^-^-^-To use HELP, supply a word or value as its
^-^-^-argument:
^-^-^-
^-^-^-^-help insert
^-^-^-^-help system
^-^-^-^-help system/script

^-^-^-To view all words that match a pattern use a
^-^-^-string or partial word:

^-^-^-^-help &quot;path&quot;
^-^-^-^-help to-

^-^-^-To see words with values of a specific datatype:

^-^-^-^-help native!
^-^-^-^-help datatype!

^-^-^-Word completion:

^-^-^-^-The command line can perform word
^-^-^-^-completion. Type a few chars and press TAB
^-^-^-^-to complete the word. If nothing happens,
^-^-^-^-there may be more than one word that
^-^-^-^-matches. Press TAB again to see choices.

^-^-^-^-Local filenames can also be completed.
^-^-^-^-Begin the filename with a %.

      <comment>/* Sea water still */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Water may be boiled away, then condensed to form pure water as [[w:distillation|distillation]]. The water must be condensed high from the water source. This may be useful for desalinating water. Volatile substances in the water may evaporate along with this water. The builder and user are responsible for further research and for safety.

==Glass bottle==
A glass bottle may be heated where it is curved outward, ''only'' if water is inside of it. Water's boiling point is 100°C, so the water temperature cannot get higher than this (unless it is [[w:superheated|superheated]] by reheating vapor with a secondary heat source). This takes heat away from the glass bottle, provided the heated air is allowed to escape around, not getting trapped in an air pocket outside of the bottle. If done properly, the glass bottle is prevented from overheating, which would break the glass. Once the water is boiled away, there will be nothing to keep the container just above 100°C, and the glass will break, creating a hazard. Safety is important to not get scalds, cause a fire or break glass. Then [[Drinking water/Distillation#vapor collection|collect water vapor]].

==Cooking container==
(stainless steel container; aluminum material is unfavorable)

==Solar distillation==
Solar distillation or [[w:Solar humidification|solar humidification-dehumidification method (HDH)]] is, as its name implies, useful for distilling water. A [[w:solar still|solar still]] and [[w:Multiple-effect humidification|multiple effect humidifcation]] are two methods of solar distillation.
[[File:Evapo still.svg|150px|right]]

===Solar still===
A '''solar still''' is a simple way of [[w:distillation|distilling]] water, using the heat of the sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills. In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure [[w:water vapour|water vapour]] condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities such as salts and heavy metals as well as eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.

Solar stills are used in cases where rain, piped, or well water is impractical, such as in remote homes or during power outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anjaneyulu|first=L.|coauthors=Kumar, E. Arun; Sankannavar, Ravi; Rao, K. Kesava|title=Defluoridation of Drinking Water and Rainwater Harvesting Using a Solar Still|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=13 June 2012|volume=51|issue=23|pages=8040–8048|doi=10.1021/ie201692q|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie201692q}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[w:Florida|Florida]] and other [[w:hurricane|hurricane]] target areas that frequently lose power for a few days, solar distillation can provide an alternate source of clean water.

Solar stills are occasionally used on a longer term basis in [[w:developing world|developing world]] settings. However, depending on environmental conditions, they usually produce a relatively small amount of water, and even less where the source is saline or [[w:brakish|brackish]]. If the source is inadequate, a compromise method is to mix the distilled water with the brackish or saline water purified with other methods - this gives a more adequate quantity and re-introduces the other source contaminants, while still lowering the salinity, and improving the taste.
The [[w:Water Pyramid|Water Pyramid]] is a larger version, which uses an inflatable dome as the condensing surface and can be used in tropical, rural areas.

Knowing how to put together a solar still can prove to be a useful [[w:Survival skills|survival skill]] and could provide an important means of obtaining potable water in the event of a wilderness emergency.  Nevertheless, under typical conditions makeshift solar stills rarely produce enough water for long-term survival, and the sweat expended in building one can easily exceed its daily output.  Solar stills can extract water from moisture in the ground but to increase the amount of moisture available to a solar still, water (fresh or [[w:saline water|saline]]) can be added inside or along the edges of the still.  Where no water sources are readily available, shredded vegetation, wet soil/sand, urine or covered faeces, can be used inside the pit.  If only the natural soil moisture is used, the pit must eventually be moved as the productivity drops.  To prevent losing moisture by taking apart the still to retrieve collected water a length of plastic tubing can be used to sip water as it accumulates.

====Sea water still====
In 1952 the US military developed a portable solar still for pilots stranded on the ocean which comprised a large inflatable 24 inch plastic ball which floated on the ocean with a tube coming out the side. A separate plastic bag hangs from attachment points on the outer bag. Seawater is poured into the inner bag from an opening in the ball's neck.  Fresh water is taken out by the pilot using the side tube which leads to bottom of the large inflatable ball.  It was stated in magazine articles that on a good day 2.5 quarts of fresh water could be produced.  On an overcast day, 1.5 quarts was produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8dwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lYK0T7T1Es2dgQe5iMgH&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Sea Water Still.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1952, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sea water stills are included in some [[w:liferaft|liferaft]] [[w:survival kit|survival kits]], though manual [[w:reverse osmosis|reverse osmosis]] desalinators have mostly replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=a0f2e9cd317c57ab0333b5da36c95319&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 |title=Manual Reverse Osmosis Desalinator - NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE, USAF |first= |last=|work=fbo.gov |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple-effect humidification===
'''Multiple-effect humidification''' (MEH) uses multiple [[w:evaporation|evaporation]]-[[w:condensation|condensation]] cycles at separate [[w:temperature|temperature]] levels to minimize the total energy consumption of solar humidification processes. &lt;ref name=&quot;MEH&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mediatum2.ub.tum.de/node?id=601861 | title=Multiple Effect Humidification Dehumidification at ambient pressure: Optimisation and applications | publisher=Technical University of Munich | date=2002 | accessdate=June 6, 2008 | author=Müller-Holst, Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vapor collection==
The water vapor should be collected safely, and be mindful of volatile substances. Alcohol and certain volatile substances have a lower boiling point than water, so be careful that nothing poisonous also condenses into the end water supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Challenges and Opportunities in Using the Internet to Realize Democracy in Egypt=

by Nahed Amin Azab

Management Information Systems, Department of Management, The American University in Cairo, Egypt

Volume 2012 (2012), Article ID 547105, Journal of North African Research in Business, 10 pages, DOI: 10.5171/2012.547105

==Abstract==

There is a widespread belief that the Internet provides real opportunities for democratization and political transformation, especially in authoritarian regimes characterized by a strong restriction on freedom of speech and expression and inability of civic engagement and participation. Such role has been clearly witnessed with the rise of the Arab spring in general, and in Egypt in particular. During the 18 days of the Egyptian revolution starting on 25 January 2011, and afterwards, the Internet proved to be an important tool in mobilizing people, coordinating between protestors and documenting and publishing facts that occurred on the ground during the revolution. However, such optimistic view cannot be supported unconditionally due to several reasons related to the uniqueness of each country. This paper therefore attempts to critically examine the potential of the Internet on the political transformation in Egypt taking into consideration a full context covering economical, political, technological and social dimensions. Studying these various aspects would highlight the challenges and opportunities that affect the Internet in changing the political situation during the transitional period the country is going through.

----

==Introduction==
 
There is growing evidence that the Internet has an influence on identity development and on civic communication and participation (Wyn et al., 2005; Metcalf, 2008). Beside easy access to the news, the Internet allows people to read others’ reviews and to send feedback comments on the news they read. Citizens’ participation was more encouraged due to the emergence of ‘Web 2.0’ technologies, such as blogs, podcasts and social networking websites, which blurred the boundaries between publisher and reader. Any user has the chance to be a message receiver or sender during any given communication cycle (Williams, 1998, Boczkowski, 2004). By enabling individuals to create and publish content, such technologies promote collaboration, ownership, empowerment (Boulos and Wheelert 2007; Christensen et al., 2002; Crespo 2007) and the ability to express opinions and be heard. Boulos and Wheelert (2007) and Lefebvre (2007) argue that this in turn could result in increasing flexibility and democracy.
 

Seeking to reach democracy, the youth who initiated the Arab spring, especially in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen, have relied on the Internet in disseminating news and philosophies of their revolutions, and in mobilizing people in their countries. Such initiatives were recognized and appreciated worldwide as some of revolutions’ leaders were nominated for peace prizes, such as Nobel from Switzerland, Sakharov by the European parliament and Anna Politkovskaya from Russia. The role played by the Internet in the Egyptian revolution triggers the need to question whether it would contribute negatively or positively in reaching democracy during and after this transitional period.
 
This paper starts by reviewing the literature discussing the relation between the Internet and democracy. Next, the paper presents different means to use the Internet in politics, and examines the applicability of these means in Egypt and their potential in assisting the country in its path towards democracy at a crucial phase during which the first democratically elected parliament has just held its opening session on the 23rd of January, only 2 days before the passing of the first year of the Egyptian revolution. 
 
==The Internet and Democracy ==

There is a growing controversy related to the ability of the Internet in assisting developing countries in fostering democracy. Some researchers see that the Internet can contribute to a great extent into such direction. For example, Milner (2006) argues that Internet capabilities (easy, broad, cheap access and sharing of information) allow for building and mobilizing opposition groups, which impose threat on autocratic regimes. Being aware of that strong effect of the Internet, such regimes do not encourage Internet adoption compared to democratic ones (Norris, 2001). 
 
Furthermore, the Internet has the potential to realize the concept of the “public sphere” as defined by Jürgen Habermas (1974): a place where communities could jointly form public opinions in an environment removed from the government or economy. On the other side, Downey and Fenton (2003) quote the expression “bad civil society” from Chambers and Kopstein (2001) described as being capable of creating a counter public sphere that could alter democratic public dialogue. Lunat (2008) notes that the Internet leads in several cases in developing countries to promoting violence due to the ‘fragile structure’ of public spheres in these communities. In fact, several reasons affect negatively the Internet potential in promoting democracy in developing countries: (i) limited Internet accessibility by many sectors in the society (Khiabany, 2009) and its availability to extremists (Dean (2003); (ii) absence of well established and sustainable online political entities (Lunat, 2008); (iii) being an additional media type, the Internet is usually in line with the existing political status enabling traditional authorities to increase their political power (Papacharissi, 2002); (iv) tracking and censorship by existing (and most probably autocratic) regimes (Albirini, 2008). As such, Albirini (2008) criticizes the optimistic view that assumes that the Internet can modify the dictatorial structure of developing countries describing this as an ‘illusion’.
 
==Internet Political Channels==

Several World Wide Web applications encouraged citizens to engage into politics, especially online newspapers, social network sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, etc.) and blogs. The Internet made a remarkable shift in the newspaper industry since the creation of the first non-print in 1995. The evolution of online papers on the web has provided a window for the emergence of new content-creation regimes, and allowed the examination of broader patterns in the construction of information on the Internet, multimedia developments being an example (Boczkowski, 2004; Molina, 1997). Starting from 1995, the Web proved to be the “electronic publishing environment of choice” for publishing newspapers (Garrison, 1997; Martin and Hansen, 1998; Molina, 1997). More than 175 US dailies were published on the Web by the end of 1995, growing to over 750 three years later (Newspaper Association of America, 1998; Editor and Publisher, 1996). In a survey of US online newspapers, Peng et al. (1999) conclude that the top three reasons for publishing on the Web versus other options are (1) availability of a large number of readers worldwide (57%), (2) ease of publishing  (27%), and (3) superior graphical presentation (15%). 
 
Most newspapers and news portals currently provide links to several social networks as an extended channel to foster more participation among their readers. Since the Howard Dean campaign on Facebook in 2004, the Internet was recognized as a powerful tool in gauging the interest and opinion of the public in the political process, as well as communicating efficiently with supporters (Westling, 2007). The most widely used social networking site is Facebook, which covers an increasing and broader number of networks (academic institutions, cities, organizations, clubs, etc.) of different geographic and ideological aspects, reaching more than 500 million members in 2010 (Facebook Press Room, October 2010).
 
Facebook provides political actors with an efficient and inexpensive tool to disseminate their messages to a wide audience, to mobilize and organize thousands of supporters and to measure public opinion. One of the main causes of the success of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008 was the resourceful and creative use of Facebook by his then-campaign-manager David Plouffe, pulling out young, disenfranchised voters to the polls. Even before Barack Obama announced his candidacy for president, the Facebook group “Barack Obama for President in 2008” had accumulated over 50,000 members. Another group, “Barack Obama (One Million Strong for Barack)” gathered 200,000 members in less than three weeks (Goldfarb, 2007), reaching 325,000 by April 2007. Obama also had strong presence on other social websites including MySpace, Twitter, MyBatanga, MiGente and AsianAve. Obama’s opponent John McCain did not give similar focus to social networks and had fewer than 200,000 supporters on Facebook (Terhune, 2008). The increasing role of Facebook in presidential campaigns can clearly be seen by noting that Howard Dean ended up with over 190,000 members in his Meetup.com group at the end of his 2004 presidential primary campaign (Trippi, 2004), versus more than 3 million supporters for Obama (DWSMG, 2008).
 
In addition to online newspapers and social network websites, political blogs are seen as an increasingly powerful form of journalism on the Internet (Farrell and Drezner, 2008), expanding media freedom (Coleman, 2005) and shaping democracy outside the mass media and conventional party politics (Gillmor, 2003). They should be seen as democratic listening posts, enabling us to pick up signals of subjective expression. Blogs were recognized in 1997 with the launching of Scripting News, a website developed by Dave Winer (Schiano et al., 2004) (dubbed the “Father of Blogging”) (BBC News, 2007), recording his views on different topics, and the longest-running blog on the Internet in 2003 (Gillmor, 2003). Blogs are gaining a growing popularity among Internet users, particularly political ones, which receive thousands of hits daily (Schiano et al., 2004). Starting with the 2004 US Presidential campaign, blogs were clearly perceived by candidates, political parties and mainstream media as a powerful tool to monitor, publish, discuss, host breaking news and even create self-owned blogs (Adamic, 2005; Bahnisch, 2006; Bichard, 2006; Carlson, 2007; Kerbel and Bloom, 2005; Stromer-Galley &amp; Baker, 2006; Trammell, 2006; Baumer, 2010). There are several reasons that drive Internet users to create blogs: responding to readers’ requests, updating others about their lives and activities, thinking by writing, looking for others’ feedback, conveying opinions and convincing others, or merely reducing tension (Nardi et al., 2004). One of the main advantages of blogs lies in their asymmetric and “non-intrusive” nature, unlike emails or instant messages. This reduces the temper and intensity of interaction (Clark and Brennan, 1991). Feedback can be through blogs, other media, or face-to-face communication, all after some time has elapsed, which allows for deeper and less emotional interaction. Furthermore, people read blogs because they find up-to-date, genuine and sincere opinions compatible with their views (Johnson et al., 2007), independency and freedom in expressing beliefs, (Bruns, 2006; Lasica, 2002) as compared to the controlled and balanced nature, which characterizes media corporations (Metzger et al., 2003). Furthermore, politically interested Internet users see that blogs are more credible than other online sources (Johnson et al., 2007). 
 
==Internet and Politics in Egypt==

Even though the Internet started in Egypt in 1993, interest in using the Internet in politics has become clearly apparent since 2008, when a Facebook page was created by the group &quot;6th of April Youth&quot;, to call for a labor strike against price hikes (Azab, 2012). Despite limited use of the Internet by political candidates to express their views and to interact with voters, a number of users head towards the Internet for other reasons: seeking political facts, commenting on political news and events, attempting to bring about partial change (Awad, 2010), gathering political views through polls and surveys and supervising the regime through publishing and disseminating corruptions and violations of human rights. 
 
Top Egyptian newspapers (e.g., AlAhram, AlMasryAlyoum, AlShorouk, AlDostor, etc.) have created not only e-newspapers publishing the same content as their corresponding traditional ones, but also their Internet portals to provide continuous updated content around the clock. Social networks, especially Facebook and Twitter, are used extensively in politics in Egypt. One of the most influential Facebook pages is “We are All Khaled Said”, which was created before the revolution on 6 June 2010. At that date, Khaled Said, a 28 year-old young man from Alexandria was found dead, with a common belief that he was tortured to death by two policemen (Abdellah and Blair, 2010). The page was created bearing his name, and attracted 4000 members to join in the first hour (ElShorouk Newspaper, 11 June 2010), with an increase of 1000 members each hour (Adel, 2010a). Several activists uploaded videos of the incident’s witnesses stating evidences contradictory to those expressed by the Ministry of Interior (ElShorouk Newspaper, 15 June 2010). As a result, the Attorney General was compelled to order the extraction of Said’s body and assign a committee to conduct a re-autopsy in order to explain the cause of death and injuries on the body (AbouElMaaref, 2010; Fouad et al., 2010). A remarkable online presence on social networks was also attributed to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, who was a prospect candidate “posing the most serious challenge” for the presidential position in Egypt in 2010 (BBC News, 2010; Broad, 2010). ElBaradei raised hope to the youth posing a possibility to commit political change through using Twitter and Facebook as channels for communications with citizens. “We are All Khaled Said”, &quot;6th of April Youth&quot; and “Mohamed ElBaradei” Facebook pages played an important role in initiating the Egyptian revolution (Ghuitas, 2011). As for blogs, many of them were recognized in expressing views opposed to existing regimes before and after the revolution (e.g., Wael Abbas, Mohamed Abdel Fattah, Michael Nabil, and Alaa Abdel Fattah). Some political blogs not only express ideas, but also include videos and photos to support them.
 
Realizing the increasing interest and position of the Internet in politics before and during the revolution, the current regime that started ruling in 11 February just after the 18-days revolution, is using Facebook to convey messages and interact with the Egyptian society and to obtain its feedback through reviews and polls.
 
==Discussion and Conclusion==

The previous section shows that the Internet different channels are used extensively in politics in Egypt. However, they are still insufficiently exploited in presidential campaigns. This could be due to the fact that the view is not clear, which made ElBaradei, who was a prospect candidate for presidential elections, decide to step down few months after freezing his campaign. Now that it has been formally announced that applications for presidential candidacy will start in March 2012, and that the elections is expected to take place before June 2012, the use of the Internet in the first democratic presidential elections ever in Egypt will be followed very closely and analyzed in depth.
 
It appears that the Internet was and is still playing an important role in influencing Egyptians from a political perspective, and that it can be used as a tool for promoting civic engagement. Internet users rely on the Internet in accessing political news and analysis, expressing opinions and monitoring the regime through publishing multimedia content. Smith and Rainie (2008) classify Internet’s behavior in politics into 3 main activities: accessing news, communicating with others and being interested in campaign information and active in disseminating it. As such, Egyptians use the Internet in performing the first 2 activities. 

One cannot deny the effect of the Internet on the happening of the Egyptian revolution. Even its censorship by the State Security Investigations (SSI) created an opportunity for youth groups to pass wrong messages about their intentions and meetings. Calls for demonstrations (started 18 months before the revolution) were transferred from the ‘virtual to the tangible world’, which were mostly efficient by social movements having a broad well-established existence (e.g., 6 April Movement that has a strong online presence as well as physical presence in 24 of the 29 Egyptian governorates) (Ezbawy, 2012; Earl and Kimport 2008; Al-Sayyid 2011). Even during the 5 days of the Internet cutoff performed by the authorities from 28 January to 1 February 2011, young Egyptians living outside Egypt created a Facebook group reporting events worldwide (Ezbawy, 2012).
 
Egyptians had high expectations that the Internet will bring about a major change towards democracy (clearly perceived by the increasing number of Internet and social network users, and by the results of several studies indicating increasing interest in politics among Internet users after the revolution). Unfortunately however, one year after the revolution, the Internet’s role is still falling behind expectations. Certainly, the Internet assisted the nation with the first steps into democracy through realizing a number of benefits on the ground, but was unable to build a critical mass capable of reaching the main objectives of the revolution and enabling activists to lead the political scene. Such fact was obvious in the first ‘democratic parliament elections’ that started in November 2011; relying mainly on the Internet in elections’ campaigns from different youth fragmented entities was not successful in influencing the mass. They still miss different dimensions of political aspects in Egypt, ‘in particular in the light of a very different configuration of political powers’ under-estimating other powerful means to disseminate ideas and pass agendas, such as mosques (Tadros, 2012). Consequently, Islamist groups represent 75% of the elected members in the new Parliament, a far higher percentage than their contribution to the Internet-based politics. The political situation currently in Egypt can be described as a ‘shallow’ form of democracy reflecting mostly a propagandistic approach. There is still a long way to formulate a true democratic framework enabling people to commit change formally (Shoukry, 2012). 
 
Shortcomings in the political status are due to several reasons in-line with the literature concerning the relation between the Internet and democracy in developing countries. First, Internet users constitute 25% of the population by educated groups since Egypt suffers from a high illiteracy rate. In addition, the Internet is providing a space for extremist groups and for electronic committees belonging to the authorities that are conveying messages against protesters and democratic movements. Second, as stated earlier, youth coalitions using the Internet are not yet combined into robust bodies. The third reason is attributed to the ruling regime following the same philosophy of the ousted one, is using the Internet as an additional channel to promote its ideas, and dissuade Internet content that does not. Thus, authorities are widely believed to be still imposing censorship on the Internet and are targeting Internet activists and jailing them, as was the case before the revolution. Lastly, youth activists are continuously dragged into various fights aiming to alter them from realizing the revolution objectives from the ruling regime and from political forces that ‘claim ownership of the revolution’ (Tadros, 2012), shifting their focus from constructing the required critical mass.
 
Nevertheless, the outlook is optimistic due to the high growth rate of Internet users and to the high percentage of youth in the Egyptian population; the best candidate to make change happen.  Moreover, traditional media such as TV and newspapers are increasingly relying on online user generated content in seeking political news and facts, which widens Internet exposure covering even non-Internet users.  In addition, since young political activists using the Internet do not yet possess a thorough knowledge in mobilization and building strong campaigns, they are definitely learning while practicing, and will gradually craft effective and creative new tactics. As Shoukry (2012) comments on the small percentage of youth activists who won in the first Egyptian parliamentary elections after the revolution: such results are based on the past, but the future will probably witness the foundation of new realities.

The Internet is definitely a potential mean for identity construction, which in turn mobilizes Civil Society leading to socio-political change (Habermas, 1996). Hence, Civil Society is presented with an unprecedented opportunity to formulate the Internet in developing countries while Internet diffusion is continuously on the rise (Petrazzini and Kibati (1999). It is thus recommended for youth coalitions to minimize the gap between the Internet and the ground through a continuous scanning and recognition of public opinion leading to dynamic reshaping of unified online and offline strategies. Online information sharing and communication are not sufficient to realize political reform and to bring democratic changes in developing countries. The Internet should be considered  a tool to support the creation of a physical environment for such transformation (Albirini, 2008). Thus, youth coalitions should reconsider using the Internet in collaborating with similar interest groups to form robust political entities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The ''polis'' or city-state==

''Polis'' (plural ''poleis''), literally means &quot;city&quot; in Greek; but the word &quot;city&quot; also included the terms state, citizenship and body of citizens. In fact, the Greek term which specifically meant &quot;city&quot; as a conglomerate of urban buildings and spaces was ''ásty''. In modern historiography, ''polis'' is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, so ''polis'' is often translated as &quot;city-state.&quot; 

The term city-state which originated in English (alongside the German ''Stadtstaat'') does not fully translate the Greek term. The ''poleis'' were not like other primordial ancient city-states like Tyre or Sidon, which were ruled by a king or a small oligarchy, but rather a political entity ruled by its body of citizens. The traditional view of archaeologists that the appearance of urbanization at excavation sites could be read as a sufficient index for the development of a ''polis'' was criticised by François Polignac in 1984 and has not been taken for granted in recent decades. In fact, the term ''polis''  changed with the development of the governance center in the city to indicate state (which included its surrounding villages), and finally with the emergence of a citizenship notion between the land owners it came to describe the entire body of citizens.

==Archaic and classical ''polis''==

Basic and indicating elements of the archaic and classical ''polis'' were:
[[File:Acropolis091.jpg|thumb|Acropolis of Athens, a noted ''polis'' of classical Greece.]]

* Self-governance, autonomy and independence (city-state)
* Agora: the social hub and financial marketplace, on and around a centrally located large open space
* Acropolis: the citadel, inside which a temple had replaced the erstwhile Mycenaean ''anáktoron'' (palace) or ''mégaron'' (hall).
* Greek urban planning and architecture, public, religious, and private (see Hippodamian plan)
* Temples, altars and sacred precincts: one or more are dedicated to the poliouchos, the patron deity of the city; each polis kept its own particular festivals and customs (Political religion, as opposed to the individualized religion of the later antiquity). Priests and priestesses, although often drawn from certain families by tradition, did not form a separate collegiality or class: they were ordinary citizens who, on certain occasions, were called to perform certain functions.
* Gymnasia: a training facility for competitors in public games. It was also a place for socializing and engaging in intellectual pursuits.
* Theatres
* Walls: used for protection from invaders
* Coins: minted by the city, and bearing its symbols
* Colonies being founded by the oikistes of the metropolis
* Political life: it revolved around the sovereign Ekklesia (the assembly of all adult male citizens for deliberation and voting), the standing boule and other civic or judicial councils, the archons and other officials or magistrates elected either by vote or by lot, clubs, etc., and sometimes punctuated by stasis (civil strife between parties, factions or socioeconomic classes, e.g. aristocrats, oligarchs, democrats, tyrants, the wealthy, the poor, large or small landowners, etc.).There were practising the direct democracy.
* Publication of state functions: laws, decrees and major fiscal accounts were published, and criminal and civil trials were also held in public
* Synoecism, conurbation: Absorption of nearby villages and countryside, and the incorporation of their tribes into the substructure of the polis. Many of a polis' citizens would have lived in the suburbs or countryside. The Greeks did not regard the polis as a territorial grouping so much as a religious and political association: while the polis would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the polis would not simply consist of a geographical area. Most cities were composed of several tribes or phylai, which were in turn composed of phratries (common-ancestry lineages), and finally génea (extended families)
* Social classes and citizenship: Dwellers in the polis were generally divided into four types of inhabitants, with status typically determined by birth:
:
:* Citizens with full legal and political rights, i.e. adult free men born legitimately of citizen parents. They had the right to vote, be elected into office, bear arms, and the obligation to serve when at war.
:* Citizens without formal political rights, but full legal rights: the citizens' female relatives and underage children, whose political rights and interests were represented, and property held in trust, by their adult male relatives.
:* Citizens of other poleis who chose to reside elsewhere (the metics, μέτοικοι, métoikoi, literally &quot;transdwellers&quot;): though free-born and possessing full rights in their place of origin, had full legal rights but no political rights in their place of residence. Metics could not vote, could not be elected to office, could not bear arms and could not serve in war. They otherwise had full personal and property rights, albeit subject to taxation.
:* Slaves: chattel in full possession of their owner, and with no privileges other what their owner would grant (or revoke) at will.

==Hellenistic ''polis''==
[[File:Antikes Alexandria Karte.JPG|thumb|Ancient Alexandria, a ''polis'' of Hellenistic Egypt.]]

During the Hellenistic period, which marks the decline of the classical ''polis'', the following cities remained independent: Sparta until 195 BC after the War against Nabis. Achaean League is the last example of original Greek city-state federations (dissolved after the Battle of Corinth (146 BCE)) . The Cretan city-states continue to be independent (except Itanus and Arsinoe, which lay under Ptolemaic influence) until the conquest of Crete in 69 BCE by Rome. The cities of Magna Graecia, with the notable examples of Syracuse and Tarentum, were conquered by Rome in late 3rd century BC. There are also some cities with recurring independence like Samos, Priene, Miletus and Athens. A remarkable example of a city-state which flourished during this era is Rhodes through its merchant navy, until 43 BCE and the Roman conquest.

The Hellenistic colonies and cities of the era, retain some basic characteristics of a ''polis'', except: the status of independence (city-state) and the political life. There is a self-governance (like the new Macedonian title ''politarch'') but under a ruler and king. The political life of the classical era is now transformed to an individualized religious and philosophical view of life. The demographic decline forced the cities to abolish the status of metic and bestow citizenship; In 228 BCE Miletus enfranchised over 1000 Cretans. (Milet, I, 3, 33-8.) Dyme sold its citizenship for one talent, payable in two installments. The foreign residents in a city are now called ''paroikoi''. In an age, when most of the establishments in Asia are kingdoms, an interesting example of a Hellenistic cities federation is the Chrysaorian League in Caria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hemocyanin2.jpg|thumb|3D structure of hemocyanin.]]

'''Hemocyanin''' is a protein found in mollusks that carries oxygen in much the same way as [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] carries oxygen in human blood.  Similarly to hemoglobin, a central metal atom binds oxygen differentially, however in hemocyanin, this central metal atom is copper.  When the copper is oxidized from its Cu(I) form to its Cu(II) the protein changes color from clear to blue, which is the source of the blue tinge of mollusk hemolymph.  The origin of the word hemolymph (from Latin for heme- blood and cyanin- blue) alludes to this blue tinge. In hemolymph, hemocyanin is present as an extracellular protein that aggregates into large complexes held together by calcium or magnesium ions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.utoronto.ca/coursenotes/GTM/JM/HCstart.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of monomers and the size of these aggregates can differ between mollusk and arthropod species, but all forms contain the central copper atoms.

== Structure ==
[[Image:PDB 1oxy EBI.jpg|thumb|Arthropod hemocyanin, displaying both [[Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Structures#Beta_Pleated_Sheet|B- sheets]] and [[Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Structures#Alpha_Helix|a- helices]].]]

The structure and function of the hemocyanin molecule revolves around the two copper atoms embedded at its core.  Each copper atom is complexed by three histidine residues that form the distorted pyramidal geometry of each atom.  This and the space between the copper atoms facilitates the bonding of the two copper atoms to each dioxygen molecule.  In close proximity to the histidine residues are two phenylalanine residues that form a hydrophobic core that protects the active site.  Once oxygen is bonded, a geometrical change occurs from trigonal pyramidal to a distorted tetrahedral and it is this change in bonding geometry that explains the change in color that occurs with oxydation of the central copper atoms.  Although in both arthropod and mollusk hemocyanin, the binding mechanism and active site are nearly identical, there are various differences in the structure and assembly of subunits.

In arthropods, hemocyanin is made up of monomers of approximately 75 kDa which make up hexamers that aggregate into multiple hexamer groups.  Each monomer may take one of several forms, all of which occur in a specific location in the molecule.  Arthropod hemocyanin has three regions, the second of which housing the copper atoms and residing within a 4 a- helical set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/276/19/15563.full&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollusks, however have much larger polymeric subunits on the order of 350-450 kDa.  Additionally, the aggregates of subunits are often much larger; for example, cephalopod hemocyanin consists of 5-10 cylindrical aggregates and in other gastropods there can be as many as 160 oxygen accepting units.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/276/19/15563.full&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the differences in quaternary structure between mollusk hemocyanin proteins, the tertiary structure of each subunit is very similar.

== Evolution ==

Hemocyanin and other proteins that facilitate oxygen transport and aerobic respiration have their evolutionary roots in some of the earliest life forms.  Since the atmosphere was mostly anaerobic, oxygen was probably poisonous to many early anaerobic organisms.  In an effort to eliminate poisonous oxygen byproducts, early oxidative proteins were evolved that utilized iron or copper to carry out oxidative processes.  Over time, the concentrations of oxygen in the atmosphere increased and oxidative proteins began to be used in aerobic systems.  Additionally, as body size began to increase (around 700-800 MYA), diffusion would not supply enough oxygen to the entire organism, and iron and copper based molecules began to be diversified.  The similarities between hemocyanin structures in mollusks and arthropods suggest a divergence in hemocyanin structure before 750 MYA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/276/19/15563.full&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:StockholmCordonMap.png|thumb|Stockholm Tax Cordon Map]]
In 2006, a tax cordon around much of the City of Stockholm was implemented.  Congestion had been a problem in the city for some time, and for years traffic flow into the downtown area had not increased.

To mitigate this congestion, a tax was charged on most types of vehicles crossing the cordon at a relatively low rate.  Prior to implementation, the tax was of much political debate.  People outside the cordon largely opposed the tax.  Once people inside the tax cordon were involved, the results changed as they showed large support for the tax.

Those who live within the tax cordon tended to cross the cordon less often than those who commuted daily from suburbs or other areas to the city for work.  Those people also would experience lower demand for their local roads and this is a possible reason for their support of the tax.

=Road pricing=

Road pricing is a generic term which refers to a charge for using a road. Such a policy involves imposition of a fee for operating a motor vehicle on a roadway facility in order to generate revenue, manage traffic demand, or reduce environmental impacts associated with traffic congestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;

Three types of road pricing based on the purpose are recognized. In '''congestion or value pricing''' the main goal is managing demand to reduce congestion and/or retain targeted travel speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Congestion pricing works by shifting some less critical rush-hour highway travels to other transportation modes or to off-peak periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; The main purpose in '''tolling''' is to generate revenue to cover the costs of infrastructures construction and/or operations. '''Environmental pricing''' aims to reduce environmental impacts of traffic (i.e. emission).&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

Road pricing is also categorized using the scale of its application &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;:
*'''Facility-based Pricing:''' when charges are imposed over specific roadway facilities (e.g. bridges and tunnels) or dedicated lanes on these facilities (e.g. HOT lanes).
*'''Zone-based (area or cordon) pricing:''' when there are charges to drive within (area) or into (cordon) a congested urban area (as in London, Stockholm and Singapore).
*'''Distance-based charges:''' when per-mile charges are levied on vehicles on roads within a specified region or country (as in the Czech Republic and Germany).

In all cases charging rates may vary by time of day (versus flat tolls), traffic volumes and vehicle types.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Fix charges are basically used in cases with revenue generation purpose while variable tolls are more appropriate for traffic demand management strategies.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

==Congestion Pricing Technology==
Today, tolls are collected at highway speeds by using electronic toll-collection technology. Vehicles are equipped with electronic devices called transponders or &quot;tags&quot;, which are read by overhead antennas or gantries.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; This system which is called Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) is implemented in Singapore, Germany and Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Simple types of tags or In-vehicle Units (IU) are affordable for less than $10.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

Global positioning systems (GPS) are used to calculate mileage traveled by trucks in Germany on the autobahns.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; A Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is also needed for data transmission in this method of tolls collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; The costs of such systems are currently high as much as $500 per vehicle in Germany. Some additional services such as in-vehicle navigation and commercial fleet management are also provided to make these high costs justifiable.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; 

Cameras are an essential complement to both DSRC and GPS systems to capture an evidence of the identity of vehicles that do not have a working tag or GPS unit. So, this component is known as an enforcement tool.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; More sophisticated cameras which are able to recognize the plate number of cars can be used independently (without having DSRC) for collecting tolls. This technology known as Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is currently used in London and Stockholm congestion pricing. Users have a specified time to pay the charge; otherwise they will be fined by an incremental penalty scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

=Referendum=
[[Image:Stockholm congestion tax referendum map.svg|thumb|200px|Map showing the results of the referendum in each [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]].
{{legend|#00FF00|'Yes'-majority.}}
{{legend|#FF0000|'No'-majority.}}
{{legend|#C0C0C0|No referendum held.}}]]
A referendum was held on September 17, 2006 on whether to permanently implement the congestion tax. Although the reigning government stated that only the results from Stockholm Municipality would be considered, surrounding municipalities held their own referendums.  The opposition parties stated they would consider these results if they won power. They proceeded to win the election, but announced in October 2006 that they would implement the congestion tax permanently.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki&quot; /&gt;

=Collection of the Tax=
[[File:Betalstation 2010.jpg|thumb|Tax Collection Point]]
The tax is imposed only between the hours of 6:30 AM and 6:30 PM Monday thru Friday.  The charge could be anywhere from 10 kronor to 20 kronor for each crossing of the tax cordon, and a vehicle can accrue a maximum of 60 kronor in charges per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;

The tax is not imposed on public holidays or during the month of July, and obviously not on weekends.  There are also many vehicles that are exempt from the tax, such as emergency vehicles or public busses.  Other types of vehicles used to be exempt, such as alternative-fuel vehicles.  Research indicates this had caused a much higher percentage of alternative-fuel vehicles to cross the cordon than regular vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;  In fact, about 28 percent of all tax cordon crossing's are exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

These decisions come as the result of a seven-month study period, in which the tax was an experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;  Today, the tax is a permanent installation.  In the table below, the charge by time of day is shown (for days in which the tax is levied).

==Exemptions==
The following classes of vehicles are automatically exempt from congestion tax:&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;
*Emergency vehicles
*Public buses with a total weight more than 14 tons
*Taxis. This exemption is no longer valid &lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;
*Diplomatic registered vehicles
*Motorcycles
*Foreign-registered vehicles
*Military vehicles
*Certain alternative-fuel vehicles (Green cars). This exemption is no longer valid.
*Vehicles with handicap plates.
*Residents of the Island of Lidingö, who can access the rest of Sweden only through the CBD, have 30 minutes to exit the area; otherwise the charges are applied.

28 percent of all passages across the congestion tax cordon are made by exempted. The proportion of passages made by Green cars has increased from 3 percent in the trial to 13 percent in 2008. It turned out that alternative fuel vehicles make on average 70 percent more journeys over the congestion tax cordon than the average for taxable vehicles. In addition, the increasing number of alternative fuel vehicles is probably another reason for the increase in trafﬁc across the congestion tax cordon in 2008 compared to the trial in 2006. For these reasons the exemption for alternative fuel vehicles ceased in July 2012 [6]. Note that reducing congestion is the primary policy goal while reducing emissions is the secondary purpose.

=Effects of Congestion Tax=
==Traffic==
During the 6 month congestion tax trial period, Stockholm saw a 22% decrease in the number of vehicle crossings into the city center.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  After the trial period, crossings rose significantly, but never reached original levels.  This remaining decline could have been due to road construction on two major brides.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  Another possible factor being commuter habit.  Travelers became accustomed to their new mode of commuting from the trial period.  

Comparing 2008 levels (a year after permanent implementation) to 2005, reveals an 18% reduction in cordon vehicle crossings.  Data from late 2007 and early 2009 reveal a similar trend.  The greater vehicle crossing reduction during the trial 2006 has several possible explanations.  Unusually large snowfall may have dissuaded commuters from driving.  Travelers may have also required time to adapt to the system originally, contributing to the large decline in traffic.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;

[[File:TrafficVolumes.png|thumb|Traffic Volume Comparison]]

The decline in car journeys across the cordon in 2008 compared to 2005 amounted to 96,000 per taxable day.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  Nearly half of these trips were work or school trips, with the remaining consisting mostly of discretionary travel.  Almost all work and school trips mode shifted to transit.  Discretionary trips on the other hand were primarily moved out of the peak period, eliminated altogether or avoided crossing the cordon.  No significant increase in car-pooling or telecommuting was seen.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;
 
Traffic levels within the inner city saw a smaller decrease than cordon crossings.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  Drivers are charged only for crossing the cordon, but travel within the inner city is not charged a tax.  With an overall reduction in congestion levels, this likely led to some convergence.  Drivers within the inner city took advantage of the additional capacity created by the congestion tax.

Orbital roads in 2008 saw a 5-10% increase in traffic compared to 2005.  This increase is partly caused by an overall rise in traffic, but also caused by commuters avoiding cordon crossings.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;

==Public Transit==
Transit ridership numbers in 2008 show 80,000 more journeys across the cordon per taxable day than in 2005.  This represents a 7% increase in transit ridership.  Roughly half of this increase can be attributed to population growth.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  Additional factors, such as changes in gas prices, business-cycle effects and expanded transit ridership, also contributed to the increase.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  Nevertheless, a clear car to transit mode shift can be observed for work and school commuters.  At least a third of the increased ridership is likely due to implementation of the congestion tax.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;

==Travel Times==
[[File:Traveltimes.png|thumb|Travel Time Comarison]]

Travel time measurements were primarily done by a camera system.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  An overall reduction in travel times on various road types is seen during the trial period.  This is not surprising given the lower car volumes.

==Environment==
Measurements to quantify environmental changes inside the cordon were conducted.  The Stockholm Traffic Administration estimated that a 10-14% decrease in CO2 emissions from vehicles occurred during the congestion tax trial period.  Since permanent implementation, estimates show a 4% further reduction.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  The decrease in CO2 emissions is largely due to the increase in alternative vehicles.  Some of it can be credited to decreased traffic volumes.  However, some of the reduction in car emissions is offset by the increased bus service.  The congestion tax is likely the greatest driving factor behind the rapid increase in alternative vehicle use.  Alternative vehicles are allowed to pass the cordon free of charge.  Although, the 9% increase in alternative vehicle use cannot be solely attributed to the congestion tax.&lt;ref name= &quot;R6&quot;/&gt;  An increase in ownership would have likely occurred regardless of the tax exemption.

==Economy==
There is no significant evidence of economic consequences to Stockholm businesses resulting from the congestion tax.  Observed changes are within normal price variations.  The rest of Stockholm county was used as a control in comparing economic changes within the city.  Researchers suggest the lack of impact on retail is due to the limited effect the congestion tax has on disposable income, estimated around 0.1%.&lt;ref name= &quot;R7&quot;/&gt;  However, if this is the case, one would expect drivers to be inelastic in their behavior.  Another explanation is that many discretionary trips were moved to off peak hours and not completely eliminated.

=The Tax Debate=

Prior to implementation in 2007, there was a trial period (January–July 2006) and a referendum in September 2006 to decide on implementation. 
Those who pay the cordon tax the most frequently are on average of higher income and have greater car ownership.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;  Many of these tax payers live in areas surrounding the inner city where household incomes are higher.

==Supporters of the Tax==
*'''Residents of the City of Stockholm'''
Residents living within the tax cordon voted in favor of the referendum.  Those same residents were in even greater support of the tax in 2007 than before the tax was implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;
*'''Owners of Exempted Vehicles'''
&quot;Exempted vehicles&quot; cross the cordon an average of 12 times per two week period, compared to seven times for a taxable vehicle.  This was a statistically significant increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;
*'''Public Transportation Companies'''
Public transportation use increased across the tax cordon by 6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; However a quarter of that increase was due to increased employment, population, and fuel prices according to the study.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;  Nevertheless, this is still a 4.5% increase in public transportation use that could be the result of the cordon tax.
Six of seven bus routes crossing the tax cordon have experienced decreased bus journey routes, even despite the increase in ridership.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;
*'''Taxpayers of Stockholm'''
While the benefit to the taxpayers can be of much debate, the net social benefit was calculated to be about 650 mSEK/year (about 100 mUSD/year) according to a study published in Transportation Research Part A.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;

==Those Indifferent to the Tax==
*'''Business Owners within the cordon'''
According to a report, business has had consistent turnover from before and after the tax implementation, and with respect to the rest of Stockholm county.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;  In fact, retail and wholesale sectors exhibited increased turnover within the tax cordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

==Opponents of the Tax==
It is worth nothing that the number of opponents to the tax has drastically decreased since implementation (and even more so since the beginning of the trial period.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhwa&quot; /&gt;  There were only a few episodes of violence or protesting on the first few days of the trial period.  Ever since, there has been no opposition beyond opinions expressed in public polling.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper&quot; /&gt;

Irony exists in the fact that the political party that supported and initiated the project (the tax cordon) was voted out of power at the same time as public polling began to approve of the congestion charging scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhwa&quot; /&gt;

==Revenue Allocation==
According to a report, the revenues are reinvested in improvements to the road network in the Stockholm region.  This had not been the plan during the trial period, as at that point it had been stated that the revenues would go entirely to improving public transport in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockholm&quot; /&gt;

The tax was implemented as a state tax, because in Sweden a municipality cannot collect taxes from the inhabitants of another municipality.  Because inhabitants would come from other locations and be taxed in the City of Stockholm, the tax could only be levied on Stockholmers, or be implemented as a state tax.  But with the tax classified as a state tax, the redistribution of those revenues is complicated.  Due to changing political parties as well as other factors, the revenues have not always found their way back to Stockholm.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockholm&quot; /&gt;

=Other Congestion Taxes =

Two other successful congestion pricing projects are those implemented in London and Singapore. There are some similarities and differences between them which are useful to be pointed out.
 
Managing congestion is the primary purpose in all three cities while transit promotion and emission reduction are secondary.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

Stockholm operates a cordon pricing while Singapore uses cordon as well as facility-based pricing and London uses area pricing. Exactly for this reason, London had to procure too many cameras in comparison with Stockholm. London conducts 348 sites along the cordon and within the area plus some patrols roving the zone capturing live videos of the license plates of all vehicles whereas Stockholm controls only 18 gantries. The charges vary by time of day in Stockholm and Singapore While there is a flat rate of £8 per day in London. In Singapore fees even varies by vehicle type.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;
 
Stockholm and London apply ANPR technology to control the zone and collect the tolls. Singapore uses the DSRC and transponders to do this but at the same time ANPR system is used as enforcement tool. So Singapore has required more infrastructures and naturally more capital and also operating costs. Stockholm applied the DSRC and transponder system too during the trial period. But then, officials decided that the ANPR system performed sufficiently that the transponder-based option is not necessary. So it was eliminated in the permanent program to reduce overall system operating costs. Stockholm and London has defined some exemption rules based on their own policies and/or characteristics. Unlike in Stockholm and London, no vehicles are exempt from the charge in Singapore, except emergency and military vehicles because of the tough geographical conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;
 
Net revenues generated in Stockholm were allocated to transit and new roads in and around the city. In London 82 percent of it was used for bus improvement, 9 percent for roads and bridges, and the remaining 9 percent for other transport improvements within greater London. In Singapore, though, a portion of net revenues returned to vehicle owners through periodic rebates on vehicle taxes and the rest were invested in transit and highway systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; This refunding gave rise to a valuable public acceptance for the pricing program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Lecture 20 - Weber on Legal-Rational Authority [November 10, 2009]=

by Iván Szelényi

==Overview==

The purest form—the ideal type—of Weber's legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens or clients alike.

==Chapter 1. Introduction to Weber's Theory on Legal Rational Authority==

Professor Iván Szelényi: Good morning. Now today's topic is Weber's theory of legal-rational authority and his theory of bureaucracy. This is one of those questions—those topics—Weber is probably the best known for. It's also a rather complicated issue. When we are saying legal-rational authority, we briefly refer to the rule of law, and we tend to associate in our mind the rule of law with liberal market economies and the liberal democracies. Well Weber has a very complex argument about this.

Indeed, legal-rational authority is the kind of system of authority which is predictable, because there is an observable law, everybody is subordinated to, which, in fact, has the most—the clearest elective affinity with a market economy. Nevertheless, as we will see, he will argue that—which is very counterintuitive—that the purest type of legal-rational authority is bureaucracy; and this is usually what we don't have in our mind when we are thinking about a market economy, that it is bureaucratic. So we have to deal with Weber's interesting claim that the purest type of legal-rational authority, which goes together with a market capitalist economy, is actually bureaucracy.

It's also interesting that Weber does not make an assumption that bureaucracy, legal-rational authority, or capitalism necessarily goes together with democracy. How democracy fits into the picture is rather problematic for him. Of course, we have to appreciate that in Weber's--when Weber was writing about these issues, somewhere between 1914 and 1920, I mean, virtually none of the countries in the world were liberal democracies or universal suffrage. The political systems of the world changed so much in the last hundred years. But he problematizes this relationship; and it's actually quite useful.

So this is the guideline for today's lecture. Again I start with the definition of the ideal type, the purest type of legal-rational authority, and then I try to dig into this unusual but very influential Weberian argument—that bureaucracy, in fact, is the purest type of legal-rational authority. And then I will look at various kinds of limitations of the exercise of bureaucratic authority. One is collegiality. The other is functional division of labor—right?--the separation of various branches of government, which is a limitation on bureaucracy, and representation, democracy, is a limitation on government. So you can see that he sees a tension—right?--between democracy, bureaucracy, legal-rational authority and capitalism. They do not go as easily together as usually we Americans tend to think about this. And then a couple of ideas about his view about democracies.

==Chapter 2. Pure Type of Legal Rational Authority==

Okay, so let me start with what is the pure type of legal-rational authority. And there are really two issues we have to very briefly talk about. There are different ways how laws and norms can be established. We're already beginning to feel our way into the problem whether the rule of law and democracy are identical, or, you know, it can be democratic, or does not have to be that democratic. And then the question is who obeys what and whom, under legal authority?

So and a bit about legal-rational authority. So the argument is—right?--that there are various ways how laws or norms can be established. And well he said, legal authority rests on the acceptance of the following ideas. Right? Well, the norms, he said, can be established by agreement—that's what we usually think when we think about rule of law—or by imposition; it can be imposed on people. Right? And it can happen on the ground of expediency. It can happen because these are the most useful laws and therefore we either agree that this is what we want to obey, or there is an authority which they impose on us. Or it can be based on value rationality. It may not be that expedient, may be not necessarily immediately useful, but on the basis of shared values, or the values of those who impose those laws—and we tend to believe it—we will—this is the way how it will be established.

And then, of course, the legal system has to be somewhat consistent—this is important for the predictability of the system—and has to be intentionally established. Right? This is not coming from accident, but intentionally established. But the major point what I wanted to make—right?--that legal-rational authority, in Weber's view, can be actually an authoritarian system. Let's say Chile under Pinochet, the later times, after he established—consolidated his power; earlier on it was a tyrannical rule. But later on, Pinochet established a legal-rational order, though it was not democratic at all. Right? It was operating with a legal system which was imposed on people. And in history we have a number of instances when we can say, &quot;This is country is a country of law and order. We know what the laws are; we actually think the laws are not unreasonable. But it was imposed by some power upon us.&quot;

Now the next question is who obeys whom? And well I don't want to dwell on this so long. This is quite clear. You already are familiar with this. What is important—right?--the person who is in authority, who issues orders, is himself subject to an impersonal order. So we are all subject to the same order. This is the essence of legal-rational authority, at least in the ideal type. Right? We know the exceptions to this. We know that Berlusconi, for instance, in Italy, though Italy is really a legal-rational authority, for a long time managed—right?--to pass a legislation which enabled him to escape prosecution; though he's probably involved in a number of criminal activities, but somehow he managed to escape criminal prosecution. But that's the exception. The rule is—right?--that even the person who is highest in charge is subject to the same authority and has to obey the law. And this is again very obvious; we already covered this, the opposite, the mirror image of it. Right? The members of the society of obedience, to the superior, not as an individual, but to an impersonal order, to the law as such. That should be quite obvious.

Now so what are the major characteristics of a system which is based on legal-rational order? There is a continuous rule-bound conduct. It's again, I think, does not call for too much clarification. It is continuously the same rules. The rules change slowly and with a great deal of difficulties, as we can see how Congress is struggling to pass a law about health care reform. It takes months or years before an important new piece of legislation gets into place. And usually new pieces of legislations, in legal-rational authority, are grandfathered. Right? If you pass a new law, you change the rules of the game, you usually grandfather them; those who entered the game before the new law are still under the rule of the old law. We do that at the universities all the time. Right? If, for instance, the degree requirements do change in a university, almost always these degree requirements are—this new legislation is grandfathered. You know the terminology. Right? It will not apply to people who are already in the program. It will only apply to people who are entering the program. Or one way of grandfathering it, that we give people a choice. You know? If you want to operate under the new rule, you can opt for the new rule; or if you want to stay under the old rule, you can stay under old rule. Only for those are the new rules binding who are entering the system now. So that's very important—right?--that it is continuous and rule-bound.

And he also said in legal-rational authority there must be a very clear separation of spheres of competence. Right? Who is competent to carry out what? And then you can always figure out how you navigate in a legal-rational order. You will be told, &quot;Well, this is not my table, you go somewhere else.&quot; So you go and you ask something from the director of undergraduate studies, and the director of undergraduate studies might say, &quot;Go and see the dean of your residential college&quot;—right?--&quot;because that is the sphere of competence of the residential college.&quot; That's the way how legal-rational order is supposed to operate. And the same, occasionally the dean of college will say, &quot;Well, you have to see your sociology professor, or your economics professor.&quot; Right? You want to get transfer credit, for instance, for a summer course, and then the dean of college well said, &quot;It is the department&quot;—be it political science or economics or anthropology--&quot;they will be able to tell whether this can be accepted as an economics course at Yale.&quot; Right?

And this also implies that there is always a hierarchy and a right to appeal. This is—again, you are very familiar with it. You know exactly if you get a grade from your discussion section leader, you can appeal to the professor to say, &quot;Well, I don't think it's a fair enough grade. I deserve a better grade. My section leader made an error.&quot; And if you are unhappy with the response of the professor, you go to the chair of the department and appeal to the chair. There is a whole hierarchy of appeal—right?--where you can try to correct what you think is not right. So I think it's extremely important that you know exactly what is the chain of appeal and how far you can go up.

Usually there is also some specialized training which is expected for people to occupy certain positions. So well discussion section leaders will always be at least graduate students; usually, well, people can teach their own course once they were passed—they are Ph.D. students but all what they have is a dissertation to finish, or they must have their Ph.D. Right? So there is a specialized training necessary to perform certain functions, as such. And that's an interesting and very complex idea—right?--that the staff has to be separated from the ownership of means of production and administration. This is even more important for Weber's argument. Being separated—it's not that easy to penetrate what he exactly wants to say with this. What does it mean that you do not own the means of administration? It basically means that the source of rules and laws are outside of the administrator as such. If you want to have any change in the rules, there must be some procedure which is beyond the person who is administering that rules, how the rules can be changed. Right? This in order—you have to prevent unpredictability in the system. And that's why rules change all the time. But the fundamental principle is that these rules should not be allowed to be changed by the person who administers—right?--those rules.

So just to give a very trivial example, once you got your syllabus and the course requirement and what kind of assignments you have to deliver during the course in order to get credit in this course, then well working out these rules, a professor plays a role. But we have to get approved by the Courses and Curriculum Committee, and then in a way we are bound by those rules. So on the way I could not announce you today, &quot;Well I changed my mind and there will be an unseen final examination where you will have to get a final examination--right?--and you will not know what questions I will ask, and I can ask any question for the whole course.&quot; Right? If I would change—right?--these rules right now, you would have, I'm sure, appeal against me, against my decision. Right? I'm bound by rules. So that means that I don't own the means of administration. Right? I am administering—right?--what is in the syllabus. Well there is a little leeway. Right? Occasionally I can give you an extension, for instance, if you come to me. Therefore it's--there is a little flexibility in the system. But fundamentally the course should be taught as it is in the syllabus, and the requirements should be like it is in the syllabus. That's what it means—right?--that you do not own—right?--the means of administration, unlike in traditional authority where a feudal lord does have—does own, appropriated, some means of administration from the monarch. And a British or a French high aristocracy could make rules; not implement the rules, but could make rules as well.

The unique feature of modern legal-rational authority is that this becomes an impersonal process, which is not done—there is a separation between those who implement the rules, and there is a separate procedure—right?--how the rules are being established. Is that reasonably clear, what ownership of means of administration means? As I pointed out, it's a very Weberian idea. Right? For Marx—right?--the whole issue is the ownership of means of production. For Weber this is everything about the administrations—the means of administration.

==Chapter 3. The Bureaucracy==

Okay, now we come to this very interesting Weberian theory of the bureaucracy: very interesting, very controversial, in many ways very counterintuitive. You may say it is false. Well we will see. That is a nice topic for discussion sections. And this is what I will go through—a number of issues. What is a bureaucracy? Weber makes this quite incredible claim, what first you will completely reject, that the most efficient organization is the bureaucracy. Right? That's exactly the opposite what you think. When something is very inefficient, then you say, &quot;Well this is so bureaucratic.&quot; Right? Weber nevertheless claims that the most efficient organization is bureaucracy.

Then the question is how is bureaucracy related to capitalism and socialism? Is really capitalism a bureaucratic organization? What is the relationship between capitalist market economy and bureaucracy? What are the consequences of bureaucracy? And also then some contradiction of bureaucratization.

Now let's just quickly rush through what are the characteristics of a bureaucracy. Well, he said, &quot;the purest type of legal authority&quot;—this is, as I said, counterintuitive--&quot;is that one which employs a bureaucratic administrative staff.&quot; And well what are the characteristics of this staff in order to qualify to bureaucracy? Well they have to be personally free. So it cannot be clients—right?--of a mentor. Right? They are legally free individuals. That makes it so different—right?--from a traditional organization. That's why a family is not a bureaucratic organization, because you are not there by choice. Right? And then a bureaucracy is organized into a hierarchy of offices—this is something which basically we already covered—and the offices are filled by a free contract, and in this contract what your qualification is, that's what we call—right?--meritocracy. People do have a certain degree, and that degree qualifies them to be incumbents of a certain office.

And they receive a fixed salary. It's not quite a bureaucratic organization if you are working for a commission. Right? You are really in a bureaucratic organization when you sign a contract and you know exactly what your fringe benefits will be and what your annual salary will be. Typically the office is the sole occupation of the incumbents, and it constitutes a career. This is also very important; again, very different from a traditional organization where people could actually be incumbents of a number of positions and could draw, in fact, even incomes from a number of positions. In a pure bureaucratic organization, you really can have only a single occupation. If, for instance, somebody is appointed with tenure to Yale, and is coming from another institution, he'll have to resign from his or her tenure at the other institution. If you are employed by Yale, you can be only a Yale employee; you cannot hold multiple jobs at the same time.

And it constitutes a career. The career means there is a ladder. You have some sense how you will progress in this bureaucratic hierarchy. Again, universities are classical bureaucracies—that you enter as an assistant professor; then you are, seven to nine years, depending on the institution, without tenure; then you are being promoted to tenure; then you expect at one point of time to become a full professor; blah-blah-blah. Right? This is what it meant, it is a career. And in many bureaucratic organizations, even in the business world—right?--you have a sense how you progress. In a law firm—right?--if you enter a law firm—right?--you have a pretty clear idea; it's actually very similar to the universities. Usually for seven years you are working for the law firm, and that's when you can become—right?--a partner in the law firm. Right? So you have a sense how your career will unfold. Well this is something we already kind of covered—right?--that you are separated from the means of administration, because you are subjected to discipline and control.

Now comes the very controversial idea, and that we have to talk about it. Weber's claim, which is very much against commonsense, that the purely bureaucratic type of administration is capable of attaining the highest degree of efficiency. Well let me, on the other hand, from this citation, underline an important point here. And this is—of course Weber was talking about a very specific type of organization, bureaucracies, which were, relatively speaking, historically quite efficient—right?--the Prussian type of bureaucracy. But here he emphasizes—and these are two very important words--&quot;from the technical point of view.&quot; Right? The bureaucracy, from the technical point of view, is the most efficient organization. It does not necessarily mean that it does achieve the highest welfare for people who are seeking to navigate in a bureaucratic organization. But technically speaking, it is the most efficient. Why? Because it has a very high degree of predictability. I mean, this predictability might suggest that it will take you a long time to get through of that bloody red tape—right?--what the bureaucracy imposes on you. But you know exactly the red tape, and you know, if you are stuck, how to try to appeal and to get the process moving. And therefore the crucial issue he said, why the bureaucracy is so efficient, because it is technically competent and it is predictable. And this is what makes it actually so—to fit so well with a market.

Well he said, &quot;And what else?&quot; If it is not bureaucracy, how can you otherwise organize an organization? If it is not done bureaucratically, then it is dilettantism. Right? And you may want to think about this. Now here comes the question about how does bureaucracy and capitalism fits into? And now he makes a very intriguing, very provocative claim. I think it is very deep, and deserves your attention. He said, &quot;The primary source of superiority in a bureaucratic administration lies in technical knowledge.&quot; Right? Bureaucracy is domination through knowledge. Well, a very provocative, very important claim. Right? Bureaucracy is—right?--the par excellence meritocratic organization—right?--where people who are issuing command are issuing command with the assumptions that they are the most competent people to carry this out. Well whether this is the case or not—you remember, Weber is always operating with ideal types, or pure types. The concrete cases may be different from it.

You may have people who are not competent to exercise the authority, what they do exercise. But I think it is important that you have the ideal type, because then you can be upset, and you say, &quot;These bloody bastards.&quot; Right? &quot;It is incompetent; cannot do the job.&quot; And then you can appeal and to say, &quot;Why don't you remove this person, because this person does not know what his or her job is?&quot; And actually such appeal very often is consequential. People occasionally are removed their position if their incompetence is being demonstrated. Well this is very difficult to do at a university, because universities, we have this system of tenure. You know? After you've suffered for seven years as an assistant professor, you are promoted to tenure, and then it is very difficult to get you out of the job. But even at the university this is possible. If you find out that I'm completely incompetent—right?--you document that I am incompetent—right?--that I am just misinterpreting all the authors you had here. And then you can appeal—right?--to the university, and you can say that I really should be removed; my tenure should be invoked. And if I'm found to be incompetent, I will lose my job; but the only way to do it, is through my incompetence. But actually universities very rarely do it, because it's a very painful exercise. But because they are bureaucracies there is—right?--the rule that it can happen, and it should happen in these cases.

And then he said, &quot;Well from this point of view, it really does not matter whether an economy is organized as a capitalistic economy, based on private ownership, or whether it is organized as a socialist economy, based on public ownership.&quot; Right? And, in fact, now he goes even further; and it's very interesting what he's got to say here. He's writing somewhere in 1919, 1920. The Soviet Union already exists, Soviet Russia already exists. There is already a society which calls itself socialist, which eliminated private ownership. And he said, &quot;Well socialism would require a still higher degree of formal bureaucratization than capitalism.&quot; That's a very interesting idea. Though until now he suggested—right?--that the bureaucratic organization fits the best with free market economy, now he said actually socialism will be even more bureaucratic.

And then I think what comes very—it's a very intriguing idea, and he said, &quot;But the big problem with socialism is that there will be a big conflict here between the formal rationality and substantive rationality, what the bureaucracy carries out.&quot; And you know by now—right?--or you have at least a hunch what he's getting at between formal and substantive rationality. Right? Formal rationality is that you are simply implementing the rules of the game. Substantive rationality is you are actually concerned with the welfare, the substantive goals of the action. And he said, &quot;Well, if you have a publicly owned economy, centrally planned economy, then the central planners make substantive decisions about the economy.&quot; They decide, for instance, where government or taxpayer money should go to—which branches of the economy should be investment going to. Right? In a capitalist economy, governments typically cannot do that. Right? They set the rules of the game. Well the best—they manage interest rates and they may be able to manage the currency exchange rate, but they cannot allocate resources across the economy. Of if they do, then people will say, &quot;We are on the road to socialism.&quot; Right? To the extent substantive rationality is involved.

But he said, &quot;Well if it is socialism, there will be this big tension.&quot; Right? You cannot be at the same time formally rational and substantively rational. You either consider the content of your decisions, or you are concerned simply with the procedures of the decision. If you are concerned with the procedure, that is formal rationality. If you are concerned with the content, that is substantive rationality.

Let me just give you one example about the legal system. Indeed, in Communist societies—and probably to some extent even China today, much less so than it was let's say thirty of forty years ago—well when justice is being served by the court, the court is not blind to who the people who are being accused of committing some crime is. The communist legal system called itself a class law; that, in fact, the purpose of the legal system is not to be blind—right?--who committed the crime. The purpose of the legal system is—that was the kind of legitimacy claim under Communism—to defend the interests of the working class. Right? And therefore that was specifically a legal system based on substantive rationality. Right?

Well capitalist legal systems tend to be procedurally—right?--rationalistic, formally rationalistic. In principle it doesn't matter who the person is when you are serving justice. This is again the ideal. Right? In concrete cases actually judges might consider some substantive characteristics of the person who is on trial, not simply to implement the law. May consider as mitigating circumstances—right?--for instance, when they are passing the law. And, of course, there are other reasons how actually substantive considerations enter the game. You know? If you are white and rich, you can hire a better defense lawyer and your chances to get off the hook within the same rules are better. So substantive considerations enter the thing. But that's the exception; that's not supposed to happen. We are angry when this happens. Right? We want to have a faceless legal system. Right? Justice is blind. Right? This blindness of justice means—right?--this is simply procedurally just—right?--and not substantively so. Right? This is why justice is shown with blind eyes.

Now what are the consequences of bureaucratization? Here are some of them. He said there is a tendency of leveling of interest; since everybody is in principle equal before the law and therefore interest will be leveled. You are not supposed to take into account people's position in it. Well there is a tendency—meritocratic tendency—that people higher up will have higher levels of training, or more training, as such. And—this is again justice is blind—what is important is that the essence of a bureaucracy has to be a formalistic impersonality: sine ira et studio, without hatred and passion. Right? This is why occasionally you are kind of upset when you are confronted with the bureaucracy. You have a special problem—you know?--and then the bureaucracy tends to be insensitive to your special problem—right?--when it is a real bureaucracy. Right? You can say, &quot;I just had a fight with my partner and this is why I cannot take the test.&quot; Well, sine ira et studio. I mean, in a real bureaucratic, discussion leader or professor will say, &quot;Too bad. This is your personal business. The test is right now.&quot; Right? &quot;You take it or leave it.&quot; Well, I mean, we are usually not that stupid bureaucrats. But that's the spirit of bureaucracy. Right? Without hatred and passion; that also means that you are not motivated by personal feelings. You don't differentiate this is a person I like and then I give preferences; or dislike, and therefore give a worse grade.

All right, there are a number of contradictions of bureaucracy. It is very formalistic. And he said there is also another interesting tendency. Though it is formalistic and it's supposed to go simply by the rules, occasionally, not only under socialism, in all systems the bureaucracy tends to have some sensitivity to substantive rationality, to the welfare of the people who are under the bureaucracy. And then it can be turned into a clientalistic system; the bureaucracy can have these tendencies. And think about welfare bureaucracies—right?--which do have a great deal of clientalistic tendencies built into them.

==Chapter 4. Limitations of Bureaucratic Authority==

Well, and there are these various limitations of bureaucratic authority. One is collegiality, division of powers, and representation. Well I don't want to dwell too long on the notion of collegiality. Collegiality, he says, really grows out of what we knew as professional groups or professional organizations. There are different ways how collegiality can operate. One way—that means that you are interacting with other people in the same organization, on the basis of collegiality. You can get a good sense of this collegiality; for instance, it's very important in the medical profession. If you go to a doctor for a second opinion, this doctor is really not supposed to say that his or her colleague, the other doctor, really screwed it and he gave you the wrong diagnosis or the wrong therapy. Right? Collegiality means that you stick together—right?--that the profession sticks together. There is a very strong sense of collegiality among lawyers, or at least supposed to be. The ethic of the legal profession is very much collegiality.

And it is also incidentally in the universities. I mean, faculty is not supposed to badmouth each other. Right? They certainly, towards students, they have to show that they have a collegial relationship with each other. Mutual respect binds them together. Occasionally there is what he calls veto collegiality; the collegiality does give veto right to certain people to run this organization. A single person can veto a decision, as such. Again, very typical in universities when it comes, for instance, to a decision whether somebody will be granted a permanent position in a university; so-called tenure, there is actually—the president of the university usually has a veto right and can veto. No matter that all bodies approved that, the president usually has a veto right—can veto that decision. It uses it very rarely, but occasionally it does use its veto right. So even in a collegially organized bureaucracy, there is these individual veto rights; otherwise, collegiality usually operates through the different committees and advisory boards. I mean, collegiality usually is emerging in a situation where you have a common trade or a common profession. That's when a group is being organized as a collegial bureaucracy, as such. And many of you will end up in professions in which you will have such a collegial environment, as such. Okay.

The other issue is—which is also a limitation of the functioning of the bureaucracy—right?--collegiality meant—right?--that though the bureaucracy is supposed to be blind to individual differences, it's not always, because we have loyalties towards each other, based on our profession. Lawyers are loyal to lawyers, and doctors are loyal to fellow doctors, and professors have a degree of loyalty.

Now the other one is division of powers. Well this division of powers, what Locke and Montesquieu and Rousseau were talking about, well it's a functional system—he cites Montesquieu about the separation of power—and that creates some degree of unpredictability in the system; but necessary, but creates some degree of unpredictability. Nevertheless, this is the way how to prevent tyranny. So therefore it is good for the economy; by what he means for the market economy.

And then comes the question of representations, and different forms of representations. Well there are—again, representations can be democratic, but is not necessarily all that bloody democratic. In fact, there is a possibility of representation when the representation is happening through some hereditary means. Traditional authority; people who were born in certain positions, like Montesquieu himself, was supposed to represent certain interests, which is beyond the personal interests of the person—right?; was supposed to represent the interests of the whole estate, what it was standing for. Well it's also—in modern times we do have a representation where representations can be selected by rotation or lot—in Ancient Greece this happened—and there can be a limited mandate; they are not representing necessarily the interest of the constituency and they can be recalled. This was typical of Communist bureaucracies. Or there can be what he calls free representation—it's what we would associate to democracy—where the representative is elected, rather than selected or appointed.

But it is also not bound by instructions; is only obliged to express his own conviction. So this is what we have seen in the Congress happening. Right? That Democrats voted with Republicans, because those Democrats argued, &quot;I'm not under party discipline.&quot; Right? &quot;I am acting out of my conscience.&quot;

Well a couple of ideas about free representation, and how it goes with a capitalist economy. Well what is crucial—right?--and Weber keeps coming back and back to this—what is vital for a capitalist economy is to be calculability and reliability. And well in early stages, in fact, there was property qualification, who could actually vote, and that was implemented in order to make the system more predictable for the propertied classes. There was a great deal of concern by the bourgeoisie to give universal suffrage, because they felt then this will be unpredictable, who will win the elections.

In fact, very often, these were monarchs and absolutist monarchs, who were pushing for extension—right?--of suffrage, because they wanted to use this against the propertied bourgeoisie. That's again something very counterintuitive, but I think historically a very accurate understanding. Right? So one has to be very careful what exactly the relationship with a capitalist economic order and democracy is. Well so Weber's fundamental argument is what many people who do the history of the democratic movement will agree; others will disagree with him. Again, a good subject for discussion. Parliamentary free representation was the product between struggles; actually struggles between monarchs and the bourgeoisie. Well I think I'll just leave this here. I probably gave us enough food for the discussion. Thank you.

      <comment>/* Different Hydrophobicity Scales */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hydrophobicity scales''' is a system used by biochemists who study amino acids to relatively define the hydrophobicity of amino acid residues. A hydrophobicity scale is typically within a negative to positive range. Values that are in the negative range are defined as not very hydrophobic, whereas the values in the positive range are defined as somewhat hydrophobic. Hydrophobicity scales also offer great insight as to the thermodynamics of the interactions that take place between lipids and proteins inside the cell membrane. 
[[File:Liquid water hydrogen bond.png|thumb|right|Hydrogen bonding between water molecules.]]

== Hydrophobicity ==
Hydrophobicity, also known as the hydrophobic effect, is the tendency and readiness of non-polar molecules, such as lipids, to associate themselves together in an aqueous solution while simultaneously excluding water molecules. The hydrophobic effect is created when lipids and other non-polar molecules disrupt the hydrogen bonding network of water and forces it reform itself around the non-polar molecule. The resulting effect is water forming a cage around that particular hydrophobic molecule. The hydrophobic effect plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein folding, as well as formation of lipid bilayers and the insertion of membrane proteins into non-polar lipid environment. 

== Different Hydrophobicity Scales ==
There are many different types of hydrophobicity scale. Below are five different ways to access the hydrophobicity level of a single amino acid residue or a single amino acid mutation of a polypeptide, as discussed by MacCallum in his hydrophobicity scales article.  In the Radzicka–Wolfenden experiment, the sidechain of the amino acid arginine is placed into water and cyclohexane solvent. The concentration of the amino acid in each layer is used to calculate the free energy. The problem with this hydrophobicity scale is that cyclohexane, being more nonpolar, does not accurately represent the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. The MacCallum et al.’s evaluation of the hydrophobicity scale is very similar to that of Radzicka’s. The only difference is that instead of using cyclohexane, MacCallum uses DOPC, which is a more accurate representation of the actual lipid bilayer. The problem is the same in that there is no backbone in this model. A “water defect” is seen because as some of the amino acids pass through the bilayer, its charges attracts and pulls the water with it. Wimley–White uses 1-octanol with water droplets and a pentapeptide Ace-WLxLL instead. They replace a single amino acid each time. This is a more realistic representation of the cell membrane because it takes into consideration the effects of the polypeptide backbone. They also measure the proportion of pentapeptide in each solvent. Moon–Fleming uses the protein OmpLA, which can be in an unfolded state in water or in a folded state when inserted inside the membrance.The equilibrium is shifted by mutating ompLA. Measurement is taken from using fluorescent spectrometry. Hessa et al. uses the protein leader peptidase. They attach an H-segment,a 19-residue-long chain, and 2 glycosylation sites on the H-segment to the leader peptidase. By assaying the glycosylation sites, they can predict if the H-segment have been inserted inside the membrane or not. These five experiments all measured the free energy transfers as the amino acid passes through the membrane. These hydrophobicity scales correlated very well with each other when normalized. Note: It should be kept in mind that these experiments do not fully represent the hydrophobicity inside the biological systems  because they do not take into consideration the membrane proteins that are already presented inside the cell membrane, which could have interact with our amino acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot;&gt;MacCallum, J.L. and Tieleman, D.P. (2011) Hydrophobicity Scales: A Thermodynamic Looking Glass into Lipid–protein Interactions. ''Trends in Biochemical Sciences.'' 12, 653-661 &lt;/ref&gt; The following image shows the system and the environment for each of the five experiments mentioned.

== Importance of the Hydrophobicity Scale ==
Even though 20-30% of all proteins are membrane proteins, less than 1% of all structures known in the Protein Data Bank are membrane proteins. Knowing the hydrophobicity scale allows for prediction of the transmembrane protein sequence, as well as allows for a better understanding of the water-protein-lipid interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Transmembrane_proteins.PNG|thumb|left|An example of the components of a typical transmembrane protein.]]

== Protein-lipid interactions ==
The thermodynamic and microscopic details for lipid-protein interactions are very important in a number of vital biological factors. 

One of such biological factor involves KvAP, which is the first crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel. The structure of KvAP has led to numerous discussions in the biochemistry community about the interactions that take place between arginines, an amino acid, and lipids. This is due to the gating mechanism that the structure suggests in which positively charged arginines were exposed to the interior of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. 

Another key biological factor in protein-lipid interactions is the action of anti-microbial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides. This is because anti-microbial peptides have specific amino acid sequences that are enriched in cationic and aromatic residues, whereas cell-penetrating peptides are rich in cationic residues.

The last major development is the successful crystallization and determination of the structure of the Sec-translocon system, which has the fundamental task of inserting membrane proteins into the membrane as soon as they are done synthesizing by the ribosome. The complexity of the Sec translocon system has raised questions about the thermodynamics of membrane insertion.

== Protein membrane structure ==
The membrane bilayer is a highly heterogeneous layer with large gradients in density and polarity on a nanometer length scale. The membrane lipid bilayer can be divided into four major regions. The hydrophobicity decreases and the hydrophilicity increases moving along each region. In the first region, which is the center of the bilayer, is very hydrophobic and is significantly disordered with properties similar to decane. In the second region, the lipid tails are more ordered and have a higher density, with features that are very similar to a polymer. In the third region, there is a diverse mixture of functional groups, most of the head group density, as well as water. In the fourth and last region, it is very hydrophilic because it is defined as mostly water that is perturbed by the lipid layer. This layer can be very deep, depending on the cellular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Engleman, D.M. ''et al.'' (1986) Identifying nonpolar transbilayer helices in amino acid sequences of membrane proteins. ''Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem.'' 15, 321-353&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of Hydrophobicity Scales ==
Different hydrophobicity scales have been developed in the biochemistry community to study the lipid-protein interactions that take place at the membrane protein. Each hydrophobicity scale has been developed independently of one another using different techniques to study these lipid-protein interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot; /&gt;

=== Radzicka-Wolfenden small molecule partitioning scale ===
One of the earliest hydrophobicity scales was developed by Radzicka and Wolfenden to study the folding of globular proteins. This scale was based on the partitioning of small molecule analogs of amino acid sidechains between a polar layer (water), and a lipophilic layer (cyclohexane). This particular scale is relevant for membrane partitioning due to the fact that the center of the membrane has physiochemical properties similar to those of bulk hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfenden, R. (2007) Experimental measures of amino acid hydrophobicity and the topology of transmembrane and globular proteins. ''J. Gen. Physiolo.'' 129, 357-362&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidechain analogs of amino acids were added to a biphasic system of water and cyclohexane. After the system reached equilibration, the concentrations of both water and cyclohexane were both measured. This ratio in the concentrations of water and cyclohexane are directly proportional to the free energy of transfer.

Although the Radzicka-Wolfenden hydrophobicity scale is simple, this scale does not accurately reflect real cellular conditions because lipid bilayers do not resemble isotropic solvents and sidechains by themselves ignore important aspects of protein structure.&lt;ref&gt;Radzicka, A. and Wolfenden, R. (1988) Comparing the polarities of the amino-acids - side-chain distribution coefficients between the vapor-phase, cyclohexane, 1-octanol, and neutral aqueous-solution. ''Biochem''. 27, 1664-1670&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MacCallum et al. molecular dynamics potential of mean force scale ===

MacCallum et al.'s molecular dynnamics potential of mean force scale focuses on molecular dynamics simulations in order to calculate the distribution of the Radzicka-Wolfenden sidechain analogs (as described above). Instead of using cyclohexane as the lipophilic layer, a more realistic bilayer called 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer (DOPC) was utilized instead. Because these are computer simulations, the local environment is able to be known in the molecular level. 

One of the most important things about this particular model is the formation of water defects in the bilayer, which are local deformations in the membrane which allow for water to penetrate into the bilayer core and keep polar and charged groups hydrated in the partitioning of polar and charged molecules into the lipid bilayer membrane.&lt;ref&gt;MacCallum, J.L. ''et al.'' (2008) Distribution of amino acids ina lipid bilayer from computer simulations. ''Biophys. J.'' 94, 3393-3404&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visual of MacCullum's Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== Wimley-White pentapeptide-based hydrophobicity scales ===
Wimley and White developed a peptide-based system to derive a thermodynamic scale between amino acid side-chain residues and lipids. &lt;ref&gt;Wimley, W.C. and White, S.H. (1996) Experimentally determined hydrophobicity scale for proteins at membrane interfaces ''Nat. Struct. Biol.'' 3. 842-848&lt;/ref&gt;. The pentapeptide which Wimley and White used was Ace-WLxLL, where x can be any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Water was used as the polar layer and 1-octanol was used as the lipophilic layer, and the partitioning between the two layers was measured. The partitioning between water and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was also measured via equilibrium dialysis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

One of the caveats of this particular scale is that its focus is explicitly interfacial instead of the bilayer core like the other scales. In order to achieve a better understanding of this scale, one will need to dwelve into the microscopic level. However, compared to the other small molecule scales, this scale is more realistic but emphasizes on the interactions of amino acid side-chain residues with either the water-lipid interface or a heterogeneous octanol environment with a hydrophobic environment for neutral amino acids like lycine and a more hydrophilic environment for charged amino acids like arginine. &lt;ref&gt;Franks, N.P. ''et al.'' (1993) Molecular oganization of liquid n-octanol: An X-ray diffraction analysis. ''J. Pharm. Sci.'' 82, 466-470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wimley, W.C. ''et al.'' (1996) Solvation energies of amino acid side chains and backbone in a family of host-guest pentapeptides. ''Biochem.'' 35, 5109-5124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visual of Wimley's Hydrophobicity Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== Moon-Fleming OmpLA folding/refolding scale ===
Moon and Fleming developed a hydrophobicity scale that is based on the reversible ''in vitro'' equilibrium between the water soluble unfolded state and membrane-inserted folded state of outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA) &lt;ref&gt;Moon, C.P. and Fleming, K.G. (2011) Side chain hydrophobicity scale derived from transmembrane protein folding into lipid bilayers. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 108, 10174-10177&lt;/ref&gt;. By making mutations in OmpLA, equilibrium between the folded, membrane-inserted state and the unfolded state in solution can be shifted and subsequently measured by fluorescent spectroscopy. 
[[File:PDB_1fw2_EBI.jpg|thumb|right|The three-dimensional structure the outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA).]]

This experiment compares a well-defined folded membrane state with an unfolded state in solution and measures the thermodynamic equilibrium between the two. One of the complications is that the bilayer used, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC), is relatively thin and unstable.


[[File:Visual of Moon's Hydrophobicity Scale.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=]]

=== Hessa et al. Sec translocon hydrophobicity scale ===
Hessa et al. developed a hydrophobicity scale using a previously developed membrane protein insertion assay using the small membrane protein leader peptidase. They engineered two glycosylation sites and a 19 amino acids long residue, also known as the H segment, which can be inserted into the membrane as a transmembrane helix depending on its hydrophobicity. By assaying the two glycosylation sites, the insertion state of the H segment can be determined &lt;ref&gt;Hessa, T. ''et al.'' (2005) Recognition of transmembrane helices by the endoplasmic reticulum translocon. ''Nature'' 433, 377-381&lt;/ref&gt;. An apparent equilibrium between the inserted and non-inserted state of H segments can be achieved by modulating the sequence. 

The insertion of the H segment involves the Sec translocon, which is a cellular machinery that either inserts of secretes a given H segment into the membrane as it gets synthesized by the ribosome. Hessa et al. used this to develop a transmembrane prediction method that relies on a linear combination of single residue results to predict whether or not a helix of an amino acid residue will get inserted into the cellular membrane &lt;ref&gt;Hessa, T. ''et al.'' (2007) Molecular code for transmembrane-helix recognition by the Sec61 translocon. ''Nature'' 450, 1026-1030&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another useful application for this method with the Sec translocon is to test whether a particular sequence from a voltage-gated potassium channel would insert into the membrane, despite having multiple arginine and other polar residues &lt;ref&gt;Hessa, T. ''et al.'' (2005) Membrane insertion of a potassium-channel voltage sensor. ''Science'' 307, 1427&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Similarities between the hydrophobicity scales ===
Despite having used different environments and methods to test for hydrophobicity, each of the five aforementioned derived hydrophobicity scales all exhibit a well-defined correlation with one another &lt;ref name=&quot;MacCallum&quot; /&gt;. For instance, the Radzicka-Wolfenden and MacCallum scales correlate very well with each other and yield almost identical absolute free energy differences. The Wimley-White scale measures the interactions in the heterogeneous environment of water and 1-octanol, whereas the Moon-Fleming and Hessa ''et al.'' scales measure properties that are directly related to membrane protein insertion and stability. 

The absolute magnitudes of the Wimley-Hessa-Moon scales and the MacCallum-Radzicka scales differ by a significant amount. Despite this fact, all five of these scales all point to the same result &lt;ref&gt;Gumbart, J. ''et al.'' (2011) Free-energy cost for translocon-assisted insertion of membrane proteins. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 108, 3596-3601&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Discrepancies===
Although the experiments that have been conducted have had similar results in an attempt to mach the reaction of lipids and their membrane proteins, the experiments were overall very simple and not necessarily replicators of a true physiological setting, and therefore do not give much insight to true physiological cellular membranes. The experiments are simply correlated and not necessarily exact, for biological membranes contain a diverse mixture of lipids as opposed to the single component bilayers used. Membrane proteins play up to a 25% role in cellular membranes and these are not included within the experiments. Additionally, charged or polar molecules typically distort the lipid-water interface. Moreover, the scales used in the above experiments have only considered single amino acid residues, while in a true biological setting, multiple amino acid residues are present. The free energy calculations (the free energy being the amount of energy measured from the transfer of each amino acid between a polar, water environment and a lipid bi-layer environment) used to determine the scales in each of the experiments were also very different and this is why a scale factor was used to compare the experiments. Overall, true biological systems have very different settings involved, which have yet to be matched more closely to true settings. Despite the discrepancies within the research of hydrophobicity scales, there are many profound reasons to continue investigating this rather complex and relatively unknown topic, as discussed below.

===Implications===
Researching hydrophobicity and establishing a scale is rather important in creating the ability to discuss the implications of the different scales, as well as in finding a single scale to utilize. The scales help to predicting membrane protein-lipid interactions as well as membrane protein structure, of which little is known. Because many drugs interact strictly with membrane proteins, understanding protein-lipid interactions through measuring hydrophobicity could give great insight to how to cure or treat illnesses through new methods that are not yet known and could be more effective. This would be most applicable in mechanisms of antimicrobial and cell penetrating peptides. Also, hydrophobicity reveals side chain-lipid interactions.

==Introduction==


The heat stress response (HSR) in plants involves a complex network of different pathways which occurs in different cellular compartments. Scientists have been trying to figure out which is the main thermosensor that initiate the transcription of heat stress response gene in response to the heat stress.Up till now, scientists predicted that there are at least four major thermosensors in plants that activate a similar set of HSR gene which helps improving thermotolerance in plants, include a plasma membrane channel, an unfolded protein sensor in endoplasmatic recticulum, an unfolded protein sensor in cytosol, and a histone sensor in the nucleus. &lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot;&gt;Finka, A., Goloubinoff, P. and Mittler, R.. “How Do Plants Feel the Heat?” ''Trends in Biochemical Sciences''. March 2011: 118-125.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship between these four thermosensors remains unknown.

==The Significances of Heat Stress in Plants==

1. Heat plays tremendous roles, especially those of adverse, in plant development, growth, reproduction and fertilization. Plant tissues involved in reproduction are especially vulnerable to the exposure of heat.

2. Plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape heat. Their metabolism is unique as they adapt their metabolism to counterbalance this disadvantage.

3. Cells and organelles in plants are designed in a way to combat and prevent damages caused by heat. 

4. Studies for heat stress in plants help agriculture. Necessary measures for heat damage may be prepared from these studies. Under heat stress, programmed cell death can be activated in plants and this can lead to the shredding of leaves, flowers not blooming, little to no production of fruits, or simply the death of plants. In addition, the reproductive tissues in plants are especially sensitive to heat. A difference of a few degrees in temperature can lead to no crops for the season. This can have an enormous and negative impact on the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; It is estimated that the 1980 and 1988 US heat waves resulted in overall damages of approximately 55 and 71 billion dollars&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Genetic engineering for modern agriculture: challenges and perspectives&quot; by R. Mittler, E. Blumwald&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Effects of Heat Stress in Plants==

Heat stress has certain effects on different components in plant cells such as the stability of membranes, proteins, RNA and skeleton structure in cells.It also can change the way chemical reactions are carried out such as enzymatic reactions in the metabolic system. Due to the changes in these components, metabolic process of plant cells becomes imbalance. The disrupted state of metabolites can result in unwanted by-products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;

In response to the changes of surrounding temperature, plants re-program their transcriptome, protome, metabolome and lipidome. This action  basically induces changes in the composition of certain transcripts, metabolites and lipids which help the plants reset a new  metabolic balance so that the cells can survive and function as normal even at high temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Moreover, when the temperature comes back to normal, plant cells can reverse the reprogram process and get back to the original metabolic balance that fit in with the current temperature. In addition, plants can also program cell death in response to the heat stress such as resulting in leaves shedding.

==Types of Heat Response in Plants==

Several heat treatments have been applied on plants to study the heat response in plants. There are three major set of heat treatments as mentioned in the article &quot;How do plants feel the heat&quot; by Ron Mittler* : no priming, stepwise priming, and gradual priming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;

In the &quot;no priming&quot; treatment, the plants are introduced to a series of severe heat stress. For example, a plant that normally grows at  21&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C is placed in an environment at 42-45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C for 0.5 to 1 hour. Plant survival is then measured 5-7 days after the treatment to determine the effect of heat stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Due to this series of severe heat applied, the plant dies very quickly (exponential decay). The plants ability to survive after such treatment is referred to as basal thermotolerance, the ability of plants to sense and adapt to extreme heat without any priming. 

&quot;Stepwise priming&quot; subjects the plants to an environment of moderate heat stress. This is set up by first letting the plants grow at 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C, and then subjecting them to a temperature of 36-38&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C for a short period time of 1.5 hours.  They are then recovered to the normal temperature of 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C for 2 hours after to which they are subjected to a severe temperature of 45&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. Their survivability under such condition (after priming) is known as acquired thermotolerance. 

&quot;Gradual priming&quot; is the process which the temperature was increased gradually and steadily until it reaches the temperature equal to extreme heat of 45&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. This is supposed to imitate the conditions that is seen in nature. Plants under these conditions also exhibit acquired thermotolorence. For Arabidopsis thaliana, gradual priming increase the survival rate by more than 10%. It is preferred over both no priming heat stress and stepwise priming temperature changes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Larkindale&quot; /&gt; 

The last type of heat treatment is &quot;warming&quot;, which is not considered as one of the heat stress treatments. During warming treatment, plants are originally at a temperature lower than standard growing temperature of 12&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C, instead of 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. They are then exposed to a temperature that is slightly higher than their ordinary growth temperature so instead of subjecting them to 21&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C, they are grown at 27&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;C. This slight increase in temperature change from the norm is, however, not considered heat stress since plants actually do not express HSR markers under warming. In general, warming allows longer term adaptation and reprogramming of the development, which includes early flowering or shedding leaves. 

The important message to take home from this experimental setup is that different heating treatments elicit different transcriptome responses. This suggests that there may be separate heat sensors and signaling pathways activating specific responses to rise in temperature.

==Sensing heat in plants==
When an ''A. thaliana'' experiences an increase in external temperature, its large surface-to-volume ratio makes sure that almost all macromolecules such as protein complexes, membranes and nucleic acid polymers in the plant cells to acknowledge the heat immediately. As it is true for every matter in the universe, the macromolecules' kinetic energy is raised by the introduction of heat into the system. This, consequently, results in reversible physical changes of the macromolecules. There are certain macromolecules that not only just &quot;perceive&quot; heat but also differentially trigger a unique signaling path that can specifically upregulate hundreds of HSR genes&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How do plants feel the heat?&quot; by Ron Mittler, Andrija Finka, Pierre Goloubinoff&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 2 basic routes plants use to mediate heat stress
1. Direct effect in a specific sensor: The specific macromolecule that behaves as a sensor molecule could be directly affected by heat. It is observed when temperature-induced changes in its quaternary and tertiary structures occur. 
2. Indirect effect in a specific sensor: In this route, the specific macromolecule sensor is indirectly influenced by heat due to the effects of heat on other components of the cell. For example, temperature-induced changes in membrane fluidity could affect a membrane protein which is embedded in. It is indirect because the membrane protein is actually affected by heat but is only subject to change when the fluidity of plasma membrane varies.

==Heat sensing at Plasma Membrane==

The fluidity of the plasma membrane can increase when there is an increase in temperature. Scientists have found out that the increased fluidity of the plasma membrane will activate calcium channels, which will lead to an influx of Calcium ions into the cell. This is the primary heat sensing event in the moss ''Physcomitrella patens''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; This is the mechanism of detecting heat. However, the actual heat stress sensor in plants cells in still unknown. The ''A. thaliana''genome encodes over 40 calcium channels and many of them are known to be located in the plasma membrane. These presences of calcium channels strongly suggest that calcium ions are the ones, which are responsible for sensing heat.

Beside activating the Calcium channels, membrane fluidity change might also trigger lipid signaling due to the change of temperature.

''How does a heat stress-induced inward calcium flux can control regulate multiple signaling pathways in plants?''

In ''A. thaliana'', the following 4 pathways are known to happen: [[File:Ch4 kinases.jpg|thumbnail|Mechanism of protein kinases]]

1. The calmodulin AtCaM3 signals heat stress and it itself is involved in the activation of different transcription factors such as WRKY39&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Functional characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY39 in heat stress&quot; from Mol. Cell, 29 (2010), pp 475-483) by S. Li&lt;/ref&gt; and HSFs &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The role of class A1 heat shock factors (HSFA1s) in response to heat and other stress in Arabidpsis&quot; from Plant Cell Envirnment, 34 (2011), pp738-751 by H.C. Liu&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Chain reactions may be triggered by heat signaling. It is known that an inward flux of calcium activates unique calcium-dependent protein kinases or the ROS-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase. A protein kinases is a kinase enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them. 

3. AtCaM3 activated calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase. This protein kinase phosphorylates HSFA1a.

4. An HSP90/FKBP-dependent kinanse can also mediate HSF phosphorylation causued from calcium binding to calmodulin &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arabidopsis ROF1(FKBP62) modulates thermotolerance by interacting with HSP90.1 and affecting the accumulation of HsfA2-regulated sHSPs&quot; from Plant Journal 59 (2009), pp 387-399 by D. Meiri, A Breiman&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipid Signaling== 

On top of ion channel activation in the plasma membrane, membrane fluidity changes caused by increase heat can also trigger lipid signaling. During heat stress, phospholipase D (PLD) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIPK) are activated. Lipid signaling molecules such as phosphatidic acid, D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP2) start to accumulate from heat stress and tigger the calcium channels open, resulting in calcium influx. On a side note, it should be noted that a reduction in phospholipase C9 activity is correlated with lower concentration of IP3, sHSP downregulation, and lower thermotolerance. 

The mechanistic relationship between lipid signaling response to heat stress and plasma membrane channels (whether it is direct or indirect) is still unclear. The chronological order of events in heat stress sensing and signaling response also remains as a question to be answered. It is likely that the signaling pathways function downstream to what's responsible for sensing heat stress in plasma membrane. 

==Change in Histone occupancy==

Histones are proteins that help package DNA. As seen in wild-type plants, the increase in temperature causes a significant decrease in concentration of certain histones such as H2A.Z which contains the nucleosomes that might trigger the changes in transcriptome so that HSR genes are initiated. Scientists also found that the decrease in H2A.Z histone concentration might also cause the change in the expression of a specific transcription factor or other regulatory proteins which can initiate the response of transcriptome. After screening for mutants impaired in heat sensing, it was discovered that the ARP6 gene is possibly responsible for mediation of responses to temperature changes. ARP6 codes for a SWR1 subunit that is required in order for H2A.Z to be inserted into nucleosomes, instead of H2A. It was shown that warming in wild-type plants result in significant decrease in H2A.Z occupancy in nucleosomes where the transcription for warming-induced genes starts. Since less histones are in the way, this allows for more transcriptions of these warming-induced genes. Less H2A.Z occupancy in certain HSP promoters can also affect transcription factor and other regulatory proteins' expression and DNA binding ability, ultimately inducing transcriptome response. It is, however, unsure whether the occupancy of the histones is the cause for heat sensing related to acquired thermotolerance. &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Unfolded Protein Response==

Heat stress may activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in both ER and Cytosol which can initiate heat stress response(HSR). The UPR is the weakening of protein stability. In the ER pathway, unfolded proteins can enter the nuclei and therefore affect the transcription of certain genes. This will lead to an accumulation of ER chaperone transcripts which will alter the metabolism of the cell in order to adapt to the heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Beside heat stress, UPR can also be activated by specific chemicals that cause UPR or changes in certain abiotic aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moreno&quot;&gt; Moreno, A.A. and Orellana A. (2011) The Physiological role of the unfolded protein response in plants. ''Biol. Res''. 44, 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Because few unfolded proteins and HSR chaperones are likely to exist under mild heat conditions, the UPR is considered to be not as sensitive as the PM heat response.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;



==ROS Signaling==

Different metabolic pathways are likely to depend on enzymes with different responsiveness to unnecessary heat. From this reason. it has been proposed that heat stress might uncouple some metabolic pathways and cause the accumulation of unwanted by-products. An example of such by-product is reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies have shown that the accumulation of ROS is mostly likely due to the change in fluidity of the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Königshofer&quot;&gt; Königshofer, H. ''et al''. (2008) Early events in signaling high-temperature stress in tobacco BY2 Cells involve alterations in membrane fluidity and enhanced hydrogen peroxide production. ''Plant Cell Environ.'' 31, 1771-1780.&lt;/ref&gt; This event is most likely a positive feedback loop since the accumulation of ROS will also open up more calcium channels in the plasma membrane and therefore lead to more calcium influx into the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt; Therefore, it seems that the plasma membrane heat sensing is highly interlinked with ROS signaling. A large accumulation of ROS may lead to program cell death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finka&quot; /&gt;

==Conclusion==

Although scientists have proposed possible ways in which plants can sense heat, there is still much we don’t understand about the specific mechanisms and the order of events. How the signals from the speciated sensors integrate with each other within the network of signal transduction is also still of an important question that is yet to be answered. There could be additional pathways not yet discovered but crucial to heat stress response.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Mismatch Repair in mammals is an important mechanism in the overall processes of DNA repair. Mismatch Repair (MMR) works by removing incorrect base pair match-ups in double-stranded DNA and replacing it with the correct base pair. However, MMR has other known functions, including mutagenesis in different ''in vivo'' conditions.

==Canonical MMR Mechanism==
Errors in DNA replication pose many problems to both the integrity of the DNA and to the individual. MMR is one way that these errors are fixed, as it is known that deficiency in MMR causes cancerous tumors in animal models. 

The basic MMR system relies on the proteins, MutSα, MutLα, EXO1, RFC, PCNA, RPA, polymerase-δ, and DNA ligase I. There are three basic steps of MMR known as licensing, degradation, and resynthesis. 

===Licensing===
In licensing, MutSα binds to the mismatch error in the DNA strand, which causes a change in the conformation of MutSα into a sliding clamp. This change is dependent upon an exchange of ADP for ATP. MutLα is recruited to forma  ternary complex with MutSα, which then diffuses along the DNA strand until it reaches PCNA.

PCNA, or proliferating cell nuclear antigen, is a protein that can undergo a conformational change to become a ring around DNA. To attach to the DNA, it relies on the function of RFC, or replication factor C. This protein uses ATP hydrolysis to attach the PCNA to the DNA. This attachment is only efficient when there is a &quot;nick&quot; in the DNA, or an apyrimidinic (AP) site. The PCNA can then attach to the 3' end of the nick. While RFC can add PCNA without a nick in the DNA, this is down with extremely low efficiency. 

Once it reaches PCNA, the cryptic endonuclease of MutLα is activated and causes additional nicks that are on both sides of the mismatch error on the same strand. This is only necessary for PCNA binding on the 3' side of the mismatch. Nicks are only made on the same strand as the mismatch because PCNA is not symmetric and has distinct sides to it. As such, MutLα can only interact with PCNA on a specific face and the complex will have a certain orientation, which remains constant even when sliding across the DNA. MutLα has endonuclease activity on one of its heterodimer subunit, PMS2, and this will only nick the same strand as the PCNA binding.

The reason that nicks are made close by to the mismatch (which is essential for DNA repair) is because the complex making the nicks, MutSα/MutLα, has the highest number around the mismatch site, correlating with greater PCNA collision frequency. This is especially important in replication, where the PCNA molecules adhere to the DNA for an extended period of time even after replication. Due to RFC, they are loaded at the 3' terminus of an Okazaki fragment of the leading strand. They adhere with a certain orientation, which allows MutSα/MutLα to cleave the nascent DNA strand, even though the gap around the Okazaki fragment has long been linked. As such, the MMR system has the correct directionality due to this nick generation.

[[File:DNA Repair.jpg|thumb|DNA Repair by DNA ligase I]]

===Degradation===

In degradation, EXO1 is loaded at the nicks created by the PCNA-activated MutSα/MutLα complex. This creates a large gap that starts the nick and ends around 150 bases afteer the mismatch. This gap is single-stranded and on the same side as the mismatch. EXO1 is an exonuclease that can only cut in a 5' to 3' direction. 

===Resynthesis===

Resynthesis involves PCNA, polymerase-δ, and DNA ligase I in order to replace the removed bases and, overall, fix the mismatch error.

===EXO1 Independent Mechanism===
Although not proven in humans, EXO1 deficient mice showed less mutations than MSH2 and MLH1 deficient mice, indicating a mismatch repair mechanism that does not require EXO1. Indeed, a 5' nick MMR mechanism could occur without EXO1 through use of polymerase-δ and MutSα, RPA, RFC, and PCNA. When there is a 5' nick from the mismatch error, polymerase-δ can catalyze strand displacement, whereby FEN1 can catalyze the removal of the strand containing the mismatch. DNA ligase I would then seal the nick formed.

==Insertion/Deletion Loops and Trinucleotide Repeats==

Insertion/Deletion loops (IDLs) and trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) interact largely with MMR in both error-preventing and error-propagating ways.

===Origin of IDLs===

IDLs arise due to the activity of polymerase on TNRs. Trinucleotide repeats are large number of repeats of a single tripley of nucleotides. Such repeats have been implicated in diseases such as Fragile X. When polymerase reads these repeats, it slows down. However, helicase does not slow down, and due to being relatively faster, there becomes long strands of single stranded DNA. As such, these strands can bunch up and form an IDL. This would cause polymerase to create shorter than usual DNA strands.

===The Error-Preventing Role of MMR===

When things such as this happen, MMR can work to fix it. If the loops is less than two to three extrahelical nucleotides long, the canonical MMR can fix it. However, if the loop is longer, there is a MutSβ-mediated way for loops to be fixed. However, this happens by some other MMR mechanism, for in the regular process, PCNA would not be able to diffuse past the large loop. Thus, there must be some non EXO1-mediated MMR.

===The Error-Propagating Role of MMR===

In certain cases, MMR may be &quot;hijacked&quot; to cause TNR expansion. In the event that there is a cruciform loop structure, where there are loops in both strands in the same relative position, a cleavage by PCNA attached by RFC onto one of the loops activating MutSβ and MutLα endonucleolytic activity may cause one of the loops to collapse. When polymerase replaces the missing nucleotides, there will be an extension of the trinucleotide repeat. A larger number of repeats has been linked to more severe disease in diseases that are caused by TNRs, and so this is an important field of study.

==Antibody Variation and Class-Switching==

Antibody variation, although due to a variety of reasons, is largely dependent on the role of MMR. After VDJ recombination, a process involving recombination of the variable, diversity, and join regions of the immunoglobulin genes, a variety of IgM antibodies can be made. However, there are further mechnanisms for antibody variability.

===The role of MMR in Somatic Hypermutation===

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a process whereby many mutations arise in the variable region of the antibody. It works through activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) where C nucleotides are converted to U. This occurs during transcription, because AID works best on single-stranded DNA. When this occurs, there is a mismatch error on the resultant DNA. As such, uracil DNA-glycosylase works to do base-excision repair (BER) and remove the incorrect U nucleotide. However, once this happens there is an apyrimidinic site (AP) remaining. This site can be the target of EXO1 in order for MMR to occur.

In this case, EXO1 cleavage may cause a large swath of DNA to be excised. When polymerase goes to fix it, AP sites and remaining uracil nucleotides may cause incorrect mutations at the sites where AID acts. This would result in changes in the variable site of the antibody and ultimately, different antigen recognition.

===The role of MMR in Class-Switch Recombination===

MMR can also cause the type of antibody to change, such as from IgG to IgM while recognizing the same type of antigen. When there are two AP sites and EXO1 causes the excision of a section of DNA to the other gap, class-switch recombination (CSR) can occur due to a double-strand break.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following interactions; ion-ion, ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, dispersion, and Van Der Waals with respect to the strength of the interaction vary in terms of strength levels.  The strength of the interaction rests largely on the distance on which they can act on each other.  

==Ion-Ion Interactions==

Coulomb’s law delivers that the electric force acting on a point charge q1 as a result of the presence of a second point charge q2. 
The potential energy, U(r), is given by the equation:
U(r)= (q1q2)/(4*π*E0)*(1/r).  In which potential energy arises from the forces between species.
Where q1 and q2 are the two charges, separated by a distance “r” in the vacuum.  E0 is the permittivity of a vacuum and 1/(4*π*E0) represents Coulombs’ constant. This equation is characteristic of the relationship between two charges.  The ion-ion interactions act over a large distance. Or it can be said that the two charges interact with each other via U~1/r.

==Dipole-Dipole==
For dipole-dipole interactions assume two polar molecules A and B having permanent dipole moments L1 and L2.   The force one molecule exerting on another will depend on L1 and L2, the distance r, and the relative orientation.  The dipole moments of two molecules tend to align with the positive end of one dipole near the negative end of the other, so that the forces of attraction between them are maximized.   The potential energy of the interaction can be simplified to 
U= -2L1L2/ (4*π* E0*r^3) for a horizontal orientation and U= -2L1L2/ (4*π* E0*r^3) for a vertical orientation.  The negative sign indicates that the interaction is attractive. 
For dipole-dipole interactions the two dipoles interact with each other via U~1/r^3.

==Ion-Dipole==

For ion-dipole interactions the interaction between an ion and polar molecule is given by: U=-(qL)/( 4*π* E0*r^2)  where q=ion charge and L again represents the dipole. 
Note: The equation is valid when the ion and dipole lie along the same axis.  
For ion-dipole interactions the cation and negatively charged end of the dipole interact with each other via U~1/r^2.

==Ion-Induced Dipole==

For ion-induced dipoles the interaction is dependent on the orientation of the dipole and for dipole-induced-dipole interactions is dependent on the polarizability of the molecule in which the dipole is induced.   Ion-induced dipoles interact with each other via U~1/r^2 and dipole-induced-dipole interactions interact with each other via U~1/r^5. 

==Dispersion &amp; Van Der Waals Interactions==
Dispersion interactions otherwise known as London interactions interact with each other via U~1/r^6.   Van der Waals Repulsion repels at an even shorter distance and is based upon the Pauli exclusion principle.  One can calculate the interaction utilizing quantum mechanics.  These interactions are dependent on the inverse of the 12th power of the distance, U~1/r^12. 
John Edward Lennard accounted for the repulsive and attraction interactions in nonionic systems: U=-A/r^6+B/r^12 where A and B are constants for two interacting molecules which gives the general form of the equation: 
U=4*E*[(H/r)^12-(H/r)^6]  for a given pair of molecules where E is the depth of the potential  well and H is the separation at which U=0.   Therefore Van Der Waals interactions are dependent upon U~1/r^12. 

The ranking of the above interactions in descending order are as follows:  
Ion-ion, ion-dipole, ion-induced dipole, dipole-induced-dipole, dispersion forces, and Van Der Waals interactions. 

Again, the strength of the interaction rests largely on the distance on which they can act on each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''p53''' is one of the most extensively studied [[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|tumor suppressors]] in multicellular organisms. It was discovered in 1979 and over 60,000 papers have been published about it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Gene Recognition by the P53 Protein Family.&quot; CHEM 114A Lecture. University of California, San Diego, La Jolla. 14 Nov. 2012. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nicknamed &quot;Guardian of the Genome&quot; and in 1993 it was named the &quot;Molecule of the Year&quot; by ''Science'' Magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; It is also known as “protein 53” or “tumor protein 53” and is part of the small p53 family which also includes [[Structural Biochemistry/P63|p63]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/p73|p73]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bissol&quot;&gt;Andrea Bisso1, Licio Collavin1, and Giannino Del &quot;p73 as a Pharmaceutical Target for Cancer Therapy&quot; Laboratorio Nazionale CIB, Area Science Park, Padriciano 99, 34149 Trieste, Italy. 2Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita, Universitàdi Trieste, Via L. Giorgieri 1, 34100, Trieste, Italy/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. This tumor suppressor is regulated by a gene called “TP53 gene”. p53 works by sensing oncogenic cytotoxic and genotoxic stress signals and responds by signaling for cell-cycle arrest as well as apoptosis in order to prevent the cells from further growing. Several experiments have shown that loss of p53, due to inactivation, rearrangement or some other change that causes the protein to lose it's function, promotes the growth and survival of cancer. &lt;ref name=&quot;Levine&quot;&gt;Levine, Arnold J., and Moshe Oren. &quot;The First 30 Years of P53: Growing Ever More Complex.&quot; Nature Reviews Cancer 9.10 (2009): 749-58. Print. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771725/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. It is estimated that 50% of the people who have cancer have a mutation in the p53 protein &lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt;

[[File:p53.png|thumb|Cartoon representation of a complex between DNA and the protein p53 (described in Cho et al. Science 265 pp. 346, 1994 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8023157])]]

The tumor suppressor p53 in humans is a polypeptide of 393 amino acids that take up five domains. p53 is active as a tetramer that has four identical chains of 393 residues. The N-terminal region consists of disordered transcription domains and a proline rich region. At the C terminus, p53 contains the regulatory domain of unfolded basic amino acids that binds DNA nonspecifically as a transcription factor. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot;&gt;Joerger AC, Fersht AR. The tumor suppressor p53: From structures to drug discovery. Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010;2:a000919.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protein is normally found in the cytoplasm of the cell. If the cell is properly functioning and the p53 protein is not needed, then it is degraded by the MDM2 protein.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; If the cell is stressed or there is something wrong, then p53 is passed to the nucleus where is dimerizes and eventually tetramerizes to act as a transcription factor.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt;. 

==Structure==
p53 is a tumor protein that codes for a protein which regulates the cell cycle. There are three domains in the p53 protein that are responsible for directly DNA repair or cell death.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; The three domains are responsible for binding to DNA, recruiting proteins (other transcription factors) to the DNA, and the third domain is a regulatory domain in the C-terminus that regulates the binding of p53 to DNA. &lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; The wide-type p53 is a libile protein that is comprised of folded and unstructured regions which function in a synergistic manner.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; 
===N Terminus p53===
The N terminus of p53 has unfolded regions, but has secondary residual structures that contain hydrophobic resides. The acidic TAD, the main body, which has 2 ill-defined subdomains (TAD1 &amp; TAD2), has binding sites for multiple interactions with proteins that deal with transcription machinery and transcriptionary coactivators. Thanks to the intrinsic disorder of TAD it can facilitate the binding of diverse proteins with high specificity. The n terminus of p53 deals with post translation modification where multiple phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, by several protein kinases, happen which shift the affinity for different proteins that compete to bind with p53. The proline rich region that is in the n terminus links the TAD to the DNA binding domain of the humans. The PXXP motifs, which are in p53 help modify and mediate the protein to protein interactions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

===DNA-Binding Domain===
The DNA binding site for p53 is 20 nucleotides long. As the protein is a tetramer, this means that each dimer binds to 10-basepair sequences that have the general pattern Pu Pu Pu C A/T A/T G Py Py Py from the 5' to 3'direction.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; Thanks to the crystal and solution structure of p53C, the structures have been found in which there are complexes within the p53C that bound to domains of signaling protein. This consists of immunoglobulin beta sandwich that is able to provide a scaffold for DNA-binding surfaces. There is a loopsheet helix motif which dock to the DNA major grooves including loop L1, and beta strands of S2 &amp; S2'. Although these loops are large, they are stabilized by a zinc ion. If this zinc is lost, there will a be a decrease in the thermodynamic stability and a increase in the aggregation tendencies. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

===C Terminus===
The C terminus consists of regions in the protein that help tetramerization. With the help of 3 residues, it forms the central hydrophobic core of the dimer. Formation of stable dimers are through high protein concentrations in the solution. Some extreme C terminus may be intrinsically disordered through local disorders to order transitions from binding to nonspecific DNA or proteins. Some motifs from residues may affect the confirmation. The C terminus is required for efficient binding and transactivation of target genes in large molecules of DNA. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

'''Mechanism'''
p53 plays an important role in cell cycle control and apoptosis. The defective p53 could also allow abnormal cells to proliferate, which then results in cancer. When the DNA is damaged, it will trigger the increase of p53 proteins, which have three major functions. They are DNA repair, growth arrest, and apoptosis (cell death). The cellular concentration of p53 must be tightly regulated. However, the high level of p53 may accelerlate the aging process by excessive apoptosis. 

'''Role of p53 in Disease'''
The tumore supression is reduced when the p53 is reduced. p53 also damaged in cells by mutagens (viruses, chemicals, or rediation). Also, p53 itself can inhibit normal p53 (Blagosklonny, 2002).

==p53 Target Gene Recognition==
p53 regulates the gene transcription binding to double-stranded DNA sequences of its choices. In other words, the p53 protein acts as a transcription factor. Each half-site that the p53 can be described as an inverted pentameric quarter site. The human genome is found to have a high probability binding loci that contains half sites without insertion. Within p53C domains, there are 4 spots that bind to response elements which increase upon binding to full length proteins. The teramers also demonstrate different areas of binding which is formed through a symmetrical dimer. The interface is stabilized within the loops that bind by hydrophobic and water mediated polar contacts. Weak protein-protein interactions are observed within the dimers that can reflect to the response elements within the different spacers. The key residues in the DNA interface make direct contact with DNA half sites inside the DNA minor groove. When making contact, it makes salt bridges that help bind. Although the specific contacts with DNA is important, the residue in the DNA domain are disordered sometimes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;

==p53 Cancer &amp; Mutations==
Although the p53 may help in repressing tumor, some mutations of the TP53 gene is found in some human cancers. These cancers may have over 17,000 cases of somatic p53 missense mutations. Some causes may be the common ancestor found between the p53 genes. There are different mutant classes amongst the mutants. Contact mutations remove DNA-contact residues, while structural mutations affect residues that are essential in the big picture of the DNA binding surface. The equilibrium unfolding and denaturation allow response elements to find even more mutant classes. B sandwich mutations are found in 1/3 of cancer cases in which the B sandwich cannot collapse with the surrounding structure. The mutation destabilizes the protein losing the hydrophobic interactions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot; /&gt;
Most of the mutations in p53 are missense mutations that affect the DNA binding domain region of the protein. When this happens, the molecule is not longer able to bind to DNA which results in a loss of function.&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;&gt; Irwin, Meredith S. &quot;Family Fued in Chemosensitivity.&quot; Cell Cycle 3.3 (2004): 319-23. PubMed.gov. Web. 14 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/irwinCC3-3.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases it has been found that the molecule still tetramerizes and is still capable of binding to DNA, but it no longer can function as a transcription factor. &lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; 

In the case of mutations that result in the protein losing its ability to bind to DNA, there is a subgroup of mutations that actually result in a &quot;gain of function&quot; and p53 now has an oncogenic role&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt;. It this case, it is believed that p53 binds to the DNA binding domain of p73, thus inactivating p73 by preventing it from binding to its targets. As a result, this inhibits that pathways p73 is responsible for, transactivation and apoptosis, thus further promoting cancer&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt; This inactivation of p73 by an alread inactive p53 further results in a decreased response to chemotherapy&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt;.
P53 inhibits tumor formation through the use of Cell Cycle Arrest, Apoptosis and Senecence. This gene has the ability to induce cell apoptosis as part of its role as a tumor suppressor. P53 becomes activated by damage in the cell and is suppressed by MDM2 and when P53 becomes too activated to be suppressed it is possible for it to activate the apoptosis pathway in the cell, among other pathways. Some of the proteins that activate p53 are the MAPK proteins, ATR, TP53RK, and p14ARF. The acetylation sites on p53 play a key role in controlling the specific p53 activation sites and if both are mutated the mutation causes the loss of ability for p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

==Regulation of p53==
MDM-2 (murine double minute 2) is the negative regulator of p53 and acts by binding to the first 42 N-terminal residues that contain a transactivation domain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belyi&quot;&gt;Belyi, Vladimir A., Prashanth Ak, Haijian Wang, Wenwei Hu, Anna Puzio-Kuter, and Arnold J. Levine. &quot;The Originals and Evolution of the P53 Family of Genes.&quot; Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; When MDM-2 binds to p53, is causes a α-helix conformation to form which is successful in blocking the transcription and ubiquitinating lysine resides in the C-terminal domain region. When stress signals or abnormal cell division is sensed, the ARF gene is transcribed and its purpose is to bind to MDM-2 and inhibit its activity and allowing p53 levels to rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belyi&quot;/&gt; 
==3D Structure==
Determining the 3D structure of p53 has been very difficult due to the very complicated folding, especially in the C- and N- termini. The best way to study the three dimensional structure of this interesting protein is to look at the structure of each of its domains separately. The domains structure that have been solved so far are the tetramerization domain; DNA binding domain in complex with DNA, a complex with a transactivation domain; and some parts of the regulatory domain in complex with proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joerger&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant to prevent new blood clots from forming. Blood clot is the aggregation of platelets in the blood vessels and the formation of fibrin network which traps the additional blood cells which can cause heart attack, stroke or other medical problems. &lt;ref&gt;[1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warfarin also is used to treat venous thrombosis (which is the swelling and blood clot in a vein). It is used to prevent pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung). Warfarin also can be called anticoagulants (&quot;blood thinners&quot;).

==Coagulation==
Blood coagulation is the process of formation of blood clots. It involves a series, known as the “coagulation cascade.” Each step of the cascade involves a protease, a zymogen, a non-enzymatic protein cofactor, platelets surface, and calcium ions.  In each step, zymogen is converted to an active protease by cleavage of one or more peptide bonds in the zymogen. Thrombin is the last in a series of coagulation enzymes that are activated by proteolysis of zymogen. Thrombin then converts the soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, which eventually forms a fibrin meshwork and the ultimate blood clot.&lt;ref&gt;[2]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Who needs Warfarin?==
Patients with prosthetic heart valves, irregular heartbeat, thrombosis, and embolism are prescribed warfarin. 

==Overview==
The chemical name of Warfarin is 4-hydroxy-3-(3-oxo-1-phenylbutyl)-2H-chromen-2-one, and the chemical formula is C19H16O4. 

==How it works==
Warfarin is used to decrease the ability of clotting of blood. It works by inhibiting vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factors. It inhibits the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. These factors require carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to bind phospholipids to the factors, which is a vitamin-K-related process.
After vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide in the liver by oxidation, vitamin K epoxide is then reduced to vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) by an enzyme. This reduced epoxide is necessary for the production of coagulation factors. Therefore, warfarin plays a role in prohibiting the actions of VKOR in the liver, so available amount of vitamin-K that can be used for oxidation and the production of coagulation factors is decreased. &lt;ref&gt;[3]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet for patients taking warfarin==
It is recommended to avoid food which is rich in vitamin K, for example, green leafy vegetables, liver, and vegetable oils.

How medicine works can be affected by the food people eat. Warfarin is a medicine prescribed for people with high risk of forming blood clots. It can prevent harmful blood clots, which may block the flow of blood to the heart or brain from forming.  Vitamin K is a vitamin usually found in leafy green vegetables. In contract of Warfarin, vitamin K plays a major role in blood clotting in the body. It is used to reverse the effects of “blood thinning” medications like Warfarin. Warfarin decreases the activity of vitamin K and lengthening the time it takes for a clot to form. Therefore, in order to make warfarin work effectively, it is very important to keep vitamin K intake as consistent as possible. First, keep intake of high vitamin K foods consistent. Second, do not have large changes in the medium vitamin K foods intake. Third, be careful about dietary supplements. It is not wise to take vitamin E or fish oil supplements. Finally, dietitian or physician may restrict cranberry juice from your diet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:AmericanShubunkinRodsan18c.jpg|200px|right]]
This is a guide to modify a cylindrical container into an aquaponic fish or aquatic animal tank for inclusion in a hydroculture system. A barrel, over-sized bucket or new container (garbage) bin can be used to make this aquatic tank: containers that are over 30 gallons are ideal for this project. The purpose is to use ornamental fish waste to fertilize plants. Here are project assembly components to choose from.

==Components==
All component materials should be nonhazardous/noncancerous. For tools and supplementary instructions see: [[Hydroculture/DIY|hydroculture DIY]]
* cylindrical plastic container: new plastic recycle bin, barrel or over-sized bucket
* o-rings
* threaded elbow
* corresponding threaded adapters
* water pump
* washer with screen
* Additional pipe, o-rings and connectors: use 1/2in to 1in pipe and smaller tubing for water flow.
** smaller size tubing and pipes are suitable for drainage. 1in piping offers less restriction, and larger sizes are unnecessary for water flow.
* pipe primer and cement

==Aquatic tank==
For an outdoor aquatic tank an overflow connection with a screen must be installed close to the top. Use two threaded fittings, with a washer with screen in between: it may not be necessary for this connection to be especially watertight.

==Water pump==
High voltage water pumps can be a ''hazard'' if damaged or mishandled. BLDC pumps are efficient and usually operate on a much safer voltage. An airlift pump may also work, if the aquaponics system doesn't require high water pressure.  Use wider diameter pipe to carry the water above the height of the tank, then it can be diverted into multiple smaller channels. ''No'' electrical connections or not watertight components may be exposed to water. Plug components higher than water-level or have a drip loop, so water does not drip into an electrical socket or other connection. The choices of how to transfer water from the aquatic tank to the plants are as follows.
===External===
For an external water pump, a hole has to be cut into the side of the cylindrical container, 1/3 way from the bottom. This must b
===Internal===
Make connections from water pump connection to wider diameter pipe, using proper connectors. The pump's electrical wire must be long enough, and it cannot be exposed to potential damage, and the connection away from potential water contact. On the side top of the aquatic tank, drill a hole to insert a threaded plug and o-ring from the outside. From the inside fit on pvc threaded ''snap tee'', o-rings to the threaded plug. The snap tee is to hold the pipe attached to the pump vertically inside the tank.

===Airlift pump===
For an airlift pump, smaller diameter pipe keeps air and water pressure higher allowing water to flow further. This can limit the height a water-flow can reach and water-flow pressure. Micro-sprinklers may be useful as micro-drippers in this case. 

==Options==

===Connect to other hydroculture systems===
This aquaponic setup can be connected to an aeroponic or hydroponic system.

===Growbed===
If the growbed or plant container is to be lower than the tank, a check valve and additional water pump is required.

==What Is A Destination?==
A destination is a place you need to go in a game to win the said game. There are often obstacles in the way who are either there by coincidence and just like to squash, slash or in some way harm you, or don't want you to get to your destination. All great games have something like it. It could a checkered line in a racing game or an enemy that needs to be defeated. It's your decision.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

What is a material? It's a data block on an object that stores things like whether that object is invisible, if it reflects, if it gives off light, etc.. Objects are also recognised in the BGE with their material. You don't need a material but it helps. For more info:

==Now To Make It==
Now let's have a destination. Find a nice place that the character must walk to. Add an empty there or maybe an object with great twists and turns. Make it obvious that you need to get to it or that it is of great importance in the game. Now make sure that the character has a material on it like Hero or Main Char or Char. This material will be used to figure out if the character has walked into the object.

Select the destination object. Now add a Touch Sensor, an And and a Scene Actuator. Connect them all. Now take the touch sensor and select the character's material in its field. This will detect when an object with the material [Character's Material] touches it.

===Scenes Are What?===
{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

What are scenes? For ease you may go to [[Beyond Blender Render/Scenes|this page]] for more information.}}
Now we must add a scene. Name it something like WIN or MWAH HA HA I WON or something like that. Wait.  What are scenes for in the BGE? We know [[Beyond Blender Render/Scenes|here]].

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

A text object is basically text that can be seen in a render. You can scale, rotate and move it like a normal object but you can still edit it like text.

To edit the text in a text object select it and than press '''TAB'''. Write any thing you want like you do in a normal text editor. When you're done press '''TAB''' again.}}

We used Won for the scene name. Add some text in the Won scene and write some nice message.

Now head back to the gameplay scene. Select the destination object. Now let's compare our logic and correct it if necessary:

[[File:Won logic1.png|800|center|Let's set a new scene. Use this idea for any new scene.]]

Now let's save. This is important in Blender because it can occasionally crash. Save as much as possible and remember: Blender doesn't ask you if you want to save when you close!

Now start the game engine. Let's see what it's like.

Now this is boring! We need some obstacles! Well, let's make a landscape.

[[File:Trp cage folding.gif|x300px|right|frame|Simple example of a molecular dynamics cage that shows the folding of a small amino acid chain, the tryptophan cage, in implicit solvent.]]
Classical molecular dynamics (MD) is a branch of computational chemistry that focuses on simulating the motion of particles according to Newton's Laws of Motion.&lt;ref&gt;Meller, Jarosaw. &quot;Molecular Dynamics&quot; Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Atoms are approximated as &quot;balls on springs,&quot; which allows for the application of the following laws:

&lt;math&gt; f = ma &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v = v_0 + at &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = vt + \frac 1 2 a t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is position, &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is velocity, &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is acceleration, and &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time.

Classical MD approximations treat bond and angle potentials as harmonic, and dihedrals as periodic. This allows for expression of the energy of a system with an equation similar to the following used by the AMBER molecular dynamics program: &lt;ref&gt; R. Salomon-Ferrer, D.A. Case, R.C.Walker. An overview of the Amber biomolecular simulation package. WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci.(2012) &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; E_{\rm total} = \sum_{\rm bonds} K_r (r - r_{eq})^2
                     + \sum_{\rm angles} K_\theta (\theta - \theta_{eq})^2
                     + \sum_{\rm dihedrals} {V_n \over 2} 
                                       [1 + {\rm cos}(n\phi - \gamma)] 
          
                     + \sum_{i&lt;j} \left [ {A_{ij} \over R_{ij}^{12}} - 
                                          {B_{ij} \over R_{ij}^6} + 
                                          {q_iq_j \over \epsilon R_{ij}} 
                                 \right ]
                     + \sum_{\rm H-bonds} 
                            \left [ {C_{ij} \over R_{ij}^{12}} - 
                                    {D_{ij} \over R_{ij}^{10}} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

Simulations are conducted in a series of &quot;time steps.&quot; In each step, the force on each atom is calculated according to the derivative of the energy equation. The atom is moved a certain distance corresponding to the magnitude and direction of the force over the size of the time step. The process is repeated over many time steps, iteratively calculating forces and solving the equations of motion based on the accelerations from the forces, and produces results that mimic complex behavior from docking of pharmaceutical compounds to the folding of simple proteins.

==Limitations==

===Quantum Effects===
Although atoms are known to behave according to the Schroedinger equation rather than by Newton's Laws, classical methods can be used with reasonable accuracy. A good indication of this can be given by checking the De Broglie wavelength of the particles involved &lt;ref&gt;J. P. Hansen and I. R. McDonald, Theory of Simple Liquids, 2nd Ed., Academic, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = \sqrt{ \frac {2\pi\hbar^2} {Mk_BT} } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is the atomic mass and &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature. The classical approximation is justified when &lt;math&gt; \Lambda \ll &lt;/math&gt; the mean nearest neighbor separation between particles. So for heavier systems, such as organic molecules, the classical approximation is reasonable, but for light systems such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, He, or Ne, the method loses considerable accuracy.

Since atoms are approximated as discrete particles, interactions of smaller particles cannot be correctly modeled with classical MD.&lt;ref&gt;Ercolessi, Furio. &quot;A Molecular Dynamics Primer&quot; University of Udine Spring College in Computational Physics, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 
Making and breaking chemical bonds, noncovalent reaction intermediates, and proton or electron tunneling all cannot be simulated with this method. Simulations at very low temperature are also problematic, as near absolute zero classical mechanics are increasingly disfavored for quantum  explanations. Quantum molecular dynamics methods exist for simulations that can be more electronically realistic, but at much greater computational cost.

===System size and timescale===
The number of atoms and amount of time that may be simulated is directly related to available computing power. Although the entirety of a small virus has been simulated before,&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Freddolino, Anton S. Arkhipov, Steven B. Larson, Alexander McPherson, and Klaus Schulten. Molecular dynamics simulations of the complete satellite tobacco mosaic virus. Structure, 14:437-449, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of fine-grained, all-atom simulations that take place are on the scale of proteins rather than organelles or complex assemblies. This is because the length of time that is necessary to simulate to observe results directly relates to system size:

==== Table  - Timescales of molecular processes====
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Secs&lt;th&gt;name &lt;th&gt; Process
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; Surface reorganizations
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; milliseconds &lt;th&gt; Protein Folding
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; 10 nanoseconds &lt;th&gt; NMR
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; Brownian dynamics
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; Lattice Monte-Carlo
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; picoseconds &lt;th&gt; Fast vibrations
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; femtoseconds &lt;th&gt; Electronic excitation
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So, the larger the system, the longer the simulation needs to be run to observe relevant behavior. Today, computer hardware specifically designed for molecular dynamics simulations&lt;ref&gt;David E. Shaw, Martin M. Deneroff, Ron O. Dror, Jeffrey S. Kuskin, Richard H. Larson, John K. Salmon, Cliff Young, Brannon Batson, Kevin J. Bowers, Jack C. Chao, Michael P. Eastwood, Joseph Gagliardo, J.P. Grossman, C. Richard Ho, Douglas J. Ierardi, István Kolossváry, John L. Klepeis, Timothy Layman, Christine McLeavey, Mark A. Moraes, Rolf Mueller, Edward C. Priest, Yibing Shan, Jochen Spengler, Michael Theobald, Brian Towles, and Stanley C. Wang (July 2008). &quot;Anton, A Special-Purpose Machine for Molecular Dynamics Simulation&quot;. Communications of the ACM (ACM) 51 (7): 91–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
can run approximately 17 microseconds of a 23,000 atom system in one day with a 0.5 femtosecond timestep. On the same system, a general-purpose parallel supercomputer can obtain on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds of simulation time.

==Thermostats==
Using an approach based on Newton's equations of motion, a simulation is obtained in the &quot;microcanonical ensemble&quot;, which is a constant energy system (nVE). This is unrealistic, however, and in order to produce accurate comparisons to experiment, simulations are most commonly done in the canonical ensemble, which features constant temperature (nVT).&lt;ref&gt;Hunenberger, Phillipe. Thermostat Algorithms for Molecular Dynamics
Simulations DOI:10.1007/b99427&lt;/ref&gt;This temperature must be maintained with an algorithm, which is called a thermostat. There are several thermostats that are commonly used, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of reliability, accuracy, and computational expense.

A typical simulation involves an MD equilibration phase, at which the structure is simulated at constant temperature for a certain amount of time at 0K, a heating phase where the system is gradually heated to the desired temperature (often 300K), and a final production simulation at that constant temperature. The initial equilibration is necessary not to move the structure to a chemical equilibrium but rather to an energetic minimum (which will usually be near the chemical equilibrium state). If the equilibration were omitted and the simulation run in a region with high energy, the simulation will continue to sample highly energetic phase space, producing results that will be inconsistent with experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;Finnerty, J. &quot;Molecular Dynamics meets the physical world: Thermostats and Barostats&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Langevin Theromostat===
This thermostat follows the Langevin equation of motion rather than Newton's, where a frictional force proportional to the velocity is added to the conservative force, which adjusts the kinetic energy of the particle so that the temperature is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, S.A. and J.D. Doll, Generalized Langevin Equation Approach for Atom-Solid-Surface Scattering - General Formulation for Classical Scattering Off Harmonic Solids. Journal of Chemical Physics, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is then described by the equation:

&lt;math&gt; ma = -v\xi + f(r) + f' &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are mass, velocity, and acceleration of the particle. &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a frictional constant, and &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is a random force that will add kinetic energy to the particle. It is sampled from a Gaussian distribution where the variance is a function of the set temperature and the time step. This balances the frictional force to maintain the temperature at the set value.

===The Anderson Thermostat===
This thermostat couples the system to a heat bath at the desired temperature. The bath is represented by collisions with a stocastic particle on randomly selected system particles. 

It has been shown&lt;ref&gt;E, W. and Li, D. (2008), The Andersen thermostat in molecular dynamics. Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 61: 96–136. doi: 10.1002/cpa.20198&lt;/ref&gt; that the addition of stochastic collisions to the Newtonian MD system results in the simulation being a Markov chain that is irreducible and aperiodic. This implies that the generated distribution with Anderson's algorithm is not a canonical distribution.

This thermostat will randomly affect velocities of particles, which results in nonphysical dynamics in the simulated system.

===The Gaussian Thermostat===
This thermostat strongly couples the system with a heat bath set to the desired temperature. Here, the change in momentum for each particle is represented as:&lt;ref&gt;J. Clarke D. Brown. Mol. Phys., 51:1243, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \displaystyle\sum_{j}^{N} (F_{ij}|q_i-q_j|) - p_i\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

This rescaling destroys dynamic correlations very quickly, and therefore does not maintain the canonical ensemble.
 
===The Berendsen Thermostat===
This thermostat, first presented in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Berendsen, H.J.C., et al., Molecular-Dynamics with Coupling to an External Bath. Journal of Chemical Physics, 1984. 81(8): p. 3684-3690.&lt;/ref&gt; involves re-scaling of the velocities of each particle in a manner that controls the temperature.

Similar to the Gaussian thermostat, the system is coupled to a heat bath with the desired temperature, although this algorithm uses weak rather than strong coupling, where the temperature of the system is corrected such that the deviation in temperature decays exponentially with some time constant &lt;math&gt;\Tau&lt;/math&gt; proportional to the timestep:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{T_0-T}{\Tau}&lt;/math&gt;

===The Nose-Hoover Thermostat===
This thermostat adds an extra term, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; to the Newtonian equations of motion, producing the following second-order differential:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp_n}{dt} = \displaystyle\sum_{i}^{N} \frac{|p_i|^2}{2m_i} - \frac{3}{2}nk_BT &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is mass, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the desired temperature, and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant. The heat bath is given some mass, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, which for Nose's suggested value of &lt;math&gt;6nk_BT&lt;/math&gt; produces the above equation for the momentum change of each individual particle.

With this thermostat, the energy of the simulated system fluctuates, but the total energy of the system and heat bath is conserved. If the system is ergodic (all accessible microstates are equally probable), then this system gives the canonical ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, R. G. (1982). Advanced Physics 31: 669&lt;/ref&gt;

==Force fields==
Molecular dynamics simulations require a &quot;force field,&quot; which lists the parameters involved in each type of interaction in the energy equation. For example, the AMBER force field requires parameters for bond equilibrium length, bond force constant for every possible combination of two atom types, angle equilibrium value, and angle force for every combination of three atom types, dihedral equilibrium phase, dihedral force constant, and dihedral periodicity for every combination of four atom types. Additional parameters also describe the nonbonded (electrostatic) forces for each atom as well.

The development and analysis of these parameters, which collectively are called a force field, is a focus of molecular dynamics research.

===Force field development===
Parameters for classical molecular dynamics ideally lead to behavior that closely approximates that of actual molecules on an atomistic level, which are in reality governed by quantum phenomena. The classical parameters are developed such that this is true- once an energy and force equation (such as the AMBER equation) has been made to establish the paradigm for the system, parameters are derived such that calculated values with them match those calculated with quantum mechanical methods or experiment. Due to the lack of availability of experimental data for the wide variety of molecules and molecular conformations necessary to develop a force field, data from quantum calculations on the systems are used instead.

Force fields are developed for specific classes of molecules. For example, AMBER provides the Amber ff99SB forcefield for proteins&lt;ref&gt;Lindorff‐Larsen, Kresten, et al. &quot;Improved side‐chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field.&quot; Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 78.8 (2010): 1950-1958.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Glycam forcefield for carbohydrates,&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, Karl N., et al. &quot;GLYCAM06: a generalizable biomolecular force field. Carbohydrates.&quot; Journal of computational chemistry 29.4 (2007): 622-655.&lt;/ref&gt; and the newly developed lipid forcefield GAFFLipid.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, C. J., Rosso, L., Betz, R. M., Walker, R. C., &amp; Gould, I. R. (2012). GAFFlipid: a General Amber Force Field for the accurate molecular dynamics simulation of phospholipid. Soft Matter.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a &quot;General AMBER Force Field,&quot; or GAFF, has been developed for the parameterization of small ligands and other molecules that do not fit into the broad force field categories.

The accuracy of a force field is critical to simulation accuracy. Simple terms, such as dihedral force constants, can have an extremely large effect on overall simulations. In fact, inaccurate dihedral parameters for the protein backbone &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; angles produced simulations that were excessively disposed to alpha helix formation, a fact which affected numerous results.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Robert B., Nicolae-Viorel Buchete, and Gerhard Hummer. &quot;Are current molecular dynamics force fields too helical?.&quot; Biophysical journal 95.1 (2008): L07-L09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freddolino, Peter L., et al. &quot;Force field bias in protein folding simulations.&quot; Biophysical journal 96.9 (2009): 3772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindorff‐Larsen, Kresten, et al. &quot;Improved side‐chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field.&quot; Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 78.8 (2010): 1950-1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, force field development has been complicated by the lack of availability of energy and force data to fit to. Force field parameters are generated by fitting the parameters such that the energy of a structure or the predicted forces on each atom predicted using the parameters matches the energy or forces generated by ab initio quantum calculations. These calculations are extremely expensive, and as a result considerable extrapolation is usually made from one set of parameters to a general one in order to avoid re-doing the calculations. For example, using parameters generated for the protein backbone of tetra-alanine as describing the backbone of any protein.

The availability of increasing computing power, more efficient algorithms, and knowledge of past methods proves promising for future parameter development. For example, side-chain parameters for various amino acids may be calculated separately and then added in to a general parameter set in order to characterize each amino acid individually.&lt;ref&gt;Lindorff‐Larsen, Kresten, et al. &quot;Improved side‐chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field.&quot; Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics 78.8 (2010): 1950-1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Force field accuracy===
Classical force fields have been developed by fitting the classical parameters such that they give results consistent with experimental and quantum data. They are categorized by the type of biomolecule- protein, carbohydrate, and lipid forcefields have been developed separately for all major MD programs. However, this categorization is still quite broad, and can neglect system-specific interactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''p73''' is part of the [[Structural Biochemistry/p53|p53]] family of [[Structural Biochemistry/Transcription|transcription]] factors that also includes p63. The family is well known for their ability to regulate cell cycle arrest and [[Structural Biochemistry/Apoptosis|apoptosis]].  p73 and p63 are both structurally and functionally similar to p53, and it is believed that they are also [[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|tumor suppressor proteins]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bisso&quot;&gt;Andrea Bisso, Licio Collavin, and Giannino Del &quot;p73 as a Pharmaceutical Target for Cancer Therapy&quot; Laboratorio Nazionale CIB, Area Science Park, Padriciano 99, 34149 Trieste, Italy. Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita, Universitàdi Trieste, Via L. Giorgieri 1, 34100, Trieste, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;. The monomer of p73 has a 50% homology with p53 causing the folding in both proteins to be very similar.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; Even thought both proteins have a very similar structure and function, while 50% of cancers have a mutated p53 protein, but only 0.5% of cancers have a mutated p73 protein which is of great interest to scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Gene Recognition by the P53 Protein Family.&quot; CHEM 114A Lecture. University of California, San Diego, La Jolla. 14 Nov. 2012. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Protein_TP73_PDB_1cok.png|thumb|Picture of p73]]

==Structure==
The p73 protein has a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] domain structure very similar to p53. The p73 protein is larger than the p53 protein as it has a 636 amino acid sequence.&lt;ref name =&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; Like p53, there are three structural domains that include a transactivation domain (TA) that is a proline-rich sequence following the N terminus of p73, a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C terminus with an oligomerization domain (OD).&lt;ref name =&quot;Allocati&quot;&gt;N. Allocati, C. Di Ilio, V. De Laurenzi, p63/p73 in the control of cell cycle and cell death, Experimental Cell Research, Volume 318, Issue 11, 1 July 2012, Pages 1285-1290, ISSN 0014-4827, 10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.01.023.(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482712000444)
&lt;/ref&gt; Because there are from the same protein family, p73 shares a 50% degree of sequence homology with p53, especially in the DBD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; The similarity in sequence leads to a similar folding structure which allows p73 to function in a very similar way to p53, such as recognizing and regulating targets of the p53 protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; However, the oligomerization domains are less conserved between the two proteins. In this area, p73 is more similar to p63 as it can hetero-oligomerize with p63, but not with p53. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bisso&quot; /&gt;

Various isoforms of p73 exist. There are isoforms that posses a transactivation site similar to the site on p53 and are denoted by TAp73. Other isoforms are ΔNp73 which were originally form the TAp73 promoter transcription do not have the N-terminal transactivation domain due to aberrant splicing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt;  Studies that shown that knockout of TAp73 in mice made the mice more susceptible to carcinogens and thus more tumor-prone. However, ''in vivo'' knockout of ΔNp73 actually reduced tumor growth showing that the two different isoforms of the gene can cause different results.&lt;ref name =&quot;Maas&quot;&gt;Maas, Anna-Maria, Anne Catherine Bretz, Elisabeth Mack, and Thorsten Stiewe. &quot;Targeting P73 in Cancer.&quot; Cancer Letters (2011): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
===Similarities and Differences with p53===
The p53 family proteins each work in different pathways, but they do have some overlapping functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viadiu&quot;/&gt; 
*MDM2 degrades both p53 and p73. 
*p53 and p73 both have a role in triggering apoptosis
However, it has been shown that cells with only p53 knocked-out have a different chemosensitivity than cells with both p53 and p73 knocked-out&lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;&gt;Irwin, Meredith S. &quot;Family Fued in Chemosensitivity.&quot; Cell Cycle 3.3 (2004): 319-23. PubMed.gov. Web. 14 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/irwinCC3-3.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In chemotherapy, patients are given drugs that target fast-growing cells and kills them. Cancer cells are reproducing very quickly and thus are more likely to be the targets of these drugs, however other faster-grwoing cells such as hair and the lining of the stomach can also be targets of these drugs. In some ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' studies, it has been observed that mutated p53 is actually able to bind to p73 and inactivate the protein, causing the cells to be more chemoresistant. &lt;ref name =&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt; 

===Cell Cycle===
TAp73 can stop the cell cycle during the G1 and G2 phases. In the G1 phase, TAp73 arrests the cell cycle by transcriptional up-regulation of p21 and p57/Kip2 which are proteins that prevent the cell cycle from continuing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; In the G2 phase, p73 represses G2/M regulators that include CDC25B, CDC25C, Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, cdc 2 and Topoisimerase IIα, thus preventing the cell from leaving the Interphase and entering [[Structural Biochemistry/Mitosis|Mitosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; Even in mitosis, when p73 is presumed to be hyper-phosphorylated and very inactive, it still plays a role that is can transcribe p57/Kip2 genes which are negative regulators of cell proliferation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; TAp73 has also been shown to interact with spindle assembly checkpoints and helps with that activity and malfunction at this point is believed to be the reason for tumorigenesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt;

===Cell Death===
TAp73 can also signal for cell death to occur through various mechanisms. Through the mitochondrial pathway, TAp73 is able to up-regulate Bax and promote its movement to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria|mitochondria]] which occurs when Bax has received apoptotic signalling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; Through the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, p73 up-regulates scrotin, a gene that can induce apoptosis, in the ER as well as in supra-basal keratinocytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;. It can also modulate the death receptor pathway and can induce CD95 expression (a death receptor).&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;
==ΔNp73== 
This isoforms of p73 is believed to be the negative of not only TAp73 but also p53 by inhibiting growth suppression and apoptosis. ΔNp73 repressed TAp73 transcipriton activity by forming inactive oligomers and competes with p53 for DNA biding sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; It has been shown that in cancer cells that reductino of ΔNp73 results in apoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt; However, there is a feedback loop pathway that occurs when TAp73 and p53 are active that induces ΔNp73 creating a auto-regulatory feedback loop so that there are not too many active TAp73 and p53 molecules. It has also been shown that if DNA damage is detected, this triggers the degradation of ΔNp73, thus allowing TAp73 to function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt;

One possible way of increasing the amount of TAp73 and decreasing the amount of ΔNp73 is by controlling the splicing of the TAp73 promoter transcripts. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the aberrant splicing responsible for changing the transcripts form TAp73 to ΔNp73 was caused by depletion of the splicing factor Slu7. This depletion of Slu7 was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) activity which, in turn, was caused by activation of EGFR by AR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt; Another way of increasing the TAp73/ΔNp73 ratio to favor TAp73 is through using the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib which has been shown to increase TAp73β in neuroblastoma cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt;
==Regulation of p73==
In most solid tumors, there is actually an abundance of p73, however it is not able to do any anti-tumor activity because it is blocked by various inhibitors that include family proteins like ΔNp73, ΔNp63, mutant p53 and non-family proteins such as MDM2, iASPP or mTOR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot;/&gt; Because of the many and complex functions of p73, it is regulated after it has already been transcribed by changing the stability or the protein, the location of the protein and the ability of the protein to bind to promoters. p73 is regulated though its degradation through the ubiquitin system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; MDM2 which is responsible for degrading the p53 protein can also bind to p73. However, instead of degrading the protein, it moves it to nuclear speckles and changes it's transcriptional activity. The E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH binds to p73 to promote degradation of the protein in normal conditions. In times of stress, ITCH is downregulated and p73 and p63 levels are allowed to increase. Unlinke MDM2, ITCH is exclusive to p63 and p73.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; Other genes that can regulate p73 include: PIAS1 that sumoylates p73 thus reducing the transcriptional activity of p73 and allowing the cell to leave the G1 phase of the cell cycle. p73's transcriptional activity is also reduced when Cyclyn/CDK complexes threonin phosphorylate it. SIRT1 inhibits the the acetylation of p73 thus decreasing the activity of p73.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allocati&quot;/&gt; 
==Experiments==

===Regulating DNA Damage Repair &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot; /&gt;===
When normal cells were exposed to bile acids, the role of p73 was activated in response to DNA damage. Increased amounts of DNA damage due to bile acid exposure triggered only the response of p73; this result indicated that p73 induction is independent to p53 and p63, but dependent on the selective activation of c-Abl-kinase. The p73 induction activates transcription of two glycosylases, SMUG1 and MUTYH, to conduct base excision repair. When p73 is deficient, an apparent increase of DNA damage is present &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot;&gt;Zaika, Elena, Jinxiong Wei, Dengping Yin, Claudia Andl, Ute Moll, El-Rifai, and Alexander Zaika. “p73 Protein Regulates DNA Damage Repair.” FASEB Journal. 25. (2011): 1-9.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The causes for esophageal adenocarcinoma involve the severe progressions of gastroesophageal reflux disease, where gastric juices mix with bile acids and enter the esophagus. Exposing the esophagus to gastric acids and bile acids leads to inflammation and tissue damage. In addition, bile and acid refluxes induces genotoxic stresses, which increases ROS and RNS production and consequently causes damage to the DNA through oxidation. 

====Methodology&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot;/&gt;. ==== 
'''Cells cultures, transfection, retroviral infections, and BA treatment'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Primary fetal esophageal fibroblasts, human nontumorous esophageal epithelial cell line, and p53-null esophageal adenocarcinogen cell lines were cultured in DMEM. hTERT-immortalized esophageal epithelial EPC2 cells were grown in KSFM medium with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factors. P73 was then inhibited using lentiviral transduction with shRNA or transfection of RNA, which both targeted a specific sequence found in all the isoforms. 

'''Antibodies, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Antibodies were used for following various proteins: p73, p63, c-Abl, phospho-c-Abl, phospho-p53, β-actin, phosphohistone H2A.X, phosphotyrosine, 8-oxoguanine, p53, p21, PUMA, SMUG1, MUTYH, and nonspecific rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using anti-p73 antibody and analyzing tyrosine phosphorylation of p73 using Western blotting. When conducting immunofluorescence, cells were grown to 50% confluency on chamber sides. Phospho-Histone and 8-oxoG were stained and the intensities of the fluorescent signal were measured. 

'''Real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation'''
&lt;br /&gt;
RNA was isolated, the total RNA was reverse transcribed with a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit, and real-time PCR was used. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted on p73 antibody and a nonspecific rabbit IgG was used as a negative control for HET-1A cells. The p73 binding sites were then analyzed. Certain sequences of primers were used to analyze p73, MUTYH, SMUG1 mRNA levels and ChIP.

'''PCR array, comet, and abrasic site quantification assays'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Comet assays were performed with modifications to the protocol. The cells were mixed with a low melting temperature agarose and applied to a pre-agarose coated slide. A buffer was used to induce cell lysis and then proceeded in electrophoresis under alkaline conditions. The slide was then stained for analysis using CometScore Software. In p73 deficient and the HET-1A cells, the mRNA expressions were compared and analyzed. 

'''Surgical Procedures and immunohistochemistry'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Mouse strains that carried the wild type p73 and normal p73 genes were analyzed. Esophagojejunostomy was conducted on these mice that carried the wild type p73 and normal p73 genes. The 15-week mice were euthanized and the lower esophagus was removed for analysis by immunohistochemistry. 

====Results &lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot; /&gt;====
Nontumorous esophageal HET-1A cells were treated with a BA mixture and the DNA damage was analyzed by immunofluorescence using phospho-H2A.X  and 8-OxoG antibodies. A small exposure to the BA mixture inflicted DNA damage through oxidation and strand breakage. The presence of the p53 family upon BA/A treatment was then analyzed. Despite the presence of DNA damage, there was a lack of increased phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 to induce p53 activation. P53 was only present when the HET-1A cells were treated with a DNA damaging drug called cisplatin. After BA/A treatment, p53 levels decreased and were undetected after a long duration of time. BA/A treatment of SKGT-4 cells resulted to an up-regulation and activation of p73; the analysis revealed that p73 induction is independent of p53. Because the mRNA levels of p73 were not increased in the epithelial cells, it indicated that the up-regulation occurred at the post-translational stage. The presence of c-Abl protein kinase induces the tyrosine phosphorylation, which then activates the p73 protein. 

By inhibiting p73 proteins, increased oxidative DNA damage is apparent. P73 activates SMUG1 and MUTYH that are involved in base excision repair by directly binding to these two glycosylases and regulates its transcription. Therefore, the down regulation of p73 proteins decreases the two glycosylases of SMUG1 and MUTYH&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaika&quot; /&gt;.

=Phagoptosis=


==Definition==
Phagoptosis is a term proposed by Guy. C. Brown and Jonas J. Neher to describe death of working cells by phagocytosis (the engulfing of a cell by a macrophage). The word is derived from two words in ancient Greek: 'phagein' which means to devour and 'ptosis' which means to fall or die.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; Thus the term, phagoptosis means death by being swallowed. Phagoptosis is also known as &quot;primary phagocytosis&quot;. 

Simply stated, phagoptosis is caused by the exposure of “eat me” signals or the loss of “don’t eat me” signals on the cell surface. The exposure and loss of these signals is reversible, thus cell death can be prevented by preventing phagocytosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==

Phagoptosis is a nascent term, combining the ideas of phagocytosis and cellular apoptosis (autonomous cell death). While not yet a confirmed phenomenon in macroorganisms, phagoptosis has been proposed as an explanation for various homeostatic and pathological processes in the body that induce the engulfing of healthy or unhealthy cells by a macrophage. Phagoptosis has been proposed, therefore, to be both a contributor to cellular degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s, whereby healthy neurons are destroyed, and a natural aging tool used by the body to rid itself of unhealthy cells, such as the consumption of old erythrocytes.

Since the 1880s, the work of Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov has led us to believe that phagocytosis, a form of cell destruction, was beneficial because only dead or dying cells were targeted. However, modern-day scientists have found that sometimes healthy, viable host cells can also be marked for cell death; this process is called phagoptosis (or primary phagocytosis).
&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.

===Types of Cell Death===
1. Autophage: mediated by autophagic in which the cell is eating itself to cause its own death.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
2. Apoptosis: mediated by caspases and it is a program of cell death (PCD).&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; 
3. Necrosis: cell injuries causes cell death within high stress level of cell structures. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
4. Cornification: cell death due to conversion of proteins  &lt;br /&gt;
5. Shedding:cell death caused by replacement in cell structures. &lt;br /&gt;
6. Phagoptosis: cell death caused by phagocytosis with macrophages. &lt;br/&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Apoptosis&lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt; 
Apoptosis is sometime referred to as “programmed cell death.” It is when the cell relatively speaking commits suicide. It generally occurs in response to certain signals in the body It is better than necrosis because it follows a structured routine and is not random like necrosis. When a cell undergoes apoptosis, the protein caspases will be calld upon to break down the any cellular components necessary for survival. The enzyme DNases is also released to destroy any DNA in the nucleus of the cell, thus eliminating any existence of that cell in that area. Aside from the production of caspases and DNases, cells that goes through apoptosis will release a signal to macrophages telling them to clean up any remaining debris. The macrophages clean everything up giving no opportunity to the dead cell to damage nearby cells. &lt;br /&gt; 

Apoptosis is actually important to human development as it gives human the fingers and toes feature that human possesses. Originally the 10 fingers are all connected to a web-like feature, but apoptosis is what causes that web to be broken down and destroyed, leaving human with 10 fingers and toes instead of four web like hands and feet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.



'''&lt;u&gt;Necrosis&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt; 
Necrosis is when cells and tissues die randomly, meaning it is not programmed. It is caused by inflammation, injury, cancer, toxins, etc that may harm the body. The problem with necrosis is that when cells die they do not send signals to nearby phagocytes that order them to clean up the dead cell. Therefore it is harder for the body’s immune system to react and clean up the dead cell if it goes through necrosis, causing build up of dead tissue or cell debris a that location. Cells that goes through necrosis may also release harmful chemicals that may hurt or kill nearby cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''&lt;u&gt;Phagoptosis&lt;/u&gt;'''

Phagoptosis is a form of cell death when phagocytes is the primary cause of cell death, which is provoked by cells displaying “eat-me-signals” instead of “don’t eat me signals.” Initially the cell produces “find me signals,” that triggers chemotaxis of phagocytes. Upon arrival the cell will either produce “eat me signals” or “don’t eat me signals” and the will ultimately determine if the cell will live or die. The most abundant form of eat me signal is the phospholipid PS found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the cell. The eat me signal comes out of the cell as a result of calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase that causes the phospoholipid to shuffle the inner leaflet from the outer leaflet, exposing the eat-me-signal. There are different ways PS can be exposed onto the cell such as, calcium elevation, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, fusion of intracellular vesicles with plasma membrae, necrosis, and apoptosis. All of these can cause a cell to release PS signals and hence result in their removal by phagocytes. &lt;br /&gt;
A way a cell can protect itself from phagocytes is producing “don’t-eat-me-signals”. A type of “don’t-eat-me-signals” that a cell displays is CD47, CD200, etc. CD47 is the most abundant “don’t-eat-me-signal” expressed by a cell. Though if the “don’t-eat-me-signal” is disrupted then phagoptosis may occur. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.

=== Problems due to Cell Death===
Even though Phagoptosis support cell to shape development in cell structures, removes excess and defective cells, and protect cells from pathogens and other cancerous cells, over-excess process of Phagoptosis can cause diseases that might harm the cell replication, production and its natural cycle. Due to the malfunction and irregularity of cell death can lead to lack of important cells in our bodies. For example, excess PS exposure in brain cell structure can terminate not only old and phagocytic neurons but also important neurons that supports our brain cells. Neurons cells are phagocytised by Microglia (Microphage in brain cells) which is caused due to Inflammation Activation. Microglia can eat apoptic neurons to reduce debris or inflammation to help cell circulation and stay in good shape for brain cells&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.; However, it also can destroy viable neurons and neuronal processes which disintegrate the healthy process of cell, neurons in brain; thus, affecting other healthy brain cells and causing cerebral diseases or disorders like Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD). Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD) is heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the progranulin gene due to lack of neurons in brain cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;. It is caused when there is lack of neurons in brain cell due to excess activities of Phagocytosis by Microglia. Many neurons were phagocytised, so it caused inactivating mutation that malfunction the role of progranulin genes in DNA. This FTA disorder is also contributed to causes of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Cell Stress===
Cell Stress causes several difference responses including phagoptosis, but the response depends on the amount of cell stress present. The different responses include: adaptation, phagoptosis, apoptosis, and necrosis. These lowest stress level would cause adaptation and as the stress level rises the other responses follow accordingly.
[[File:Cell Stress|thumbnail|The cell has several different responses to cell stress. Different levels of stress cause different responses.]]

Numerous conditions may cause cell stress. Temperature shifts such as heat shock could cause proteins in the cell to denature. Heavy metals can change the conformation of the protein and therefore the function. Free radicals can cause proteins to be fragmented. Fragmentation of proteins render them ineffective. Solvents such as ethanol can cause translation errors. Cell stress response can be the upregulation of some genes and the downregulation of others. In essence, response to cell stress can either cause some proteins to be produced more and others to be produced less depending on the situation. Regulation of cell stress is different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes mainly due to codon differences. &lt;ref name=&quot;cell stress response&quot;&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2010/214074/ cell stress response], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-In-Cell Phenomena: Entosis and Cannibalism==
Cell-In-Cell phenomena is most likely seen in tumor cells, especially those are very strong and metastatic. Tumor cells can engulf immune cells which eventually kills tumor cells; On the other hand, tumor cells can also engulf other tumor cells for survival or protection from other harms. Some tumor cell can go through cannibalism process (Cell-In-Cell Phenomena) to protect themselves from immune cells; and Entosis process can happen to both tumor and normal cells. 



===Entosis===
Entosis is caused when tumor cell invade each other; it is caused when detached from Extracelluar Matrix. This Entosis process can cause either survival of the cells or death of invading cells by Lysosome Digestion. Entosis mostly happen in animal cells because animal cells are mostly attached to extracellular matrix for their survival. When some cells are detached from ECM (Extracellular Matrix), they lose the adhesion and cells start to push into their neighboring cells; thus, sometimes, Entosis is considered as interaction between two neighboring cells. Interestingly, cells which are locked due to the result of Entosis are alive and they can divide themselves inside another cells.  Entosis is also referred to &quot;cell-in-cell structures&quot; which indicates the loss of attachment from extracellular matrix. In other word, It is process by which tumor cells invade each other when detached from matrix and it is relatively common in malignant cancers. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.



===Cannibalism===
Cannibalism is caused when cells eating up each other for survival and protection due to damages or infection. For example, Wang ''et al'' found out some tumor cell can go proceed apoptic cell death. From the bodies of patients who have Huntington's disease, immortalised lymphoblasts phagocyotes are eating up each other to survive in tough condition or to replenish and protect themselves. However, whether restriction of phagocytosis will be able to avoid cell death in cell-in-cell phenomena is still questioned. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Brown GC, Neher JJ, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682109 “Eaten alive! Cell death by primary phagocytosis: 'phagoptosis'”], ‘[PubMed]’, 27 June 2012. Retrieved on October 28, 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Types of Signaling and Known Pathways==

What can cause a macrophage to consume a cell? Many intercellular interactions occur via chemical signaling; the cell displays certain compounds outside of the plasma membrane, to which other cells respond thanks to receptors on the exteriors of their plasma membranes. While some of these compounds invoke phagoptosis, others repulse it and it is the net amount of these &quot;eat me&quot; versus &quot;don't eat me&quot; signals that determine the final fate of the cell. Three main compounds have been proposed to signal macrophages to engulf a cell, each with its own signaling pathway that causes the compound to be expressed or suppressed on the plasma membrane.


===Attractive Signals===


1. PS (phosphidatylserine)—normally suppressed by an ATP-operated inhibitor called aminophospholipid translocase, which actively pumps PS to the inner membrane of the cell, PS has been shown to, under certain circumstances, lead to phagocytosis of so-called “activated” T cells. PS binds to the receptor Tim-4 on phagocytes, which signals the phagocyte to engulf the cell. If there is no ATP to run the translocase or if there is an overabundance of free calcium in the cytoplasm, the translocase stops running, and another membrane protein called scramblase randomizes the exposure of PS in the cell membrane, potentially exposing it to free phagocytes for endocytosis. This process can happen even in healthy cells.PS exposure can also occur due to oxidative stress which activates the scramblase and prevents translocase. Another result of PS exposure is when the intracellular vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane.

In summary, there are 5 ways that the PS “eat me” signal can be exposed: elevation in calcium levels, lack of ATP, oxidative stress (which activates scramblase and stops translocase), fusion of intracellular vesicles with plasma membrane, necrosis, or apoptosis. Another requirement for phagocytosis to be carried out is the presence of macrophages that are capable of attaching to PS. 

In order for macrophages to recognize PS, different receptors must be activated. Resting macrophages express the following PS receptors: Tim4, stabilin-1, stabilin-2, and BAI1. On the other hand, macrophages that are activated express the protein MFG-E8 and its receptor, vitronectin, in addition to the MerTK receptor. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that PS exposure does not always equate to cell death; the cell type and surrounding conditions also plays a role. For example, when purified PS is added to 3 different cell lines, the viable cells show an elevation of PS on their surfaces. This stimulated phagocytosis as expected, but as soon as the PS was “internalised”, phagocytosis was inhibited. In other cases such as that of lymphoma cells, PS exposure is not enough to even initiate phagocytosis because either the cells also expressed “don’t eat me” signals or they required another signal to co-stimulate phagocytosis. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;
[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000412000709#], An article proposing the coining of the new term &quot;phagoptosis&quot; as an intentional cell reaction to stress and a natural homeostatic process.&lt;/ref&gt; However, PS exposure on viable cells can be reversed. When neutrophils are activated they have galectins that induce PS on the surface of the cell. If the galectin is removed before the macrophages detect it, then phagoptosis will not occur.



2. CRT (cell-surface calreticulin)—CRT is abundant in cells, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Its transport to the exterior of the cell (exocytosis) can cause it to behave as an attractive signal to phagocytes, which have the CRT receptor LRP (lipoprotein receptor-related protein).  Rather than actively displaying CRT as a self-destructive signal, a stressed cell will decrease the repulsive chemical signal CD47 (discussed in the subsequent section), after which a phagocyte will become attracted to excess CRT on the external surface of the target cell. This is an especially prevalent mechanism in cancer cells, which actively attempt to display the CD47 signal. Cancer cells require strong exposure of &quot;don't-eat-me&quot; signals in order to prevent phagoptosis. While CRT is tied to the surface of a cell, it can also send signals to bind proteins, PS, or C1q on target cells. This will stimulate phagocytosis through the LRP, which is on the phagocyte.

An “eat me” signal similar to CRT is thrombospondin 1 (TSP). Like CRT, TSP1 activates phagocytosis with the use of lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) on the phagocyte. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;


3. MFG-E8 (milk fat globule EFG-like factor-8)—This chemical signal binds to the phagocytotic initiator MerTK (Mer tyrosine kinase) on the phagocyte with the help of several connecting or “bridging” compounds, including Gas-6, protein S, galectin-3, tubby and Tulp 1. These can interact with PS and other receptor proteins in complicated pathways to induce phagocytosis on white blood cells called neutrophils.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Repulsive Signals===


In addition to these attractive signals, there are repulsive signals that cells can display to actively prevent phagocytosis. While the attractive signals may be displayed as a result of cellular stress, repulsive signals are altogether more specific. Some repulsive signals include:

1. CD47 (Cluster of Differentiation 47: CD47 is the inhibitory membrane protein expressed on the surface of the majority of cells. It binds to signal-regulatory proteinα (SIRP-α) on the phagocyte. Examples of cells that use this protein as a 'don't eat me' signal include erythrocytes (red blood cells), cancer cells, and platelets, T-cells. In clinical studies performed on mice with cancerous growths, it has been found that blocking of this protein results both reduction of tumor size and spread throughout the body as a result of phagocytosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Williams, Sarah C.P. [http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/03/one-drug-to-shrink-all-tumors.html &quot;One Drug to Shrink All Tumors&quot;], '[AAAS]', 26 March 2012. Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;


2. Sialic-Acid Derivatives: These react with a variety of receptors, such as cofactors to prevent phagocytosis. Modifications of sialic-acid on cell surfaces can stop C3b and C1q from binding and signaling nearby macrophages. Sialic acid can be removed from the cell surface by implementing neuraminidase and doing so can induce phagocytosis. Siglec-11, a receptor on brain microphages (microglia), can prevent inflammation and phagocytosis of neurons by binding to their surface. However, Siglec-11 requires polysialylated proteins to be present on the cell surface. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;


3. PAI-1: PAI-1 (or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) is another major repulsive signal in cells. Neutrophil cells are an example of a cell type that mainly uses PAI-1 as its repulsive signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;


4. CD200 (Cluster of Differentiation 200): This is a protein expressed on the membrane of certain cells. In the case of myeloid cells, it can prevent phagocytosis by releasing an inhibitory signal.&lt;ref&gt;Carclay AN, Wright GJ, Brooke G, Brown MH [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12072366 &quot;CD200 and membrane protein interactions in the control of myeloid cells&quot;], '[NCBI]', 23 June 2002. Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===How Attractive and Repulsive signals Work Together===

1.  However, it is important to note that the display of an “eat me” signal alone may not be sufficient to induce phagocytosis. Despite having “eat me” signals on its surface, a cell may not be attacked by phagocytes because it also displays “don’t eat me” signals. The proportion of “eat me” signals such as PS to “don’t eat me” signals such as CD47 plays a major role in determining how the cell will be recognized by macrophages. Furthermore, the type of cell as well as its environment also influences the degree of influence that signals monitoring cell death will have. Multiple cell types require a cooperative protein or PS oxidation to undergo phagocytosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

==Phagoptosis in Model Organisms==

Much of the information about cell death has been obtained from model organisms, such as ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' (a species of transparent nematode) and ''Drosophila melanogaster'' (a species of fly commonly used in laboratories).&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Phagocytosis in Development===

[[File:Adult Caenorhabditis elegans.jpg|thumbnail|right|Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode around 1mm in length.]]
In ''C. elegans'' it has been found that a combination of loss-of-function mutants in ''ced-1'' as well as in ''ced-3'' (two transmembrace receptors in ''C.elegans'')&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Z, Hartwieg E, Horvitz HR. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11163239 &quot;CED-1 is a transmembrane receptor that mediates cell corpse engulfment in C. elegans.&quot;], '[NCBI]', 12 January 2001. Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; led to reduced apoptosis as well as reduced phagocytosis, indicating that both are important factors in programmed cell death during development of the species. This also prevented some death from mutation and toxins. From this it was concluded that light stress on the cell (such as weak activation of caspase, which is involved in apoptosis) is not enough to cause a cell to die, but in conjunction with PS exposure could cause phagoptosis. By removing the srgp-1 gene, which prevents phagocytosis of PS-exposed cells, it was found that rates of phagocytosis in normally apoptotic cells and other stressed cells increased. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|409.5x212px|thumbnail|right|Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fly often used for genetic testing.]]





In ''D. melanogaster'', developmental cell death is caused by 3 proteins: Hid (head involution defective), Rpr (Reaper), and Grim. All of these induce apoptosis of the cell by binding to the caspase inhibitor DIAP1. This leaves developmental phagocytosis intact, which seemed to remove most of the cells normally lost in development. This indicates that while apoptosis might not be essential for development of ''D. melanogaster'', phagocytosis might be. One of the mechanisms through which phagoptosis occurs in ''D. melanogaster'' is the ER protein pretaporter, which is expressed externally on the surface of cells. There is also competition between cells of different genotypes within ''D. melanogaster'' through induced phagoptosis of surrounding cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;





==Turnover of Cells Due to Phagoptosis==
Phagoptosis is one of the main forms of cell death, causing turnovers of erythrocytes, neutrophils, T-cells and many other cells &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;.

===Erythrocytes===
Erythrocytes are red blood cells. The highest rate of cell death in the body is caused erythrophagocytosis, the cell destruction of red blood cells. Two million red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are produced every second in the human body. They live for about 120 days and then are destroyed by macrophages in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow in such a way that equals its rate of production. Instead of undergoing apoptosis, red blood cells display “eat me” signals such as PS. A loss of CD47 “don’t eat me” signals in old red blood cells is enough to cause rapid phagocytosis.

Older erythrocytes tend to get phagocytized more because they contain more &quot;eat-me&quot; signals such as PS, phosphidatylserine. When PS is exposed on the cell’s surface, a macrophage senses this and phagocytizes the red blood cells. This can be reversed by other signals such as CD47 on the cell’s surface, binding to the macrophage’s SIRPα receptors. As erythrocytes become older, they lose CD47 signal, causing phagocytosis of erythrocytes. It was found that older erythrocytes live longer when there were depletion of macrophages, which concludes that phagoptosis was the reason for red blood cell's turnover. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

*The phagocytosis of red blood cells is mediated by “eat me” signals such as PS as well as “don’t eat me” signals such as CD47. Erythrocytes are particularly excellent for studying the regulation of phagocytosis because they are destroyed at the same rate they are produced, giving them the highest rate of cell death in the human body.  Every second, about 2 million red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. Each cell has a life span of approximately 120 days. As erythrocytes get older, they begin to display more “eat me” signals and fewer “don’t eat me” signals on their surface. Signals that prevent phagocytosis such as CD47 act on the SIRPa receptors of macrophages, preventing them from attacking viable erythrocytes. Having more “don’t eat me” signals or having fewer macrophages will prolong the survival of older erythrocytes. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Neutrophils===
Neutrophils, which are the most plentiful type of white blood cell, are quite different in comparison to erythrocytes. Like red blood cells, neutrophils are also produced in bone marrow and destroyed in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. They are created at a rate of 0.5-1 million per second in humans, with a lifespan of about 5 days. What’s peculiar about these white blood cells is that the younger cells are just as susceptible to phagocytosis as the older cells. When isolated, neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptotic cell death. For neutrophils, the protein PAI-1 is a “don’t eat me” signal. When PAI-1 is blocked, CRT becomes the main “eat me” signal. Neutrophils are the only leukocytes to expose CRT without the need of a stimulus, which would explain their fast renewal rate in the body. They also have the ability to eat activated platelets and small cells such as bacteria.  

Also, phagocytosis is not the only cause of turnovers in neutrophils like it is for erythrocytes; instead spontaneous apoptosis occurs when neutrophils are isolated. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

When CRT is expressed on neutrophil’s surface, it signals the drive of phagocytosis by macrophages. In contrast, PAI-1 expresses the signal that prohibits phagocytosis, but depletion of this signal causes increasing chance of it being phagocytized. This can be reversed by adding PAI-1 proteins that binds to the white blood cell’s surface, barring phagoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

Neutrophils can also act as phagocytes, but only devouring smaller bacterias.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; 

Like erythrocytes, neutrophils are also made in the bone marrow. However, neutrophils only have a lifespan of 5 days before they are phagocytised. Another noteworthy difference between neutrophils and erythrocytes is that unlike for an erythrocyte, the phagocytosis of a neutrophil is not concurrent with its age. “Younger neutrophils are just as likely to be phagocytised as older neutrophils. (p. 328)” The protein PAI-1 acts as the primary signal preventing phagocytosis on neutrophils. When this “don’t eat me” signal is removed, viable neutrophils are attacked by macrophages. Like PS, the PAI-1 protein also exhibits reversible binding. Adding the protein back to the surface of neutrophils will decrease their rate of phagocytosis.  The phagocytosis of neutrophils is also influenced by antibodies that block PAI-1. When PAI-1 is blocked, the “eat me” signal CRT can induce phagocytosis of neutrophils that are still viable leading to a decreased immune response.  Although CRT acts as the primary eat me signal on neutrophils, neutrophils can also be stimulated to bring PS to their surface, encouraging attack by surrounding macrophages. The phagocytosis of red blood cells is mediated by “eat me” signals such as PS as well as “don’t eat me” signals such as CD47. Erythrocytes are particularly excellent for studying the regulation of phagocytosis because they are destroyed at the same rate they are produced, giving them the highest rate of cell death in the human body.  Every second, about 2 million red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. Each cell has a life span of approximately 120 days. As erythrocytes get older, they begin to display more “eat me” signals and fewer “don’t eat me” signals on their surface. Signals that prevent phagocytosis such as CD47 act on the SIRPa receptors of macrophages, preventing them from attacking viable erythrocytes. Having more “don’t eat me” signals or having fewer macrophages will prolong the survival of older erythrocytes. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===T-Cells===
T-Cells play an active role in adaptive immunity. These cells activate themselves by attaching to part of antigens and proliferate to leave memory T-cells for secondary immune responses. The activation of T-cells leads to PS exposure and recognition by the Tim-4 receptor, which leads to phagocytosis; thus, carrying out its role to destroy the body's foreign invaders. The Tim-4 receptors on phagocytes are blocked when antigens are introduced during immunization or during infection with influenza virus. This decreases the production of antigen-specific T cells which in return will increase immune responses to those antigens. Similar to erythrocytes, neutrophils, platelets, the turn over of T-cells is regulated by the CD47 signal. Once the T-cell loses that signal, it will be devoured by macrophages. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;

===Hemophagocytosis===
Phagoptosis has been linked to multiple inflammatory and immune disorders, where viable blood cells are attacked by macrophages. A reduction in red or white blood cell count is known as cytopenia. Individuals with cytopenia often have compromised immune systems and are vulnerable to infection. Inflammation can induce the increased phagocytosis of red blood cells by causing these cells to display “eat me” markers, primarily PS, on their surface. Inflammation also increases the capability of macrophages to target red blood cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;  Hemophagocytosis is difficult to treat because inflammation plays a vital role in the immune response by isolating foreign substances which may potentially be harmful so they can be destroyed by phagocytes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000821.htm &quot;Immune response&quot;], '[Medicine Plus]', Retrieved on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opportunities for Future Research==

There is still much research to be done with phagoptosis, but early experiments indicate that certain instances of cell death such as erythrocytosis, neutrophil “cannibalism,” and unnatural neurodegeneration, which were once attributed to apoptosis, may be the result of this more complicated process. Further research may be able to illicit specific solutions to problems that apoptosis models could not adequately describe, which in turn, could provide an opportunity to develop new treatments for degenerative diseases.

===Neurodegeneration===

While there are many different health problems that arise with unnecessary phagoptosis, one of the most serious of these comes from loss of neurons in the brain. This is particularly harmful because neurons are not able to be regenerated. Therefore, permanent damage may result from microglia, the macrophage in the brain responsible for consumption of neurons among other tasks, engulfing any neuron that exposes inflammation, whether or not that neuron is viable. It has been recently discovered that a major cause of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is linked to inactivation of the progranulin gene which inhibits phagocytosis. This suggests that Parkinson's disease, Alzheimers, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be controlled by phagocytosis control in the brain. Controlling phagocytosis in the brain can be done, for example via PS blocking, which should stop all loss of viable neurons without having to inhibit inflammation.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; 

Although there are problems with unnecessary phagoptosis in the brain, phagoptosis can also be potentially beneficial in the brain as well. Microglia, or brain macrophages, can also devour apoptotic neurons (neurons which have been programmed to die), reducing the debris and inflammation. There are some cases where the microglia's ability have been impaired due to inflammation, which impairs its ability to classify which neuron to devour, mistaking viable neurons for apoptotic neurons during phagocytosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.jimmunol.org/content/185/10/6317t]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phagoptosis performs many beneficial functions in the body including defense against harmful pathogens and regulation of the inflammatory response. However, recent studies indicate that it may be a primary culprit of diseases associated with frontotemporal degeneration. FTD is caused by phagoptosis of viable neurons, which is normally prevented by a protein known as progranulin which regulates phagoptosis in the brain. Mutations in the gene that codes for progranulin are associated with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt; 
===Cancer Research===

It has been discovered that cancer cells contain high quantities of exposed CD47 protein which contributes to their low rate of consumption by macrophages. Potential research may find inhibitors or antibodies against CD47 that may help induce natural death of cancer cells. For example, in leukaemic cells, it has been discovered that the addition of CD47 antibodies is enough to eradicate several types of leukemia from model organisms such as mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several applications are examined to illustrate the idea of phagoptosis:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Example !! Eat me signal!! Don't eat me signal
|-
| C elegan || &quot;PS exposure: reversed by ATP-dependent translocase tat-1, disruption of tat-1 exposes PS 
on surface of viale cell induce phagocytosis. PS exposure Downregulated by srgp-1&quot;
 || 
|-
| Drosophila || Death induced by Hid, Rpr and Grim protein, bind to DIAP1, adtivate caspases to induce apoptosis. Knockout of IAP of DIAP1 prevent apoptosis, but doesn't affect phagocytosis--apoptosis not required for Drosophila,while phagocytosis required. Pretaproter act as eat me signal || 
|-
| &quot;
Erythrocytes red blood cells&quot;
 || no apoptosis, old erythrocytes phagocytosed by &quot;eat me signal&quot; PS and altered Band 3 transporter.
 || Phagocytosis inhibited by CD 47 on erthroyte surface, acts on macrophage SIRP receptor. Expression of CD47 reduce in old eryghrocytes--promote phagocytosis. Knockdown of PS-receotors stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 block phagocytosis
|-
| Neutrophils (white blood cell)  || &quot;phagocytes by spleen, liver and bone marrow. Young neutropils are as likely to be phagocytised neutrophils undergeo spontaneous apoptosis when isolated (contrast to Erythrocytes)neutrophil turnover is independent of apoptosis(similar to erythrocytes)&quot;&quot;eat me&quot;&quot; signal: CRT (via LRP) when PAI1/CD47 blocked Uniqueness: exposeCRT constitutively--turnover depleted by CD47-blocking antibodies&quot;&quot;eat me&quot;&quot; signal: oxidised PS and lyso-PS&quot;
 || &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal: PAI-1 on neutrophils, PAI-1 can inhibit interaction between CRT and LRP&quot;

|-
| Platelets || platetes are phagocytosed by neutrophils cayse downregulating blood clotting via phago || Don't eat me signal: CD47.CD47 expression on platelets, such that platets lacking CD47 are rapidly cleared
|-
| T cells || Antigen recognition causes PS exposure on surface of activated T cells. T cell surface PS is recognized by PS receptor Tim-4, mediating phagoptosis. During immunisation with antigen blocking Tim-4 on phagocytes, increase subsequent immune responses to those antigen.  expressing Tim-4 in phagocytes decrease # of T cells || &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal: CD47 regulate T cell turnover. Bax/Bak double knockout mice, can't perform apoptosis, have large expansion of T and B cell, so apoptosis contributes to turnover.
|-
| Hemophagocytosis entosis and cell cannibalism || found in infectious and inflammatory disorder activatedmacrophage engulf viable blood cells inflammation increase both phagocytic capacity of macrophage and PS exposure of leukocytes, so inflammation induced hemophagocytosis and cytopenia. || 
|-
| Neurons and inflammatory neurodegeneration || viable neurons are phagocytised by microglia in brain. Inflammatory activation caused the microglia to become highly phagocytic and release phagocytic adaptorprotein MFG-E8, which induce reversible PS exposure on neurons and lead to neuronal phagocytosis.blocking exposed PS, MFG-E8 prevent neuronal loss without inhibiting inflammation.  Inflammation in brain causemicroglia to eat viable neurons, can be prevented by blocking phagocytic signaling. microglia can spontaneously phagocytise viableneurons, which increase by removal of surface sialic acid residue || Progranulin inhibit phagocytosis of apoptotic and PS-exposed cells in vivo, so neuronal loss in FTD is caused by phagoptosis that progranulin normally suppresses
|-
| Cancer || Cancer can be limited by antibody and complement-dependent phagocytosis of cancer cells, or by induction of &quot;eat me&quot; signals by macrophage and T cells. &quot;eat me&quot; signal is CRT: drive phagoptosis one CD47 is neutralised. || cancer cell overexpress &quot;don't eat me&quot; signal CD47 antibodies against CD47 induce phagocytosis of leukaemic cells by macrophage--completely clear leukaemia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Long non-coding RNAs, also known as lncRNAs, are similar in structure to mRNAs. However, lncRNAs are unique in that they do not function in any protein-coding. Chemical probing and structural studies have been methods to understand the structures of several IncRNAs, this includes the structure of the ribsome [1]. Other research that applies to IncRNAs is the approach to measure the secondary structure of RNA. Furthermore, as the name suggests, lncRNAs are long (or large) transcripts produced by mammalian genomes. 

==History==
Before many advances in technology that enabled the present day’s depth of research on RNA molecules, lncRNAs were discovered and characterized. Initially, these molecules were thought to function similarly to other RNA, coding for proteins. However, subsequent data from experiments showed that lncRNAs lacked open-reading frames (ORF), which proved that these transcriptions could not possibly code for proteins. 

Even though it has been determined that lncRNAs do not participate in protein synthesis, the question still remains as to what are the functions of these transcriptions. Although the significant mysteries of lncRNA mechanisms remain unanswered, according to Moran, Perera and Khalil’s paper, “numerous publications in the past several years have now documented important functions for lncRNAs, affecting many biological processes, including regulation of gene expression, dosage compensation, genomic imprinting , nuclear organization and compartmentalization, and nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;&gt;Khalil, Ahmad M., Victoria A. Moran, Ranjan J. Perera. &quot;Emerging Functional and Mechanistic Paradigms of Mammalian Long Non-Coding RNAs.&quot; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3413108/. 5 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional Long Non-Coding RNAs Present in Mammals==
Long non-coding RNAs fall into three categories: intronic long-non coding RNAs, natural antisense transcripts, and long intervening non-coding RNAs. Although it is confirmed that the human and other mammalian genomes produce these various types of lncRNAs, it is yet to be discovered precisely the roles of these molecules in biological processes, nor their mechanisms of action. Such topics are still left to debate in many various hypotheses.

===Intronic Long Non-Coding RNAs (Intronic lncRNAs)===
As the name suggests, intronic long non-coding RNAs (intronic lncRNAs), are expressed only from the introns of protein coding genes.

===Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATS)===
Natural antisense transcripts, abbreviated as NATs, are transcripts that overlap with protein-coding genes and are transcribed in the antisense direction. These molecules were discovered in the early 2000s, when over 11,000 lncRNAs were identified in a mouse. After further inspection, it was determined that a significant amount of these lncRNAs were NATs. Moran, Perera and Khalil write that in a different study, it was found that “40% of protein-coding genes in human cells also express NATs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt;
NATs have been studied throughout the past decade, and research demonstrated that NATs have a specific function: they regulate the protein-coding genes with which they overlap. 

===Long Intervening Non-Coding RNAs (lincRNAs)===
Recently, lncRNAs have been expressed in the “intergenic” regions of the genome, or stretches of DNA that have few or no genes. These lncRNAs have been named long intervening non-coding RNAs, or lincRNAs. 

Before RNA sequencing technologies, researchers utilized the known fact that “actively transcribed protein-coding genes typically display a specific histone modification pattern” and were then able to isolate lincRNAs. These results showed that both human and mice genomes create over 3300 lincRNAs. RNA sequencing technology confirmed these results, exposing many more lincRNAs. Presently, it is projected that human DNA as a whole produces over 8000 lincRNA, over half of which are considered to be “high confidence lincRNAs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt; These high confidence lincRNA are located in various regions of the cell, both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and are believed to potentially play roles in cell identity.

==Known Functions of Long Non-Coding RNAs==
Even though only a small proportion of lncRNAs have been examined through experiments, the emerging result is that these molecules participate in many biological contexts. 

===Regulation of Gene Expression===
Although gene regulation typically requires many different factors due to its complexitry, recent studies reveal that lncRNAs contribute to gene regulation by various mechanisms. 

A known, well-studied lncRNA called Xist is an example of these gene-regulating lncRNAs. Xist is responsible for the initiation and spreading of the inactivation of X chromosomes in female somatic cells. Although Xist’s specific mechanism in achieving this function is unknown, it is accepted throughout the scientific community that Xist is required to inhibit hundreds of genes on the inactive X chromosome.

Another process that lncRNAs participate in to regulate gene expression is called genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting requires very tight regulation, mainly because the expression of imprinted genes play critical roles on mammalian development, and the level of expression between the two alleles of an imprinted gene can vary greatly from one gene to another. A considerable amount of lncRNAs, alongside mRNAs, actively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes ''in cis''. “Air,” one of these gene expression regulatory lncRNAs, silences three imprinted genes in cis by localizing to chromatin.

Genes can also be regulated by lncRNAs in trans. One such lncRNA called HOTAIR, which is actually a lincRNA, regulates human HOXD genes expression ''in trans''. 

===Maintenance of Pluripotency===
Pluripotency is the ability of a stem cell to give rise to the three germ layers: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. 

Although previous studies expressed that there are key transcription and chromatin factors that are required to maintain pluripotency, it has also been discovered that some of these transcription factors bind to the promoters of many lincRNAs in mice. Another study also indicated that two specific lincRNAs are required to maintain pluripotency as well. 

In-depth research focused on the role of lincRNAs in pluripotency maintenance; this lead to a specific study that demonstrated that 26 lincRNAs are required for pluripotency maintenance. Each of these lincRNAs was determined to lead to “either an exit from the pluripotent state or activation of lineage commitment programs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that lincRNAs act as sensors, sensing the environment of the stem cell and alerting the stem cell to remain pluripotency or to change according to alterations in the environment.

===Nuclear Organization: Formation of Paraspeckles===
The regulation of gene expression takes place at multiple levels, such as before, during or after transcription, or during translation. Recently, nuclear structures called paraspeckles are suggested to be participants in gene regulation after transcription has taken place. However, paraspeckles have been observed to be dynamic structures that are absent at certain stages during development. The fact that the appearance of paraspeckles coincide with the activation of a lncRNA called nuclear-enriched autosomal transcript 1, or NEAT1, is evidence that supports the conclusion that NEAT1 is a required molecule for the formation of paraspeckles. Furthermore, the depletion of NEAT1 causes the subsequent loss of paraspeckles in the nucleus; likewise, the overexpression of NEAT1 leads to an increase in paraspeckles. Such observations have suggested the essential role of NEAT1 in paraspeckle formation and maintanence in the nucleus.

===Regulation of Alternative Splicing===
Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs leads to proteomic complexity due to its production of several protein products with different functions from a single mRNA. A lncRNA called metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, or MALAT1, is identified as having an important role in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. This is supported by the fact that MALAT1 localizes to nuclear speckles, which actually contain several proteins associated with alternative splicing. In particular, MALAT1 regulates the phosphorylation of specific proteins that are involved in the regulation and splicing sites of pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, it has been proven that the depletion of MALAT1 affects patterns in alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. However, despite the discovery of MALAT1, it has yet to be determined if other lncRNAs participate in the regulation of alternative splicing. 

==How Long Non-Coding RNAs Exert Their Effects==
Although researchers have yet to discover all there is to know about the detailed mechanisms of action for lncRNAs, there are several mechanisms by which lncRNA exert their effects which can be explained.

===Long Non-Coding RNAs as Guides for Chromatin-Modifying Complexes===
Although chromatin-modifying complexes and DNA methytransferases function by enzymatically modifying chromatin and DNA to activate and repress genes, the question as to how these enzymes, without DNA binding capacity, recognized their target genes. It has recently been suggested that some lncRNAs act as guides for chromatin-modifying complexes and other nuclear proteins to specific locations so that these molecules can exert their respective effects. 

Both the lncRNAs HOTAIR and Air target and direct chromatin-modifying complexes to their target genes; the only difference between both of these lncRNAs is that HOTAIR binds ''in trans'', whereas Air binds ''in cis'' [[#Regulation of Gene Expression|(this is concurrent with their gene-regulating functions, which are mentioned in the 
“Regulation of Gene Expression” section)]]. Recent evidence illustrates that in this process, the lncRNA binds to chromatin first, and then serves as “docking station” for chromatin-modifying complexes.

===Long Non-Coding RNAs as Structural Links in Ribonucleoprotein Complexes===
Although the specific molecular composition of most ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) that surround RNAs in the cell has yet to be established, studies have expressed that lncRNAs exist in the cell as RNPs. For example, the lncRNA Xist has been shown to interact with a specific transcription factor which aids in connecting Xist to the inactive chromosome; Xist forms a molecular bridge of sorts to connect this transcription factor and a chromatin-modifying complex in order to repress genes on the inactive chromosome. 

Other lncRNAs, such as NEAT1 and MALAT1, form molecular scaffolds for several proteins. In doing so, they can regulate the functions of these proteins. However, it is not known as to how these lncRNAs recognize their respective proteins and commence the formation of these molecular scaffolds in the nucleus.

===Long Non-Coding RNAs as Regulators for Distinct Transcriptional Programs===
Several lncRNAs have been shown to respond to specific stimuli in the cell environment. Consequently, they are triggered to activate specific transcriptional programs that allow for cell response to these stimuli. In certain cases, lncRNAs act as negative regulators. For example, the lncRNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) serves as a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which are a specific class of nuclear receptors. When activated, GAS5 interacts with the GRs, inhibiting this class of nuclear receptors from binding to their specific DNA response elements and carrying out their function. Thus, lncRNAs act as modulators of the effects a transcription factor can lead in changes in gene expression, as well as the cell’s ability to respond to stimuli from the cell’s environment.

==Potential Roles of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Human Disease==
Although only a few lncRNAs have been linked to human disease, recently, in some cases, scientists have observed strong associations between lncRNAs and human disease. According to Moran, Perera and Khalil’s paper, “lncRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in a wide range of human diseases and disorders, including various types of cancers.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalil&quot;/&gt; Even though the mechanisms of most lncRNAs have not been fully discovered in its entirety, several studies have begun to bring clues as to the mechanisms of few lncRNAs. In the article &quot;Genome Regulation by Long Noncoding RNAs.&quot; Rinn and Chang mention about the alteration of IncRNAs in human cancers, &quot;Dozens of lncRNAs have been documented to have altered expression in human cancers and are regulated by specific oncogenic and tumor-suppressor pathways, such as p53, MYC, and NF-κB recently described a class of lncRNAs that show periodic expression during the human cell cycle, and many of these are dysregulated in expression in human cancer samples.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Rinn&quot;&gt;Rinn, John L., and Howard Y. Chang. &quot;Genome Regulation by Long Noncoding RNAs.&quot; National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cancer has been the disease most studied and researched and it leaves the possibility that IncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of many other diseases. In future studies, it is necessary to study potential IncRNA transcripts in regions that do not contain protein-coding genes since this are strongly associated with human diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oxycodone is a type of analgesic, oral medication used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It was developed in Germany in the year 1916 as an attempt to improve on the existing opioids, drugs derived and used by opium poppy for therapeutic benefits. A few common examples of compounding are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and oxycodone with acetaminophen. Numerous brand names include OxyContin, a Purdue Pharma brand for the time-release oral oxycodone variation, Roxycodone, and Xanodyne. 
[[File:Roxycodone 30mg.jpg|thumb|Xanodyne pharmaceutical 30mg Roxicodone immediate release tablet]]

==Prescribed Usages==
Oxycodone is mainly used to alleviate moderate to severe pain, as well as managing acute chronic pain. It can also be used an alternative to severe diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome when commonly prescribed drugs do not work effectively. Oxycodone causes less sedation, respiratory distress, pruritus, and nausea than morphine, therefore making it easier for the body to tolerate it than morphine. If oxycodone is taken as a combination product, make sure to read all information about the ingredients and to ask your doctor and pharmacist for more information for safe usage. 

==Adverse Effects==
The most common negative side effects reported are disturbing nightmares, memory loss, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, mood changes, flushing, lightheadedness, headaches, dry mouth, itching, heavy sweating, anxiety, and diminished vision. A few patients have experienced abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, urine retion, dyspriea, and impotence. Overdose effects include shallow breathing, clammy skin, hypotension, miosis, respiratory arrest, and death. 
[[File:Side effects of Oxycodone.png|thumb|right|Main [[adverse effect|side effects]] of oxycodone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|title=Oxycodone|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, MedlinePlus|date=2009-03-23|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682132.html|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Dosage and Administration==
Oxycodone comes in a variety of forms: as a solution (including concentrated), a tablet, capsule, and long-acting/extended-release. The previous list of oxycodone forms are usually taken with or without food every 4 to 6 hours, depending if the medication is needed for temporary pain or as a regularly scheduled form of medication Always follow the directions on the prescription label and ask a doctor or pharmacist to explain any information that you do not fully understand. 

As mentioned before, it can be taken orally or intranasally using intravenous injections or rectally. 60-87% of all Oxycodone usage are through oral administration, with the rest remaining Compared to morphine, it can be 1.5 to 2 times as potent when taken orally. Because of its potency, a doctor will likely start a patient on a low dosage and increase it over time if the pain is not managed. The body can grow accustomed to the medication, and when that occurs the doctor may need to increase the dose.

This medication can be habit-forming, and consequently a patient must not take a larger dose. A patient also cannot take oxycodone more often than prescribed or take it for a longer period of time than recommended by his doctor.  Do not stop taking the medication abruptly; you may experience symptoms of withdrawal. 

==Withdrawal==
When a patient suddenly discontinues the medication, he may experience symptoms such as anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, muscle pain, nausea, fevers, flu-like symptoms (runny noses, sneezing, chills, watery eyes, etc.) and muscle weakness. When withdrawal occurs, the doctor usually decreases the dosage gradually. Most cases of severe withdrawals are associated with those addicted and using Oxycodone illegally. The experience of withdrawals from Oxycodone are unique to each individual due to the differences in metabolism etc. Therefore even with the same amount of dosage, one person might experience a withdrawal much worse than the next man. Withdrawal effects can be diminished by proper detox procedures. &lt;ref name=&quot;oxycodone&quot;&gt;[http://www.novusdetox.com/oxycodone-withdrawal-symptoms.php oxycodone], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Druge Abuse==
Oxycodone is a powerful drug used by young teens as well as adults. The drug puts users on a advantage high. Since it is a relief medication, it provides users with a calm relief feeling for a few hours as it enters their bloodstream. The tolerance of taking the drug becomes increasingly higher as users ingest the drug more often. As addiction becomes imminent, certain side effect may come into play and also ruin the social life of drug abusers. Some of the effects addiction leads to are: constantly thinking about oxycodone, obtaining numerous amounts of the drug, taking the drug secretly in order to hide it from others from knowing, lying to loved ones, and feeling pain and restless thoughts during nights of sleep. And because oxycodone contains acetaminophen, taking high doses of the drug can lead to liver problems in the future and sometimes even death.

==Special Precautions==
Oxycodone is a sensitive and potent medication, and consequently have a few precautions before taking it. Inform your doctor and pharmacist: 
*If you are allergic to certain medications such as codeine, hycodan, and any other medications 
*If you are taking other medications (including vitamin or nutritional supplements) you are taking or plan to take.
*If you have or ever have had asthma, lung disease, or paralytic ileus
*If you continue to drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol and if you have used any street drugs (including overdosing on a medication)
*If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding
*If you are about to have surgery (including dental work)

==Brand Names==
Oxycodone also go under the name of:
*Dazidox 
*Endocodone
*Oxy IR 
*ETH-Oxydose
*Oxyfast
*Roxicodone
*Oxycontin
*Oxexta

'''Introduction:''' 

Cardiolipin, the signature phospholipid of mitochondria, is a lipid dimer. The structure consists of two phosphatidyl groups bridged by a glycerol. The four acyl chains distinguish it from typical phospholipids which have two acyl chains. It is synthesized in the inner membrane of the mitochondria complex. In contrast with other phospholipids, cardiolipin remains firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes.

'''Synthesis:'''

In eukaryotic cells, cardiolipin synthesis takes places in the mitochondrion. Key steps such as the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylglycerolphosphate and the initiation of the cardiolipin remodeling cascade were identified to be linked with enzymatic activity. The biosynthesis begins with phospahtidylglycerolphosphate synthase (Pgs1) catylyzing the first step of the reaction producing phosphatidylglycerolphophate (PGP) from the condensation of cytidine 5'diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). PGP is then dephosphorylated to phosphatidylglycerol (PG)by a phosphatase identified as Gep4 and PTPMT1. Gep4 was identified in yeast for genetic interactors of prohibitins. PTPMT1 was discovered in mice. Next, cardiolipin synthase forms an immature cardiolipin from PG and CDP-DAG characterized by a random assortment of attached acyl chains that vary in length. The final phase of cardiolipid synthesis is acyl chain remodeling defined by the symmetric incorporation of unsaturated longer fatty acyl chains. The remodeling is initiated by a phospholipase specific to the organism. In yeast, the phospholipase is cardiolipin deacylase (Cld1) and in mammals the calcium-independent iPLA2γ. The phopholipase removes an acyl chain from the immature cardiolipin generating the intermediate, monolysocardiolipin (MLCL). The regeneration of cardiolipin from MLCL involves three different enzymes, tafazzin (Taz1), monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 (MLCLAT1), and acyl-Coa:lysocardiollipin acyltransferase-1 (ALCAT1). MLCLAT1 and ALCAT1 utilize acyl-CoA as an acyl chain donor for the reacylation of MLCL. Taz1 is a transacylase that takes an acyl chain from another phospholipid, preferably phosphatidylcholine (PC) and adds it to MLCL. Each of these remodeling enzymes resides in a specific subcellular compartments for distinct functions. Taz1 and MLCLAT1 remodeling generates the mature cardiolipin while ALCAT1 remodeling produces the &quot;bad&quot; cardiolipin associated with pathologic processes. 



'''Functions:'''

Cardiolipin is the center of mitochondrial physiology. It plays a major role in the organization of the protein components of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)[2]. It improves the efficiency and adaptability of the OXPHOS machinery by two mechanisms. First, cardiolipin stabilizes higher order respiratory complexes. This increases the efficiency of electron flow and ADP/ATP exchange. In addition, cardiolipin acts as a protein trap to restrict the flow of electrons. Without cardiolipin, the functionality of the electron transport chain is reduced resulting in a weaker electrochemical gradient (ΔΨ).

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For The Novice'''

What are scenes? They are like different worlds in a .blend (that being the file format of Blender). You can use them for anything you think will work. To toggle your scene look at the pull down menu at the top of the window (generally with the text &quot;scene&quot; in it. You can add scenes from this menu and when there are more then one you may toggle between them.}}

What ''are'' scenes '''for'''? Here are the many uses:

==HUD==
Do you know what a HUD is? It stands for '''H'''eads '''U'''p '''D'''isplay and basically has your points, health or whatever you want to be told during gameplay. In Blender you create a separate scene for the HUD and get it to overlay on the gameplay. It looks like a normal HUD... because it '''is'''!

==Too Bad, You Lost!==
Don't you want consolation in a game when you lose? Add another scene and write something funny, sympathizing or weird.

==Surprise, You Won!==
If you won you want to be told that you have and maybe some of the variables giving you that win. Another scene and you're in business.

==The Game Is &lt;u&gt;''Paused''&lt;/u&gt;==
You want pause menus? When you press the button it will bring up a scene that displays your options.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Topical
For topical drug administration, drugs are applied directly to the affected area. The effect reminds in the local area. The advantage of topical administration is that drugs can be given to the patient. No trained personnel are required for application. Usually, there is no pain involved in administration. Side effects are very minimal. 

		Epicutaneous
Drugs are applied directly onto the skin surface. This administration can be used to test if a patient is allergic to certain drugs or substance. Epicutaneous administration can also be used for local anesthesia to relieve minor pain for cuts or burns.
		Eye drops
Drugs are applied directly into the affected eye. Eye drops are saline-containing liquid. Examples of eye drops are rinse eye drops, Glaucoma eye drops, steroid and antibiotic eye drops.
		Inhalational
Drugs are inhaled through the mouth by the patient. Inhalational administration drugs can be used to treat asthma or acute infection in upper airway. The advantage of inhalational administration is that the response of body is much faster than oral administration because the drug does not have to go through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Also, because the drug does not have to go though liver, so the damage to liver is minimized. 
		Intranasal route
Intranasal route administration is also known as nasal spray. Examples of nasal spray are decongestant nasal spray or allergy relive.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chromosome Overview==

[[File:Schéma d'un Chromosome.png|thumb|MAuthor H'arnet]]


During mitosis and meiosis chromatin fibers coil and condense into '''chromosome''' structures. Each chromosome is made up of '''chromatin''', a complex of proteins and DNA. The chromosomes are long pieces of DNA that are found in the center of the nucleus inside the cells. 
'''Centromeres''' are a constricted region on the chromosome, which determines its appearance. Centromeres can be placed along different points along the length of the chromosome classifying it as metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric depending on centromere location. Chromosomes are cellular structure carrying genetic material located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and contain DNA molecules and proteins. Somatic cells from the same species contain identical number of chromosomes, which represents the '''diploid number''' (2n). Chromosomes exist in pairs; referred to as '''homologous chromosomes''', one homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism’s mother and one from the father. Homologous chromosomes share genetic similarities such as a '''locus,''' an identical gene site along their length. On the other hand, bacteria and viruses contain only one chromosome. A normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes in its nucleus. Sex cells contain 23 chromosomes in humans. '''Haploid number''' (n) of a chromosome is one half the diploid number. During meiosis, diploid number of chromosomes are converted to haploid number as gametes are formed. Sex determining chromosomes X and Y are not often homologous. Females carry two homologous X chromosomes while males carry one Y and one X chromosome, which are not homologous but contain homologous regions and behave homologous in meiosis.
However, &quot;the remaining chromosomes are refered to the autosomal chromosomes and they are known as chromosome pairs 1 through 22&quot; (University of Maryland).

==Chromosome Mutations==


[[Image:Haploid, diploid ,triploid and tetraploid.svg|thumb|right|200px|Ehamberg]]


'''Chromosome mutations''', occur when change in the total number of chromosomes are effected by deletion or duplication of genes or chromosome segments and rearrangement of genetic material within or among chromosomes. '''Aneuploidy''' is a condition in which one or more chromosomes are present in extra copies or are deficient in number but not a complete set. To be more specific, the loss of a single chromosome from a diploid genome (diploid cell-cell containing two set of chromosomes (2n), one set inherited from each parent) is called '''monosomy''' (2n-1). The gain of one chromosome is called '''trisomy''' (2n+1). A condition with complete set of haploid chromosome is called '''euploidy'''. There are events in which organisms have more than two sets of chromosomes; '''triploids''' for example are organisms with three sets of chromosomes. '''Tetraploids''' have four sets of chromosomes.

Chromosome mutations result in serious problems such as '''Turner syndrome''', a monosomy in which females may contain all or part of an X chromosome. Monosomy for autosomes is usually lethal in humans and other animals. '''Klinefelter syndrome''', a trisomy genetic disorder in males caused by the presence of one or more X chromosome. The effects of trisomy are similar to those of monosomy. Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy in humans that has a substantial number of survivors one year after birth. Trisomy in chromosome 21 is the cause of Down syndrome and it affects 1 infant in every 800 live births.

==Polyploidy==

[[File:Polyploidization.svg|thumb|Ilmari Karonen]]

'''Polyploidy''', is an occurrence in which more than two sets of haploid chromosomes are present. This condition is rare in animal species but common in lizards, amphibians, fish, and very common in various plants. Polyploidy originates in two ways: (1) '''autopolyploidy''' the addition of one or more extra sets of chromosomes of the same species; (2) '''allopolyploidy''' is the combination of chromosome sets from different species. Autopolyploidy have sets of chromosomes identical to parent species.  Autotriploids for example can be represented as AAA and can arise from the failure of all chromosomes to separate during meiotic division, which result in a diploid gamete. The fertilization of the gamete by a haploid gamete results in the production of a zygote with three sets of chromosomes. Autotriploids often produce genetically unbalanced gametes with odd numbers of chromosomes. Autotetraploids can be represented by AAAA and are most likely to produce balanced gametes in sexual reproduction.

==Deletion and Duplication==
[[Image:Deletion vectorized.svg|thumb|right|200px|National Human Genome Research (USA)]]

[[Image:Gene-duplication.png|thumb|left|200px|National Human Genome Research (USA)]]

'''Deletion''' in chromosomes occurs when a chromosome breaks in one or more places and a portion is lost or missing. Deletions can occur either near one end or within the chromosome, which are known as intercalary deletions. '''Deletion loops''' are unpaired regions of the normal homolog which occurs when synapsis between a chromosome with intercalary deletion and a normal homolog.  The size of the chromosome deletion can determine the survival of the organism and unlike large deletions, small deletions can result in survival. '''Duplications''' in chromosomes occur when a large piece of chromosome is present more than once in the genome. They can arise from unequal crossing over between synapsed chromosomes during meiosis.

==Chromosome Theory of Inheritance==
In the 1902, Walter Sutton and Theordor Boveri proposed that how the chromosomes are transmitted is the same as Mendel's Theory of how genes are transmitted. Genes are located on chromosomes. Chromosomes segregate and assort independently during meiosis. The evidence comes from Morgan's experiment with fruit flies. In 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan started his work with Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly. He chose fruit fly because they can be cultured easily, are very prolific, have short generation time, and have only four pair of chromosomes that can be easily identified under the microscope. They have three pair of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. At that time, he already know that X and Y have to do with gender. He used normal flies with red eyes, and mutated flies with white eyes and cross breed them. He was able to conclude that gene for eye color was on the X chromosomes. Males have only 1 X, Y does not carry gene for eye color.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Acetyl-CoA==
Acetyl coenzyme A, or better known as acetyl-CoA, is an important molecule used in metabolic processes. It is primarily used by the body for energy production through the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle. 

[[File:Structures of acetyl coenzyme A and coenzyme A..pdf|thumb|Structures of acetyl coenzyme A and coenzyme A.]]


==Formation==





Acetyl-CoA is a product of the oxidation of several amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. 
It is formed after pyruvate enters the mitochondria via active transport. The oxidation transformation that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is known as a pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. In this process, each pyruvic acid molecule loses one carbon atom, and combines with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is then exhaled out of the cell. This process is catalyzed by a complex of three enzymes through a process known as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-acetyl-coa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The formation of acetyl coenzyme A from pyruvate involves several steps, all of which are catalyzed by enzymes..pdf|thumb|The formation of acetyl coenzyme A from pyruvate involves several steps, all of which are catalyzed by enzymes]]













==Functions==
The main function of Acetyl-CoA is to carry acyl groups or thioesters. It is the precursor to HMG CoA, an important part of cholesterol and ketone synthesis. It can also be found as a vital reagent in the synthesis of fatty acids and sterols, as well as the oxidation of fatty acids as well as the breaking down of many amino acids. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB01206&lt;/ref&gt;

Acetyl-CoA is well known as the junction between Glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycle as well as an essential component in balancing between carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Acetyl-CoA has also been a central metabolite that is involved in many metabolic transformations within the cell. The acetyl group of the acetyl-CoA is used to oxidize via the TCA cycle to reduce NAD+ and FAD to NADH and FADH2, respectively. These products are then used to fuel ATP production through the electron transport train.

In May 2011, Ling Cai et al. found that Acetyl-Coa functioned as a carbon-source rheostat that signals the initiation of the cellular growth program by promoting the acetylation of histones specifically at growth genes. By intimately coordinating with nutrient availability, the acetyl-CoA was concluded to play as a critical signal for metabolic growth and proliferation.

Activation of acetyl-CoA: Some acetyl groups within the cell are tagged with coenzyme A (CoA). Acetyl-CoA molecules are tagged at the back end by a process called condensation with carbon dioxide, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in order to redirect acetyl groups into fatty acid biosynthesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
When studying Chemistry, it is important to consider both the chemical properties of the reactants and the conditions under which the reaction occurs, the mechanism by which it takes place, the rate at which it occurs and the equilibrium toward which it proceeds. The law of mass action states that the rate of a chemical reaction at a constant temperature depends only on the concentrations of the substances that influence the rate, which are usually one or more of the reactants, but can occasionally be a product. Another influence on the rate can be caused by the presence of a catalyst that does not appear in the balances chemical equation. The rate law can only be experimentally determined and can be used to predict the relationship between the rate of a reaction and the concentrations of reactants.

==Rate Equation==
For almost all forward and irreversible reactions, the rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to some degree. For example, for the reaction aA+bB-&gt; cC +dD, the rate is proportional to [A]^m[B]^n, that is: rate = k[A]^m[B]^n 
The k is the rate constant. Multiplying the units of k by the concentration factors raised to the appropriate powers give the rate in units of: concentration/time.
The proportionality factor, k called the rate constant, is a constant at a certain temperature. There are dimensions in the constant and it can be easily determined by using dimensional analysis of a particular rate law.. It is commonly known that as the value of the k value increases, the reaction speed increases.

==Rate Law Determination through Experiment==
The value of k (constant), x and y in the rate law equation (rate= [A]^m[B]n) must be determined experimentally for a given reaction at given temperature. the rate is measured as a function of the initial concentrations of the reactants A and B.
==Order or Reactions==
Chemical reactions are often classified on the basis of kinetics as zero-order, first-order, second-order, mixed order, or higher-order reactions. The general reaction aA + bB → cC + dD will be used in the discussion next. 
First lets note what each of these orders means in terms of initial rate of reaction effect:
# Zero-order in the reactant—there is no effect on the initial rate of reaction
# First-order in the reactant—there initial rate of reaction doubles
# Second order in the reactant—the initial rate of the reaction quadruples
# Third order in the reactant—the initial rate of reaction increases eightfold



The equation of rate law &lt;ref name=&quot;rate law&quot;/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
-r_A = k_A(T)fn(C_A, C_B, ...)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k_A&lt;/math&gt; is the specific rate of reaction, which also called the rate constant. 
   

Generally, four reactions are involved with rate laws. The homogeneous reactions include only one phase. The Heterogeneous reactions include two or more phases, and usually appear at the interface between the phases. The reversible reactions depend on the concentrations of reactants and products that can react in both directions. The irreversible reactions react in only one direction until one of the reactants is exhausted. 

Generally, there are four types of reaction order. The most common form is 

&lt;math&gt;          
-r_A= k_A C_A^aC_B^b
&lt;/math&gt;


The units of the specific reaction rate constant are

&lt;math&gt;           
k = (Concentration)^{1-n} / Time
&lt;/math&gt;
 

The four types of reaction order:
 
*Zero-order (n=0): 		      &lt;math&gt;-r_A= k_A&lt;/math&gt;
 	
The unit of k of zero-order is &lt;math&gt;mol/dm^3/s&lt;/math&gt;
 
*First-order (n=1): 		     &lt;math&gt;-r_A= k_A C_A &lt;/math&gt;              
 	
The unit of k of first-order is &lt;math&gt;s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
 
*Second-order (n=2): 	     &lt;math&gt;-r_A = k_A C_A^2&lt;/math&gt;
  	
The unit of k of second-order is &lt;math&gt;dm^3/mol/s&lt;/math&gt;
 
*Third-order (n=3): 	             &lt;math&gt;-r_A = k_A C_A^3&lt;/math&gt;
	
The unit of k of third-order is &lt;math&gt;(dm^3/mol)^2/s&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene regulation is often affected by variations stemming from the chromatin. A multitude of mechanisms play roles in gene regulation, including “regulation of the core transcription machinery, recruitment of the transcriptional activators or repressors, and altering chromatin structure via post-translational covalent modification of histone proteins.” Yet the most studied and proven mechanism roots from variations of chromatin architecture. Recent research has pointed to a variety of metabolic molecules to be responsible for modulation of genes. Some key metabolic regulators found were: Acetyl-CoA, NAD+, SAM and alpha-KG.

In a landmark study by Kaochar et al., acetylation was found to play a major role in histone modifications, which ultimately leads to gene transcription.

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22944281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acetyl-CoA==
== History==

In 1964, Allfrey et al. found that the acetylation of the histone tails facilitated access to DNA for transcription by neutralizing the positive charge of lysine side chains. This is due to the fact that many transcription factors interact directly with the acetylated lysines. A significant correlation was found between the ability of a protein to acetylate histones and activate transcription.

== Mechanism == 

The wide range of post-translational modifications of histone proteins allow chromatins to take on a variety of structures. This, in turn, contributes to the cell’s ability to control gene expression.</text>

== This game was invented by protein researcher David Baker and his fellow computer scientists from University of Washington. The objective of fold.it is find the best structure(the one that is in the lowest energy level)for desire protein. Players use tools like building hydrogen bonds or rotating the structure around. They collect points as they lower the energy of the structure. Players of fold.it are mostly people who don't have knowledge in protein structures. However, these players has done a lot of amazing works in improving our knowledge of proteins. One of the biggest accomplishments they have done was finding the three dimensional structure of a virus that cause AIDS in monkey in 2011. While the supercomputer tried to solve this protein folding problem for 15 years,a group of gamer found the solution in as short as three weeks. This group of gamer didn't want to reveal their real names but their passion for the game has advanced protein study significantly.
If you want to be part of this evolutionary game, you can go to http://fold.it/. The game has a clear interface and is very easy to start.

      <comment>/* Kinetic Control */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

Product ratios of reactions can be changed according to the conditions in which the reaction occurs.  Depending on the kinetic and thermodynamic control of the reaction, product ratios can vary dramatically. An example of this is the hydrobromination of 1,3-butadiene at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C v.s 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.  At 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the reaction is under kinetic control and the products favor 3-Bromo-1-butene over 1-Bromo-2-butene in a 70:30 mixture.  However at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the reaction is under thermodynamic control and favors the 1-Bromo-2-butene product with a 15:85 ratio. &lt;ref name = &quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

Chemical reactions can be controlled by thermodynamic or kinetic means. When a reaction can yield two different products, the reaction conditions change the outcome and therefore the products. When conditions of a reaction changes, the reaction itself may change. Some conditions to be considered are temperature, pressure, light, or even solvent. The difference between thermodynamic and kinetic conditions is that thermodynamic factors associate with the relative stability of the molecules while the kinetic factors are associated with the rate of product formation. This phenomena of different products can only occur when there are two different paths with two different activation energies or energy required to make the reaction progress. In essence, when temperature is low the reaction undergoes kinetic control where the major product is the one that comes from the quickest reaction. When temperature is high, the reaction undergoes thermodynamic control which provides the more stable system and product. Under kinetic control the reaction is rate based and is not reversible, but under thermodynamic control the reaction is in equilibrium and is also reversible under the correct conditions. &lt;ref name=&quot;control&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch10/ch10-3-3.html control], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermodynamic Control ==

When the product ratio of a reaction depends upon the thermodynamic stability of the products, a reaction is said to be under thermodynamic control. In the hydrobromination of 1,3-Butadiene at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the ratio of the products favors the more stable isomer, as it is under thermodynamic control. At higher temperatures or over long periods of time, the more stable isomer will dominate as the two isomers will be in equilibrium and rapidly interconvert.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot;&gt;Schore, Neil E. (2011). Organic Chemistry Structure and Function 6th Edition. W. H. Freeman&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic control of a reaction favors the more thermodynamically stable molecule. This reaction pathway is selected for by using long reaction times or high temperatures. Long reaction times or high temperatures will give the molecules more energy to surpass the lower kinetic pathway to eventually make its way over to the more stable thermodynamic product. Even though molecules have already taken the kinetic pathway, with enough time or high enough temperatures, the molecules will have the energy to go back and overcome the higher activation energy in order to rest in the more stable state or product. Essentially, with enough time or temperature molecules will select for the thermodynamically controlled pathway and end as the more stable product. &lt;ref name=&quot;control&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch10/ch10-3-3.html control], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinetic Control ==

A product ratio that follows the relative rates of formation, such as the hydrobromination of 1,3-butadiene at 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, is said to be under kinetic control.  The reason 3-Bromo-1-butene dominates is because at 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the reverse formation is much slower than at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C so the isomers are not rapidly inter-converting.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

Kinetic control favors shorter reaction times. This is also the path that requires less energy or has a lower activation energy. This is because at the start of a fast reaction more molecules will go towards the kinetic lower energy path and if stopped short, the molecules will not have a chance to return and take the thermodynamic path. Also, low temperature favors the kinetic pathway because it does not give the molecules that already took the kinetic path enough energy to return back to the starting material and then take the thermodynamic path. The way to get the kinetic product is to use short times for reactions to trap the kinetic product or use high temperatures.  &lt;ref name=&quot;control&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch10/ch10-3-3.html control], November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is how to build a simple aeroponic bucket.

==Materials==
All component materials should be nonhazardous/noncancerous. For tools and supplementary instructions see: [[Hydroculture/DIY|hydroculture DIY]]
* 5 gallon bucket with lid
* pump: fountain
* pex tubing
* sprinkler head: grass type
* plastic grommet: larger than plug socket depending on configuration

==Process==
Modification on the bucket is optional. Cut holes in the lid for net pots. Then cut a hole for a grommet, either in the lid or close to the top of the bucket. This is to protect the wire from damage that could cause an electrical hazard. 

The water pump can be super-glued or tie wrapped to a heavy object to keep it from moving.
Place water pump inside the bucket, thread the wire through the grommet. Water can spill out of here, so keep electrical connections higher than and away from this.
The remaining space between the wire and the grommet can be filled in, without a material that can scratch or otherwise damage the electrical wire: cut a slit in a smaller grommet to fit around wire.

Fit pex tubing on water pump connector. Some grass sprinkler heads will fit inside of the pex tubing.

Now it is time for finishing touches.

      <comment>/* Types of Noise */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">

Noise can be defined as random fluctuations of a signal.  Noise caused by stochastic fluctuations in genetic circuits (transcription and translation) is now appreciated as a central aspect of cell function and phenotypic behavior. Noise has also been detected in signaling networks, but the origin of this noise and how it shapes cellular outcomes remain poorly understood. The noise in signaling networks results from the intrinsic promiscuity of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and that this noise has shaped cellular signal transduction. Features promoted by the presence of this molecular signaling noise include multimerization and clustering of signaling components, pleiotropic effects of gross changes in protein concentration, and a probabilistic rather than a linear view of signal propagation.

== Types of Noise ==
=== Genetic Noise ===
Genetic noise is caused by the random fluctuations of signals during the processes of transcription and translation in DNA replication.  The noise can cause genes to express differently.  For example, two genetically identical cells can behave differently due to the influence of noise.  This random gene expression may allow the cell to suddenly be able to resist a substance that would originally have killed it if the noise did not cause the cell to change.  
=== Signaling Noise  ===
Noise in signaling is caused by the numerous amount of protein-protein interactions(PPI) due to its promiscuous nature.  Since proteins interact with many other types of proteins in a short period of time, many signals are being produced. The promiscuity of PPIs that create signal noise may help the recovery of cell functions through homologous pathways. This signaling noise may also be important for increasing robustness of signaling between cells by dampening incorrect events. Increasing robustness of signals can be due to multimerization, functional selectivity, and also pleiotropic effects. There has been research that shows that noise plays a role in epigenetic memory by affecting the central switches of cell functions. There is also speculation that changes in levels of signaling noise may be related to human diseases. By understanding how signaling noise affects cell function, researchers and scientists can finally get a better idea on its affect on diseases or also on propagation of epigenetic memory.

== Noise Threshold ==
Noise creates a threshold for signals to cross before a signal can create an effect.  This threshold prevents many irrelevant signals due to the promiscuous nature of PPI to cause an effect.  A single signal from a receptor cannot overcome the noise threshold by itself. To overcome this threshold, multiple receptors must come together to create a signal large enough to overcome the signal.  The process of which multiple receptors come together is called multimerization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341496&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multimerization ===
Multimerization is the clustering of multiple receptors which together create a noise which surpasses the background noise in the cells. This is the first method of overcoming the noise threshold so that signals can be sent appropriately and accordingly. When the receptors sending the same signal join together, the signal is then amplified which allows it to be sent. In contrast, when there is just one or a few receptors, the combined noise of their signals will less likely be greater than the threshold, resulting in no signal being sent. 

=== Functional Selectivity ===
Functional selectivity is another way to allow signals to be sent through a &quot;proof-reading&quot; method. If the components of the signal are all present and in the exact order in which the signal consists of, then the signal will be sent. If there are some but not all of the components of the specific signal, then that signal will not be sent. This method can be referred to as &quot;proof-reading&quot; because the body makes sure that the signal components are all correct in order for the process to proceed. The body will &quot;proof-read&quot; for any mistakes and correct them to allow signals to proceed.

=== Pleiotropic Effect ===
Pleiotropic effect is when the body produces more of one specific molecule that will lead to the surpassing of the noise threshold which results in a signal being sent. This effect does not necessarily mean that the number of receptors will change (like in multimerization). Instead, the concentration of a molecule is what changes in order to increase the chances of sending a signal. The body can also reduce the chance of a sending a harmful signal by reducing the concentration of a molecule related to the harmful signal. This way the noise level of the harmful signal will not surpass the noise threshold and will not be sent.

== Human Interactome ==
[[File:Human interactome.jpg|center|400px|Human Interactome]]

The human interactome is a large intricate network of thousands of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). It contrasts the classical idea that protein interactions follow a linear signaling pathway. Within the human interactome, proteins not only interact with one other protein, but they interact with many different proteins. This could also be seen as proteins having multiple protein partners to communicate with. The interaction of several proteins is what makes up the promiscuity of these PPI networks. The human interactome is a huge discovery because it allows researchers to search deeper into its relationship with diseases and genetics. 


There are three different ways to see whether interactome networks have been established.
The first is through a compilation of interactions from published work. There are usually some established literature-based work on the physical or biochemical interactions done by other researchers which can reassure that the interaction network does exist. The second way is through computational predictions which are based on the structural information of a protein, sequence and gene-order, and the existence of genes in genomes that transfer interactions between organisms (via orthology mapping). Though this way might be quick, the lack of experimental proof due to indirect 'orthogonal' information makes this a not so strong approach. The last approach is through systematic mapping strategies applied towards large groups of genomes and proteomes. Because of the advancement in technology, researchers and scientists are able to put together interactomes in shorter periods of time (than before).

      <comment>/* The Demethylation Pathway */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Derived from the Greek, epigenome means &quot;above&quot; the genome. The epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify, or mark, the genome in a way that tells it what to do, where to do it and when to do it. The marks, which are not part of the DNA itself, can be passed on from cell to cell as cells divide, and from one generation to the next.

==Effects of Epigenome==
The protein-coding parts of your genome, called genes, do not make proteins all of the time in all of your cells. Instead, different sets of genes are turned on or off in various kinds of cells at different points in time. Differences in the types and amounts of proteins produced determine how cells look, grow and act. The epigenome influences which genes are active — and which proteins are produced — in a particular cell. So, the epigenome is what tells your skin cells to behave like skin cells, heart cells like heart cells and so on.

==Epigenetic Modification==

Epigenetics involves heritable gene functions that are not attributed to changes in the cell’s DNA sequence. Some known examples of epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation and histone modification.

===DNA Methylation===

[[File:DNA methylation.jpg|thumb|DNA methylation of a DNA strand and its complimentary strand]]

DNA methylation is the process of adding a methyl group to a DNA sequence. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme known as DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs). There are two types of DNMTs: De novo DNMTs and Maintenance DNMTs. De novo DNA methyltransferase enzymes initially attaches the methyl group to a DNA strand. Maintenance DNMTs copy the methylation from an existing DNA strand onto the complimentary strand after replication. DNMTs recognize regions where a cytosine nucleotide is placed next to a guanine nucleotide along the base sequence. This region is known as CpG, where a phosphate group binds a cytosine to an adjacent guanine.

DNA methylation processing is used to repress gene expression. The methylation blocks the promoter site at which transcription factors bind to, thus stopping the gene expression. Though DNA methylation is very stable, the reaction can be reversed by a different group of enzymes.

===De Novo Methylation in Cancer===
Alterations to DNA methylation patterns play a major role in the onset of cancer. In fact, all tumors that have been studied exhibit changes in DNA methylation. Early studies seem to suggest that widespread demethylation is characteristic of cancer. One type of methylation pattern is called de novo methylation. In this process, the polycomb complex (PRC2) targets genes that, under normal conditions, have unmethylated CpG island promoters. These genes are repressed due to the methylation of H3K27. Methylation of H3K27 is mediated by  the histone methylase EZH2. The methylated H3K27 then binds to the chromodomain-containing complex (PRC1), thereby giving rise to a type of heterochromatin. During normal development, targeted de novo methylation can take place at certain sites on DNA. Similarly, it can occur abnormally in cancer. The explanation offered for this phenomenon suggests that the histone methylase EZH2 recruits Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Some studies show that the polycomb complex PRC2 may be released from the methylated islands. This event results in a more stabilized form of methylation-mediated repression, which occurs instead of the flexible polycomb repression mechanism. 

Many believe that de novo methylation is a completely random process. This theory helps to explain the presence of methylated tumor suppressor genes in some cancer types. However, more recent research reveal DNA methylation in cancer to involve hundreds of CpG islands that are methylated in a more pre-determined way. Under the older theory, it is believed that DNA methylation causes genes to become inactivated. In contrast, the newer theory revealed that the genes targeted for methylation have already been inactive. Many of these targeted genes have a polycomb complex nearby, which may explain how the methylases are recruited to carry out the gene modification. Thus, the newer theory based on programmed methylation suggests that de novo methylation in cancer  occurs on gene sites that were targeted regardless of whether the genes are active or inactive. The target sites are also independent of whether the genes affect tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, studies on human colon cancer reveal the possibility that DNA methylation can cause a more permanent repression mechanism than that of the normally flexible polycomb repression mechanism; this observation links DNA methylation to tumorigenesis.


===Fragile X Syndrome===
Fragile X Syndrome is a developmental disease that eventually causes mental retardation. This disease occurs when abnormal de novo methylation causes the repression of the FMR1 gene early in development. Abnormal de novo methylation is believed to be the cause of Fragile X syndrome due to the fact that inactivation of the FMR1 gene is observed to occur alongside a process known as H3K9me3 heterochromatinization. From these studies, scientists believe that the programming of all abnormal modifications may proceed through a single mechanism in which histone methylases mediate random DNA methylation and repression. 


===The Demethylation Pathway===
Active demethylation occurs in a step-wise manner that results in a modification of 5-methylcytidine (5mC). This modification allows the molecule to be recognized for removal and replacement by repair; the modified 5-methylcytidine is replaced with unmethylated cytosine. The following steps depict the pathway suggested for active demethylation: 

1. Hydroxylation: An enzyme known as ten-eleven-translocation (Tet) catalyzes the hydroxylation of the methyl group on 5-methylcytidine, thereby forming 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (5hmC). 

2. Deamination: Activation-induced deaminase (Aid) or Apobec family proteins replaces the amine group of 5-hydroxymethylcytidine with a doubly bonded oxygen atom. This new molecule is called 5-hydroxymethyluridine (5hmU). 

3. Glycosylation: A glycosylase (Mbd4 or Tdg) essentially removes the 5-hydroxymethyluridine structure from the sugar-phosphate backbone. What is left is an apyrimidinic acid residue.

4. Repair: The apyrimidinic acid residue is replaced with cytosine (C) through a repair process such as nucleotide excision repair (BER or NER).

===Histone Code===

The hypothesis of the histone code, a recent postulation by Strahl and Allis &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6796/abs/406593a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;, suggests that it is a number of histone modifications at a particular locus that is involved in determining what genes are expressed or suppressed.  This expression is a heritable epigenetic factor that allows regulatory proteins to have an effect on gene expression.  By changing the charge of histones or the addition of structural proteins, genes can be essentially turned on or off.  But the question of whether it is the combination of histone modifications working in concert or a cumulative effect of numerous modifications is a topic of current debate&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Histone modifiers consist of residue specific proteins and reader proteins allow for these epigenetic changes to be transmitted post-translationally.

===Transcriptional Histone Modifications ===

Acetylation of histones has been associated with increased transcription of specific genes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;. Several acetyltranserfase compounds have been documented that allow acetylation of histone complexes and increase genetic transcription.  Using genome mapping techniques, it has been shown that the most acetylated regions are responsible for the highest rates of transcription.  However, the acetylation is relatively dynamic, often only lasting for several minutes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  This suggests that it is the frequent acetylation that has a role in the promotion of a genetic region rather than simply the presence of acetylated histones.  

Lysine methylation in histones that leads to decreased transcriptional activity is much longer lived in relation to acetylation.  Mono, di, and tri-methylation is part of an indexing system that is involved in epigenetic control and each manner of methylation has a different longevity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additionally, methylation has a longer turnover rate than phosphorylation.

Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine can be phosphorylated as another impermanent epigenetic control factor that occurs on histone tails.   During mitosis, core histone tails are occasionally phosphorylated in a process that is initiated then spreads throughout the genome&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Phosphorylation has been linked to acetylation and other post transcriptional modifications.

===Histone assembly and deposition===

As chromatin is assembled, histones are constructed in the cytoplasm and transported through the nuclear membrane to be deposited on DNA.  Generally, histone assembly and placement is concurrent with S-phase progression.  Histones are initially modified on their journey into the nucleus and placed at the replication fork of the chromatin then further modifications are made within the first few minutes of placement.  However, further modifications like the methylation of lysine occur after longer periods of time, indicating the importance of epigenetic changes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Inheritance of the epigenetic code===

For histone modifications and the epigenetic code to be heritable, the cell must be able to initiate modification, alter modifications, and transmit modifications to future copies of the genetic code.  As mentioned previously, acetylation of histones has a rapid turnover, which does not strongly suggest a lasting or heritable epigenetic control.  Even in situations where acetylation is observed for longer durations, it is usually seen to attract proteins responsible for increasing levels of acetylation, and is not likely responsible for the heritability of epigenetic codes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000410000940&lt;/ref&gt;.  Methylation, however has been observed to have a prolonged binding and increased stability of reaction and could be responsible for a transmittable epigenetic code.  Although it is still to be determined if there is a “histone code” that carries epigenetic changes as DNA is copied, a code based on methylation of histones is the most likely type of histone modification to be involved.

==Epigenome and cancer==
Cancers are caused by a combination of changes to the genome and the epigenome.

Adding or removing methyl groups can switch genes involved in cell growth off or on. If such changes occur at the wrong time or in the wrong cell, they can wreak havoc, converting normal cells into cancer cells that grow wildly out of control.

For example, in a type of brain tumor called glioblastoma, doctors have had some success in treating patients with a drug, called temozolomide, that kills cancer cells by adding methyl groups to DNA. But that's only part of a very complex picture. Cells also contain a gene, called MGMT, that produces a protein that subtracts methyl groups — an action that counteracts the effects of temozolomide. In some glioblastomas, however, the switch for the MGMT gene has itself been turned off by methylation, which blocks production of the protein that counteracts temozolomide. Consequently, glioblastoma patients whose tumors have methylated MGMT genes are far more likely to respond to temozolomide than those with unmethylated MGMT genes.

Changes in the epigenome also activate growth-promoting genes in stomach cancer, colon cancer and the most common type of kidney cancer. In other cancers, changes in the epigenome silence genes that normally serve to keep cell growth in check.

To come up with a complete list of all the possible changes that can lead to cancer, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has started a project called The Cancer Genome Atlas. Beginning with glioblastoma, these researchers are comparing the genomes and epigenomes of normal cells to those of cancer cells. They are looking for any changes in the DNA sequence, called mutations; changes in the number and structure of chromosomes; changes in the amounts of proteins produced by genes; and changes in the number of methyl groups on the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
[[File:MCS.JPG|thumb|Schematic Diagram of the MSCs in a Eukaryotic Cell]]
Two organelles in a cell come in contact via membrane contact sites (MCS).  Membrane contact sites govern the signaling and crossing of ions and lipids from one cellular organelle to the next.  Even though research on MCS have been going on for over 50 years now, there is still so much more to uncover regarding their function, structure and regulation.  To this date, there are multiple studies done on three main contact sites: the nucleus-vacuole junction, mitochondria-ER, and plasma membrane-ER contact sites.  Having membrane- bound organelles is a special characteristic for eukaryotic cells, as it allows for specialized functions in different compartments of the cell.  Two organelles exchange information through interorganellar or MCS when they are in close proximity.  To visualize their communication, a technique such as electron microscopy was employed.  This technique first arose in the 1950s when the close apposition of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria was first seen.  Ever since then, similar electron microscopy techniques were used to visualize contact sites in cells between the endoplasmic reticulum and: mitochondria, vacuoles, Golgi, chloroplasts and plasma membrane.  Since most studies were conducted without molecular markers, they usually refer to proximity of around 30 nanometers between two organelles’ membranes.  Unfortunately, there is still no excellent 3D model visualization of MCS.  However, in the recent years, there is an increase in the studies of the proteins that reside in the membrane sites and molecular determinants needed to create MCS. 


===The Nucleus-Vacuole Junction (NVJ)===

    
The membrane contact site between the nucleus and the vacuole is known as the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ).  The primary study is of the yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the vacuolar membrane, inner nuclear membrane, and the ER membrane is bridged through NVJ.  Nucleus-vacuole junctions are the best studied MCS to this date. NVJ is made of vacuolar protein Vac8 and the ER-localized protein Nvj1. If one of these two proteins is missing from deletion of genes, the MCS will not be made and there would not be contact between two organelles. &lt;br&gt; : There have been two cellular functions suggested for the NVJ.  The first one is piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus.  This is a process that marks a part of the yeast nucleus for degradation in the vacuole lumen.  Piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus is stimulated during nitrogen or carbon starvation and requires autophagic parts shared between the electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane, the selective cytoplasm to vacuole, and unselective microautophagy.  The second suggested function of NVJ is lipid biosynthesis.  The two proteins that participate in lipid biosynthesis, Osh1 and Tsc13, reside in the NVJ. Osh1 comes from the yeast oxysterol-binding protein homology family whose role includes lipid sensors and lipid transfer.  However, there is no evidence that shows NVJ regulates lipid biosynthesis because localization of osh1 in NVJ is exclusive to stationary phase. In addition,  OSH1 is not needed for forming NVJs or for the piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus in starved cells. The other protein resides in NVJ (Tsc13) is responsible for catalyzing the terminal step in biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids(VLCFAs). These fatty acids can affect the structure and fluidity of membranes. Although we have pretty good understanding of these two enzymes, we haven't figured out why they reside in NVJ or if there are other proteins that are in the NVJ.&lt;br&gt; : Similar contact sites between ER and the endosome/lysosome (for eukaryote cells) have been observed. Instead of osh1, late endosome-localized oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L(ORP1L) works as a cholesterol sensor and it sense level of cholesterol by changing its conformation. Through the change of conformation, ORP1L tells ER how much cholesterol there is in the cell. &lt;br&gt; : Although NVJ is the most studied membrane contact site, we still don't know how much it can do for a cell.

===The Mitochondria-ER contact site===
The second most-studied MCS is the mitochondria-ER site.  This site is primarily visualized via electron microscopy.  The section of ER that co-purifies with the mitochondria, known as mitochondria-associated membrane fraction (MAM), is researched extensively on.  The two main functions of this site is lipid biosynthesis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  homeostasis.  Early research showed that the MAM fraction encompasses enzymes that participate in phospholipid biosynthesis.  In addition, the mitochondria and ER must work together to make certain lipids. For example, let’s take a closer look in the biosynthetic pathway of phosphatidylcholine.  The substrate for this pathway is made in the ER, which then enters the intermembrane space of the mitochondria to produce phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and then PE goes back to the ER to synthesize phosphatidylcholine.  This process shows that the ER and mitochondria collaborate to produce certain lipids.  On the other hand, ER-mitochondria MSCs is responsible for the transmission of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; .  Homeostasis of mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  is important because Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulated the ATP production rate.  Furthermore, an overload of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  can trigger cell death.

===The PM-ER contact site===


There are many contact sites of ER-PM in different cell types.  The function of ER-plasma membrane contact sites is similar to that of the mitochondria-ER junctions, since Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and lipid synthesis and trafficking take place there.  As mentioned above, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation is crucial as it is also responsible for protein synthesis, folding, and signaling.  In excitable cells, the global calcium signal is generated by the coupling of PM depolarization and ER calcium release.  In non-excitable cells, calcium influx is controlled by detecting luminal ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  levels.  Research has showed that the PM-ER contact site is involved in non-vesicular lipid trafficking. We know that lipids are insoluble in water. So to transfer lipid from its synthesis sites to its desired work place, one must shield the lipid. In fact, couple families of lipid transfer protein (LTPs) that can perform this task have been found on the contact sites. One of them is oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) related proteins(ORPS). The oxysterol-binding protein related protein is of a big LTP family which is conserved from yeast to man. It binds to sterols and scientist believe it helps to transfer non-vesicular sterol between the ER and PM.  Even though PM-ER contact sites is crucial for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  and lipid signaling,  we still cannot identify the tether proteins that mediate such contact. One strong possible protein for PM-ER contact sites is a class  of highly conserved protein called junctophilins. It can stabilize the junctions by anchoring ER/SR to the PM, giving a structual basis for physiological coupling between PM and ER/SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  channels.
Further investigation is necessary to map the molecular machinery for the regulation and generation of PM-ER contact sites.

=== Conclusion of the Membrane Contact Sites (MCS) ===
Functions of MCS was established first as a site of trafficking of lipids and ions. However, as more and more studies done on MCS, we know that MCSs are also responsible for signaling, effective transmission of metabolic cues within cell, organellar inheritance control mechanism. We are not clear on how MCS perform these tasks yet but better understanding of MCS would be achieved once we figure out its molecular components.

==Introduction==
Norethindrone (or norethisterone)  is a form of female hormone that prevents ovulation (the release of egg from an ovary). This medicine causes changes in a woman's cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and therefore harder for conception.

Norethindrone is used for birth control (contraception) to prevent pregnancy. Norethindrone is also used to treat menstrual disorders, endometriosis, or abnormal vaginal bleeding caused by a hormone unbalance.

==Side Effect==
Immediately contact for medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction after consuming Norethindrone: 
# hives 
# difficulty breathing 
# swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Stop using this medication and call your doctor if you have any of these serious side effects:

# sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body;
# sudden headache, confusion, pain behind the eyes, problems with vision, speech, or balance;
# pain or swelling in one or both legs;
# migraine headache;
# swelling in your hands or feet, rapid weight gain;
# symptoms of depression (sleep problems, weakness, mood changes);
# severe pelvic pain;
# chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; or
# nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
# Less serious side effects may include:
# mild nausea, vomiting, bloating, stomach cramps;
# breast pain, swelling, or tenderness;
# dizziness;
# freckles or darkening of facial skin;
# increased acne or hair growth;
# changes in weight;
# vaginal itching or discharge;
# skin itching or rash;
# changes in your menstrual periods, decreased sex drive; or
# mild headache.

==History of Synthesis==
In 1951, norethindrone was synthesized by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Dijerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City.

      <comment>/* Allele Frequency in Subpopulations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene flow is the movement of genes from one population to another through the transfer of alleles. This can occur within a population as well as across a population.  Gene flow includes lots of different kinds of events, such as pollen being blown to a new destination or people moving to new cities or countries. If genes are carried to a population where those genes previously did not exist, gene flow can be a very important source of genetic variation. In the graphic below, the gene for brown coloration moves from one population to another.


[[File:Gene flow final.png|thumbnail]]

The rate of gene flow depends on the capability of individual organisms. For example, a wind-pollinated corn will have a possible gene flow range of about 50 feet whereas fruit flies have migrated from over 15km.

==Random Drifts==
Random drifts: the idea of allele frequencies in gene flow is that all alleles have an equal opportunity of being transfered. Although some alleles appear to be more favorable, this is accounted by its increased appearance in the population. Random drift is the important mechanism of evolution. One aspect of genetic drift is the random nature of transmitting alleles from one generation to the next, given that only a fraction of all possible zygotes become mature adults. The easiest case to visualize is the one which involves binomial sampling error. If a pair of diploid sexually reproducing parents (such as humans) have only a small number of offspring, then not all of the parent's alleles will be passed on to their progeny due to chance assortment of chromosomes at meiosis. In a large population, this will not have much effect in each generation because the random nature of the process will tend to average out. But in a small population the effect could be rapid and significant.

==Gene Flow in Humans==
Gene flow in humans can be primarily accounted by migration. For example, the Vietnam War caused the mating of US soldiers with Vietnamese women, thus leading to a differing gene pool frequency.  
The loss or gain of people can also affect the gene flow. For example, if red-haired Scottish were to move out of the country, then the next generations of Scottish would consist of fewer red-heads.
Population genetic studies are mainly based on the description of genetic variability and on interpopulational comparisons using genetic distance measures. The evolutionary dynamics of the populations are inferred from these parameters and accurate estimates of gene flow may be critical. The present study reevaluates the role of gene flow in human populations by different statistical methods from a number of microsatellite and protein polymorphism data. The estimated number of individuals exchanged per generation (Nm) was greater than 1 in all data sets with all statistical methods. The correlation between geographic and genetic distances suggests a pattern of isolation by distance, characteristic of demographic and genetic equilibrium conditions among populations worldwide. Thus the high values of Nm may be interpreted as a reflection of high gene flow between geographically close populations. As expected, gene flow appears to exert a pivotal role in the genetic history of humans.

==Gene Flow between Species==
Gene flow can occur between species through viruses. The DNA of one cell is extracted by a virus and injected into another.
The extent of this type of gene flow between humans is unclear at the moment, although estimates of 40-50% are plausible. However, this can be observed in several species such as insects, fish, reptiles, mammals, and especially microorganisms.

Researchers hypothesize that differential gene flow across species boundaries is a pattern resulting from selection, in which the absence of selection on some traits or alleles between species results in gradual transitions of these traits across a hybrid zone. In contrast, ongoing selection to maintain species at other traits prevents the dispersal of alleles across species boundaries and is expected to produce a pattern of steep transitions of traits across a hybrid zone. In house mice, researchers found that alleles near the center of the X chromosome exhibit steep transitions across the hybrid zone, and these alleles are in a region previously shown to be associated with hybrid sterility. This work demonstrates the utility of hybrid zones to test for the effect of selection on interspecies gene flow in particular regions of the genome. 

By continuing to study hybridizing species and hybrid zones, researchers can further understand which sets of genes have permissible gene flow and which are more restricted. Then, by studying genes in the latter category, scientists can learn which genes or gene sets may be important in maintaining species integrity in the face of gene flow.

==Allele Frequency in Subpopulations==
The average allele frequency can be calculated via this formula:
pt = p + (po - p ) (1-m)^t

p is the frequency of alleles in generation t
m is the migration rate
o is the initial frequency of an allele in a subpopulation
t is the number of generations

OMPG is used to provide a balance between drift and gene flow and allow heterozygosity by minimizing the loss of alleles.

Given subpopulation size, number of subpopulations, the migration rate m, generations to evolve, this script shows changes of allele frequencies among subpopulations at single locus, which results from the effect of migration. All subpopulations have equal number of individuals.
Migration is depicted in the form of a N*N matrix, which is consisted with identical non-zero values at non-diagonal positions and zero on the diagonal line, where N is the number of subpopulations. Sum of values of elements on row i (i = 1, 2, …, N) of the migration matrix equals to the migration rate, thus it ensures that every individual in subpopulation i has probability m to become a migrant, and such a migrant has equal possibility of entering any other subpopulation. Initialization of allele frequencies among subpopulations is to use a list of numbers, which have counts equal to number of subpopulations and been set evenly distributed between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1. Therefore, the average allele frequency named theoretical value that all subpopulations share after a long term of evolution will be 0.5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">“Better medical treatments do not always require stronger medicine. The effectiveness of chemical agents depends on the method of administration. So treatment can often be improved by finding optimal drug formulation of delivery system.” (Professor Mark Saltzman)
As the result, many chemists, biochemists, pharmacists, bioengineers, and chemical engineers work to improve the administration of the drugs instead of find the stronger medicine.  There are three categories of drug administration, topical, parenteral, and enteral.

Drug Administration Routes refers to the various ways of inserting a drug or other chemical inside a patient or animal in order for the chemical to be absorbed into the blood and delivered to the target tissue.
There are several known ways to administer drug into an organism, but the easiest and the most commonly used method is through injection. 

==Topical Administration==
For topical drug administration, drugs are applied directly to the affected area. The effect reminds in the local area. The advantage of topical administration is that drugs can be given to the patient. No trained personnel are required for application. Usually, there is no pain involved in administration. Side effects are very minimal. 

==Epicutaneous==
Drugs are applied directly onto the skin surface. This administration can be used to test if a patient is allergic to certain drugs or substance. Epicutaneous administration can also be used for local anesthesia to relieve minor pain for cuts or burns.

===Eye Drops===
Drugs are applied directly into the affected eye. Eye drops are saline-containing liquid. Examples of eye drops are rinse eye drops, Glaucoma eye drops, steroid and antibiotic eye drops.

===Inhalational===
Drugs are inhaled through the mouth by the patient. Inhalational administration drugs can be used to treat asthma or acute infection in upper airway. The advantage of inhalational administration is that the response of body is much faster than oral administration because the drug does not have to go through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Also, because the drug does not have to go though liver, so the damage to liver is minimized. 

===Intranasal Route===
Intranasal route administration is also known as nasal spray. Examples of nasal spray are decongestant nasal spray or allergy relive.

==Parenteral Drug Delivery==
Parenteral drug delivery has systematic effect on the body, meaning that the drugs do not stay specifically at one area, but body as a whole. In parenteral drug delivery, substance is given by routes other than the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, intraarterial injection, etc.

===Intravenous Injection===
The substance is injected into the vein. The substance can be drugs. The first intravenous injection every given to a patient was in 1667. The advantages of intravenous injection are that the response is very rapid, the dosage of the drug can be easily controlled, and veins are insensitive to irritation by irritant drugs at higher concentration. However, there are many disadvantages of intravenous injection. First of all, it is not always easy to find a suitable veins. Veins disappear when a patient is under high pressure or tension. Second of all, intravenous injection can be toxic due to its fast response from the body. Third of all, a trained personnel is required, and the drug cannot be given to the patients. Last of all, it is rather expensive to prepare sterilizing the needles.

===Intramuscular Injection===
The substance is injected into the muscle. The substance can be vaccines or antibiotics. The advantages of intramuscular injection are that large volume of drugs can be applied and a sustainable release of drugs is possible. Muscles can act as an adsorption compartment. When the concentration of drug inside of the body is low, the muscle can slowly release the drugs into the body. However, there are also many disadvantages of intramuscular injection. Trained personnel are required for intramuscular injection; the drug cannot be given to the patients. Absorption is sometimes erratic, especially for poorly soluble drugs. The solvent of the drug may be released faster than the drug, causing the drug to precipitate at the site of injection and therefore immobilizes the drug.

===Subcutaneous Injection===
Subcutaneous injection is injection under the skin. Insulin is a good example for subcutaneous injection. The advantages of subcutaneous injection are that the drugs can be given to the patient because no trained personnel are needed, and the adsorption, even though slow, but is usually complete. The adsorption can be improved by applying massage or heat on the injected site. However, subcutaneous injections are very painful, irritating drugs can cause damage in the skin, and only a small dosage of drug can be applied. 

Below is a picture illustrating the difference between different kinds of injections.


===Intraarterial Injection===
Intraarterial injection is injection into the artery. 

===Intradermal Injection===
Intradermal injection is injection into the skin itself. Examples are skin testing for some allergen or tattoo.

===Transdermal===
Transdermal patch utilizes diffusion through the skin to sustain drug released. Examples are transdermal patch. Picture below demonstrates the difference between traditional intramuscular injection and a transdermal patch. As can be seen from the illustration, intramuscular injection can be much more painful than transdermal patch.

[[File:Transdermal microneedles.png|thumb|Illustration of skin penetration of a traditional intramuscular injection and a novel transdermal patch. The needles of transdermal patch are much smaller and shorter than that of intramuscular needle.]]

==Enteral==

===Oral===
		Many drugs can be made into tablets or capsules. The advantages of oral administration is that it is portable, convenient, easy to take, and not painful. It is cheap because the tablets do not need to be sterilized and can be produced in large quantities. However, oral administration can be sometimes inefficient because high dosage or low soluble drugs suffer low bioavailability. The drug will also be metabolized in the liver during adsorption, which is known as the first-pass effect. Also, the food the patient consumes may also alter the effect of the drugs. The drug can also be damaging to the normal gut flora in the GI tract. Last of all, oral drugs cannot be given to unconscious patient. 
===Rectal===
		Various drugs are produced in suppository or enema form.
===Gastric feeding tube===
		Many drugs or nutrition can be given to unconscious patients through gastric feeding tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial we'll create a &quot;number-guessing game&quot;.

It goes as follows: somebody thinks a random number and you try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

Each time you make a guess, you are given you one of the following answers:

# &quot;My number is bigger&quot;
# &quot;My number is smaller&quot;
# &quot;You guessed right!&quot;

When you finally guess the number, the game ends.

We'll start with a version without UI, and then make it more interactive.

== A first Implementation ==

In our case it is the computer the one &quot;thinking&quot; the random number. But how do we generate random numbers in Smalltalk to begin with? 

By reading the help of class &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;, we come across this two handy usage forms:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
(6 to: 12) atRandom.
10 atRandom.
&lt;/source&gt;

You can try that out in a Workspace.

Let's begin by creating a class &lt;code&gt;NumberGuessingGame&lt;/code&gt;. It should have the instance variable &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, which will hold the random number the player will try to guess.

Here is the class template:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
Object subclass: #NumberGuessingGame
  instanceVariableNames: 'number'
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: ''
  category: 'Smalltalk-Fun'
&lt;/source&gt;

We'll implement the initialization method as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
initialize
  number := (1 to: 100) atRandom.
&lt;/source&gt;

For now we'll be interacting with the game directly through the Workspace. 
Go to a Workspace and create an instance of our game:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game := NumberGuessingGame new.
&lt;/source&gt;

But we can't play yet! We would like to make guesses and receive an answer. It should work like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game responseForGuess: 34.  &quot;My number is bigger&quot;
game responseForGuess: 70.  &quot;My number is smaller&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

An simple implementation of this method could look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
responseForGuess: guess
  (number &gt; guess) ifTrue: [^ 'My number is bigger'].
  (number &lt; guess) ifTrue: [^ 'My number is smaller'].
  ^ 'You guessed right!'
&lt;/source&gt;

And now the game can begin.

Try it out in the Workspace, by entering guesses and &quot;print-it&quot; to see the answer.

== Better Interaction ==

Although it is possible to play by printing message-sends in the Workspace, it's not as inviting as it could be. Let's make this a more &quot;interactive&quot; experience.

For basic using interaction, like showing alerts or asking for information, there is the class &lt;code&gt;UIManager&lt;/code&gt;. There is a &quot;default&quot; (singleton) instance of this class already present in the system and ready to use.

First, we'll have the game ask us a number. The way to ask for input is by using the method &lt;code&gt;request:&lt;/code&gt;. It shows a dialog box where the user can enter some text. The call returns that text as a string. Try this in a Workspace, and make sure you &quot;print&quot; the resulting value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
UIManager default request: 'What is your name?'.   &quot;James Bond&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The dialog looks like this:

[[File:Smalltalk UIManager requesting name.png|thumbnail|none|Dialog-box requesting name]]

Second, we'll have the game tell us in a dialog box what the response is. This time the method is &lt;code&gt;inform:&lt;/code&gt;. Expanding on the example above, select and evaluate these statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
| name |
name := UIManager default request: 'What is your name?'.
UIManager default inform: 'Hello, ', name.
&lt;/source&gt;

It should look like this:

[[File:Smalltalk UIManager showing name.png|thumbnail|none|Dialog-box showing message]]

Armed with this knowledge we can implement our corresponding methods. One to ask for a number guess, and the other to show a response to the player:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
askForGuess
  ^ (UIManager default request: 'What is your guess?') asNumber.

showResponseToGuess: guess
  | response |
  response := self resposeForGuess: guess.
  UIManager default inform: response.
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember how the return value of &lt;code&gt;request:&lt;/code&gt; is of kind &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;? This is why we are converting it to a number with &lt;code&gt;asNumber&lt;/code&gt;.

It seems that we are ready to use these two methods together. Let's do just that in a new method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
&lt;/source&gt;

Go ahead and try it out in the Workspace:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game play.
&lt;/source&gt;

This is how the guess-input should look like:

[[File:Numberguess-ask-guess.png|thumb|none|Asking for a guess]]

This is how a response should look like:

[[File:Numberguess-number-bigger.png|thumb|none|Showing a response]]

== The game-loop ==

As you might have noticed, our game is short-lived. It only asks and responds once. Then it stops.

We need to do this repeatedly until the number is correctly guessed. The way to repeat a block of statements in Smalltalk is precisely by using the class &lt;code&gt;Block&lt;/code&gt;. Take a look at this class, especially in the category &quot;controlling&quot;.

We'll be using the method &lt;code&gt;doWhileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; in order to keep asking until the guess equals the random number. We use &lt;code&gt;doWhileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;whileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; because we want our block to be evaluated at least once, so that &quot;guess&quot; has at least one initial value.

The new version of &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess ] doWhileFalse: [ guess = number ].
&lt;/source&gt;

Try it out:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game play.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the game-loop is in place. The only problem is that the game keeps &quot;remembering&quot; the initial random number. Even after you won.

One solution of course is to &quot;re-initialize&quot; the game on the Workspace, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game initialize.
&lt;/source&gt;

It would be much nicer if this as part of our game-loop... but where exacly? Let's look at our alternatives:

* Before the game begins? It doesn't seem right, since we already chose a random number when the game was initialized.
* After the game finishes? It doesn't seem right either, since you could want to ask for the random number after you won.

This seems like a dilemma. If we just could know if a game was won or not... then we could re-initialize the game at the beginning, only if it was previously won. 

We'll just add that information to our game.

=== Adding game status ===

In order to store the game status we will introduce a new instance variable. 
Modify the class to look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
Object subclass: #NumberGuessingGame
  instanceVariableNames: 'number finished'
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: ''
  category: 'Smalltalk-Fun'
&lt;/source&gt;

The variable &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; will be initially &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, and become &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; when the game was won.

Accordingly, change the initialization method like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
initialize
  number := (1 to: 100) atRandom.
  finished := false.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we are ready to make the necessary changes to the &quot;game-loop&quot;.

Our first change will be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess ] doWhileFalse: [ guess = number ].
&lt;/source&gt;

This makes sure that if we re-start the game, it will pick re-initialize itself if the game was finished. And remember that in the initialization we set &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; back to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

However, something is missing: we never set &quot;finished&quot; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; after the game is won! 
Let's do just that:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess ] doWhileFalse: [ guess = number ].
  finished := true.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Refactoring the game-loop ===

The &quot;play&quot; method now does what we want. But the intention is somehow lost in too many low-level details. This goes against the &quot;Smalltalk way&quot; of doing things, and could use some refactoring. 

==== Separation of concepts ====

We'll try to separate concepts to different, intention revealing, methods. But before we do, allow me modify the assignment of &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; so that it's confined to the repeating block. You'll see why later:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  finished := (guess = number) ] doWhileFalse: [ finished ]
&lt;/source&gt;

A first consequence of this change is that we can switch to the more intuitive &lt;code&gt;whileFalse:&lt;/code&gt; (at least if you have experience in other programming languages). Since we don't have &quot;guess&quot; in the condition anymore, we can re-structure our look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  | guess |
  finished ifTrue: [self initialize].
  [ finished ] whileFalse: [ 
    guess := self askForGuess.
    self showResponseToGuess: guess.
    finished := (guess = number) ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, let's try to find out what our method is doing. We could come up with:

# It makes sure the game is properly re-initialized, if needed
# It performs the steps of a game interation
# It repeats the steps in a loop until the game is won

We'll refactor the re-initialization and the game-iteration to these methods:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
reinitializeIfNeeded
  finished ifTrue: [ self initialize ]

doOneIteration
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  finished := (guess = number).
&lt;/source&gt;

The refactored version of &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; now looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
play
  self reinitializeIfNeeded.
  [ finished ] whileFalse: [ self doOneIteration ]
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Different levels of abstraction ====

Something just does not feel right about the presence of &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; in both &lt;code&gt;doOneIteration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;. And that is that we are mixing abstraction levels: we have nice intention-revealing methods for the user interaction, the game-iteration and re-initialization, yet we still deal with the &lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt; variable directly. This is not elegant and something we could also improve.

For that, let's create these methods:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
isFinished
  ^ finished 

beFinished
  finished := true.
&lt;/source&gt;

And modify the calling sites accordingly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
doOneIteration
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  (guess = number) ifTrue: [self beFinished ]

play
  self reinitializeIfNeeded.
  [ self isFinished ] whileFalse: [ self doOneIteration  ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Before you go any further and try to play, make sure you re-initialize the game instance in the Workspace one last time:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game initialize.
&lt;/source&gt;

Otherwise you'll get an error when you try to &quot;play&quot;. This is because we introduced a new variable (&lt;code&gt;finished&lt;/code&gt;) that remained un-initialized (with &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;) in our existing instance. Alternatively, you can create a new instance altogether:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
game := NumberGuessingGame new.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we are ready to play again, as many times as we want.

== Number of tries ==

The goal of this game is not only to guess a number, but to do so in &quot;as few attempts as possible&quot;.

In order to make the game more challenging we could tell the user how many times he/she tried at the end. Let's introduce a new instance variable for this purpose:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
Object subclass: #NumberGuessingGame
  instanceVariableNames: 'number finished tries'
  classVariableNames: ''
  poolDictionaries: ''
  category: 'Smalltalk-Fun'
&lt;/source&gt;

Don't forget to initialize it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
initialize
  number := (1 to: 100) atRandom.
  finished := false.
  tries := 0.
&lt;/source&gt;

Each time the player makes a guess, this counter should go up by one. We stick to our hesitation to manipulate instance variables without revealing our intention, so we create this method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
increaseTries
  tries := tries + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

And call it thus:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
doOneIteration
  | guess |
  guess := self askForGuess.
  self showResponseToGuess: guess.
  self increaseTries.
  (guess = number) ifTrue: [self beFinished ]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The message at the end also needs to be changed. It should mention the number of tries. 

One way to accomplish this is by concatenating two strings:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
'Number of tries: ', tries asString.
&lt;/source&gt;

Another by using the &lt;code&gt;format:&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
'Number of tries: {1}' format: {tries}.
&lt;/source&gt;

And yet another, by using streams:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
'' writeStream
  nextPutAll: 'Number of tries: ';
  nextPutAll: tries;
  contents.
&lt;/source&gt;

To better illustrate, we'll combine the last two. This is how it looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
resposeForGuess: numberGuess
  number &gt; numberGuess
    ifTrue: [ ^ 'My number is bigger' ].
  number &lt; numberGuess
    ifTrue: [ ^ 'My number is smaller' ].
  ^ '' writeStream
      nextPutAll: 'You guessed right!';
      cr;
      nextPutAll: ('Number of tries: {1}' format: {tries});
      contents
&lt;/source&gt;

It it very correct and object oriented, but looks pretty much complicated for just concatenating two strings and a number. 

Of course that part could also be written like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;smalltalk&quot;&gt;
  ^ 'You guessed right!
Number of tries: {1}' format: {tries}.
&lt;/source&gt;

It is up to you.

However, if when choosing this variant you have to be careful that the sentence &quot;Number of...&quot; really is at the beginning of the next line. This is because within string-literals Smalltalk will honor all newlines, tabs, etc. In our case we have an explicit newline character.

Now play again, and see how many tries you need in average to beat the computer.

=== Steroid and Thyroid hormones ===
[[File:Steroid and Thyroid hormones.jpg|thumb|Steroid and Thyroid hormones]]

Both of them are hormones which are lipid soluble. These hormones can pass across the cell membrane and enter into cytosol or even the nucleus. Cholesterol is the single precursor molecule for Steroid hormones. The estrogens (female sex hormones) and androgens (male sex hormones) are two classes of steroid hormones. Estrogen can diffuse across the membrane of a target cell and interact with a specific receptor with the cytoplasm. After forming of steroid-receptor complex, it can pass through nucleus membrane and enter into the nucleus. In the nucleus, it changes the transcription of mRNA for certain protein.

Thyroid hormones can regulate growth. Also it can play a role in stimulating the breakdown of proteins, fats, and glucose. Thyroid hormone secreted from the thyroid gland. They similarly diffuse across the plasma membrane and get into the nucleus. The thyroid-receptor complex influences certain transcription essential for some metabolic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., Tymoczko, John L., and Stryer, Lubert. Biochemistry. 6th ed. New York, N.Y.: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2007: 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences Between Androgen and Estrogen ===

Firstly, a hormone is produced chemically through the endocrine gland and possesses a specific effect on the activities of various organs in the body. Specific activities with which hormones help are growth and development, sexual function, reproduction, mood, and metabolism. The major endocrine glands through which hormones are produced are the pituitary, pineal, thymus, pancreas, thymoid, and adrenal glands. The primary male and female hormones are called the androgen and the estrogen. Males can produce these hormones in the testes, while women produce them in the ovaries. Although males and females possess both of these types of hormones, they possess them in significantly different amounts. For instance, the majority of males produce an immense amount testosterone, a form of an androgen, whereas women barely produce any amount. This relationship is the same with a male possessing levels of estrogen. Males still do produce this hormone, but in extremely small amounts daily.


Androgen: They are a group of hormones that play a role in male characteristic traits and reproductive activity. It is also considered a steroid, such as testosterone, that regulates the development of masculine characteristics. The male characteristics that androgens help develop include secondary sex characteristics that boys develop when going through puberty. Also, androgens influence sperm-cell formation and sexual interest and behavior. 
Androgens may be called &quot;male hormones.&quot; Both men's and women's bodies produce androgens, just in differing amounts. In fact, androgens have more than 200 actions in women.
The principal androgens are testosterone and androstenedione. They present in much higher levels in men. Other androgens include dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S).
In a woman's body, one of the main purposes of androgens is to be converted into the female hormones called estrogens.
In women, androgens are produced in the ovaries, adrenal glands and fat cells. In fact, women may produce too much or too little of these hormones-disorders of androgen excess and deficiency are among the more common hormonal disorders in women.
In women, androgens play a key role in the hormonal cascade that kick-starts puberty, stimulating hair growth in the pubic and underarm areas. Additionally, these hormones are believed to regulate the function of many organs, including the reproductive tract, bone, kidneys, liver and muscle. In adult women, androgens are necessary for estrogen synthesis and have been shown to play a key role in the prevention of bone loss, as well as sexual desire and satisfaction. They also regulate body function before, during and after menopause.

About Androgen-Related Disorders:
a) High Androgen Levels
Excess amounts of androgens can pose a problem, resulting in such &quot;virilizing effects&quot; as acne, hirsutism (excess hair growth in &quot;inappropriate&quot; places, like the chin or upper lip) and thinning hair.
Many women with high levels of a form of testosterone called &quot;free&quot; testosterone have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by irregular or absent menstrual periods, infertility, blood sugar disorders, and, in some cases, symptoms like acne and excess hair growth. Left untreated, high levels of androgens, regardless of whether a woman has PCOS or not, are associated with serious health consequences, such as insulin resistance and diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease.
In addition to PCOS, other causes of high androgen levels (called hyperandrogenism) include congenital adrenal hyperplasia (a genetic disorder affecting the adrenal glands that afflicts about one in 14,000 women) and other adrenal abnormalities, and ovarian or adrenal tumors. Medications such as anabolic steroids can also cause hyperandrogenic symptoms.

b) About Low Androgen Levels:
Low androgen levels can be a problem as well, producing effects such as low libido (interest or desire in sex), fatigue, decreased sense of well-being and increased susceptibility to bone disease. Because symptoms like flagging desire and general malaise have a variety of causes, androgen deficiency, like hyperandrogenism, often goes undiagnosed.
Low androgen levels may affect women at any age but most commonly occur during the transition to menopause, or &quot;perimenopause,&quot; a term used to describe the time before menopause (usually two to eight years). Androgen levels begin dropping in a woman's age of 20, and by the time she reaches menopause, they have declined 50 percent or more from their peak as androgen production declines in the adrenal glands and the midcycle ovarian boost evaporates.
Further declines in the decade following menopause indicate ever-decreasing ovarian function. For many women, the effects of this further decline include hot flashes and accelerated bone loss. These effects may not become apparent until the women are in their late 50s or early 60s.

About Treatment for Low Androgen Levels:
Combination estrogen/testosterone medications are available for women in both oral and injected formulations. Small studies find they are effective in boosting libido, energy and well-being in women with androgen deficiencies, as well as providing added protection against bone loss. However, the risks from the combination of estrogen and testosterone include increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer, adverse effects on blood cholesterol and liver toxicity.
Testosterone is also an effective treatment for AIDS-related wasting and is undergoing studies for treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and autoimmune diseases. Women with PMS may have below-normal levels of testosterone throughout the menstrual cycle.

Estrogen: They are the sex hormones produced primarily by a female's ovaries that stimulate the growth of a girl's sex organs, as well as her breasts and pubic hair, known as secondary sex characteristics. Estrogens also regulate the female menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.gender.org.uk/about/06encrn/62_hormn.htm] Androgen and Estrogen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estrogen is the general name for a group of hormone compounds. It is the main sex hormone in women and is essential to the menstrual cycle. Although both men and women have this hormone, it is found in higher amounts in women, especially those capable of reproducing. Secondary sex characteristics, which are defining differences between men and women that don't relate to the reproductive system, are determined in part by estrogen. In women, these characteristics include breasts, a widened pelvis, and increased amounts of body fat in the buttock, thigh, and hip region. This hormone also contributes to the fact that women have less facial hair and smoother skin then men.
It is also an essential part of a woman's reproductive process. Estrogen regulates the mentrual cycle and prepares the uterus for pregnancy by enriching and thickening the endometrium. Two hormones, the luteinzing hormone (LH) and the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), help to control how the body produces estrogen in women who ovulate. Estrogen is manufactured mostly in the ovaries, by developing egg follices. Moreover, it produced by the corpus luteum in the ovaries, as well as by the placenta. The liver, breasts and adrenal glands may also contribute to its production, although in smaller quantities. 
There are three distinct compounds that make up this hormone group: estrone, estradio and estriol. During a woman's reproductive life, which starts with the onset of menstruation and continues until menopause, the main type of estrogen produced is estradiol. Enzymatic actions produce estradiol from androgens. Testosterone contributes to the production of estradio, while the estrone is made from andostenedione. 

Estrogen is important to a woman's health beyond just how it relates to her reproductive cycle. Although it can cause women to retain fluid, and early exposure through early menses can increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, this hormone has significant benefits.

'''&lt;big&gt;Androgens as related to women&lt;/big&gt;'''

In women, androgens are produced in the adrenal glands, ovaries, and fat cells. Disorders involving excess or inadequate levels of androgens in women constitute many of their common hormonal disorders. For women, the key roles of androgens are to aid in the starting of puberty and to regulate the function of certain organs. For adult women, androgens are needed for estrogen synthesis and are involved in the prevention of bone loss, and in sexual desire and satisfaction

==The Three Chemical Classes of Hormones==
There are three general classes of hormones characterized by their structure, and not their function. The three categories are:

1. Steroids
Steroids are lipids which are formed from cholesterol. Examples include testosterone and cortisol. These hormones are given off by gonads, adrenal cortex, and the placenta. Steroids are natural substances with many different effects in the human body, which begin over several days. The primary use of steroids in health care is to reduce inflammation and other disease symptoms. Steroid inhalers have an important role in reducing deaths from asthma, local steroid injections are useful in treating painful joints and ligaments. Steroid creams are used extensively to treat eczema and other inflammatory skin conditions. Steroids make the whole immune system less active, which can be very useful in illnesses where there is an immune component. Steroids are the ultimate anti-inflammatory drugs.
However, steroid use in medicine is limited by very serious side effects in the body as a whole. That is why steroids tend to be used sparingly in local preparations such as sprays and creams, which ensure maximum steroid dose where it is needed, and minimum levels in the blood stream.
Steroids also affect the brain, and high doses can make people feel happy, euphoric, hyped-up, with disturbance of sleep and even serious psychiatric illness such as mania, very aggressive behavior and psychosis (delusions, pananoia, loss of touch with reality). If steroid users are also taking other drugs which affect mood or brain function, these side-effects can be far more common.
Steroids are really useful in the care of those with advanced cancer when short life expectancy from their condition means physicians are far more relaxed about long term side-effects.
Brain tumours often respond dramatically to steroids. The reason is that the brain is contained in a bony box inside the skull and pressure can build up inside the head, resulting in headaches, sickness, drowsiness and other problems. Brain scans often show that a tunour the size of a wallnut can be surrounded by a big immune reaction, with brain swelling and inflammation. Steroids reduce the additional swelling, often reversing symptoms and buying time. The underlying cancer continues to grow if the person finally begins to deteriorate death often follows rapidly as the steroid dose is reduced.
So steroids are really powerful, with wide ranges of actions, producing dramatic effects ranging from pain relief to mood elevation, and if it were not for the very serious side effects, they would be used even more often.
The body becomes dependent on steroids and when used in health care, most physicians reduce dosage gradually, even though they may start in an acute illness with a very high dose.


2. Peptides

Peptides are the most common type of hormones and contain a chain of amino acids. Examples include TRH and vasopressin. These hormones are given off by the heart, liver, stomach, kidney, pituitary gland, and parathyroid. Peptides play a crucial role in fundamental physiological and biochemical functions of life. For decades now, peptide research is a continuously growing field of science.
When the number of amino acids is less than about 50, these molecules are named peptides while larger sequences are referred to as proteins. 
The amino acids are coupled by a peptide bond, a special linkage in which the nitrogen atom of one amino acid binds to the carboxyl carbon atom of another.
Peptides (proteins) are present in every living cell and possess a variety of biochemical activities. They appear as enzymes, hormones, antibiotics, receptors, etc.
Synthetic peptides may be useful in structure-function studies of polypeptides, as peptid hormones and hormone analogues, in the preparation of cross-reacting antibodies, and in the design of novel enzymes.
Peptides are synthesized by coupling the carboxyl group or C-terminus of one amino acid to the amino group or N-terminus of another. There are two strategies for peptide synthesis: liquid-phase peptide synthesis and solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).


3. Amines
Amine-derived hormones are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan. Examples include catecholamines and thyroxine. These hormones are given off by the thyroid and adrenal medulla.
In amines, the hydrogen atoms in the ammonia have been replaced one at a time by hydrocarbon groups.
Amines fall into different classes depending on how many of the hydrogen atoms are replaced.
In primary amines, only one of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule has been replaced. That means that the formula of the primary amine will be RNH2 where &quot;R&quot; is an alkyl group.
In a secondary amine, two of the hydrogens in an ammonia molecule have been replaced by hydrocarbon groups. 
In a tertiary amine, all of the hydrogens in an ammonia molecule have been replaced by hydrocarbon groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Summary of the Digestive System ===

The digestive system deals primarily with the breakdown of food polymers into smaller molecules to provide energy for the body. 

 
'''1.)''' The entire digestive process can be simplified through the individual processes of ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination. Through analysis of each of these processes, an effective comprehension of the organs that make up the digestive system can be observed. During the process of ingestion, an organism utilizes mechanical digestion by chewing the particular food of interest. In this situation, the mouth, also known as the oral cavity, acts as the source of increasing the food’s surface area by creating it into a bolus, a smaller and more circular version of the food that will subsequently be swallowed down the esophagus. Besides these organs, there are also accessory glands that contribute to ingestion as well such as the tongue and the teeth. Through observing the digestion portion of the digestive system, enzymatic hydrolysis can be witnessed in which the esophagus transfers food down from the oral cavity and towards the stomach in which hydrochloric acid and pepsin allow the chemical breakdown of the food. Next, in the absorption portion of the digestive system, nutrient molecules enter body cells within the small intestine. Lastly, the elimination process of the digestive system is closely connected with the excretory system in which the undigested material of an organism becomes eliminated from the body.

'''2.)''' With the general idea and characteristics about the digestive system recently observed, the structure and function of the digestive system of three different types of organisms can be examined: a human, an invertebrate, and a non-mammal vertebrate.

*Firstly, in the human digestive system, there is an alimentary canal, also known as a complete digestive tract, which represents a digestive tube extending between two openings, a mouth and an anus. The mouth acts as the initiating factor of the digestive tract and digestion initiates with the very first bite of any particular food type in which subsequent chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily digested. Simultaneously, saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breakdown into a form that the body can more readily absorb. Generally, humans are considered to be omnivorous, consuming both meat and plant-like objects. 

*Secondly, the digestive system of the invertebrate octopus will be observed. An octopus also possesses a two way digestive system consisting of a mouth and an anus. In contrast the typically omnivorous human diet, the octopus is a carnivorous creature with a diet generally consisting of lobster, crab, and shrimp. Utilizing their incredibly strong beaks to kill and consume their prey, the food will be digested in the stomach and digestive sac and then released from the anus. 

*Thirdly, as for a non-mammal vertebrate, a turtle’s digestive system can be observed. The digestive system of turtles is similar to that of other vertebrates. Unlike amphibians, they do not have mucous glands, but do have salivary glands. Turtles swallow their food whole or in large chunks and as this occurs, the salivary glands empty into the mouth and moisten the food to aid in swallowing. Although omnivorous in general, most turtles are at least partly carnivorous which cause them to possess strong digestive enzymes. The turtle's tongue is broad and flat while being firmly attached to the bottom of the mouth, preventing the tongue from moving. Alligator snapping turtles have small worm-like appendages on their tongues. These appendages can be filled with blood and are allowed to wiggle. With the turtle's mouth open and appendage wiggling, the alligator snapper can attract small fish to catch more effectively. The walls of the turtle's digestive tract are made of smooth muscle tissue and the muscles contract, pushing food down the esophagus and intestines towards the stomach.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://health.nih.gov/category/DigestiveSystem], Digestive System &amp; Personal BILD2 Essay.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;references/&gt;

==In-depth Steps in the Digestive System==
'''Ingestion'''
The act of ingestion begins the process of the whole digestive system. Ingestion begins when an organism puts a consumable in their mouth, and mechanical digestion begins in the form of chewing and breaking down the food. Performing mechanical digestion allows for the consumed food to increase in surface area, which allows for easier digestion and absorption of nutrients. During this time, the food turns into a bolus to allow for easier swallowing. Also during mechanical digestion, saliva is secreted in order to protect the lining of the mouth from the mechanical digestion. Saliva contains several enzymes, including amylase which protects the lining of the mouth, as well as mucin, which aids in swallowing. After mechanical digestion by chewing, and chemical digestion with saliva, the bolus of food is pushed into the esophagus, and moves down the throat by peristalsis.

'''Digestion''' 
There are two important forms of digestion where molecules are broken into smaller pieces for absorption, known as mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs first in the oral cavity and begins with the chewing of food. Polysaccharides and sugars are only broken down in the oral cavity. Chemical digestion then follows as the salivary glands produce saliva and brings it through ducts to the oral cavity where it helps the breakdown of food. There is an enzyme in saliva called amylase that hydrolyzes polysaccharides and disaccharides into simple sugars in a process known as enzymatic hydrolysis. The tongue helps shape the food into a bolus and aid with swallowing. Once swallowing has occurred, the bolus of food reaches the pharynx, a region in that throat that opens to up to either the trachea (which leads to the lungs) or the esophagus (which leads to the stomach). During swallowing, there is a cartilage flap called the epiglottis that covers the glottis, an entryway that leads to the trachea so that food will not go down the wrong way and end up blocking the windpipe. Because this entryway is blocked, the larynx is able to guide the bolus of food to the esophagus entryway. There is an esophageal sphincter that regulates the movement of material in and out of the esophagus. This sphincter contracts when person is not swallowing and contrastingly, it relaxes when swallowing occurs so that the bolus of food can travel down the esophagus to the stomach. Chemical digestion is also prevalent in the stomach. The bolus of food is further broken down by the stomach’s gastric juices, which is composed of HCl and pepsin. The strongly acidic HCl helps to break down the extracellular matrix in the bolus of food, while the pepsin, being a protease, aids in breaking down peptide bonds and digesting proteins in the food. As the bolus is mixed with the gastric juices, the stomach constantly churns until the bolus turns into chime. Various other organs assist in the digestion of food, with the liver aiding in lipid breakdown, and the pancreas secreting bicarbonate to neutralize the HCl in gastric juice.

&lt;u&gt;''Chemical Digestion in the Stomach''&lt;/u&gt; The stomach utilizes strong chemicals and enzymes that would normally destroy organic matter easily. The stomach is able to protect itself from its own gastric juices by carefully synthesizing the chemicals together to efficiently digest the bolus of food and turn it into chyme. The entire inside of the stomach is lined with a layer of mucus, as well as other layers of epithelial cells that are replaced every few days. The stomach utilizes hydrochloric acid as a means to destroy harmful bacteria as well as to denature the proteins in the bolus. Because hydrochloric acid can cause high damage to the stomach, the H+ ions and Cl- ions are kept separate until it is needed for digestion. Separate parietal cells in the stomach keep the ions separate, until they use ATP to drive the H+ and Cl- ions out, where they react in the stomach lumen to form the HCl. HCl is also able to activate pepsinogen into pepsin, a useful enzyme that specializes in protein cleaving and digestion. Stomachs that do not have the proper defensive ways to utilize the HCl and pepsin within the gastric juice often get damaged stomachs, leading to gastric ulcers.

'''Absorption'''
	Absorption of nutrients begins in the small intestine. The small intestine has massive surface area lined with villi and microvilli, which help aid in absorbing the nutrients from the chyme. Afterwards, the chyme goes through the large intestine, which is divided into three parts: the colon, cecum, and appendix. The cecum aids in fermenting the ingested food, and the colon reabsorbs water and other nutrients that the body might’ve used during the digestive process. As the ingested material passes through the intestines by peristalsis, usable nutrients are absorbed, while waste is left behind in the form of feces.

'''Excretion'''
	The final stage in the digestive system is excretion, in which the ingested food is now formed as a (usually) solid waste known as feces. The feces is excreted out of the body via the anus, ending the digestive process for the particular ingested food.

==Gastric Juice Production==
There are gastric glands located on the interior surface of the stomach. The gastric glands have three different types of cells that are responsible for secreting the parts that make up the gastric juice such as mucus, pepsin and hydrochloric acid. The parietal cells in the gastric gland secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl). The chief cells secrete an inactivate form of pepsinogen that is not activated to pepsin until it comes into contact with hydrochloric acid in the lumen of the stomach. Lastly are the mucus cells that secrete mucus, a substance that protects the lining of the stomach. Gastric juice does not destroy stomach cells that make it because all these ingredients remain inactive until they are released into the lumen. Pepsinogen and HCl are first secreted into the lumen of the stomach. Hydrochloric acid converts the pepsinogen (inactive form) into pepsin. And pepsin, the activated form begins a chain reaction, activating more pepsinogen. Gastric juice begins the process of chemical digestion of proteins in the stomach.

==Digestion in the Small Intestine==
The small intestine is the longest compartment of the alimentary canal and is the major organ of digestion and absorption. This is the site where the rest of the digestion and enzymatic hydrolysis processes takes place, followed by absorption. First portion of the small intestine is the duodenum, where acid chyme combines with the gastric juices of the pancreas, liver, gall bladder.

==Hormonal Control of Digestion==
*When food arrives at the stomach, it causes the walls to stretch and this stimulates the release of the gastrin hormone from the stomach. Gastrin will travel through the bloodstream and come back to target the stomach, causing the stomach to release gastric juices.
*Once chyme passes from stomach to duodenum, it triggers the release of hormones, secretin and cystokinin (CKK) because of the fatty acids and amino acids present in the chyme. The secretin works positively on the pancreas to stimulate the release of bicarbonate, which will help break down fats into fatty acids and neutralize acid chyme. Meanwhile CCK stimulates the gallbladder to release bile, which is a detergent that breaks down fats into smaller fats. CCK also stimulates the pancreas to release more digestive enzymes that can hydrolyze fats. 
*The secretin hormone and CKK both have inhibitory responses and act negatively on the stomach to slow down digestion and the production of chyme. 

==Absorption in the Small Intestine==
The jejunum and ileum are parts of the small intestine that are strictly responsible for absorption. The large surface area of the small intestine is due to the villi and microvilli that are exposed to the intestinal lumen. This large microvillar surface increases the rate at which nutrients are absorbed. The villi and small epithelial cells make up and line the border of the small intestine. Nutrients can be transported across the epithelial cell through passive or active transport. Sugar moves through passive diffusion down the concentration gradient into the epithelial cell, it then gets collected in small blood capillaries and travels through the circulatory system. Meanwhile amino acids, peptides, vitamins and glucose are pumped actively against the concentration gradient by the epithelial cells and then circulated throughout the bloodstream by capillaries. Fats, on the other hand, need to be reassembled in the lymphatic system and transported differently. 

'''Absorption of Fats''' 
In the lumen, the fat molecules, called triglycerides undergo enzymatic hydrolysis during which the enzyme, lipase breaks down the fat molecules into fatty acids and monoglycerides. The smaller molecules made up of fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse into the epithelial cell. In the epithelial cell, the small molecules revert back to being triglycerides which are mixed with cholesterol and coated with protein to form chylomicrons. These molecules leave the epithelial cells and are transported into the lacteals.

==Absorption in the Large Intestine==
While the primary function of the small intestine is to absorb nutrients and water, the large intestine functions to absorb mainly water. The colon is a part of the large intestine that connects to the small intestine and leads to the rectum and anus. The colon functions to recover the water that enters the alimentary canal. The cecum connects where the small and large intestine meet and helps in the fermentation of plant material. In humans, the cecum also has an extension known as the appendix. The appendix does not play a large part in immunity. Feces are any wastes from the digestive tract. As they move through the colon, they become more solid and ultimately pass through the rectum and leave out through the anus. 

==Appetite Regulating Hormones==
There are hormones secreted by tissues and organs in the body that then are transported through the bloodstream to the satiety center, a region in the brain that triggers impulses that give us feelings of hunger or aid in suppressing our appetite. Ghrelin is a hormone that is released by the stomach and targets the pituitary, signaling to the body that it needs to eat. PYY is a hormone that is released by the small intestine and counters ghrelin. It is released by the hypothalamus and signals that you have just eaten and helps to suppress our appetite. The pancreas releases the hormone insulin, which targets the hypothalamus  and also aids in suppressing our appetite after we have just eaten and there is a rise in blood glucose levels. The last hormone is leptin which also helps to suppress appetite. Leptin is produced by adipose fat tissue and targets the hypothalamus. 

==Mucin's Role in Gastrointestinal Tract Diseases==

The intestinal barrier is composed of a mucin (glycoproteins) layer and tight junctions between epithelial cells as well as by regular epithelial cell replacement which protects the intestine from mechanical stress produced by the passage of digested food through the gastro intestinal (GI) tract, molecular breakdown from digestive enzymes, and foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. While providing protection, the mucin layer must allow the passage of digested molecules through to be absorbed by epithelial cells. Unraveling the depth of protection by the mucin layer to all damaging vectors can develop a comprehensive understanding of mucin’s potential role in many intestinal diseases&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;.
[[File:Mucin (glycoproteins) In GI Tract.JPG|thumb|Mucin (glycoproteins) In GI Tract]]

Up to 20 mucin genes have been identified and are broadly classified as either secretory or membrane-associated large glycoproteins&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;. Recent studies have shown that the mucin layers in the GI tract vary in mucin protein composition, mucin layers, and mucin thickness&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;. The mucin layer has been shown to prevent digestive enzymes from entering the wall of the intestines&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;. The mucin layer can be compromised if there is a structural abnormality or production of the glycoprotein is altered. This results in poor protection of the intestinal wall and can lead to systemic damage to the body.


For example, shock is a physiological process that still kills many individuals through multiple organ failure. Recent studies have shed light on the role the intestine plays in this process. The intestinal mucosal barrier becomes compromised during shock and no longer performs as a barrier&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt;. When this occurs, the luminal contents of the intestine, including cytotoxic free fatty acids (FFAs), may enter the wall of the intestine causing damage both to it and other organs&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;.

A complete comprehension of mucin’s role as a protective agent can lead to a greater understanding of many GI diseases and complications and the role mucin has in each. Diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn’s Disease, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome could be treated more efficiently since mucin plays a role in each. Shock victims would also benefit since many of the complications arise from the breakdown of the intestinal barrier&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Crohn's Disease ===

Another disease that involves the digestive system, Crohn’s disease, causes inflammation within the digestive tract. The end part of the small intestine called the ileum is the most commonly affected towards the Crohn’s disease. Normally, the movement of muscles in the GI tract and the release of hormones and enzymes allows for the digestion of food. However, in Crohn’s disease, inflammation occurs in the inner lining of the affected part of the GI tract and the subsequent effect of inflammation and swelling can cause pain and can cause emptiness within the intestines, resulting in diarrhea. A long lasting type of inflammation may produce scar tissue that builds up inside the intestine to create a stricture, a narrowed passageway that can decrease the movement of food through the intestine, causing pain or cramps. Crohn’s disease is considered an inflammatory bowel disease, the general name for diseases that cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines. Crohn’s disease can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis. For example, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease both share the characteristics of abdominal pain and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns/index.aspx], Crohn's Disease.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory process primarily involving the intestinal tract. Although it may involve any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus, it most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine (ileum) and/or the large intestine (colon and rectum). Crohn's disease is a chronic condition and may recur at various times over a lifetime. Some people have long periods of remission, sometimes for years, when they are free of symptoms. There is no way to predict when a remission may occur or when symptoms will return.

==Symptoms==
Because Crohn's disease can affect any part of the intestine, symptoms may vary greatly from patient to patient. Common symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and bloating. Not all patients experience all of these symptoms, and some may experience none of them. Other symptoms may include anal pain or drainage, skin lesions, rectal abscess, fissure, and joint pain (arthritis).

Common Crohn's symptoms: 
•Cramping - abdominal pain
•Diarrhea
•Fever
•Weight loss
•Bloating
•Anal pain or drainage
•Skin lesions
•Rectal abscess
•Fissure
•Joint pain

Who does Crohn's disease affect?
Any age group may be affected, but the majority of patients are young adults between 16 and 40 years old. Crohn's disease occurs most commonly in people living in northern climates. It affects men and women equally and appears to be common in some families. About 20 percent of people with Crohn's disease have a relative, most often a brother or sister, and sometimes a parent or child, with some form of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease and a similar condition called ulcerative colitis are often grouped together as inflammatory bowel disease. The two diseases afflict an estimated two million individuals in the U.S.

==Causes==
The exact cause is not known. However, current theories center on an immunologic (the body's defense system) and/or bacterial cause. Crohn's disease is not contagious, but it does have a slight genetic (inherited) tendency. An x-ray study of the small intestine may be used to diagnose Crohn's disease.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is almost always with medication. There is no &quot;cure&quot; for Crohn's disease, but medical therapy with one or more drugs provides a means to treat early Crohn's disease and relieve its symptoms. The most common drugs prescribed are corticosteroids, such as prednisone and methylprednisolone, and various anti-inflammatory agents.
Other drugs occasionally used include 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, which are immunosuppressive. Metronidazole, an antibiotic with immune system effects, is frequently helpful in patients with anal disease.
In more advanced or complicated cases of Crohn's disease, surgery may be recommended. Emergency surgery is sometimes necessary when complications, such as a perforation of the intestine, obstruction (blockage) of the bowel, or significant bleeding occur with Crohn's disease. Other less urgent indications for surgery may include abscess formation, fistulas (abnormal communications from the intestine), severe anal disease or persistence of the disease despite appropriate drug treatment.

While it is true that medical treatment is preferred as the initial form of therapy, it is important to realize that surgery is eventually required in up to three-fourths of all patients with Crohn's. Many patients have suffered unnecessarily due to a mistaken belief that surgery for Crohn's disease is dangerous or that it inevitably leads to complications.
Surgery is not &quot;curative,&quot; although many patients never require additional operations. A conservative approach is frequently taken, with a limited resection of intestine (removal of the diseased portion of the bowel) being the most common procedure.
Surgery often provides effective long-term relief of symptoms and frequently limits or eliminates the need for ongoing use of prescribed medications. Surgical therapy is best conducted by a physician skilled and experienced in the management of Crohn's disease.

What is a colon and rectal surgeon?
Colon and rectal surgeons are experts in the surgical and non-surgical treatment of diseases of the colon, rectum and anus. They have completed advanced surgical training in the treatment of these diseases as well as full general surgical training. Board-certified colon and rectal surgeons complete residencies in general surgery and colon and rectal surgery, and pass intensive examinations conducted by the American Board of Surgery and the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery. They are well-versed in the treatment of both benign and malignant diseases of the colon, rectum and anus and are able to perform routine screening examinations and surgically treat conditions if indicated to do so.

==Genetic study==

Scientists have recently conducted new research into the genetics of inflammaroy bowel disease such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These research studies have recently reveals new insights into the origin of this set of illnesses.

Researchers have presented information of linked genetic variations in 163 regions of the human genome that are at heightened risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of those discovered regions, 71 are newly discovered. IBD includes various automimmune digestive disorders that affect nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. Symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patients with IBD typically have to undergo lifelong treatment with medications and other forms of drug therapy.

In recent studies, researchers analyzed data from about 34,000 people who took part in 15 previous studies of either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. They also examined more than 41,000 DNA samples data from genome-wide scans of patients of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These samples were collected around the world from 11 different centers.

Since 163 regions were found to develop IBD, 71 were newly found and the other 92 regions were confirmed. Both groups were confirmed to be prone to inflammatory bowel disease. The way these regions were analyzed was done by overlapping those linked with other autoimmune diseases, suggesting IBD results from overactive immune defense systems that can evolve into serious bacterial infections.

Sceintists have stated, &quot;Until this point we have been studying the two main forms of IBD -- Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis -- separately,&quot; co-lead author Judy Cho, professor of gastroenterology and genetics at Yale School of Medicine, said in a Yale news release. &quot;We created this study based on what seems to be a vast amount of genetic overlap between the two disorders.&quot; The new studies reveal &quot;a genetic balancing act between [the immune system] defending against bacterial infection and attacking the body's own cells,&quot; co-lead author Jeffrey Barrett of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England, said in the news release. &quot;Many of the regions we found are involved in sending out signals and responses to defend against bad bacteria. If these responses are over-activated, we found it can contribute to the inflammation that leads to IBD.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Lactose Intolerance ===

Just as any other organ system, the digestive system remains susceptible to diseases such as Lactose Intolerance. Individuals who are diagnosed with Lactose Intolerance experience the inability to effectively digest lactose, a carbohydrate often found in dairy products such as milk, cheese, ice cream, and cream cheese. The inability to digest lactose is due to the lack of an enzyme called lactase in which its production is found in cells within the small intestine. For a normal individual without Lactose Intolerance, the enzyme lactase would break down the carbohydrate lactose.  If someone diagnosed with Lactose Intolerance were to have any dairy product such as the ones stated above in their system, various problematic digestive system symptoms may soon result such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea.  However, there are actually some individuals with Lactose Intolerance who can consume an adequate amount of dairy products without experiencing harsh symptoms. Generally, the effects of these symptoms possess mild to severe extremities solely based on the amount of lactose digested as well as the individual’s particular lactose tolerance.

Lactose intolerance may be diagnosed by two common tests: Hydrogen Breath Test and Stool Acidity Test. In Hydrogen Breath test, the patient drinks a large dose of milk and their breath is analyzed regularly to check the amount of hydrogen. Usually, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. However, those with lactose intolerance will have high levels of hydrogen due to the undigested lactose. The accuracy of this test may be affected by smoking. The second method of detecting lactose intolerance, Stool Acidity Test, is primarily used for infants and young children. If lactic acid and glucose are present, it may be determined that the child has lactose intolerance. 

Many people are concerned about their calcium intake if they are lactose intolerant. Some foods with high calcium contents are rhubarb, sardines, spinach, salmon, and soy milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance], &quot;National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC).&quot; Lactose Intolerance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intro ==
Contraception, or birth control, is a form of family planning. This method prevents unwanted pregnancies and sometimes also prevents sexually transmitted diseases. Some forms of birth control are meant for only males, and others are meant for women. 

Other family planning techniques include abstinence, surgical sterilization, natural family planning, and withdrawal.

== Barrier Methods ==

Barrier methods of contraception are used as a physical or chemical forms of blockading sperm from having access within the uterus to prevent any fertilization of an egg, and thus, a pregnancy. They have no considerable side effects, except for any allergies to the materials within the devices, and can be used right before sexual intercourse. 

'''Male Condoms''': This is the most common form of contraception within the modern world. A male condom is used by a male by rolling the thin tube onto an erect penis before any type of intercourse. It became a very popular contraceptive method in the 20th century and is the most effective form of birth control that prevents most sexually transmitted diseases if only used once. The earliest type of male condom were made from animal products, and are considered high-end on the American markets today. The most common type of condoms sold and purchased today is the latex rubber condom and is available in lubricated or non-lubricated varieties.

'''Female Condoms''': These type of condoms look very similar to the male condoms, but are actually inserted into the female instead of on the male. It is a single-use, pre-lubricated, polyurethane sheath that is also used before sexual intercourse. It has two rings--one that is inserted to the upper vagina and the other stays on the outside of the vagina and covers the vulva and surrounding area of the vagina. It is not as widely used due to the costliness of the materials. 

'''Spermicides''': Spermicides are chemicals that are used to kill sperm, and, therefore, not allowing them to enter the vagina and causing a pregnancy. In some cases, they can even kill some sexually transmitted diseases. They are available in the form of gels, jellies, foams, pessaries, and water-soluble films. Usually used in conjunction with other types of barriers, spermicides are safe in low amounts, as high dosages could damage the vaginal lining, sensitize the penis, and even help increase the chances of being infected with HIV. 

'''The Sponge''': Sponges can come in varying kinds and sizes. It is usually made of disposable and soft polyurethane and paired with a spermicide. It is a choice of contraception for women because it is very convenient--women just need to wet the sponge in water, insert into the vagina, and it would be effective for the next 24 hours, despite the number of sexual acts. Despite its convenience, it is still not as effective as other contraceptive techniques. 


'''Cervical Cap''': The rubber, metal, or latex cervical cap is a small, cup-like instrument that is placed on the cervix within the vagina. Spermicide can be placed within the dome to ensure that sperm is blocked physically as well as chemically. Some types of cervical caps must use suction with the vaginal walls in order to be in place during sexual intercourse. Since every cervix is different, every woman must be fitted by a medical professional properly. Few women actually use this method of barrier contraception because there are not many professionals that are trained in the fitting of the cervical cap. In the U.S., the FDA approved three types of the cervical cap--small, medium, and large. The small cervical cap is designed for women who have never gotten pregnant, the medium is for women who have had a miscarriage, abortion, or had birth by Caesarian section, and the large cap is for women who have had a live and natural birth.

'''Diaphragms''': Like the cervical cap, the diaphragm is also a contraceptive barrier that is used at the cervix. This dome-shaped device can be made from latex or silicone and is expanded over a ring. There is a spring on the rim of the ring that also creates suction onto the vagina. Just like the cervical cap, the diaphragm is also needed to be fitted depending on the size of the cervix. The drawback to this method is that the diaphragm must be placed three hours before sexual intercourse.


== Hormonal Methods ==

Hormonal methods of contraception are used to impede fertilization and ovulation of an egg through the manipulation of ovarian hormones, such as progesterone and estrogen. These methods include oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectables, implants, birth control patch, and vaginal contraceptive ring. Although these forms of contraceptives do help prevent unwanted pregnancies, they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases.

==== Oral Contraceptives: ==== 

'''Combined Oral Contraceptives:''' These contraceptives are available in the form of pills, which must be taken once everyday. The pill impedes the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the pituitary, which doesn't allow for the maturation of follicles in the ovaries. By the human body's feedback loop, the luteinizing hormone (LH) increases, which then prevents ovulation of eggs within the ovary. In addition to the decrease of ovulation, the increase of progesterone in the pill increases the cervical mucus, which creates a harsh environment for sperm. The two types of birth control pills include the combination progesterone and estrogen pill and the progesterone-only pill. Usually, women must orally take 20, 21, or 22 active pills, which contain a measured amount of combined progesterone and estrogen, and then followed by inactive sugar pills. During the time that the woman is taking the inactive pills, less menstrual bleeding would take place than if the woman was not on the pill. These pills imitate a normal, yet regulated, menstrual system. Examples of combined oral contraceptives include Yaz, Yazmin, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Desogen.      

'''Continuous-Use Oral Contraceptives:''' These pills also must be used everyday orally and contain a combination of progesterone and estrogen. The purpose of these pills is to decrease the number of menstrual periods and the duration of the periods within the year. With continuous-use oral contraceptives, women must take active pills for 12 weeks straight and then take 7 inactive pills. A drawback to this method is that women will experience breakthrough bleeding and spotting. An example of this type of contraceptive include Seasonique.    

'''Progesterone-Only Pills''': These pills only contain progesterone in order to increase the thickness of cervical mucus and decrease the infiltration of sperm. This method also utilizes once-a-day pills, just like combined oral contraceptives and continuous-use oral contraceptives. Many providers choose to prescribe this contraceptive to women who have experienced adverse side effects with the estrogen in the combined pills. Progesterone-only pills are not as effective as the combination pills. 

'''Emergency (Postcoital) Contraception''': This method of contraception is used orally and only once immediately after (approximately 24-36 hours) the woman has experienced unprotected sexual intercourse that may lead to an unwanted pregnancy. Yet, it may still be effective up to five days after  unprotected sexual intercourse. This &quot;Morning After Pill&quot; only contains a dosage of 750 mg of levonorgestrel in each pill. It is meant to be a single use, and not continuously.

==== Intrauterine Devices: ==== 

Intrauterine devices, or IUDs, are plastic devices placed within the cervix that could contain copper and/or release levonorgestrel and are used to inhibit sperm from reaching an implanted egg. Earlier versions of the IUDs had a copper-based branch to stabilize it within the vagina. With the more modern plastic variation, it was observed that as the size of the device increased, the menstruation became heavier, and women were more prone to vaginal infections if they ever had sexual contact with anyone with STDs. With this type of contraceptive, there are many risks that appear to outweigh the advantages. 

==== Injectables: ====

Injectables are a long-lasting and more efficient versions of the oral contraceptives. Injectables are available to women as 3-monthly intramuscular injection with a high dosage of medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), or known as Depo-Provera, and as a 2-monthly intramuscular injection with a dosage of norethindrone enanthate, or NET-OEN. The only negative aspect with using injectables as a form of contraceptive is how to maintain a regular dose for a long period of time. 

It is projected that the use of injectables will be more common in the future as compared to other methods of contraception. The progestin-only injectables are most likely going to be the most commonly used and offered, such as the 3-monthly DMPA and the 2-monthly NET-EN. In terms of the combined injectable, a monthly dose would be available. A 3-monthly injectable made with levonorgestrel butanoate is being improved, which works similarly to DMPA. With a 3-monthly dose, such as DMPA, the greatest advantage is that there is a low amount of synthesized chemicals circulated within the body, as well as faster and easier for women to stop taking the contraception in order to become fertile again. Also, less hormonal chemicals would result in less ovarian limitation and less risk of amenorrhea, or the lack or miss of one or more menstrual periods. 

Depo-Provera is a type of long-acting hormonal method by injection that is very successful in its purpose of contraception, but is difficult to remove from the body and takes a longer time for the individual to become pregnant again. Norethindrone enanthate, a reduced progestogen version of Depo-Provera, provides a slight relief from the adverse side effects of Depo-Provera, but the woman would need to be injected every 2 months instead. 

Side Effects of injectables as a form of long-acting contraception include large fibroids, amenorrhea, hypertension, diabetes, delayed return of ovulation, etc. In some cases, the continued use of injectables is associated with osteoporosis. These injectable preparations last so long that if the patient were to want to cease this form of contraception, it may take weeks to months in order for fertility to return once again.   A main side effect of Depo-Provera is bone density loss over time.  It is suggested for the patient to intake calcium supplements in order to counteract this side effect.  Depo-Provera is not suggested to use for more than two years.

=== Subcutaneous Implants ===

These implants provide a consistent and long-lasting method of contraception. Implants must be surgically placed subcutaneously and also removed from the same area. In terms of its structure, implants usually have a steroid placed inside of a capsule or rod. Because this form provides a steady dose of progestogens, implants usually contains a smaller amount of hormones than injectables and oral contraceptives. Surgical insertion and removal usually requires a professional and removal takes a longer time than insertion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I taught Japanese-English interpreting to professionals in Japan for some years, at the excellent School of International Studies in Yotsuya.  This piece reminds me a bit of any of my very good bu not quite there students.  OK for day to day professional work, e.g. in a bank, but not good enough for the United Nations, Mombusho or the State Department.
 
I'm not that great on biochemistry, but I lived with it for many years: my first wife, the excellent Susie Schmidt, was one of Jim Watson's editors from about 1972 onwards.  Still, I'd be happy to give this a copy edit if the author would drop me a line.  david.lloydjones@gmail.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Clinical Trials ==
[[File:LSD-clinical-trial-bottle.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample of Drug Candidate for a Clinical Trial]]
In the United States, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requires that potential drugs be demonstrated to be effective and safe before they may be used in human beings on a large scale. This requirement is particularly true for drug candidates that are to be taken by people who are relatively healthy. The trials test the effectiveness and potential side effects of a candidate drug before it is approved by the FDA for general use. 

=== Phases ===

Clincial trials proceed in at least three phases. 

&lt;u&gt;Phase 1:&lt;/u&gt; In phase 1, a small number (10-100) of healthy volunteers take the drug for an initial study of safety. These volunteers are given a range of doses and are monitored for signs of toxicity. 

&lt;u&gt;Phase 2:&lt;/u&gt; In phase 2, the efficacy of the drug candidate is tested in a small number of persons who might potentially benefit from the drug. Further data regarding the drug's safety are obtained. Such trials are often controlled and double-blinded. 

&lt;u&gt;Phase 3:&lt;/u&gt; In phase 3, similar studies are performed on a larger population (thousands). This phase firmly establishes the efficacy of the drug candidate and to detect side effects that may eventually develop in a small percentage of the subjects who receive treatment. 

Only after the conclusion of all three phases can a drug be approved for clinical use by the public. 

===Reasons===

Clinical studies are designed to add medical knowledge related to treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of diseases or conditions. Some common reasons for conducting clinical studies include:

* Evaluating one or more interventions for treating a disease, syndrome, or condition
* Finding ways to prevent the initial development/recurrence of a disease or condition
* Examining methods for identifying a condition or risk factors for that condition
* Exploring ways to improve the comfort and quality of life of people with a chronic illness through supportive care

=== Methods ===

Clinical Trials are usually led by a principal investigator, who is often a medical doctor. Clinical studies have a research team that may include doctors, nurses, social workers, and other health care professionals. Clinical studies can take place in many locations, including hospitals, universities, doctors' offices, and community clinics. The location depends on who is conducting the study. 

Controlled studies involve a group of individuals given a placebo and a second group that is given the actual drug. These studies also tend to be double-blinded, so that neither the subjects nor the researchers know which subjects are in the treatment group and which are in the control group. This approach prevents bias in the course of the trial. After the completion of the trial, the assignments of the subjects are unsealed and the results for the two groups are compared. A variety of doses are often investigated in phase 2 trials to determine which doses appear to be free of serious side effects and which does appear to be effective.

=== Cost/Time ===

Clinical trials tend to be extremely expensive. Costs can run from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. Extensive records and documentations are filed and subsequently compiled for submission to the FDA. The full cost of developing a drug is currently estimated to be from $400 - $800 million dollars. 

According to one study, it takes an estimated 15 years for a drug to go from lab to patient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Inhalation is a drug administration route in which a drug or inhalant is smoked. Inhalation is effectively used medically for several anesthetics. The onset of this drug administration route is quite rapid due to the fact that there are capillaries located in the lungs, making it easy for the drug to quickly enter the bloodstream. Once the drug is in the bloodstream, it takes approximately five to eight seconds for the drug to reach the brain.

==Problems with Inhalation==
Although inhalation is an effective method of drug administrations, there are three factors that must be kept into consideration with medically using this drug administration method.

1. Drugs and materials must not be irritating to the mucous membranes and lungs.&lt;/br&gt;
2. Controlling the dosage may be more difficult than other drug administration methods.&lt;/br&gt;
3. The drug must be administered until the desired effect is met. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Benadryl, also known as Diphenhydramine, is an antihistamine drug. It is usually found as a crystalline, white powder and is soluble in water and alcohol. Diphenhydramine is typically used for treating allergic reactions. 

In the body, histamine is released when one suffers through an allergic reaction or even viral infections. The histamine then binds to cell receptors, triggering changes in the cell that lead to allergy symptoms such as itching and sneezing.

As an antihistamine drug, diphenhydramine competes against the histamine for the cell receptors. The antihistamine not only prevents histamines from binding and stimulating the cells but while doing so, it also binds to the receptors—they do not stimulate the cells, therefore allergy symptoms will not show.

==History== 
Benadryl was discovered by George Rieveschl, who took part in many experiments with focus on relieving muscle pain at University of Cincinnati. Benadryl is an antihistamine drug that used for treating people who suffer with allergy.  Benadryl was first available through prescription in 1946. Later in 1980s, it was approved as over-the-counter drug.

==Content==
Benadryl contains the histamine-blocker diphenhydramine.  This drug will help patients to recover from common symptoms: sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose, and sore throat. One application of Benadryl is Benadryl Chesty Cough &amp; Nasal Congestion: a drugs that is used to relieve the symptoms of chesty cough and cold.

==Side Effects==
Do not use this drugs if you are currently treating with depression, heart condition, blood pressure, and behavioral disorder.
As many other drugs, Benadryl does have some common side effects:
* sleepiness
* dizziness
* headache
* dry mouth
* difficulty urinating.

==Chemistry==
Diphenhydramine is synthesized as shown below. The molecular formula of Diphenhydramine is C&lt;small&gt;17&lt;/small&gt;H&lt;small&gt;21&lt;/small&gt;NO • HCl.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
An intravenous (IV) injection is a drug delivery method which the drug is directly injected into the bloodstream. With this method, the onset of the action is much rapid since the drug is being administered directly into the bloodstream. Delivering a drug intravenously can be beneficial when using irritating material since blood vessel walls are highly insensitive to irritants. High concentrations and dosages of drugs can be delivered intravenously much quicker than other methods, which can be beneficial, yet dangerous at the same time.

==Disadvantages with using Intravenous Injections==
Although intravenous injections can be quick, there are some disadvantages with using this method. A major disadvantage of using IV injections is that repeated injections at the same site results in the area surrounding vein injection site losing its strength and elasticity. In worst case scenarios, if a particular injection site has been punctured into several times, the wall of the vein collapses and blood will no longer move through it. Another concern of using IV injections is the transmission of infections. Contaminated needles and syringes should not be used more than once; nor should they be shared between patients.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The term epicutaneous refers to the route of topical drug administration by which the drug, poison, fluid, or other substance is taken into the body via direct skin application. The three major routes of administration include: topical, in which the effect is local; enteral, in which the effect is non-local; and parenteral, in which the effect is systemic. Epicutaneous medications range from lotions, creams and ointments to powders, patches, and tinctures. Other topical medications may be inhaled or applied to surfaces of tissues other than skin. Topical medications taken in excess can result in adverse skin reactions such as itching, inflammation and redness; however, if consumed properly can yield the desired outcome.

==Permeation Through Skin==
The skin acts as a barrier separating the internal body structures from the external environment, maintaining a slightly acidic pH as to prevent against pathogens and other foreign invaders. There are several layers of skin: the outer layer called the epidermis, followed with the dermis, followed with an innermost layer of fatty tissues. The two principal routes of drug administration through the skin are:

1) Transepidermal absorption:
This process outlines diffusion of substances across the stratum corneum. Diffusion can occur via the intercellular lipoidal route or through a microscopic route designed for polar compounds and ions. Because the epidermis structure is extremely compact leaving little intercellular space, permeation calls for the crossing of cell membranes. Yet the greatest struggle lies in penetration through the dermis, where diffusion occurs through the interlocking channels of the substance.

2) Transfollicular (shunt pathway) absorption:
Sebaceous and eccrine glands operate as the skin's appendages and channels of drug absorption by acting as shunts that bypass the stratum corneum. The overall mechanism progresses through partioning and diffusion through the sebrum, the driving force being a concentration gradient. An equation has been formulated to describe this process:
R = h/FDK 

R =Resistance of diffusion resistor,
F = Fractional area,
H = Thickness,
D = Diffusivity,
K = Relative capacity,

==Epicutaneous Applications==
1) Allergy Testing:
Antigen extracts are applied to the skin as puncture skin tests. This method measures the reactivity of the skin to the injected material. This can be carried out through the scratch test, prick test, or intradermal test. 

2) Local Anesthesia:
Local anesthesia provides immediate relief to the region of application by numbing the sensation and causing a loss of nociception. These drugs can be classified either as aminoamide or aminoester and are given as an injection, spray, or ointment. These are often used for dental or dermal purposes. 

3) Transdermal Patches:
Transdermal patches overlap under the parenteral category but some can fall under the epicutaneous category as well. They serve a wide array of purposes:

*Prevention of motion sickness: Scopalamine was the first transdermal patch to be approved by the FDA, in 1979.
*Birth control
*Hormone replacement therapy: To alleviate symptoms of menopause.
*Cessation of tobacco smoking
*Allergy tests

4) Arthritis Pain:
These drugs exist mainly as creams that work to immediately and temporarily mitigate the sensations of arthritis in the hand. They come in a few forms:
*Counterirritants
*Salicylates
*Capsaicin

5) Wounds/Rashes: Skin conditions can be treated with the usage of creams, lotions, gels, ointments, or in some cases steroids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each molecule has a set of symmetry operations that describes the molecule's overall symmetry. This set of symmetry to classify molecules is known as point group
Group theory is a powerful mathematical tool in determining the symmetry, properties, and data of complex molecules. 
Molecules are said to belong to the same point group if they have the same symmetry response under a set of operations. That is to say, two molecules can have totally different shapes but belong to the same point group as long as the respond the same to some symmetry operations.
A molecule can only belong to one point group. It cannot belong to more than one point group. 

It is important to understand that point groups is a tool for categorizing the different symmetries a molecule might have. This tries to classify molecules based on their molecular shapes and symmetries. There are various symmetry elements used to illuminate the shape of the molecule. The shape and symmetry of a molecule is highly important especially in structural biochemistry because structure determines functions of proteins and molecules. It is also important to note that many molecules are constantly going through conformational change, therefore its point group can also change. Point group is a tool for us to understand on a molecular level, symmetry. &lt;ref name=&quot;Point groups&quot;&gt;[http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/grossman/stereo/pointgroups.HTML Point groups], November 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coxeter diagram finite rank2 correspondence.png|thumbnail]]

=Types of Point Groups=
Molecules can be separated by the symmetry elements that they contain. The different Symmetry operations can be classified into:
[[File:Ammonia-2D.svg|thumb||right|Ammonia|150x150px]]
-'''Rotation operation (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;):'''  is rotation of 360/n degrees about a rotation axis that renders the object unchanged.. For example, ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) contains a threefold rotational axis, which gives it a C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; operation. Objects or molecules can have more than one rotational axis. An example of an object with more than one rotational axis is a snowflake or octahedron. [[File:Snowflake-black.png|thumb||right|Snowflake|150x150px]]
 
-'''Reflection operation (σ):'''  is a reflection across the mirror plane where when the object remains unchanged when reflected. There are three different σ's. The first is σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;where the mirror plane is parallel to the primary axis of rotation and an outer atom. A σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is a mirror plane that is also parallel to the primary axis of rotation but it does not pass through an outer atom, rather it is between two outer atoms. An exception to this is in T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;, in which all mirror planes are referred to as σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. The last mirror plane is such that is a horizontal reflection σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; where the plane of reflection is perpendicular to the primary axis of rotation. A primary axis of rotation is the axis with the greatest number of rotational symmetry folds. Objects and molecules can also have more than one plane of reflection.[[File:Sigma v.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;]][[File:Sigma d.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;]][[File:Sigma h.jpg|thumb|text-bottom|σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]]

-'''Inversion operation (i):''' is a combination of a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation and a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; operation to invert the molecule across a point of inversion, which is usually taken to be the center of the molecule. It is a reflection (or inversion) through the mid-point (center) of the object or molecule.

-'''Improper Rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;):''' is the rotation of 360/n, followed by reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. An S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; operation is identical to an inversion (both being a 180 degree rotation, followed by a reflection across the perpendicular horizontal axis).

-'''Identity (E):''' is merely a rotation by 360 degrees around an arbitrary axis that returns an equivalent configuration. Every molecule has at least an E operation.
==Examples==
O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; – octahedral point group – contains all symmetry elements and operation of a perfect octahedron.
[[File:Octahedron-2-3D-balls.png|thumb||center|Figure I. Octahedron. ]]

C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; : An infinite number of mirror plane parallel to an infinite number of rotation axis.
[[File:Carbon-monoxide-3D-vdW.png|thumb||center| ]]
 

D&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; : not only has an infinite number of rotation axis and mirror planes but also has a two-fold rotation perpendicular to these infinite number of rotation axis. D&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; also has an inversion center.

C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;
There is a 3-fold primary rotation axis and 3 mirror planes parallel to that axis.

D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;
Designates that there are 3 two-fold rotational axes perpendicular to a three-fold primary axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to that primary axis.


==How to Work a Point Group Flow Chart==
All molecules have some type of symmetry or lack thereof, and can be grouped into categories (called point groups) where all molecules with the same symmetries have the same point group. To facilitate the determination of a molecule's point group, without having to exhaustively determine every one of its symmetry properties, a point group flow chart can be used. A molecule's point group can be easily determined by finding how many rotational and mirror planes it contains in a logical manner. The less symmetrical an object is, the more difficult symmetry operations are needed to determine its point group, where as the higher symmetries are more easily determined. This allows users to answer simple questions based on the shape of the molecule. If one is able to understand the point group flowchart, there requires no memorization. Therefore point group determination is quite simple, all it requires is knowledge of types of point group and some visualization. &lt;ref name=&quot;point group&quot;&gt;[http://symmetry.otterbein.edu/tutorial/pointgroups.html pointgroup], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many other point groups such as C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;5v&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;5h&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. Memorizing the definition of all the point-groups is overwhelming. To simplify this, point group of a molecule can be easily found by following a flow chart. First, start with determining if the molecule is linear or not. If it is,then determine if there is an inversion center. If the molecule is not linear, check if there are two or more C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, where n is greater than two. If yes, then determine if there is an inversion center and if there is a C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; rotation axis. If there are two or more C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s, then check if there are C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s at all. If so, then check if the C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; with the higher n is perpendicular to nC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;. &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;If so, then determine if the molecule has a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; or σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. If there aren't two or more C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s, then check if there is a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, nσ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, or S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;. These are the cases where there is a C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, but if there aren't any C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'s then check if there is a σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; of inversion center. If this is done correctly, the arrival at the end of a chain will be the point group for the observed molecule.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:Flow chart.png|center|Point Group Flow Chart]]

=Example of how to use the flow chart=
[[File:Water molecule like Micky mouse.png|thumb||center|Water molecule]]
Above is a figure of water molecule. Following the flow chart:
1.	The molecule is not linear
2.	The molecule does not have more than 2 axis of rotation other than the primary axis
3.	The molecule has a proper C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; primary rotation
4.	But the molecule does not have 2 other proper rotation axis perpendicular to the primary rotation axis
5.	The molecule does not have a mirror plane perpendicular to the primary axis

==High Symmetry Point Groups==
Molecules of high symmetry are of certain geometric shapes like Linear, Octahedral (O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), Tetrahedral (T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;), and Icosahedral (Ih) shapes. Although there are some variations in these symmetries, they are often rare in nature.

-'''C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt;''' are linear molecules with an infinite number of rotations along the primary rotation axis, and an infinite number of reflection planes containing the rotation axis. They have no center of inversion, and are usually two atom molecules.

-'''D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt;''' are also linear molecules with an infinite number of rotations along the primary axis and an infinite number of reflection planes containing the rotation axis. The three main difference from a C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; are that a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes and a reflection plane exist perpendicular to the primary axis of rotation, and an inversion center.

-'''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' molecules have a tetrahedral geometry (but don't always have the shape of a tetrahedral). They have 4 C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axes, 3 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes, 3 S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axes, and 6 mirror planes. However, they lack C4 axes.

-'''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' molecules are most commonly those with octahedral structure. They typically have 4 C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rotations, 3 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotations, and an inversion center

-'''I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' molecules are identified by their C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; axes, along with its inversion center.

==Low Symmetry Point Groups==
C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a molecule with no symmetry other than the identity operation, E.
C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is a molecule with only a mirror plane and the identity operation, E.
C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; contains only an inversion center and the identity operation, E.

The subset of pure reflectional point groups, defined by 1 or 2 mirrors, can also be given by their [[Coxeter group]] and related polygons. These include 5 crystallographic groups. The symmetry of the reflectional groups can be doubled by an [[isomorphism]], mapping both mirrors onto each other by a bisecting mirror, doubling the symmetry order.

=== Reflective subset groups ===
[[File:Coxeter_diagram_finite_rank3_correspondence.png|thumb|Finite isomorphism and correspondences]]
The subset of pure reflectional point groups, defined by 1 to 3 mirror planes, can also be given by their [[Coxeter group]] and related polyhedra. The [3,3] group can be doubled, written as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;3,3]], mapping the first and last mirrors onto each other, doubling the symmetry to 48, and isomorphic to the [4,3] group.

==Representations==
Irreducible representation is used to create a character table for that point group. 

-A value of 1 means that the symmetry does not change its orbital position

-A value of 0 means the operation changes orbital's position

-A value of -1 means the orbital does not change its symmetry but inverts its sign.

Reducible representation is simply a combination of irreducible representations.

==Character Table==
Character tables are designated by these characters which means different operations.

-x,y,x is the transformation of the x,y,z coordinates

-R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation about the x, y, z axes

-R is any symmetry operation like C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

-X is the character of operation

-i, j is the designation of different representations such as A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

-h is the total number of symmetry operations in the group (order)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
An intramuscular (IM) injection is a drug administration route in which a drug is injected into a muscle. In terms of absorption, the injection methods that delivers the drug quickest to slowest is intravenous, intramuscular then subcutaneous. It is favored due to its fast-acting as well as long-lasting capabilities. These injections are inserted into the deep muscle tissue where the deposition of medication is absorbed gradually into the bloodstream. 

==Absorption==
The three main sites of intramuscular injection is in the deltoid muscle of the arm, buttocks and the thighs. Absorption is quickest when injecting into the arm and slowest in the buttocks. 

==Advantages==
When injecting into the muscle, there is less chance of irritation due to greater blood supply and faster absorption. Also, when wanting to inject larger amounts of drugs, it is best to inject into the the muscular region instead of injecting subcutaneously.

==Procedure==
Needle should not be smaller than an inch nor exceed one and a half inches in length. The maximum volume of medication recommended should be five milliliters at one site per adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Eye drop is a tropical drug administration route in which a medicated solution of saline-containing liquid is administered to the surface of the eye. Though most of the eye drop usually is lost through patient reaction or resides on the surface of the eye, some of the drug enters the bloodstream through the mucous membranes that line the cornea as well as through the conjunctival mucosa and parts of the tear drainage system. A major advantage of eye drop administration is the ease of regular application of high concentrations of medication as well as its lack of need to go through intestinal digestion. Drugs that are administered through the usage of an eye drop can either be in a fully aqueous solution or in suspension (cloudy).

Eye Drop is a drug that is given to patients after eye surgery,or when having severe dry eyes. Eye drops can help with clearing eyes to make it better for sight.

==Types of Eye Drops==
1) Rinse eye drops&lt;/big&gt;''' 

Rinse eye drops are solutions that help lubricate or replace the tears of the eyes. Rinse eye drops do not necessarily contain any medication. This is the most common form of eye drop administration. 

2) Antibiotic and steroid eye drops

Antibiotic and steroid eye drops are predominantly used for treating eye infections. They also can be used to prevent infections from occurring after eye surgeries. 

3) Glaucoma eye drops

Glaucoma eye drops assist in the draining of fluid from eyes, which in turn lowers eye pressure. Glaucoma eye drops can vary vastly and are sometimes combined with many other medications that vary on a patient’s need.

4) Antihistamine eye drops

Antihistamine eye drops contain antihistamines, which inhibit a body’s response to allergens. They work by inhibiting the release of histamines into the body. They do not necessarily target the allergens, but allow the patient to cope better with its presence. Antihistamine eye drops are used to lessen the histamine response in the eye.

5) Steroid and antibiotic eye drops

These eye drops are used to treat eye infections. It must be used for the full time prescribed to avoid relapse of the infection. The medication may sting your eyes when first used.

6) Glaucoma eye drops

These eye drops decrease eye pressure by helping the eye's fluid to drain better. They are classified by their active ingredient.

==Side Effects==
As many other drugs, eye drops are considered to have some side effects: sore throat, fever, rash, itching, dizziness, swelling.
One of the most common side effects is eye redness after using the eye drop. This will lead to pain in eyes or problem with visions that one should be cautious. But in fact, eye drops are less risky than tablet medicines and sometimes, these risks can be prevented from pressing the inner corner of the eye after using. If you do not use them the correct way then you can infect not only one eye, but both eyes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Professor Nobuhiko Katunuma (1926-November 11, 2013) was one of the world’s leading scientists specialized in proteolysis in general and cysteine proteinases and their corresponding inhibitors in particular. As a renowned scientist, Professor Katunuma’s research interest is related to the medical and biomedical field as his great uncle, Professor Seizo Katsunuma, the President of Nagoya University, had told him ‘Biochemists working at Medical Schools should contribute in the fight against diseases in man’. His scientific contribution was rewarded with the ‘1990 National Violet Ribbon Decoration for Scientists and Artists’ award. Besides being a successful researcher, Professor Katunuma is also an inspirational colleague and dedicated mentor. His passion for science and intrigued ideas always provoke his coworkers. He usually observes his students’ experiment closely and also involves himself in these experiments to enhance his scientific sense even further. Nowadays, more than 30 researchers who had been Professor Katunuma’s mentee have become Professors or Laboratory Heads or even established their own laboratory. Outside his love for structural chemistry, Professor Katunuma is also interested in photography, music and Kendo, or Japanese sword fencing. 

==Biography==
Professor Nobuhiko Katunuma was born in 1926 in Nagasaki, Japan. He graduated from the School of Medicine at Nagoya University in 1953. After earning his Doctor of Philosophy in medical sciences, he completed his Postdoctoral with Professor Hugo Theorell at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. After that, he moved back to Japan and became an Associate Professor at the Institute of Protein Research, Osaka University. In 1963, he moved to the Institute of Enzyme Research, School of
Medicine at Tokushima University. With his widely successful scientific career and dedication to young researchers, Professor Katunuma was promoted to be the Director of the Institute since 1971 and also served as Dean of the Medical School at Tokushima University from 1980 to 1982. In 1992, he retired from Tokushima University and continued his research at the Institute for Health Sciences, at Tokushima Bunri University. 

==Academic Career==
During the first 30 years at Tokushima University, Professor Katunuma’s main research was about the enzymes involved in vitamin B6 metabolism and their intracellular protein turnover. Together with his colleague Mitsuko Okada, he discovered mitochondrial glutamicoxalacetic transaminase and the urea cycle glutaminase isoenzymes. Later on, with his colleague Yasuhiro Kuroda, he established the enzymes’ functions in the hepatocarcinogenesis.

In 1971, he discovered the acceleration of pyridoxal enzyme turnover in animals with vitamin B6 deficiency and the enzymes participate in proteolysis of the apoproteins. These discoveries suggested that protein degradation can be initiated by the apoprotein formation in proteolysis process. This idea provoke further research into the initiation of various biochemical pathways by limited proteolysis, such as prothrombin activation by mast cell tryptase histamine release by mast cell chymase, and initiation of influenza virus entry by tryptase Clara. In his later years at Tokushima University, he also conducted a research project specialized in the role of lysosomal enzymes and their inhibitors in intracellular proteolysis. His studies on the 3D structure of protease enzyme cathepsin B in human in collaboration with Robert Huber led to his subsequent studies on chemically designed specific-inhibitors against enzyme cathepsins. With these studies, Professor Katunuma established himself as one of the pioneers in the field of structural based drug synthesis.

In 1992, after his retirement from Tokushima University, he started his second career as Professor and Director of the Institute of Health Sciences in Tokushima Bunri University. In his new position as the President of Tokushima Bunri University, Professor Katunuma actively involved in the development of new synthetic cysteine protease inhibitors, the derivatives of E-64 and the CLIK inhibitors, and studied the role of cysteine proteases in bone resorption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is Mass Spectrometry'''
Mass Spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics that works by measuring the mass to charge ratio of ionized particles. Mass Spectrometry is a very useful method because it can accurately distinguish ions that differ by a single atomic mass unit. 

'''Contribution to proteomics'''     
Mass spectrometry in conjunction with other protein purification techniques have significantly contributed to the advancement in proteomics. Mass spectrometry was used to identify plasma membrane proteins, study plasma membrane topology, protein protein interactions and the plasma membrane signaling networks. Often times MS is coupled with other specific techniques. For example, in the study of plasma membrane topology H/D MS is used. In this technique the rate of H/D exchange is measured to gain a better understanding of the protein's structure. Because the rate of H/D exchange is affected by the environment and positioning of specific parts of the protein, basic topology of the protein can be modeled using this technique. 

'''Significance of proteomics'''  
Studying proteins and their properties allows scientists to explain how a specific cell process takes place. Once the protein's role in the process is thoroughly understood, steps in a specific cell process can be modified by changing the property of the proteins involved. This is significant because it can have huge pharmaceutical applications. For example, scientists can develop a drug that targets the active site of a specific protein that regulates cell division to combat cancer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) is the sum of atomic wave functions that lead to the formation of molecular orbitals. 

==Parameters==
-The symmetry of the orbitals must have the same sign overlap

-The energy of the atomic orbitals must be smaller

-The distance between the atoms must be short enough to provide good overlap of the orbitals.

[[File:Dihydrogen-MO-Diagram.svg|thumbnail]]

The Linear combination of atomic orbitals are essential for molecular orbital understanding and building the molecular orbital diagram. The Linear combination of atomic orbitals or LCAO are tools that have described groups of orbitals as linear combinations of basic functions. The LCAO helps us understand symmetry of a molecule and how the ligands surround the center. &lt;ref name=&quot;Linear combination of atomic orbitals&quot;&gt;[http://www.mpcfaculty.net/mark_bishop/molecular_orbital_theory.htm Linear combinations of atomic orbitals], November 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==s Orbital Bonding==
s Orbital bonding is when their two electron clouds overlap and merge into a large molecular electron cloud. This results in a linear combination of the atomic orbitals. 
Bond order is defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{B.O.} = \frac{\text{number of bonding electrons} - \text{number of antibonding electrons}}{2}\ &lt;/math&gt;
This has to be positive in order for a stable bond to be created. The overall number of bonding and antibonding electrons determine the number of bonds

Bonding molecular orbital is where both atomic wave functions contribute, which has a lower energy than the original atomic orbitals
Antibonding molecular orbital is the cancellation of waves functions, at a higher energy than the original atomic orbitals.
Nonbonding molecular orbital is when the orbital of one atom has a symmetry that does not match the orbital of any other atoms 

==p Orbital Bonding==
p Orbital bonding occurs when the two orbitals overlap, the overlapping regions have the same sign. As a result, the sum of the two orbitals has an increased electron probability in the overlap region. 
The overlap of two opposite signs leads to a node of zero electron density. As a result, the orbitals of Px, Py, and Pz are to be considered separately.

==d Orbital Bonding==
The transition medals bond in a similar way as p orbitals, but results in Dyz, Dz^2, Dyz, Dxz, Dx^2-y^2, and Dxy. 
The Dxz and Dyz orbitals form pie orbitals whereas the Dx^2-y^2, and Dxy orbitals are collinear to the z axis. 

==Paramagnetic vs. Diamagnetic==
Paramagnetic compounds are attracted by an external magnetic field due to one or more unpaired elections that are attracted to the magnetic field
Diamagnetic compounds are not attracted by an external magnetic field because all the electrons are paired.
This can have profound effects on metal compounds.

      <comment>/* The Steps of Meiosis */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Overview'''==

'''Meiosis''' is the process in which a cell reduces its cell from being a diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, to being a haploid, having one set of the twenty-three chromosomes, when creating eggs and sperm. A haploid cell will combine with another haploid cell (one from an egg and one from a sperm) to form a diploid cell. This will result in the right number of chromosomes, 46. During this process, abnormalities of the number of chromosomes usually occur in humans.

=='''The Process of Meiosis'''==
This process happens in the cell nucleus, where there is a pair of chromosomes from each parent. Chromosomes replicates when the chromosomes from both parents are copied and paired to exchange portions of their own DNA. Chromosomes, that are similar, will pair up. The paired chromosomes will swap portions of their DNA, creating a mix of new genetic material in the offspring's cell. When the nucleus divides up into daughter cells, the chromosome pairs are divided. The daughter nuclei will divide again, resulting in further division of chromosomes. The daughter nuclei will end up having single chromosomes and a new mix of genetic material. 
[[File:Meiosis Overview.svg]]

=='''The Steps of Meiosis'''==
Unlike mitosis, meiosis undergoes two replications rather than one. It is because of these two divisions that allow for the resulting daughter cells to end up with only half of the number of chromosomes, or haploid, from the total amount of chromosomes, or diploid. The steps goes as follows:

&lt;u&gt;Meiosis I&lt;/u&gt;

'''Prophase I''': just like in mitosis, during the prophase step, DNA is condensed into very thick like rodes. In additon the nuclear membrane or envelope along with the nucleoli dissappear which allows for free DNA roaming. The spindle apparatuses begin to form ready for the metaphase step. One difference between mitosis prophase and meiosis prophase I is that as the DNA condenses, the chromosomes are visible as tetrads, in other words, homologous DNA pairs, which is not seen in mitosis.

'''Metaphase I''': The tetrads of chromosomes are lined up on the equator of the cell with the spindle apparatus having already been completely formed. It is during prophase I and metaphase I where genetic recombination occurs. When the homologous pairs of DNA, or tetrads, are first lined up against each other, a event called crossing over occurs at the chaismata. Crossing over events happen between neighboring tetrads which swap genetic information with each other. More genetic variation comes from metaphase I specifically in the sense that tetrads can line up completely randomly on the equator of the cell, also known as independent assortment. It is these two events that derive most of genetic variation.

'''Anaphase I''': The tetrads of chromosomes that were previously lined up on the equator are pulled apart in this phase. They are pulled apart in such a fashion that the spindles that are attached to the centromere of all the tetrads lined up on the equator and are pulled apart  to each pole on either side of the cell, towards the centrioles. The resulting chromosomes are now two chromatids.
 
'''Telophase I''': In this phase the chromosomes with two chromatids that have moved to eeither side of the cell decondense and a nuclear envelope begins to form around the genomic material. 

&lt;u&gt;Meiosis II&lt;/u&gt;

'''Prophase II''': The chromosomes that have two chromatids from the previous meiosis I cycle recondense, with their nuclear envelope and nucleoli disappear similiar to prophase I. In addition the spindle forms in this phase. 

'''Metaphase II''': The chromosomes with the two chromatids line up at the equator similiar to how they lined up in metaphase I. Although genetic variation is seen in this phase as well as it was seen in metaphase I, the degree is very much diminished. In prophase I, crossing over occurred, however in prophase II, since homologous chromosomes are non existent in this phase, the chromatids cannot react with any neighboring pieces of DNA. The only source of variation in this phase is independent assortment of genes on the equator of the cell. The possibility of chromatids either going left or right on the cell and being chosen for fertilization is the source of variation here. 

'''Anaphase II''': The chromosomes split by the same mechanics explained in Anaphase I except only one chromatid head moves towards each pole of the cell. 

'''Telophase II''': This phase has the same exact mechanics explained in Telophase I. The only difference is that instead chromatids being de-condensed with a nuclear envelop developing around it, it is solely a chromatid head. The cell is now ready to develop into sperm or eggs at this stage.

=='''Mutations and Birth Defects'''==
According to Angelika Amon, a molecular biologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the leading cause of human birth defects and miscarriages are the mistakes in dividing DNA between daughter cells during meiosis. Miscarriages occur when embryos have an incorrect number of chromosomes and do not go to full term.

The likelihood that chromosomes will not be apportioned properly increases with age in women. Studies have shown that one out of every eighteen babies born to women who are over the age of forty-five has three copies of chromosomes 13, 18, or 21 instead of the normal amount of two. This can lead to birth defects or mutations. An example is that Down Syndrome is caused by three copies of chromosome 21.

=='''Studying Meiosis'''==
Amon studies yeast cells, which separate their chromosomes almost exactly the same way cells of humans do. The exception is that yeast cells' chromosomes separate much faster. A yeast cell copies its DNA and produces daughter cells in about half an hour. Humans cells, on the other hand, takes about a whole day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Paclitaxel (taxol) is an important anti-cancer pharmaceutical drug.  In 1967, Monreoe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani extracted paclitaxel from the bark of a Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia.  

Paclitaxel is used to treat AIDs-related Kaposi sarcoma, breast, ovarian, and lung cancer in UK.  This medicine binds to the tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules. This stabilizes the microtubules and prevents further cell division. 

==Side Effects==

[[File:Taxol.svg|500px]]



Functional Groups: aromatic(3), amine, ketone(2), esters(4), alcohol(3), and ether(5) 
It has 11 stereocenters.
==Mechanism of Actions==
[[File:Mechanism of Taxol.png|450px|thumb|Mechanism of Paclitaxel]]

Microtubules are cellular components that act as a skeleton for the cell. For cell division to occur, microtubules need to depolymerise back to tubulin. After that, tubulins repolymerise to form the spindle of cell division. The movement of the replicated chromosomes during mitosis depends on the spindle and therefore, the depolymerization of microtubules. 

Paclitaxel or Taxol enhances the polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and also interacts directly with microtubules, stabilizing them against depolymerization. Hence, it interferes with the spindle formation process. Chromosomes are unable to move to the opposite sides of the dividing cells. Cells division is inhibited and eventually, cell death is induced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Prozac, also known as Fluoxetine, is part of class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, that is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and panic attacks. The medicine works by maintaining the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that controls mood and mental state, in the brain. In other cases, Prozac is used to treat alcoholism, attention-deficit disorder, borderline personality disorder, sleeping disorders, heaches, mental illnesses, post-traumatic stress disorder, Tourettes' syndrome, obesity, sexual disorders, and various irrational fears

[[File:S-fluoxetine-3D-vdW.png|thumbnail|3D Representation of Prozac]]

== Side Effects ==
Some common side effects of Prozac are depression, anxiety, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and loss of appetite. Due to how Fluoxetine effects neurotransmitters, it can sometimes block other neurotransmitters like for acetylcholine. When Acetylcholine is blocked, nausea occurs. Another dangerous side effect is the fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors also inhibit nitric oxide synthesis which leads to the narrowing of blood vessels. This is dangerous because it can lead to hypertension. Also, even though Prozac is an antidepressant drug it can lead to depression due to the neurological chemical imbalance in the brain.

== Administration ==
Prozac is administered orally. A capsule is taken and slowly distributed while in the digestive system.

== Precautions ==
Prozac should never be taken more than prescribed. A major imbalance to the neurotransmitters and neurological pathways would occur and lead to many side effects.  
It should not be taken while pregnant, due to the fact of hypertension, which will lead to heart defects and lung problems in the newborn. Also, Prozac should not be taken in combination of other antidepressants because of seriously dangerous chemical reactions. Lastly, people under 24 years old may have thoughts of suicide.

== Chemistry ==
The way Prozac works is by blocking the signal on the axon that tells it when enough serotonin has been produced. Therefore, an excess amount of serotonin is delivered to the nerves. The way Fluoxetine is metabolized is by CYP2D6 in the liver. Due to its slow metabolism, it has a long half-life within the system. Because of this slow accumulation, it takes awhile before the excess serotonin starts to show significant effects. Prozac acts as an agonist for 5HT2C receptors which have been known to be responsible for the defensive and aggressive behavior. It has been seen that low 5-HT levels in the brain have traditionally been associated with depression.
==Mechanism of Actions==
[[File:Chemical synapse.jpg|250px|thumb|Chemical synapse]]

Neurotransmitters are signaling molecules that are used to transmit messages between neurons in the brain. The pathways of neurotransmitters in the synapse can be prolonged or shortened by specific chemicals called neuromodulators. Some neuromodulators can aid with the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse; others inhibit the reabsorption of neurotransmitters by neurons so that the neurotransmitters remain in the synapse. Under certain mental conditions such as bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression, the regulation of secretion and removal of neurotransmitters into the synapse is not functioning properly. In particular, in depression and similar disorders, neurotransmitter seretonin is one of the mostly affected. To treat depression, the most common form of drugs is called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Prozac is one of the most widely used member of this class.
[[File:Mechanism of Prozac.jpg|250px|thumb|Mechanism of Prozac]]

















Prozac works on the serotonin balance in the synapses by inhibiting a neuromdulator called SERT, which pumps serotonin back into the neurons. Thus, Prozac helps to prevent the reabsorption of serotonin and increase the amount of seretonin in the synapse. The proper amount of seratonin in the synapse is believed to help with mood elevation and depression.

== History ==
Eli Lilly discovered fluoxetine in the 1970's when working with antihistamine diphenhydramines. She wanted to synthesize many derivatives of this compound and test them on mice. Eventually, she made a derivative only inhibiting serotonin reuptake, which she called Prozac. Many controversial accounts have been made against Prozac and Lilly. Violent outbreaks, suicides, and murders were all thought to be seen as behavior invoked by the drug. However, it has been said that Prozac is not addictive or habit forming. Once Prozac's patent had expired in 2001, many generic serotonin inhibitor drugs started selling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
Parenteral drug administration is any non-oral means of having the drugs administrated into the body. Intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous are the most used forms of drug administration.

=Advantages=
Some advantages with parenteral drug administration are that it can be used for drugs that are poorly absorbed by the body or ineffective when given orally.

=Disadvantages=
This method of drug administration tends to be expensive due to the amount of equipment required, as well as a more painful experience for the patient. Thus, competent practitioners are recommended. Other risks with parenteral administration are that any errors during the technique of administering the drug may lead to physical harm to the body or adverse drug absorption in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
The oral medical administration is the process of delivering the drug through the mouth so that it enters the alimentary tract. It is known to be the most frequently used route of drug administration due to the fact that it is convenient and cost effective. Drugs that enter through this route usually comes in solid dose forms in order to promote the high degree of drug stability, but they can also come in liquid forms. Different drugs can be taken orally at different time intervals, which can vary between before or after ingesting food.

==General pathway==
Most of the absorption process is accomplished between five and thirty minutes after ingestion, but absorption is not usually complete for as long as six to eight hours. Once drugs passes through the stomach, the drug needs to proceed from the small intestine into the bloodstream. The membrane separating the intestinal wall from blood capillaries is made up of two laters of fat molecules, making it necessary for substances to be lipid soluble or soluble in fats to pass through. Even after sucessful absorption into blood capillaries, however, substances must still pass through the liver for a screening process before being released into the general circulation around the body. Enzymes in the liver are capable of breaking down the molecular strucrue of certain drugs, thus reducing the amount that eventually enters the blood stream. As a result of all these natural barriers, orally administered drugs must be ingested at dliberately elevated dose levels, to allow for the fact that some proportions of the drug will not make it through to the bloodstream.

=Disadvantages=
Administering drugs orally can potentially be problematic due to the unpredictable nature of gastrointestinal absorption. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Factors such as ingested food can alter the pH within the gut, gastric motility, emptying time, and the rate of drug absorption.


=Anti-asthmatic agents and Anti-Inflammatory=

[[File:Cortisol.png|thumbnail|center|Cortisol Structure]]
Cortisol or hydrocortisone is a compound of the class called corticosteroids. This compound is the anti-flammatory agent that is used in medicine. Scientists have discovered that the inflammatory of the breathing passages can contribute to the attack of asthma. As a result, it was recommended to control the oral inflammatory together by including corticosteroids in medicine and inhaling bronchodilators to treat asthma. However, corticosteroids can have negative side effects. For instance, this compound can inhibits growth in children. Hence, scientists started to use synthetic corticosteroids to be used for inhalation. 
In addition, scientists have discovered a synthetic steroid that can be used as anti-inflammatory. Fluticasone is the compound that replace its hydrogen with flourine that would help to activate the compound's ability to be used as anti-inflammatory. This steroid would bind to the protein inside the cell nuclei called the glucocorticoid receptor in order to prevent the inflammatory response in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Intranasal drug administration is an attractive option for local and systemic delivery of many drugs. The nasal mucosa is – in other words, nose – easily accessible. Intranasal drug administration is noninvasive, almost painless and the most susceptible way of administrating drugs for children. Application can be performed easily by patients or by physicians in emergency settings. Intranasal drug delivery offers a rapid onset of therapeutic effects (local or systemic). Nasal application circumvents gastrointestinal degradation and hepatic first-pass metabolism of the drug. The drug, the vehicle and the application device form an undividable triad. Its selection is there- fore essential for the successful development of effec- tive nasal products. This paper discusses the feasibility and potential of intranasal administration. However, there are still many debatable topics on the following topics: 
# the intended use (therapeutic considerations)
# the drug
# the vehicle 
# the application device

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''The Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis'''&lt;/u&gt;

The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis was a hypothesis independently developed by two scientists. One scientist was a Russion chemist, Aleksandr Oparin, and the second scientist was a British scientist, John Haldane. 
Both independently suggested that if the primitive atmosphere was reducing (as opposed to oxygen-rich), and if there was an appropriate supply of energy, such as lightning or ultraviolet light, then a wide range of organic compounds might be synthesised.

Oparin came up with the hypothesis in 1924 that Earth’s atmosphere was extremely reducing in its early stages of development. This means that the atmosphere had an excess of negative charge and could cause reducing reactions by adding electrons to compounds.  Oparin suggested that these organic compounds could have undergone a series of reactions leading to more and more complex molecules. Under these circumstances, Oparin hypothesized that organic molecules could have formed from simple inorganic molecules.He proposed that the molecules formed colloid aggregates, or 'coacervates', in an aqueous environment.  These coacervates were able to absorb and assimilate organic compounds from the environment in a way reminiscent of metabolism.   They would have taken part in evolutionary processes, eventually leading to the first lifeforms. 
 
Similarly, in 1929, before Haldane read about Oparin’s theory of a reducing atmosphere, Haldane also hypothesized that the early staged of Earth’s atmosphere was reducing, which could catalyze reactions that would form more complicated organic molecules from simpler molecules. Haldane hypothesized that the oceans served as a huge cooking pot where powered by the sun or lightning, chemical reactions could occur in an aqueous environment to form a huge diversity of organic compounds.  Haldane proposed that the primordial sea served as a vast chemical laboratory powered by solar energy. The atmosphere was oxygen free, and the combination of carbon dioxide, ammonia and ultraviolet radiation gave rise to a host of organic compounds. The sea became a 'hot dilute soup' containing large populations of organic monomers and polymers. Haldane envisaged that groups of monomers and polymers aquired lipid membranes, and that further developments eventually led to the first living cells. 

Haldane coined the term 'prebiotic soup' or 'prebiotic atmosphere' that consisted of an abundance of methane, ammonia, and water.  This term became a powerful symbol of the Oparin-Haldane view of the origin of life.
 

&lt;u&gt;'''Miller-Urey Experiment'''&lt;/u&gt;

In 1953, two scientists set out to test Oparin and Haldane's hypothesis.  Harold Urey and his student Stanley Miller tried to calculate the chemical constituents of the atmosphere of the early Earth.  They based their calculations on the view that the early atmosphere was reducing.  In order to do this, they simulated early earth atmospheric conditions by creating a closed system which contained water, methane gas, ammonia, and hydrogen gas.  Urey suggested that his student, Miller should attempt to synthesize organic compounds in this type of atmosphere.  

Miller carried out an experiment in which he passed a coninuous spark discharge at 60,000 Volts through a flask containing the gases identified by Urey along with water.  Furthermore, this electrical current was run through the laboratory set up to simulate the catalytic source of lightning that was present in the early atmosphere. 

Miller found that after a week, most of the ammonia and much of the methane had been consumed. The main gaseous products were carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N2). In addition, there was an accumulation of dark material in the water. Few of the specific constituents of this could not be identified, but it was clear that the material included a large range of organic polymers.  From the results of their experiment, they found that up to 15% of the carbon in the system was inorganic compounds that had formed in the system.  This conclusion proved that organic molecules could be formed from inorganic molecules in Earth’s early atmosphere.  In addition, out of the organic molecules produced, Miller and Urey showed that some of the organic compounds were amino acids, which are necessary for living organisms. 

Analysis of the aqueous solution showed that the following had also been synthesised:

1. 25 amino acids (the main ones being glycine, alanine and aspartic acid) 

2. Several fatty acids 

3. Hydroxy acids 

4. Amide products. 



&lt;u&gt;'''Aftermath of the Miller-Urey Experiment'''&lt;/u&gt;

The Miller-Urey experiment was immediately recognized as an important breakthrough in the study of the origin of life.  It was received as confirmation of the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis in that several of the key molecules of life could have been synthesised on the primitive Earth in the kind of conditions envisioned by Oparin and Haldane. These molecules would then have been able to take part in prebiotic chemical processes, leading to the origin of life. 

Other similar experiments have been done to mimic early Earth conditions in an attempt to find other ways organic molecules could have formed. One experiment was done to mimic deep underwater volcano conditions. At these underwater volcanoes, catalytic heat as well as many minerals was constantly supplied. This provided an ideal system for organic molecules to be formed. This system was also found to produce amino acids, which is essential for living organisms to process into proteins.

Since the Miller-Urey experiment, a great deal of effort has been spent investigating prebiotic chemistry. It has become apparent that organizing simple molecules into assemblies capable of reproducing and evolving is a far greater task than was generally realized during the excitement that followed the experiment. In addition, the view that the early atmosphere was highly reducing was challenged towards the end of the twentieth century, and is no longer the concensus view. 

Although the significance of specific details of the Miller-Urey for the origin of life may now be in question, it began the new scientific discipline of prebiotic chemistry, and has been enormously influential in the development of ideas about the origin of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The human rectum is a channel in the human body through which drugs can be easily administered and absorbed well. Sometimes it is the most preferable to give a drug rectally rather than orally, e.g. in cases of nausea and vomiting. Disadvantages of drug administration through rectum include the interruption of absorption by defaecation and lack of patient acceptability ( it is not comfortable for most patients to have drug administered through their rectum). The mechanism of drug absorption from the rectum is probably no different to that in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, despite the fact that the physiological circumstances (e.g. pH, fluid content) differ substantially, absorption from aqueous and alcoholic solutions may occur very rapidly, which has proved to be of considerable therapeutic value in the rapid suppression of acute convulsive attacks by diazepam (e.g. in children), but absorption from suppositories is generally slower and very much dependent on the nature of the suppository base, the use of surfactants or other additives, particle size of the active ingredient, etc. There is some evidence that hepatic first-pass elimination of high clearance drugs is partially avoided after rectal administration, e.g. lignocaine. This can be explained by the rectal venous blood supply: the upper part is connected with the portal system, whereas the lower part is directly connected with the systemic circulation. Plasma concentration data following rectal administration of representatives of several classes of drugs are reviewed: anticonvulsants, non-narcotic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, hypnosedatives and anaesthetics, strong analgesics, theophylline and derivatives, corticosteroids, antibacterial agents, thiazinamium, promethazine, hyoscine-N-butyl-bromide, streptokinase, progesterone, ergotamine tartrate and levodopa. Only limited number of cases has it been adequately shown that the rectal route of administration gives plasma concentrations which are comparable to the oral route. Potentially the rectal route offers the same possibilities as the oral route, but the influence of the formulation seems to be very critical. It is also likely that the future novel drug delivery systems with zero order release characteristics will be applied rectally. Interesting preliminary results have already been obtained with theophylline administered by 2ml osmotic pumps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sublingual medications are administered by inserting them directly under the tongue. The medications dissolve rapidly and are absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth, where they enter into the bloodstream. The medications are compounded in the form of small, quick-dissolving tablets, sprays, lozenges, or liquid suspensions. The most common sublingual medication is the nitroglycerin tablet, which is a form of pain reliever that is absorbed the fastest when administered sublingually to the body. The sublingual administration method is not always appropriate. Sublingual medications should not be administered if the gums or mucous membranes have open sores or areas of irritation. The patient should not eat, drink, chew, or swallow until the medication has been absorbed. Swallowing the medication must be prevented, since it will decrease the drug's effectiveness as it is digested in the digestive system. Sublingual administration method is fat acting and the body will be able to sense its effect within 5-10 minutes after administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition of Living Organisms==
Processes are carried out in an immense variety of ways between plants, animals, fungi and other types of organisms. An organism is defined to be alive when it performs, in one form or another, all of the following life processes: nutrition, movement, growth, reproduction, and respiration, as well as sensitivity and excretion, according to Functioning of Organisms by Philip Stephenson.

==Characteristics of Living Organisms==
===1. High degree of chemical complexity and microscopic organization===

Living organisms are composed of cells with highly organized systems, starting from the smallest cellular unit to the largest. Some organisms are unicellular (composed of one cell), free-living and contain organelles to help carry out their life processes. More complex organisms are multicellular (composed of more than one cell). These cells are organized into specialized roles, like tissues or muscles, where they each live co-dependently. Tissues are organized into organs. The organ system in composed of multiple organs that function together. An organism is a complex series of organ systems.

===2. Systems to extract, transform and use energy from the environment===

Living organisms that convert organic matter from the environment and convert into energy that chemical material inside our cells use in metabolism are called heterotrophs. Other organisms such as algae and plants that use photosynthesis to extract energy from the sun along with carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars are called autotrophs. Certain types of bacteria use chemosynthesis to couple the transformation of organic molecules into from their energy with inorganic molecules. 
Without this ability to extract, transform and use energy, organisms will quickly become unable to power their life functions.

===3. Self-replication and self-assembly===

Living organisms have the ability to reproduce. In plants and simple animals, reproduction is through the process of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is defined as a single individual reproducing without the help of another individual. Examples of asexual reproduction include splitting or budding. More complex organisms participate in sexual reproduction, where two individual contribute genetic information to create a new individual with a unique combination of traits. 

===4. Sensing and responding to changes in environment===

Living organism have the ability to respond to stimuli in their environment. Changes may include light, heat, sound or chemical contact. In response to stimuli, an organism uses hormones to change their behavior in response to the surrounding environment.

===5. Define function for each component and regulation among them===
Living organisms possess specific conditions that they must maintain for survival. The ability to regulate conditions such as temperature, nutrients and water are essential for survival. Homeostasis, a stable balance of internal conditions against external forces is a condition that must be kept.

===6. History of evolutionary change===

Populations of living organisms adapt to changes in their environment through evolution. As changes occur in the population, the organism adapts, using their abilities to metabolize respond and reproduce. Characteristics that are more useful in survival are passed to offsprings and allows survival for the species.

===Growth of Living Organisms===
All living organisms grow. An increase in mass and increase in number 
of individuals are twin characteristics of growth. A multicellular organism 
grows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs 
continuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen 
only up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to 
replace lost cells. Unicellular organisms also grow by cell division. One 
can easily observe this in an invitro cultures by simply counting the number 
of cells under the microscope. In a majority of higher ordered animals and plants, 
growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must 
remember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living 
objects also grow if we take an increase in body mass as a criterion for growth. 
Mountains, boulders and sand mounds grow, however this kind of 
growth exhibited by non-living objects is by the accumulation of material on 
the surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore 
cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Conditions 
under which growth can be observed in living organisms have to be explained 
in order to understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. Dead organism do not grow.

===Reproduction===
Reproduction is s a characteristic of living organisms.--- 
In multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of 
progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents. 
Invariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms 
reproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due 
to the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like 
yeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (flat worms), we observe 
true regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of 
its body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the filamentous algae, 
the protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it 
comes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba, 
reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. 
We have already defined growth as equivalent to increase in cell number 
or mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very 
clear about the usage of these two terms - growth and reproduction. 
Further, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile 
worker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot 
be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Of course, 
no non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself. 

===Metabolism===
Another characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms 
are made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to 
various classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and 
changed into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical 
reactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic 
reactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they 
unicellular or multicellular. All plants, animals, fungi and microbes exhibit 
metabolism. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our 
body is metabolism. No non-living object exhibits metabolism. Metabolic 
reactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. An 
isolated metabolic reaction(s) outside the body of an organism, performed 
in a test tube is neither living nor non-living. Hence, while metabolism is 
a defining feature of all living organisms without exception, isolated 
metabolic reactions in vitro are not living things but surely living reactions. 

=== Cellular Organization of the Body is the Defining Feature of Life Forms.===

=== Adaptation of Environments===
The most obvious and technically complicated feature of all 
living organisms is this ability to sense their surroundings or environment 
and respond to these environmental stimuli which could be physical, 
chemical or biological. We sense our environment through our sense 
organs. Plants respond to external factors like light, water, temperature, 
other organisms, pollutants, etc. All organisms, from the prokaryotes to 
the most complex eukaryotes can sense and respond to environmental 
cues. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants 
and animals. All organisms handle chemicals entering their bodies. All 
organisms therefore, are 'aware' of their surroundings. Human beings are 
the only organisms known to be self aware, i.e., have self-consciousness.

===Consciousness===
Consciousness therefore, becomes the defining property of living 
organisms. When it comes to human beings, it is all the more difficult to define 
the living state. We observe patients lying in coma in hospitals virtually 
supported by machines which replace heart and lungs. The patient is 
otherwise brain-dead. The patient has no self-consciousness. Are such 
patients who never come back to normal life, living or non-living? 
In higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena 
are due to underlying interactions. Properties of tissues are not present 
in the constituent cells but arise as a result of interactions among the 
constituent cells. Similarly, properties of cellular organelles are not present 
in the molecular constituents of the organelle but arise as a result of 
interactions among the molecular components comprising the organelle. 
These interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of 
organization. This phenomenon is true in the hierarchy of organizational 
complexity at all levels.

=== Self-Replicating, and Self-Regulating===
All living organisms are self-replicating, evolving and have self-regulating interactive systems capable of responding to external stimuli. 
Biology is the story of life on earth and is the story of evolution for living organisms on earth. All living 
organisms - present, past and future, are linked to one another by the 
sharing of common genetic material, but to varying degrees of assortments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

When there are unneeded amino acids from either protein digestion or turnover, they are broken down into certain compounds. This process usually occurs in the liver. 

In amino acid degradation the amino group is removed and turned into an α-ketoacids which is then modified so that the carbon chain could enter the metabolism and eventually become glucose or intermediates of the citric acid cycle.

==Amino Acid Degradation==


The amino group is transferred to α-ketoglutarate which forms glutamate. Then the glutamate is oxidatively deanimated to form the ammonium ion NH4+

Aminotransferases catalyzes the reaction that turns the α-amino group from an α-amino acid to an α-ketoacid. These enzymes catalyze α-amino groups from a variety of amino acids to α-keto-glutarate for conversion to NH4+

Aspartate aminotransferase, catalyzes the transfer of the amino group of aspartate to α-ketoglutarate.
 
Alanine aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of the amino group of alanine to α-ketoglutarate.
 
The nitrogen from the α-ketoglutarate in the transamination reaction is converted into an ammonium ion by oxidative deamination. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. 
This enzyme is special in that it is able to utilize either NAD+ or NADP+. The reaction dehydrogenates the C-N bond, and then hydrolyses of the Schiff base to make a ketoglutarate

The equilibrium for this reaction favors glutamate. But the reaction can be pushed forward by the consumption of ammonia. Glutamate dehydrogenase is found in the mitochondria. This compartmentalization prevents interaction with ammonia. In vertebrates, the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase is allosterically regulated.

 NH4+ is converted into urea, which is then excreted as waste.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Flagella==

Flagella (singular=flagellum), are extensions of the cell commonly found in many Bacteria and Archaea, and even in some Eukaryotic cells. Cells that have flagella often use their flagella as their main method of motility. Most bacterial cells use their flagella to travel randomly, a process called random walk, unless there is a chemical signal present, in which the cell would travel to the attractant (or away from a repellant) through chemotaxis.

==Types of Flagella==

There are three major types of flagella found among cells

'''Peritrichous''' flagella are a series of flagella that appear around the cell in all directions. Some examples of cells that have peritrichous cells are E.coli cells and salmonella cells.

'''Lophotrichious''' flagella are a group of flagella that are bundled together on one side of the cell. 

'''Monotrichous''' flagella have only one flagellum attached to one side of the cell

==Form and Function==

'''Bacteria/Archaea cells:''' The primary function of flagella is to allow for cell motility. The flagella are comprised of protein monomers called flagellin. The flagella are able to perform this by spinning in an either clockwise or counterclockwise direction. When the flagella (or flagellum, for monotrichous cells) are spinning in the counterclockwise direction, the flagella is driving the cell forward towards the attractant or away from the deterring signal. When the flagella is rotating clockwise, the entire cell stops the forward movement in order to change direction. The flagella is able to rotate in either direction by generating torque in the basal body. Within the basal body is a specialized protein called the mot protein, which generates torque to propel the circular flagellar motion. The basal body also acts as an anchoring system for the flagella, consisting of a set of rings known as the L, P, MS, and C rings. The flagella is able to switch between the clockwise and counterclockwise directions through Fli proteins, which senses where the attractant/deterrent is, and switches the direction of rotation for the flagella in response to the chemical signal (therefore performing chemotaxis). 

'''Eukaryotic cells:''' Eukaryotic cell flagella differ from bacterial cells in terms of how the flagella move in order to propel the cell forward. Because eukaryotic cells are much bigger than bacterial cells, instead of a clockwise/counterclockwise direction, most eukaryotic cell flagella move in a “whip-like” motion which is fueled by ATP hydrolysis in the cell. Eukaryotic cells with flagella also have many more microtubules in the membrane to help aid in support during cell chemotaxis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Professor Ivan Berke was the founder of the clinic enzymology and medical biochemistry in Serbia and Yugoslavia who played an important role in pharmacy and medicine. Many students under his tutorship became biochemists who specialized in my different fields. His contribution will help many new generations in the medical field. He was a role model to all of his students in every aspect.

==Biography==
Professor Ivan Berke was born on November 13th 1910 in Bjelovar. In 1933, he graduated from a Pharmacy Department in Zagreb. In 1936, he graduated from the 7th group of Chemistry In Zagreb. He then served in military for one year. In 1939, he obtained a doctorate in chemistry and was elected to become an assistant at the Chemical Institute of the Faculty of Medicine. After holding several positions at the Institute of Chemical, he then became director of that Institute. He became a scientific advisor in Budapest and then worked for the Institute of Chemistry in Zagreb until 1953. During 1953 and 1960, he was an Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the Medical Faculty in Skopje. In 1960, he joined the Biochemistry Institute in Belgrade. Later in 1964, he was elected as a Senior Professor of Biochemistry and remained at this position until retirement in 1978.

==Academic Career and Contribution==
His contribution in scientific work was first influenced by Tomislav Pinter, who explained to him about how analytical and physical chemistry worked. In 1931, with the help of professor Milo Mladenovi, he then became more interested in preparative organic chemistry and Pregl’s micro-analysis. After that, he focused on determining the functional groups of polyterpene acid in a-elemi and b-elemonic acids. This work led to the first papers about the new derivatives of dihydro- and dribromineelemonic acid, and di- and tetrazonide. With the help of Dr Pinter, he focused more about inorganic analytics.
 
He was the one who created a basis for electrophoresis. This technique became a main focus on clinical biochemistry. Due to financial problems to use the large apparatus in the lab, Dr Berke introduced some methods of solutions for paper electrophoresis. Later then, he was one of the greatest investigators in this field and his works were cited in everything that dealt with this topic. 

Besides many applications of this electrophoresis, the most interesting study was of nephritic syndrome in children in 1952. Dr Berke spent several years developing “Thiol Function” in Serbia which led to his achievement in determining the activity of enzyme dimethyleethine: homocysteine methylferase.

He spent most of his time doing methodological research in biochemistry and enzymology. He became more and more interested in enzyme and finally ended up with this famous book “General and Medical Enzymology”.  He was a tutor for 18 years during the time he was in Belgrade. More than 150 students under his guidance became biochemists who specialized in my different fields. Throughout his life, he had published many books and articles all over the world.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: First Grasp The Concept'''

Blender has multiple modes. To edit an object you must select it and put it into edit mode. This is done either by pressing the '''TAB''' key or by going to the bottom of the 3D view panel and clicking on the pull down menu with the text &quot;'''Object Mode'''&quot;.

In edit mode you may select any face, vertex (a point at a corner usually. This is only a rough definition) or an edge (the line between to vertexes). You select these with '''RIGHT-CLICK''' and scale, move and rotate like an object in object mode.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Note'''

You may go back to object mode by pressing '''TAB'''.}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Note'''

You may extrude an edge, vertex or face by pressing '''E'''.}}

}}

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Next Learn How To Edit'''

When you want to create an object in a certain shape you must first think of what object will be the easiest to model to make your dream object. The cube is usually the best for this job but this is not always the case.

You can experiment by adding objects and then modelling them in to something else. With this you can learn the abilities.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOVICE PAGE: Note'''

You may subdivide (make 1 face or edge into multiple faces or edges) a face or edge by selecting it and clicking the &quot;Subdivide&quot; button in the menu to the left of the 3D view.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

Try and keep your models LOW-POLY. This means try to have as few faces per object as possible. Don't let this constrict your modelling though. Just when one face could do instead of four try to reduce it. High-poly models can slow the game down.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

When extruding in edit mode it is best to set an axis.

{{BBR/tip|
'''Tips And Tricks'''

Do you want to move a face on two axis' at a time instead of one? Press '''SHIFT-Z''' to move on X and Y, '''SHIFT-X''' to move on Y and Z and '''SHIFT-Y''' to move on Z and X.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:subcutaneous_injection.png|thumbnail|right|Subcutaneous Injection]]
==Definition==
A '''subcutaneous injection''' (SC, SQ, SubQ) is a method of drug administration in which the drug is injected into hypodermis, the fatty tissue layer directly beneath the dermis and epidermis. Because there is limited blood flow to the hypodermis, subcutaneous injection is usually used when slow absorption of medication is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Clinical Center - National Institutes of Health. [http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf &quot;Patient Education: Giving a subcutaneous injection.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that are administered using this method must be soluble and potent in small concentrations. Common medications used with this procedure include heparin, insulin, growth hormones, and vaccines against MMR and varicella.
==Sites and Method of Injection==

With subcutaneous injection, the drug is usually administered through loose interstitial tissues of the upper arm, the anterior surface of the thigh, the lower portion of the abdomen, or the lower back. When injecting, the skin is pinched up to prevent injection into muscle. It is recommended to use the same site for routine injections. The shot is given at a straight 90 degree angle if at least 2 inches of skin can be grasped. Otherwise, it is given at a 45 degree angle.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How To Give A Subcutaneous Injection.&quot; Drugs.com, n.d. Web. 28 Oct. 2012. http://www.drugs.com/cg/how-to-give-a-subcutaneous-injection.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Absorption Rate==
Factors that may increase absorption rate are heat, massaging, co-administers vasodilators, or hyaluronidase at the site of injection. Epinephrine may decrease the absorption rate due to decreased blood flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Transdermal refers to the process in which the drug diffuses through the intact skin for the purpose of systematic distribution (as opposed to topical distribution). In order to achieve this route of administration, utilities such as transdermal patches, transdermal gels, and  transdermal implants can be used for medical purposes. 

==Pathways==

===Transcellular Pathway===
The transcellular pathway is the more direct path in which drugs can make its way across the skin. In this route, drugs are transported across the skin by proceeding through the membranes of dead kertinocytes (the predominatn cell type within the epidermis) that make up the top layer of skin, which is known as the stratum corneum. Even though the path distance for this method is the shortest, drugs can experience resistance due to the phospholipid membranes that they have to cross.  

===Intercellular Pathway===
The intercellular pathway is the more common pathway in which the drugs pass through the skin by navigating through small spaces that exist between the cells of the skin. 

==Disadvantages==
Even though the skin is easily accessible for the purpose of drug delivery, its main function of preventing foreign substances from entering the body can limit the types and amounts of drugs that are taken in through this route of administration. In order to reach the microcirculation of the dermis, the drug must manage to go through the Epidermis and the Dermis, which are two significant layers of the skin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition=
Intradermal (ID) drug administration is the injection of a small amount of fluid into the dermal layer of the skin. The needle most commonly used for this technique is the tuberculin syringe with a 26-gauge needle, which is about one-fourth to one-half inch in length. A small amount of swelling in the skin after injection is to be expected.

      <comment>/* Introduction */ tiny change: took out a word and added &quot;so well&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Derived from the juice of the opium poppy Papaver Somniferum, morphine makes up about 10% of the plant's juice and has been used for thousands of years to relieve pain of all types and varying severity.  Until it was isolated in 1806, it was ingested as the dried juice called opium.  Whether in opium or by itself, injected, smoked or swallowed, morphine binds to receptors in the brain to create feeling of euphoria, which makes it popular for recreational use. In the gut, it binds to the same receptors and slows peristaltic movement so well it remains an unparalleled treatment for diarrhea.  As with any opiate, prolonged users will eventually become addicted and tolerance — increasing doses needed to achieve the same effects — can be expected both to analgesia (pain relief) and the euphoria (high) morphine produces.

Although indispensable as a weapon against pain, relief comes with &quot;side effects&quot; that may not be so welcome, especially sleepiness, blurred vision, constipation, and decrease in appetite.  Of course, morphine's potential to cause physical dependence (&quot;addiction&quot;) is its worst unwanted effect as withdraw symptoms can be pretty unpleasant should the person abruptly stop or sharply reduce their dose of morphine.

[[File:Morphine-from-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumbnail|3D Representation of Morphine]]

== How Morphine Works ==
Morphine can be administered several ways: IV drips, orally as a pill, injection, nasally (insufflation), or rectally; each method has its own degree of effectiveness, with the pill form being the least effective (10-30%) and IV drips being the most effective (close to 100%). It works by binding the mu-opioid, the kappa-opioid, and the nociceptin receptors in the brain and spinal cord (mostly on substantia gelatinosa, where the feeling of pain is first processed), as well as the delta-receptors in the brain. It inhibits that transmission of signals from pain neurons in the peripheral nervous system and also produces effects in the dorsal horn to excite neurons and other pathways. The result is that morphine blocks pain signals from both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Ironically, the drug doesn't stop the transmission of pain, but rather alters the user's perception of the pain; he or she is aware of the pain but finds its manageable or it can be ignored. 

As little as 5mg of morphine can produce noticeable affects as the drug binds to the same receptors that endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins bind to — these opiate-like substances produced naturally by the human body.

The euphoric effects morphine produces are part of another mechanism involving the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitors and their respective neurons. Under cellular conditions, GABA reduces the amount of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that is associated with pleasure, released in the brain. Morphine inhibits the amount of GABA that is released in the brain. Over time, it gradually increases the levels of dopamine the brain, which results in a &quot;high&quot; or euphoric feeling.

In addition, prolonged use of morphine inhibits the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). When morphine suddenly becomes unavailable, the human body produces more cAMP as a results, which leads to hyperactivity and drug craving.

==Adverse Effects==

===Addiction===
The use of morphine is well-known for causing &quot;addiction&quot; — physical dependence.  Psychological addiction is also possible but a different concern caused by factors less concrete than the far better understood phenomenon of physical addiction, especially to morphine.  

Physical dependence, when a given dose becomes a daily necessity to avoid unpleasant &quot;withdrawal syndrome&quot; symptoms, is a feature of morphine use that can be expected to occur in virtually anyone who takes it for long enough.  How long this takes varies within a fairly narrow window but it isn't very likely within the usual week or ten-day period most people will have it prescribed to them.  After that, it should be discussed with a physician to prevent needless suffering caused either by untreated withdrawal or from the unwarranted cessation of pain relief treatment for fear of &quot;addiction.&quot;

Physical dependence occurs with the other opiate drugs, too, although to different degrees in terms of the severity of withdrawal and development of tolerance to the drug.

===Constipation===
As an opioid, morphine has the tendency to act upon the myenteric plexus, which is in the intestinal tract. This results in the reduction of gut motility, which cases an overall effect of constipation. Morphine decreases the rate of intestinal transit by inhibiting the process of peristalsis of the intestine.

===Tolerance===
Tolerance to morphine occurs very readily, meaning that a higher concentration of morphine is necessary to obtain the same feelings or effects. Hypotheses of how this tolerance develops include the change in the receptor conformation of phosphorylation, the decoupling of receptors of G-proteins, the upregulation of the cAMP pathway,  and μ-opioid receptor internalization.

===Withdrawal===
Morphine withdrawal progresses as follows, roughly broken down according to symptoms, their onset and likely duration:
* '''Stage 1''': Pronounced desire for the missing drug (&quot;craving&quot;) and anxiety; starts six to twelve hours after the last dose.  

*'''Stage 2''': Along with craving and anxiety (which may become stronger) typical symptoms are sweating, runny nose, yawning, and watering eyes (&quot;lacrimation&quot;). Usually starts within about 8 to 12 hours after last dose

*'''Stage 3''': General feeling of being uncomfortable, aching all over the body and loss of appetite are typical as symptoms progress. At this point muscle spasms, especially in the legs, are the origin of the term &quot;kicking&quot; (originally to describe opium withdrawal and later to giving up any other habit) and abdominal cramping are the next symptoms to appear next, about 24 hours after the last dose.

* '''Stage 4''': This is the acute stage when symptoms are at their worst and can last two or three days before subsiding. The pain continues, especially in joints. Insomnia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, are typical symptoms although they vary quite a bit — between individuals and between attempts to &quot;kick&quot;. Men sometimes ejaculate involuntarily. Severe depression is also a very common symptom.

== Deadly Combinations/Precautions ==
Morphine is a potentially dangerous drug because, along with pain relief (analgesia) it depresses breathing.  This effect increases with dosage but is also affected by tolerance so it is only a danger in case of overdose or when combined with certain depressants, like alcohol.

 '''Words cannot be patented, but works under copyright do not belong here.'''

This is not a comprehensive list and the terms used here have not been exposed to vigorous scientific testing. These are simply some terms which emerged in the course of nursing employment, which may be helpful to students of nursing.

Several publishers have invested time and energy to quantify a propietary language. The International council of nurses has published a list of nursing classifications which has been accepted as an international scientific language by the World Health Organization. Mapping the ICN terminology to commercial languages is underway [http://www.hindawi.com/isrn/nursing/2012/676905]. Having said that, enrolled nurses need to use their powers of critical thinking to show an awareness of the underpinning principles behind informatics, regardless of source. 

There are a range of nursing diagnosis in the academic nursing literature. Various standards exist for verification and validation for informatics purposes. Students are encouraged to decide for themselves what they consider to be useful definitions of international concern to nurses. 

*Worry - an emotional state linked to all body systems.
*Maceration - having excessive fluid (specify where)
*Dessication - insufficent fluid (specify where)
*Somalgia - paroxysms of soreness or ache, variously described.
*exposure to factors causing deteriorating condition (specify)

In practise, nursing diagnosis is given cursory treatment by some individual nurses. Some institutional health care approaches omit diagnosis altogether. It may not be worth students learning a particular version, when employers may prefer acuity scoring of their own design. Nursing diagnosis may be regarded by some practising nurses as overly academic, impractical, unwieldy or uneconomial. The topic of diagnosis does not appear in all nursing curricula. Nursing diagnosis is sometimes given little emphasis in training as only one of several possible nursing care planning approaches. The whole question of informatics is considered by some nurses as detracting from more important clinical issues.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''DNA-Binding Proteins Distinguish Specific Sequences of DNA''' ==

The method prokaryotes use most often when responding to environmental changes is altering their gene expression. Expression is when a gene is transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins. The two types of expression are constitutive—where genes are constantly being expressed—and regulated—where specific conditions need to be met inside the cell for a gene to be expressed. This sub-section focuses on how prokaryotes go about regulating the expression of their genes.

Transcription, when DNA is converted into RNA, is the first place for controlling gene activity. Proteins interact with DNA sequences to either promote or prevent the transcription of a gene.

Keep in mind that DNA sequences are not discernible from one another in terms of having features that a regulatory system would be able to register. Therefore, when regulating gene expression, prokaryotes rely on other sequences within their genome, called regulatory sites. These regulatory sites are most often also DNA-binding protein binding sites and are close to the DNA destined for transcription in prokaryotes.

An example of one of these regulatory sites is in E. coli: when sugar lactose is introduced into the environment of the bacterium a gene for encoding the production of an enzyme, β-galactosidase, begins to be expressed. This enzyme’s function is to process lactose so that the cell can extract energy and carbon from it.

[[File:Lac regulartory site.png thumb |frameless|lac regulatory site]]

The sequence of nucleotides of this regulatory site (pictured) displays an almost completely inverted repeat. This shows that the DNA has a nearly twofold axis of symmetry, which in most regulatory sites usually correlates to symmetry in the protein that binds to the site. When studying protein-DNA interactions, symmetry is generally present.

Furthering the investigation into the expression of the lac regulatory site and the protein-DNA interactions that take place there, scientists looked at the structure of the complex formed between the DNA-binding unit that recognizes the lac site and the site itself, which is part of a larger oligonucleotide. They found that the DNA-binding unit specific to the lac regulatory site comes from the protein lac repressor. The function of lac repressor, as the name suggests, is the repression of the lactose-processing gene’s expression. This DNA-binding unit’s twofold axis of symmetry matches the symmetry of the DNA, and the unit binds as a dimer. From each monomer of the protein an α helix is inserted into the DNA’s major groove. Here amino acid side chains interact (via very site-specific Hydrogen bonding) with the exposed base pairs in such a fashion that the lac repressor can only very tightly bind to this specific site in the genome of E. coli.

[[File:Lac repressor.jpg thumb |framed|The lac repressor and operator DNA]]

=== The helix-turn-helix motif is common to many prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins ===

After discerning the structures of many prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins, a structural pattern that was observed in many proteins was a pair of α helices separated by a tight turn. These are called helix-turn-helix motifs and are made of two distinct helices: the second α helix (called the recognition helix) lies in the major groove and interacts with base pairs while the first α helix is primarily in contact with the DNA backbone.

== '''In Prokaryotes, DNA-Binding Proteins Bind Explicitly to Regulatory Sites in Operons''' ==

Looking back at the previous example with E. coli and β-galactosidase, we can garner the common principles of how DNA-binding proteins carry out regulation. When E. coli’s environment lacks glucose—their primary source of carbon and energy—the bacteria can switch to lactose as a carbon source via the enzyme β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose which are then metabolized by the cell. The permease facilitates the transport of lactose across the cell membrane of the bacterium and is essential. The transacetylase is on the other hand not required for lactose metabolism but plays a role in detoxifying compounds that the permease may also be transporting. Here we can say that the expression levels of a group of enzymes that together contribute to adapting to a change in a cell’s environment change together.

[[File:Lactose.gif thumb thumbnail |thumbnail]]

An E.coli bacterium growing in an environment with a carbon source such as glucose or glycerol will have around 10 or fewer molecules of the enzyme β-galactosidase in it. This number shoots up to the thousands, however, when the bacterium is grown on lactose. The presence of lactose alone will increase the amount of β-galactosidase by a large amount by promoting the synthesis of new enzymes rather than activating a precursor.

When figuring out the mechanism of gene regulation in this particular instance, it was observed that the two other proteins galactoside permease and thiogalactoside transacetylase were synthesized alongside β-galactosidase.

=== An operon is made up of regulatory components and genes that encode proteins ===

The fact that β-galactosidase, the transacetylase, and the permease were regulated in concert indicated that a common mechanism controlled the expression of the genes encoding all three. A model called the operon model was proposed by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod to explain this parallel regulation and other observations. The three genetic parts of the operon model are (1) a set of structural genes, (2) an operator site (a regulatory DNA sequence), and (3) a regulator gene that encodes the regulator protein.

In order to inhibit the transcription of structural genes, the regulator gene encodes a repressor protein meant for binding to the operator site. In the case of the lac operon, the repressor protein is encoded by the i gene, which binds to the o operator site in order to prevent the transcription of the z, y, and a genes (the structural genes for β-galactosidase). There is also a promoter site, p, on the operon whose function is to direct the RNA polymerase to the proper transcription initiation site. All three structural genes, when transcribed, give a single mRNA that encodes β-galactosidase, the permease, and the transacetylase. Because this mRNA encodes more than one protein, it is called a polycistronic (or polygenic) transcript.

[[File:Lactose operon.png thumb |thumbnail|The lactose operon]]

The lac repressor protein in the absence of lactose binds to the operator and blocks transcription

[[File:Lac repressor protein.jpg thumb |framed|The lac repressor protein]]

The lac repressor (pictured bound to DNA) is a tetramer with amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. The amino-terminal domain is the one that binds to the DNA while the carboxyl-terminal forms a separate structure. The two sub-units pictured consolidate to form the DNA-binding unit. When lactose is absent from the environment of the bacterium, the lac repressor binds to the operator DNA snugly and swiftly (4x10^6 times as powerfully to the operator as opposed to random sites on the genome). The binding of the repressor precludes RNA polymerase from transcribing the z, y, and a genes which are downstream from the promoter site and code for the three enzymes. The dissociation constant for the complex formed by the lac repressor and the operator is around 0.1 pM and the association rate constant is a whopping 10^10 M-1s-1. This suggests that the repressor diffuses along a DNA molecule to find the operator rather than via an encounter from an aqueous medium.

When it comes to the DNA-binding preference of the lac repressor, the level of specificity is so high that it can be called a nearly unique site within the genome of E. coli. When the dimers of the amino-terminal domain bind to the operator site, the dimers of the carboxyl-terminal site are able to attach to one of two sites within 500 bp of the primary operator site that approximate the operator’s sequence. Each monomer interacts with the bound DNA’s major groove via a helix-turn-helix unit.


=== Ligand binding can induce structural changes in regulatory proteins ===

Now let’s look at how the presence of lactose changes the behavior of the repressor as well as the expression of the operon. All operons have inducers—triggers that facilitate the expression of the genes within the operon—and the inducer of the lac operon is allolactose, a molecule of galactose and glucose with an α-1,6 linkage.

[[File:Structure of Allolactose.png thumb |thumbnail|Allolactose]]

In the β-galactosidase reaction, allolactose is a side product and is produced at low levels when the levels of β-galactosidase are low in the bacterium. Additionally, though not a substrate of the enzyme, isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) is a powerful inducer of β-galactosidase expression.

In the lac operator, the way the inducer prompts gene expression is by inhibiting the lac repressor from binding to the operator. Its method of inhibition is by binding to the lac repressor itself thus immensely reducing the affinity of the repressor to bind to the operator DNA. The inducer binds to each monomer at the center of the large domain, causing conformational changes in the DNA-binding domain of the repressor. These changes drastically reduce the DNA-binding affinity of the repressor.


=== The operon is a common regulatory unit in prokaryotes ===

Numerous other gene regulation complexes within prokaryotes function analogously to the lac operon. An example of another network like this one is that which takes part in the synthesis of purine (and pyrimidine to a certain extent). These genes are repressed by the pur repressor, which is 31% identical to the lac repressor in sequence with a similar 3D structure. In this case, however, the pur repressor behaves opposite from the lac repressor: it blocks transcription by binding to a specific DNA site only when it is also bound to a small molecule called a corepressor (either guanine or hypoxanthine).


=== Transcription can be stimulated by proteins that contact RNA polymerase ===

While the previous examples of DNA-binding proteins all function by preventing the transcription of a DNA sequence until some condition in the environment is met, there are also examples of DNA-binding proteins that actually encourage transcription.

A good instance of this is the catabolite activator protein in E. coli. When the bacterium is grown in glucose it has very low amounts of catabolic enzymes whose function it is to metabolize other sugars. The genes that encode these enzymes are in fact inhibited by glucose, an effect known as catabolite repression. Glucose lowers the concentration of cAMP (cyclic AMP). When the concentration of cAMP is high, it stimulates the transcription of these catabolic enzymes made for breaking down other sugars. This is where the catabolite activator protein (CAP or CRP, cAMP receptor protein) comes into play. CAP, when bound to cAMP, will stimulate the transcription of arabinose and lactose-catabolizing genes. CAP, which binds only to a specific sequence of DNA, binds as a dimer to an inverted repeat at the position -61 relative to the start site for transcription, adjacent to where RNA polymerase binds (pictured).

[[File:CAP-cAMP complex.jpg thumb |framed|CAP-cAMP complex]]

This CAP-cAMP complex enhances transcription by about a factor of 50 by making the contact between RNA polymerase and CAP energetically favorable. There are multiple CAP binding sites within the E. coli genome, therefore increasing the concentration of cAMP in the bacterium’s environment will result in the formation of these CAP-cAMP complexes, thus resulting in the transcription of many genes coding for various catabolic enzymes.


== '''Regulatory Circuits Can Result in Switching Between Patterns of Gene Expression''' ==

In investigating gene-regulatory networks and how they function, studies of bacterial viruses—especially bacteriophage λ—have been invaluvable. Bacteriophage λ is able to develop via either a lytic or lysogenic pathway. In the lytic pathway, transcription takes place for most of the genes in the viral genome which leads to the production of numerous virus particles (~100) and the eventual lysis of the bacterium.  In the lysogenic pathway, the bacterial DNA incorporates the viral genome where most of the viral genes stay unexpressed; this allows for the viral genetic material to be carried in the replicate of the bacteria. There are two essential proteins plus a set of regulatory sequences within the viral genome that are the cause for the switch between the choice of pathways.

=== Lambda repressor regulates its own expression ===

[[File:Λ repressor fusions.jpg|thumb|λ repressor]]

λ repressor is one of these key regulatory proteins which promotes the transcription of the gene that encodes the repressor when levels of the repressor are low. When levels of the repressor are high, it blocks transcription of the gene. It is also a self-regulating protein. While the λ repressor binds to many sites in the λ phage genome, the one relevant here is the right operator, which includes 3 binding sites for the dimer of the λ repressor in addition to 2 promoters within an approximately 80 base pair region. The role the first promoter plays is driving the expression of the λ repressor gene, while the other promoter is responsible for driving the expression of a variety of other viral genes. The λ repressor binds to the first operating site with the most affinity; and when it is bound to this first operating site, the chances of a protein binding to the adjacent operating site increase 25 times. When the first and second operating sites have these complexes bound to them, the dimer of the λ repressor inhibits the transcription of the adjacent gene whose purpose is to encode the protein Cro (controller of repressor and others). The repressor dimer at the second operating site can interact with RNA polymerase so as to stimulate the transcription of the promoter which controls the transcription of the gene encoding the λ repressor. This is how the λ repressor facilitates its own production.
λ repressor fusions can be used to study protein-protein interactions in E. coli. There are two different domains in λ repressor: the N-terminal (DNA binding activity) and the C-terminal domain (dimerization). In order to have an active repressor fusion, the C-terminal domain should be replaced with a Heterodimers domain and form a dimer or higher order oligomer. However, inactive repressor fusions cannot attach to the DNA sequences and affect the expression of phage or reporter.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo Mariño-Ramírez, Lisa Campbell, and James C. Hu. Screening Peptide/Protein Libraries Fused to the λ Repressor DNA-Binding Domain in E. coli Cells. 2003; 205: 235–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A circuit based on lambda repressor and Cro form a genetic switch ===

We can see in the above picture how the λ repressor blocks production of Cro by binding to the first operating site with the most affinity. Cro meanwhile blocks the production of the λ repressor by binding to the third operating site with the most affinity. This entire circuit is the deciding factor as to whether the lytic or lysogenic pathway will be followed: if λ repressor is high and Cro is low, the lysogenic path will be chosen; if Cro is high and the λ repressor is low, the lytic path will be chosen.

[[File:Circuit.jpg thumb |framed|Lambda repressor and Cro genetic circuit]]

=== Many prokaryotic cells release chemical signals that regulate gene expression in other cells ===

Some prokaryotes are also known to undergo a process where they release chemicals called autoinducers into their medium (quorum sensing). These autoinducers, which are most of the time acyl homoserine lactones, are taken up by the surrounding cells. When the levels of these autoinducers reach a certain point, receptor proteins bind to them and activate the expression of several genes, including those that promote the synthesis of more autoinducers. This is a way for prokaryotes to interact with one another chemically to change their gene-expression patterns depending on how many other surrounding cells there are in their medium. Communities of prokaryotes that carry these mechanisms of quorum sensing out are collectively called a biofilm.

== '''Gene Expression Can Be Controlled at Posttranscriptional Levels''' ==

Though most of gene expression regulation happens at the initiation of transcription, other steps of transcription are also possible targets for regulation.

=== Tryptophan Operon  ===

Exploring the genes of the tryptophan operon (abbreviated as trp operon) in order to study the regulation of tryptophan synthesis shows two types of mutants. One type of mutant involves structural gene mutations and the other a regulatory mutant. The mutants that involve structural gene mutations are auxotrophic for tryptophan and need tryptophan to growth. To convert the precursor molecule chorismate to tryptophan, the trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA genes codes for a polycistronic message and the mRNA will be translated to the enzyme that carries out the conversion.

[[File:Tryptophan.jpg|thumb|Tryptophan]]

The second type of mutants is able to constitutively synthesize the enzymes necessary for the synthesis of tryptophan. The trpR gene codes for the tryptophan repressor. The gene mapped in another quadrant of the E. coll chromosome compared to the trp operon. The trpR gene cannot regulate the synthesis of tryptophan efficiently. 
Studies on the dimeric trp repressor protein show that it does not function alone. The repressor must bind the last product of that metabolic pathway in order to regulate the synthesis of tryptophan. Thus, tryptophan is a corepressor for its own biosynthesis. This process is called feedback repression at the transcriptional level. 

When the concentration of tryptophan is high enough, then the repressor binds to tryptophan to make a repressor-tryptophan complex. This complex will attach to the operator region of the trp operon and prevents RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription of the structural genes. Also, when the concentration of tryptophan is low in the cell, due to lack of tryptophan-complex RNA polymerase is able to bind to the gene and transcribe the structural genes. Therefore, tryptophan will be biosynthesized.&lt;ref&gt;Arkady B. Khodursky, Brian J. Peter, Nicholas R. Cozzarelli, David Botstein.

Published online 2000 October 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attenuation is a prokaryotic mechanism for regulating transcription through the modulation of nascent RNA secondary structure ===

While studying the tryptophan operon, Charles Yanofsky discovered another means of transcription regulation. The trp operon encodes 5 enzymes that convert chorismate into tryptophan, and upon examining the 5’ end of the trp mRNA he found there was a leader sequence consisting of 162 nucleotides that came before the initiation codon of the first enzyme. His next observation was that only the first 130 nucleotides were produced as a transcript when the levels of tryptophan were high, but when levels were low a 7000-nucleotide trp mRNA which included the entire leader sequence was produced. This mode of regulation is called attenuation, where transcription is cut off before any mRNA coding for the enzymes is produced.

Attenuation depends on the mRNA’s 5’ end features. The first part of the sequence codes for a leader peptide of 14 amino acids. The attenuator comes after the open reading frame for this peptide—it is an RNA region capable of forming a few alternate structures. Because transcription and translation are very closely coupled in bacteria, the translation of say the trp mRNA begins very soon after the synthesizing of the ribosome-binding site.

The structure of mRNA is altered by a ribosome, which is stalled by the absence of an animoacyl-tRNA necessary for the translation of the leader mRNA. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon past the attenuator site

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ramachandran plot original outlines.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Original hard-sphere, reduced-radius, and relaxed-tau φ,ψ regions from Ramachandran, with -180 to +180 axes]]
[[Image:Protein backbone PhiPsiOmega drawing.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Backbone dihedral angles φ and ψ (and ω)]]
A '''Ramachandran plot''', also known as a Ramachandran diagram or a [φ,ψ] plot, was originally developed by Gopalasamudram Ramachandran, an Indian physicist, in 1963. Ramachandran Plot is a way to visualize dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure.  Ramachandran recognized that many combinations of angles in a polypeptide chain are forbidden because of steric collisions between atoms.  His two-dimensional plot shows the allowed and disfavored values of ψ and φ: three-quarters of the possible combinations are excluded simply by local steric clashes.  Steric exclusion is the fact that two atoms cannot be in the same place at the same time is the powerful organizing principle that propels the use of the Ramachandron plot forward.

==Torsion Angles==
The two torsion angles of the polypeptide chain, also called Ramachandran angles, describe the rotations of the polypeptide backbone around the bonds between N-Cα (called Phi, φ) and Cα-C (called Psi, ψ). The Ramachandran plot provides an easy way to view the distribution of torsion angles of a protein structure.  It also provides an overview of allowed and disallowed regions of torsion angle values, serving as an important factor in the assessment of the quality of protein three-dimensional structures. 

Torsion angles are among the most important local structural parameters that control protein folding - essentially, if we would have a way to predict the Ramachandran angles for a particular protein, we would be able to predict its 3D structure. The reason is that these angles provide the flexibility required for folding of the polypeptide backbone, since the third possible torsion angle within the protein backbone (called omega, ω) is essentially flat and fixed to 180 degrees.  This is due to the partial double-bond character of the peptide bond, which restricts rotation around the C-N bond, placing two successive alpha-carbons and C, O, N and H between them in one plane. Thus, rotation of the main chain (backbone) of a protein can be described as the rotation of the peptide bond planes relative to each other. 

==Regions in Ramachandran Plot==
The Ramachandran Plot helps with determination of secondary structures of proteins. 
*Quadrant I shows a region where some conformations are allowed. This is where rare left-handed alpha helices lie.
*Quadrant II shows the biggest region in the graph. This region has the most favorable conformations of atoms. It shows the sterically allowed conformations for beta strands.
*Quadrant III shows the next biggest region in the graph. This is where right-handed alpha helices lie.
*Quadrant IV has almost no outlined region. This conformation(ψ around -180 to 0 degrees, φ around 0-180 degrees) is disfavored due to steric clash.

==Exceptions==
Exception from the principle of clustering around the α-helix and β-strand regions is [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids#Glycine - Gly/ G|glycine]]. Glycine does not have a complex side chain, which allows high flexibility in the polypeptide chain as well as torsion angles, something normally not allowed for other amino acid residues. That is why glycine is often found in loop regions, where the polypeptide chain makes a sharp turn. This is also the reason for the high conservation of glycine residues in protein families, since the presence of turns at certain positions is a characteristic of a particular fold of a protein structure. 

Another residue with special properties in terms of its torsion angles is [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids#Proline - Pro/ P|proline]]. Proline, in contrast to glycine, fixes the torsion angles at values, which are very close to those of an extended conformation of the polypeptide (like in a beta-sheet). Proline is often found at the end of helices and functions as a helix disruptor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Synthesis =
The synthesis of amino acids is vital to life itself. They are important because they are the basis of proteins and required for the synthesis of more complicated molecules such as vitamins. Amino acid synthesis is the process of creating amino acids from other molecules. Not all animals can synthesize all the amino acids. Non essential amino acids are those that are synthesized while the essential amino acids are those that need to be obtained through diet. Non-essential amino acids are the amino acids that can be synthesized in animals. 

The amino acids synthesis pathways are grouped into six categories. They are grouped according to their similar mechanism or the use of similar enzymes to synthesize amino acids. These six categories are simple reactions, branch chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, threonine/lysine, serine/glycine, and unique pathways.

== Synthesis of Amino Acids ==

=== Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky ===




Using Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination, the creation of racemic alanine can be formed from propanoic acid.  This can be done as Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination allows for an addition of a functional group at the carbon 2 of propanoic acid.  Through this reaction, a nucleophile can displace the bromine that is formed on carbon number two.  In using a nucleophile such as ammonia, the amino acid Alanine can therefore be formed.  Due to the low yields produced by Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination, Gabriel Synthesis is preferred in the making of primary amines.


''Mechanism of Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky Bromination:''
[[File:Hell Volhard Zelinsky Reaktion Mechanismus3.svg|938 × 212px|center]]

This reaction is followed by an addition of ammonia, which will displace bromine and form Alanine.

=== Gabriel Synthesis ===



The formed 2-substitued propanedioate can be alkylated, allowing for the preparation of a variety of substituted amino acids. 

''Mechanism of Gabriel Synthesis:''
[[File:Gabriel synthesis mechanism.png|thumb|Gabriel synthesis mechanism|center]]

A propanedioate such as diethyl 2-bromomalonate would be used to form an amino acid such as Glycine.  The difference however in the synthesis of Glycine from the Gabriel Synthesis from the regular Gabriel synthesis shown above, is that the group that is attached to the Nitrogen after the first step would be hydrolyzed to form two carboxylic acids.  One of the carboxylic acid group would be then decarboxylated and hydrolysis would occur once again to cleave the imide group, which would result in the formation of Glycine.

=== Strecker Synthesis ===
This synthesis is based on the cyanohydrin formation that can occur from aldehydes and hydrogen cyanide.  When this reaction is carried out in the presence of ammonia or ammonium cyanide with an acetaldehyde, formation of the amino acid Alanine can occur.

''Mechanism of  Strecker Synthesis of Alanine:''
[[File:Strecker synthesis.png|thumb|Strecker synthesis|center]]

==Simple Reactions:The synthesis of Glutamine, Glutamate, Aspartate, Asparagines and Alanine==

Glutamate is synthesized by the addition of ammonia to alpha-ketoglutarate.

[[File:Synthesis of Glutamate.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Glutamate]]

Using Glutamate, the addition of another ammonia molecule made Glutamine. 

[[File:Synthesis of Glutamine.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Glutamine]]

Aspartate is made by the combination of Oxaloacetate and Glutamate. 

[[File:Synthesis of Aspartate.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Aspartate]]

Asparagine can be made by adding ammonia directly to Aspartate.

[[File:Synthesis of Asparagine.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Asparagine]]
There are several methods for making Alanine. The most common way is the transferring of amine group from glutamate onto private.

[[File:Alprazolam.jpg|thumb|Add caption here]]

==Introduction==
Alprazolam (also known as Xanax) is a psychoactive drug  used to treat anxiety disorders along with panic disorders. It is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines  and how it works is it decreases abnormal excitement in the brain. Alprazolam can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can come as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, and it is also available in a liquid form. 
Alprazolam is used to treat anxiety disorders and panic disorders (sudden and unexpected attacks of extreme fear and uneasiness about these thoughts). Alprazolam is in a class of medication called benzodiazepines, which works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.

Alprazolam is also sometimes used to treat depression, fear of open spaces (agoraphobia), and premenstrual syndrome. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
[[File:Alprazolam chemical structure.png|thumb|Chemical structure]]

==History==
Alprazolam is now part of Pfizer, but it was first released by Upjohn. It was covered under U.S. Patent 3,987,052, which was filed on October of 1969 and expired in September 1993. In the year 1981, Alprazolam was released. When it came out, the first approved indication was panic disordered. 

A young psychiatrist named David Sheehan suggested using the new distinction called DSM-III. Hence, DSM-III created in the classification of anxiety disorders between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and panic disorder in order to market alprazolam. In other words, this was a way for Sheehan to advertise the use of alprozolam. From his studies, Sheehen knew that panic disorder was both widespread among the populace and responsive to benzodiazepines. Therefore, he had an idea and suggested to Upjohn that marketing alproxolam for panic disorder would both cover new diagnostic territory and emphasize the unique potency of this drug. He was basically finding unique ways to show how great alprozolam is. 

As his clinical study continues, Sheehen describes how the first group of patients he tested with aplprozolam say how effective this drug was. They were basically all very impressed with the action that alprozolam carries. Several months later, when the United States Food and Drug Administration approved alprozolam, alprozolam was sold out quick and they made a great profit. However, similar to many other drugs out there many published reports in the medical literature state that taking alprozolam created severe withdrawal symptoms including psychoses, seizures, and intense rebound anxiety.

==Panic/Anxiety Disorders== 
Alprazolam is effective in relieving moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. It is no longer the first line of defense for these attacks due to concerns of tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Doctors limited Alprazolam for a patient from 4 to 10 weeks and is only allowed  to distribute the drug to those of no history of tolerance or dependence of any drug.
 
==Alprazolam and Pregnancy==
By taking Alprazolam while being pregnant has potential  risks. It can cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period. It can also cause neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. Alprazolam are known to excreted in human milk and passed down to the infants. Alprazolam causes the infants to lose weight and become lethargic.

==Mechanism of Action==
Alprazolam is a Central Nervous System drug from the benzodiazepine class of no known mechanism of action. It is predicted to have its effects through binding to different stereo-specific receptors in the CNS. Alprazolam has also been tested to show antidepressant properties, which isn't usually a common characteristic of regular benzodiazepine derivatives.

[[File:Side effects.png|thumb|Add caption here]]

==Side Effects==
Alprazolam can cause several side effects. The most common side-effects are:
# drowsiness
# light-headedness
# headache
# tiredness
# dizziness
# irritability
# talkativeness
# difficulty concentrating
# dry mouth
# increased salivation
# changes in sex drive or ability
# nausea
# constipation
# changes in appetite
# weight changes
# difficulty urinating
# joint pain

Besides these common side effects, it sometimes produces more side side effects such as:
# shortness of breath
# seizures
# seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist (hallucinating)
# severe skin rash
# yellowing of the skin or eyes
# depression
# memory problems
# confusion
# problems with speech
# unusual changes in behavior or mood
# thinking about harming or killing yourself or trying to do so
# problems with coordination or balance

==Food and Drug interactions==
Alprazolam is metabolized via CYP3A4. Inhibitors such as fluoxetine, ketoconazole, cimetidine, nedfazodone, ritonavir, propoxyphene, erthromycin, and itraconazole are all examples of combining CYP3A4 inhibitors. These inhibitors basically delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam which create an excessive accumulation of alprazolam. 

Through the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day, Imipramine and Desipramine both have been reported to increase an average 31% and 20%. It is also known that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alproxolam. This leads to the increased of plasma levels of alprozolam and accumulation. 

Furthermore, herb kava and alprazolam can have a great affect between each other when combined because it can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Hypericum is a genus of about 400 species of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae that can lower the plasma levels of alproxolam and reduce its therapeutic effect. However, looking at the big picture, alcohol is one of the most important and common interactions. This is due to the idea of combination. Alcohol and benzodiazepines such as alproxolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another. Due to this reaction, it causes severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. Therefore, it is usually seen that the more alcohol and alprozolam taken, the worse the interaction will be.

      <comment>/* Reason of Drug Targeting and its Consequences */ typos</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Drug Targeting=
In order to delivery drug to the desired destination, targeting is an important subject in drug delivery. Ligand is a substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve for a biological purpose. There are three classes of ligands that are commonly used for drug delivery targeting. Antibodies and/or antibody fragments, peptides, and aptamers. Depending upon the situation of targeting, different type of ligand is used.

==Reason of Drug Targeting and its Consequences==
Drug targeting can be defined as the method and efficiency of delivering drugs to a target organ or system.  Although this may seem like a simple process (just eat it or inject it into the blood right?), there are actually so many obstacles that have to be solved that it takes pharmaceutical companies years to develop one drug.   These challenges include if the drug actually makes it to the target organ, and if it makes it to the organ in significant amounts that would actually be of benefit.  
Its common knowledge that if drug is eaten, it'll eventually end up in the blood and go everywhere in the body.  What is not usually knows is if the drug is too thinly spread out over the body to be of any use, and the consequences of these drugs arriving at an non-target organ. 

The fact that drug concentrations could be diluted to the point where it has no effect could be linked to a pharmaceutical's attempt in finding out the dosage of this drug.  When testing a drug, scientists must find out how much of the drug could be administered to give a significant effect, while also testing for if increasing the dosage would increase the side effects.  A balance of these two must be met in order for a drug dosage to be determined.  Some variables would include the patient's body mass, age, blood levels, health of kidney and liver, and other medications the patient is taking.  All these factors would play a role in determining how much drug to administer to the patient.  If a patient has healthy liver, there's a good chance that a lot of the drug is going to be destroyed before it reaches the bloodstream.  If the patient has low amount of blood, not a lot of drug has to be administered because it wont be as diluted.  other medications the patient is taking could have chemical reactions that could lead to serious side effects.  Another factor to take into account is the chemical weight and properties of the drug.  If the drug has high molecular weight, not as much of the drug needs to be administered.  

Mainly, pharmaceuticals are more concerned with what would happen if a drug meant for the kidney ends up near the lungs, or something similar to this.  This could be called side effects.  Often this is solved by observing the carbohydrate chains on the surface of cell membranes to discover what receptors cells of specific organs have.  Developing a drug that fits into most of these receptors (a broad and commonly structured drug) would increase the chances of side effects.  It is therefore crucial to develop a drug that binds to a cell's receptor as specifically as possible to reduce side effects.  Discovering side effects and minimizing these side effects is a big part of getting a drug pass the examination tests and get on the shelves of pharmacies.(5)

=Anti-microbial drugs targeted at different levels=
==At cell membrane level==
Two drugs that target harmful microbes at the cell membrane level include polymyxins and nystatin. Polymyxins interfere with bacterial cell membrane, and therefore bacteria cannot function as osmotic barriers. The functional distinction between polymyxins and nystatin is that nystatin interferes with cell membranes of fungi and yeast whereas polymyxins disrupt bacterial cell membrane. Nystatin will bind to ergosterol, an essential component found in fungi cell membrane, which leads to cell membrane interruption that is representative with appearances of holes in the membrane.

=Other groupings of anti-microbial drugs by their targets=
==At DNA level==
Fluoroquinolones, or Cipro, inhibits synthesis of nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, by preventing gyrase, an enzyme needed for DNA replication, from unzipping. As a result, there is no DNA replication. Fluoroquinolones is broad-spectrum and extremely potent and thus can be used on difficult to treat bacteria, such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', which causes anthrax, and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. Another anti-microbial drug that is targeted at the DNA level is rifampin, which is used to treat TB by inhibiting prokaryotic RNA polymerase, which in turn prevents transcription and therefore, no production of mRNA. The bacteria cannot live without these essential proteins.

==At protein synthesis level==
Linezolid, or Zyvox, disrupts the initiation of protein synthesis, and thus is used to treat MRSA, methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', and VRE, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, which are two of the most difficult pathogens to treat. Other anti-microbials that target at the protein synthesis level include streptomycin, gentamycin, tetracyclines, and erythromycin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nanodrug Platform==

Different administration of drugs is to enhance the drug effects on the body, depending on the symptom of the patient. Below is an illustration showing therapeutic window. The goal and the challenge of the researchers is to minimize the drug toxicity to the body and to maximize the drug activity inside the body.
In order to keep the drug concentration inside of blood at the therapeutic window, a sustainable drug release is desired. To achieve this, many nanotechnology drug platforms are available. The most common ones are liposomes and hydrogels.



===Hydrogel===
Hydrogel can encapsulate drugs inside its core. When the environment changes, the hydrogel is able to swell, which causes the release of drug.

====Types of hydrogel====

=====Acidic or basic hydrogel=====
	change in pH causes swelling causes release of drug

=====ionic hydrogel=====
	change in ionic strength causes change in concentration of ions inside the gel causes change in swelling causes release of drug

=====hydrogel containing electron-accepting groups=====
	Electron-donating compounds causes formation of charge and transfer complex causes change in swelling causes the release of drug.

=====Hydrogel containing immobilized enzymes=====
	A substrate is present, and enzymatic conversion causes the product the change and swell, which causes the release of drug.

=====Magnetic particles disperse in alginate microshapes=====
A magnetic field is applied to change the pores in gel to change in swelling and thus release of drug.

=====Thermoresponsive hydrogel=====
	A change in temperature causes change in polymer-polymer and water-polymer interactions that changes the shape of hydrogel and causes the release of drug.

=====Polyeeletrolyte hydrogel=====
	An electric field is applied that causes the membrane the charge and causes the electrophoresis of charged drug and change the shape of hydrogel to release the drug

=====Ethylene-vinyl alcohol hydrogel=====
	Untralsound irradiation is used to increase the temperature to cause the hydrogel to swell to release the drug.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Most of the vitamins are known to act as coenzymes. However, Vitamin D, also known as calciferol, do not behave as coenzymes. Instead, Vitamin D are known to regulate calcium and phosphate metabolisms. Through recent research, Vitamin D are known for preventing different cancers and cardiovascular disease, protecting against diabetes, and enhancing the ability of muscle works.  &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. Biochemistry. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally, the best sources for vitamin D can be found in fatty fish like salmon and tuna and in fish liver oils. Smaller amounts of vitamin D can also be found in beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Vitamin D can also be taken in the form of supplements, either in the form D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Most of people are attain their vitamin D through sunlight exposure. The UV-B radiation of sunlight penetrates the skin and converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 which then becomes vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Health effects of supplements ==
Up until today, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on health are uncertain. A United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that outcomes that are related to disease such as cancer or diabetes could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake. However, some researchers claimed that the IOM made a mistake when calculating the blood level of vitamin D associated with bone health. In return, the IOM members said that they used a standard procedure for dietary recommendations and that the result is just based on what they had in their data. Basically, many researchers use large scale of clinical trials to do research on vitamin D supplements. 

== Bone Health ==
Osteomalacia also known as rickets (when happen to children) are caused by vitamin D deficiency. Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with falls, and low bone mineral density. The United States Preventive Services Task Force in the year of 2012 issued a draft statement conveying that there is not enough evidence to indicate that healthy postmenopausal women should use supplemental doses of calcium or vitamin D to prevent any fractures. 

However, there are also other studies that show that any supplementation containing vitamin D and calcium may improve bone mineral density. Supplementation containing vitamin D may also decrease the risk of falls and fractures in only certain groups of people and not all. Further studies, even proved that elders in the age of 65 may take these supplements and decrease the risk of fractures. However, there is not much evidence that can prove this actually works. In the end, it appears that without a good amount of calcium, the amount of vitamin D that a person consume is not enough to benefit the bone health.

== Mortality ==
Low blood levels of vitamin D are related with increased mortality. Elderly women that are giving supplementary vitamin D3 seems to decrease the risk of death. However, there are vitamins that are not seen effective. One such vitamin is vitamin D2, and other vitamins are like alfacalcidol and calcitriol. It is important to note that consuming vitamin D is good for the health, but an excess and a deficiency in vitamin D appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging.

== Cancer ==
Taking supplements containing vitamin D does not appear to help people with prostate cancer. However, there some cancers that are related to low vitamin D levels and with worse outcomes in other cancers. As of today, there is not enough evidence to support supplementation in those with cancer.

== Pregnancy ==
It is actually good for pregnant women to take a good amount of vitamin D because it will give positive immune effects. However, there are many women who are pregnant that does not take the recommended dose of vitamin D and this will definitely create a negative impact on the mother and her baby in the stomach.

== Multiple Sclerosis ==
Multiple sclerosis is related to low vitamin D. Although there are uncertainties, many supplementation that contains vitamin D may have a protective effect. 

The reason why vitamin D deficiency is thought to case multiple sclerosis is due to the following reasons:

*MS often increases with increasing latitude, which is strongly inversely correlated with duration and intensity of UVB from vitamin D concentrations and the sunlight.
*At higher latitudes in populations with high consumption of vitamin D (rich fatty fish), the prevalence of MS are lower than expected.
*With migration from high to low latitudes, MS risk decreases.

Since the year 2011, Vitamin D3 is tested to be as a treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.

== Synthesis ==
Vitamin D is synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) in three different steps. The first process in this synthesis is by utilizing ultraviolet light to photolyze 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The second process occurs immediately when the previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; isomerizes to create vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as Cholecalciferol. The last process occurs when vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Cholecalciferol) goes through the process of hydroxylation reaction to form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. Biochemistry. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
The images shown below indicate the process of synthesizing Vitamin D in three different steps:

[[File:Reaction - cholecalciferol to calcidiol.png|thumbnail|center]]
[[File:Reaction - calcidiol to calcitriol.png|thumbnail|center]]

7-Dehydrocholesterol is formed by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol and has a conjugated diene unit in its B ring. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is present in the tissues of the skin, where it is transformed to vitamin D3 by a sunlight-induced photochemical reaction. Vitamin D 3 is a key compound in the process by which Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is absorbed from the intestine. Low levels of vitamin D 3 lead to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations in the body that are insuffi cient to support proper bone growth, resulting in the bone disease called rickets.

[[File:1,7-shift of lumisterol to vitamin D2.png|thumb|right|7-Dehydrocholesterol is transformed to vitamin D 3 by a sunlight-induced photochemical reaction]]

== Deficiency of Vitamin D ==
Deficiency of Vitamin D may cause severe damages to both children and adults. Children should be aware of the disease known as rickets which is mainly caused by Vitamin D deficiency. The symptoms of rickets are deformation of skeletal bones which affects in impaired growth. Adults should be aware of the disease known as osteomalacia. Symptoms for osteomalacia is bending of bones due to its weakness. A primary way to escape from Vitamin D deficiency is through fortified foods. Milk is an excellent way to consume an acceptable portion of Vitamin D for our daily lives. &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. Biochemistry. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

People at risk of not getting enough vitamin D include: 
* breastfed infants - their vitamin D intake directly corresponds to their mother's vitamin D levels
* older adults - As they age their skin decreases in its efficiency to synthesize vitamin D. Also can be caused because they are more likely to stay indoors
* people with limited sun exposure - As UV rays from the sun are the main source for vitamin D, limiting the sun exposure can drastically decrease the vitamin D intake.
* dark-skinned people - The greater amounts of melanin reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight.
* obese people - Those who are obese may need higher amounts of vitamin D than those who are not obese.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
	Researchers initially thought that enzyme ERO1, endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1, couples oxygen reduction to ''de novo'' formation of disulfides, but it was recently discovered that mammals that are deficient in this enzyme still survive and form disulfides. This suggests that there exist alternative pathways to forming disulfides. Discoveries have found that peroxiredoxin 4 is involved in peroxide removal and disulfide formation. Many other different pathways for disulfide formation in the mammalian ER include quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase, ER-localized protein disulfide isomerase peroxidases and vitamin K epoxide reductase. These various pathways for forming disulfides are regulated by glutathione.
[[File:Disulfide-bond.png|thumb|Disulfide-bond]]

== Disulfide formation in the endoplasmic reticulum ==
Many important secretory and cell-surface proteins like antibodies, plasma membrane receptors and channels, extracellular matrix proteins, and blood clotting factors contain disulfide bonds because disulfides heighten protein stability and control redox-dependent functions. Disulfides in the endoplasmic reticulum undergo a procedure catalyzed by membranes of the PDI, protein disulfide isomerase, family and then undergo co-translational translocation to the ER. As the polypeptide starts to fold, cysteine residues that come into close contact form disulfides, even if they do not form in the end product. These disulfides that do not end up folding into the final product are sources of problems for misfolded proteins but may also serve as intermediates in normal folding processes. In order to obtain the final correctly folded disulfide, incorrectly folded disulfides must be disintegrated in a reaction catalyzed by the PDI family. The PDI family thus plays a vital role in the course for the correct formation and reduction of disulfides in order for proper folding of proteins that enter the endoplasmic reticulum

The correspondence of a disulfide between the enzyme and substrate is needed to cause a catalytic reaction to form a disulfide. Since PDI family members each accommodate at least one thioredoxin domain, a CXXC motif alternates between dithiol and disulfide states at their active site. When a disulfide is transferred to the substrate protein, a reduction of the active site occurs. It is necessary that the active site be deoxidized in order for the enzyme to carry out further oxidation.  It was initially thought that GSSG, glutathione disulfide, was relevant in how the active site is reoxidized. ''In Vitro'' experiments were conducted and showed that a GSH/GSSG ratio similar to that found in the endoplasmic reticulum would efficiently oxidize active site cysteines in PDI, thus transferring disulfides onto substrate proteins. These experiments didn’t show how disulfides were introduced ''de novo''. With the revelation of ERO1p, an enzyme in yeast called endoplasmic oxidoreduction, it was found that this enzyme was necessary for the formation of disulfide. ERO1p plays an important role in oxidizing PDI instead of secreting proteins or low-molecular-weight molecules like GSH and catalyzing oxidation by coupling ''de novo'' disulfide formation to the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. While securely regulated in order to prevent overproduction of reactive oxygen species, ERO1 showed how disulfides could be formed ''de novo'' and also identified the ultimate electron acceptor for the pathway.

== Ero 1 is essential in yeast but not in higher eukaryotes ==
Knockout of the gene encoding ERO1p in various organisms showed different conclusions of its importance. When the gene encoding ERO1p was knocked out in yeast, it demonstrated its importance as an essential protein in yeast. Knockouts in higher eukaryotes showed different results. When knocked out in D. mlanogasterI, this led to a relatively mild phenotype with a certain problem in its folding of the cell-surface receptor Notch. Two ERO1 paralogs, pair of genes ERO1α and ERO1β, exist in mice and humans. When knocked out of ERO1 β, a defect in the folding of proinsulin occurred. ERO1α is thought to drive disulfide development in other tissues. It was found that a double knockout of ERO1α and ERO1β did not result in a more severe reaction than when ERO1 β is knocked out by itself. This showed that there existed an ERO1-independent pathway for the formation of disulfides in mammalian cells and double knockout cells helped re-establish normal endoplasmic redox conditions. 

== Potential pathways to generate disulfides ''de novo''  in the ER ==

&lt;u&gt;'''PRDX4'''&lt;/u&gt;

Since H2O2 is also generated when a reaction is catalyzed by ERO1, this indicates that additional proteins might be present in the endoplasmic reticulum to remove this reactive oxygen species. Enzymes called peroxiredoxins metabolize H2O2 ensuing disulfide formation. PRDx4 is active in both H2O2 removal and disulfide formation. Studies show a new responsibility for PRDx4 in de novo disulfide formation. Since PRDX4 and several PDI family members within the ER and equivalent, this shows that the enzyme is an abundant endoplasmic resident protein. Under circumstances where PRDX4 was efficiently reduced by some PDI family members during incubation of the two proteins at equal concentrations, some PDI protein was oxidized. This showed that even though GSH was a reductant on its own, when a PDI is included, the efficiency of PRDx4 reduction is enhanced. This proposes that disulfide exchanged between PRDx4 and GSH to form GSSP depends on the presence of PDI. If PRDX4 were to be reduced by PDI family members, a rapid disulfide formation in secretory proteins could occur. These results are confirmed by in vitro evidence. Since PRDX4 enhances a temperature-sensitive mutant of ERO1, viability and disulfide formation in yeast occurs at non-permissive temperatures. However, overexpression of PDI family members can also lead to decrease or increase in the ability of PRDX4 to be reduced in the endoplasmic reticulum. In conclusion, by combining the ERO1 and PRDX4 pathways, every oxygen molecule that is reduced causes two disulfides to be introduced, therefore making the whole process more effective than using ERO1 alone.

&lt;u&gt;'''GPX7 and GPX8'''&lt;/u&gt;

GPX7 and GPX8, homologous enzymes, belong to the family of thioredoxin GPX-like peroxidases that can also reduce H2O2. They are PDI peroxidases that couple the reduction of H2O2 to oxidation of certain PDI family members. In the presence of these GPXs, certain PDI family members are easily oxidized. With the presence of both GPX and PDI, oxidative refolding of a reduced model protein mediated by H2O2 proceeds faster. Physical associations between ERO1α and both GPXs in cells are shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. With the addition of GPX7, the in vitro rate of oxygen consumed by ERO1α increased, indicating a more efficient process in its presence. These biochemical results show an important role for GPX7 and GPX8 in disulfide formation. 

&lt;u&gt;'''QSOX'''&lt;/u&gt;

Erx2p, a sulfhydrl oxidase, when overexpressed could suppress the ero1-1 mutation. This different pathway shows that alternative proteins could potentially fulfill the essential function of ERO1 in yeast and other organisms. QSOX, a flavoprotein known to introduce disulfides into proteins in vitro, is similar to Erv2p. QSOX plays a part in catalyzing de novo disulfide formation by coupling disulfide oxidation to the reduction of oxygen in order to form H2O2. Unlike ERO1, which specially oxidizes only PDI family members, QSOX has a much broader substrate specificity that can introduce disulfides into protein substrates. However, PDI has the ability to greatly enhance native disulfide formation since QSOX cannot isomerize non-native disulfides. QSOX has the ability to complement Δero1 yeast strain when overexpressed. This indicates that QSOX is involved in disulfide formation when in vivo. When ERO1 and QSOX are both knocked down, a more severe phenotype occurs than when ERO1 is knocked down alone indicating that QSOX might provide some function when ERO1 is absent. QSOX currently remains a candidate for de novo disulfide formation independent of ERO1 due to its promiscuous substrate specificity and location in the secretory pathway. 

&lt;u&gt;'''VKOR'''&lt;/u&gt;

The VKOR enzyme exhibits another potential ERO1-independent pathway for disulfide formation . VKOR is a four transmembrane helix protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. VKOR functions by catalyzing the two steps in the reduction of vitamin K epoxide so as to generate vitamin K hydroquinone. When vitamin K epoxide is reduced, a CXXC motif in VKOR is then oxidized to form a disulfide bond. Members in VKOR family exchange this disulfide with thiredoxin-like oxidoreductases in order to oxidize substrate proteins. Since human VKOR does not contain a thioredoxin domain, PDI family members instead serve as VKOR substrates. WHen overexpression occurs with active-site CXXA mutants, VKOR can be trapped in a mixed-disulfide complex with PDI family members, mainly the transmembrane-bound TMX and TMX4. Results of these experiments show that VKOR sustaining disulfide formation is still unclear but proves a potential pathway.

==Relative contribution and interplay between oxidative pathways==

With all these potential pathways for disulfide formation, now their relative contribution has to be figured out. ERO1 pathway is an important pathway for disulfide formation under normal physiological conditions. TRDX4 hyperoxidation in cells expresses a deregulated form of ERO1 and shows that the enzyme is active in the ER and has the ability to produce hydrogen peroxide. Even though mammals do no necessarily need this pathway, if it didn’t exist, it would compromise disulfide formation. ERO1 is important in determining the redox status of PDI in cells and also forms mixed disulfides with PDI. This shows that ERO has the ability to oxidize PDI. If animals did not have ERO1 to survive and still formed disulfide-bonded proteins, this shows that other pathways exist. Their relative contributions still have to be explored.

	PRDX4-dependent pathway doesn’t provide a significant contribution to disulfide formation. If it did, it would be predicted that the Prdx4 knockout mouse should have a severe phenotype and even though the Prdx4 knockout mouse is viable, it is sterile due to oxidative stress in the testis. PRDX4 pathway is then determined to be crucial for correct function of specific tissues though not essential for survival. If there were a higher presence of PRDX4 in higher eukaryotes, it would show mild phenotypes of ERO1 knockouts as an alternative source of hydrogen peroxide that is available in order to make the PRDX4 pathway work. More research is needed to determine which sources provide the H2O2 necessary to drive disulfide formation. The importance of the PRDX4 pathway needs to be determined, even if PRDX4 provides an alternative pathway to ERO1 for disulfide formation. 

	An endogenous level, enzymes GPx7 and GPx8 cannot substitute for PrdxIV in ERO1 knockout cells. These enzymes could have a similar function to PRDX4. Research shows that proteins of the peroxiredoxin family have a higher rate of reactivity towards H2O2than GPXs. Evidence shows that interaction between Ero1α with the GPXs in vivo might compensate for their relatively slower rates of reactivity. Further understanding of their characterization is needed of the enzymes in order to explain their roles in de novo disulfide formation. Current research shows that the cellular function of VKOR in disulfide formation remains essentially uncharacterized. In VKOR, the mixed disulfide trapped with PDI family members does suggest a role in the process though. The pathway of oxidation of PDIs by VKOR being coupled strictly to γ-carboxyglutamate formation is not important due to its low flux. This would not be the case if the hydroquinone could be reoxidized through an alternative electron acceptor. This could bring about a more important role in the pathway.
	
As shown in vitro experiments, direct oxidation by H2O2 of cysteines in PDI and substrate proteins to form disulfides could potentially occur. Although, these pathways are shown to not be important due to faster kinetics of substrate refolding when the reaction mixture contains H2O2 and PDI family members together with either of the PDI peroxidases or PRDX4. Dehydroascorbate is an addition source of oxidizing equivalents in the ER. DHa can be moved into the ER from the cytosol, generated in the ER, and like H2O2, DHA directly oxidizes PDI and unfolds reduced proteins in vitro . Due to its slow rate, the former pathway is shown to not be a main route for the reduction of DHA. A faster pathway occurs with a faster PDI-independent oxidation of protein substrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Transmucosal refers to the route of administration in which the drug is diffused through the mucous membrane. This can refer to inhalation, nasal, sublingual, vaginal, rectal, or ocular routes. 

==Insufflation==
Insufflation refers to the action of inhaling a substance. It is often used as a route for respiratory drugs that can treat sinus and lung conditions. This route of administration is typically used for psychoactive drugs due to the faster diffusion rates into the bloodstream and its capabilities of enabling the drug to bypass the blood-brain barrier. For this method, bioavailability is higher than the bioavailability for the oral route. Cocaine is a common drug that utilizes the route of insufflation. 

==Sublingual Administration==
Sublingual administration refers to the process of diffusing drugs into the blood by utilizing tissues beneath the tongue. Drugs that are designed for this route include barbiturates, enzymes, steroids, and cardiovascular drugs. Like the other transmucosal routes, the sublingual administration diffuses through the mucous membrane that is under the tongue. This process is more direct than the oral tract, thus lowering the risk of degradation due to salivary enzymes before entering the bloodstream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Overview'''
Cdc48 is a hexamer protein that belongs to a group of enzyme called ATPase.  Past research has shown that it helps to control the quality of protein activities such as: endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD), transcriptional and metabolic regulation, DNA damage response, and many more.  New research shows that Cdc48 regulates the degradation of damaged proteins by helping to store them in aggresome when the cell is under stress and later to destroy the damaged proteins.  

[[File:Landes Bioscience Madame Curie Database|thumbnail|Cdc48]]
'''Structure'''
Cdc48 is a hexamer protein.  It has central core with six protomers attached to it to form a ring.  The four domains that make up a protomers an amine terminus, AAA region (D1 and D2), and a carboxyl tail.  There are twelve ATPase active sites for ATP hydrolysis reaction.  When a hydrolysis reaction occurs, Cdc48 changes its shape by maneuvering the six protomers that allows for the opening and closing of the rings.  Furthermore, different temperatures allows for different parts of the domain to be more activity than others.  For example, D1domain works at its maximum at the 60˚C while D2 domain works better at 37˚C.  In addition, the conformation change is necessary because it affects the function of the protein.  If the protein does not work, it can result in a cell death.  Furthermore, the carboxyl tail can be phosphorylated and acetylated that will affect the protein’s ATPase activity, localization, and binding ability.

'''Function'''

	The function of Cdc48 depends heavily on its cofactor.  Each cofactor programs that protein to perform a specific function.  Meanwhile, the substrate-processing factor will bind to the protein to direct the protein’s path.  One of the best known functions of the protein is in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation.  Cdc49 forms a complex with Udf1 and Np14, which then bind to an ERAD ubiquitylated substrate.  Consequently, this action causes a chain reaction that leads to the damaged proteins to be degraded in the proteasome.  Another role that Cdc48 takes part in is mitochondrial protein degradation.  Here, Vms1 replaces Ufd1 to form a complex with Cdc48.  When cells are exposed to rapamycin or hydrogen peroxide, this activates the Cdc48 to be moved to the mitochondrial membrane to degrade selected mitochondrial proteins in a process called UPS.  New research showed that a protein called E3 ligase Parkin and Cdc48 help to prevent damaged mitochondrial proteins from fusing with healthy ones.  Cdc49 also plays a role in cytoplasmic protein degradation.  Similar to ERAD, Cdc48 form the same complex.  However, its role differs by removing the ubiquitylated enzymes from the glucose-induced degradation deficient (Gid) complex to create loose ends so that the damaged proteins can go into the proteasome to be degraded.  In the nucleas protein degradation, Cdc48 complex helps to unfold and disassemble defected proteins with of its cofactors Ubx4 and Ubx5.  Ribophagy is another process that depends on Cdc48.  Here, mature ribosomes are degraded to make sure that the cell can survive.  Cdc49 pairs up with Ubp3 and Bre5 to deubiquitylate the ribosome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

RAGE is a central signaling molecule found in the immune system and is involved in enduring and complicating responses toward inflammation. RAGE is also a receptor for products of glycation and acts as a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes common characteristics instead of specific ligands. New information about RAGE’s extracellular structure led to this discovery. Experimental procedures of x-ray crystallography and NMR show that ligand binding is driven by electrostatic interactions between ectodomains and ligands, which are positively charged and negatively charged, respectively.

=RAGE and Inflammation=
[[File:PDB_8fab_EBI.jpg|thumbnail|RAGE is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors. ]]
This receptor, RAGE, is part of a superfamily of cell surface receptors known as immunoglobulin (Ig). It is a major molecule in the development of severe chronic diseases including diabetes, inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and even cancer. Animals that are healthy have low expressions of the RAGE molecule but expression increases as the state of health or a disease worsens. Increased expression in the RAGE molecule also increases the expression of ligands attached to the RAGE molecule. Examples of RAGE ligands include AGEs, which are advanced glycation end products and members of the S100 protein family. AGEs are also part of many other groups including the high mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB1), β amyloids, and fibrous protein aggregates. Attachment of ligands to RAGE receptors activates various signaling pathways that depend either on the ligand, environment or cell type. These pathways can be: 
*RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways
*stress-activated protein kinase pathways
*p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways 
*cAMP response to element-binding (CREB) protein 
*activation of transcription family (STAT3)

When an inflammation response is in process, the RAGE-ligand attachment leads to an increase in the expression of the RAGE molecule. This is a type of positive feedback loop that results in prolonged activation of NF-κB, which is a nuclear transcription factor allowing for the conversion of a positive inflammatory response into a chronic physiological state. Researchers of this phenomenon realize that in order to prevent the RAGE molecule from inhibiting inflammatory responses, the positive feedback loop created by the RAGE-ligand and RAGE molecule, should be disrupted by blocking the receptor-ligand interaction site. However, this would require extensive knowledge of the mechanism of RAGE-ligand interaction. 

=Structure=
X-Ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have allowed for studying the structure of RAGE as well as the mechanism of RAGE-ligand recognition. RAGE has a large positive surface charge allowing it to create electrostatic traps for ligands that have negative charges. The molecular organization of RAGE plays an important role initiating signals for ligand interaction. By studying fluorescence-labeled receptors, it was evident that RAGE did not exist as a single molecule in the plasma membrane of cells but collects in assemblies of receptors.

RAGE has a single transmembrane helix that connects the ectodomain with the short cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular component that is required for the ligand to recognize and bind. This extracullar component has three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains. The N-terminal Ig domain is assigned to the V-set of Ig-like molecules and is known as the V domain of RAGE. The other two Ig domains are part of the C1 and C2 set. The N-terminal V domain is located far away from the plasma membrane but the C2 domain lies close to the membrane. V and C1 domains can be joined together to form an elongated structure. V and C1 domains can be fixed and become the VC1 domain, which can connect to the C2 domain by several amino acids that have no secondary structure, which allows the VC1 and C2 domains to link. NMR spectroscopy studies have shown that VC1 moves as a single unit and can combine with the C2 domain. 

The V domain consists a large amount of arginine and lysine, which carry positive charges at neutral pH. RAGE V domain has more arginine and lysine than the V-set of Ig domains. Arginine and lysine residues form large positively charged patches on the surface of V and C1 domains. Meanwhile, C2 domain has mainly acidic residues on its surface and is negatively charged. Because the two domains are oppositely charged, the extracellular component of RAGE is subdivided. This subdivision is reflected in the ligand binding properties of the different domains since ligands do not bind to C2 due to charge repulsion. Most ligands tend to bind to the V domain or the VC1 domain since ligands are negatively charged. There is only one case where a ligand has bound to the C2 domain. Nonetheless, charge-charge interactions are important for the formation of the receptor-ligand complex and suggested that the positively charged ligand-binding domain of the RAGE molecule can recognize certain arrangements of negative charges of ligands and can recognize these as common features for the ligands. 

 
=Receptor-ligand Interactions=
[[File:Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).jpg|left||thumbnail|Surface Plasmon Resonance allowed for the revelation that ligands with multiple subunits have long periods of ligand-receptor interaction. ]]
Positron emission topography (in vivo) and in vitro have allowed for the study of binding of ligands. In vitro studies are conducted by monitoring the cellular response of RAGE ligands as well as protein-protein interactions. It was concluded that RAGE-ligand binding causes cells to respond immediately. Signaling of the ligand and its RAGE molecule increase in strength when the bonding affinity between the RAGE and ligand is high. The signal strength also increases when the signaling complex is activated for longer periods of time. There are two phases of the process of ligand binding. First, the dissociation phase reveals the lifetime of the signaling-competent complex. Ligands that dissociate slowly in vitro can induce longer and more intense receptor activations. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a method for observing these activations since it examines the real-time interaction of the receptor, which can become immobilized and its ligand, which can bind. The thermodynamics of binding including the affinity of the RAGE-ligand attraction as well as the kinetics of the dissociations can be observed. The SPR technique has also revealed that multimeric, or consisting of multiple subunits, ligands have prolonged periods of binding to their receptors.

=RAGE Ligands=
Rage ligands are very diverse and have common features that allow for the activation of the RAGE molecule. The following are examples of RAGE ligands: 
*AGEs (Advanced glycation endproducts)
These molecules are heterogeneous and are derived from the condensation and oxidation of proteins, peptides and sugars. The first step in forming AGE is the reaction of the aldehyde group of sugars with amine groups from lysine or arginine amino acids. This is a nonspecific and non-enzymatic process and it is called glycation. When glycation is high and frequent in individuals, it leads to diabetes and other complications. Oxidation of AGEs allows for the increase in overall negative charge on the ligand by carboxymethylation of the amino group. AGEs and RAGE have high affinities for one another and initiate a high level of endurance for pro-inflammatory responses. AGE and RAGE interaction has been observed as the main cause of diabetes complications and cardiovascular disorders.
*S100 Proteins 
This family of proteins includes more than 25 members and each displays different patterns and functions. These proteins are small and acidic and have two different calcium bindings that are connected by a flexible loop. S100 proteins form homodimers and sometimes heterodimers and oligomers such as tetramers and octamers. S100 proteins can be found in vertebrates mainly and are localized in the cytoplasm, acting as calcium sensors. These proteins can display intracellular calcium signaling and binding that causes the S100 proteins to change in conformation and shape. In the extracellular space, S100 proteins are loaded with calcium since the calcium concentration is high, so they can bind to RAGE easily.
*Amyloid β and amyloid fibrils
[[File:Abeta 2lfm.jpg|thumbnail|Beta Amyloid structure]]
Alzheimer disease is caused by the extracellular deposition of amyloid β peptide, originating from proteoloytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. Amyloid β peptides contains between 40 and 42 amino acids. These peptides have acidic and hydrophobic regions that are prone to accumulation of amyloid fibrils that build up amyloid plaques in the brain, causing Alzheimer’s disease. Mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease have shown that RAGE binds amyloid β and moves it around the blood stream to the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system (CNS). Analyzing this using in vitro revealed that RAGE and amyloid β have high affinity for binding the soluble amyloid β peptide. RAGE can also bind amyloid fibrils.
*High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1)
[[File:Protein_HMGB1_PDB_1aab.png|left||thumbnail|Structure of high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1)]]
This protein has an extracellular regulatory function and acts as a proinflammatory activator. HMGB1 has three domains: two N-terminus domains that are involved in DNA binding and one C-terminus domain that consists of various acidic amino acids as well as directs the binding to the RAGE molecule. HMBG1 binds to RAGE and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which forms the HMGB1-RAGE-TLR9 complex that activates B cells. DNA can bind with RAGE with high affinity and form a stable complex without the HMGB1 protein, but DNA-RAGE interaction has not produced noticeable results yet. 

=Ligands and their Common Features=
RAGE can recognize common characteristics in different ligands. RAGE ligands have a net negative charge at their surfaces. They also usually have neutral pH, but S100 proteins have acidic pH.  Also, AGEs do not usually have their surfaces negatively charged until they transform during glycation and oxidation. Most ligands also oligomerize. AGE modifies proteins, which leads to covalent bonds to higher molar mass molecules. S100 proteins also form large assemblies of tetramers or octamers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Overview'''
Cdc48 is a hexamer protein that belongs to a group of enzyme called ATPase.  Past research has shown that it helps to control the quality of protein activities such as: endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD), transcriptional and metabolic regulation, DNA damage response, and many more.  New research shows that Cdc48 regulates the degradation of damaged proteins by helping to store them in aggresome when the cell is under stress and later to destroy the damaged proteins.  
 
&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Structure'''
Cdc48 is a hexamer protein.  It has central core with six protomers attached to it to form a ring.  The four domains that make up a protomers an amine terminus, AAA region (D1 and D2), and a carboxyl tail.  There are twelve ATPase active sites for ATP hydrolysis reaction.  When a hydrolysis reaction occurs, Cdc48 changes its shape by maneuvering the six protomers that allows for the opening and closing of the rings.  Furthermore, different temperatures allows for different parts of the domain to be more activity than others.  For example, D1domain works at its maximum at the 60˚C while D2 domain works better at 37˚C.  In addition, the conformation change is necessary because it affects the function of the protein.  If the protein does not work, it can result in a cell death.  Furthermore, the carboxyl tail can be phosphorylated and acetylated that will affect the protein’s ATPase activity, localization, and binding ability.

'''Function'''
	The function of Cdc48 depends heavily on its cofactor.  Each cofactor programs that protein to perform a specific function.  Meanwhile, the substrate-processing factor will bind to the protein to direct the protein’s path.  One of the best known functions of the protein is in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation.  Cdc49 forms a complex with Udf1 and Np14, which then bind to an ERAD ubiquitylated substrate.  Consequently, this action causes a chain reaction that leads to the damaged proteins to be degraded in the proteasome.  Another role that Cdc48 takes part in is mitochondrial protein degradation.  Here, Vms1 replaces Ufd1 to form a complex with Cdc48.  When cells are exposed to rapamycin or hydrogen peroxide, this activates the Cdc48 to be moved to the mitochondrial membrane to degrade selected mitochondrial proteins in a process called UPS.  New research showed that a protein called E3 ligase Parkin and Cdc48 help to prevent damaged mitochondrial proteins from fusing with healthy ones.  Cdc49 also plays a role in cytoplasmic protein degradation.  Similar to ERAD, Cdc48 form the same complex.  However, its role differs by removing the ubiquitylated enzymes from the glucose-induced degradation deficient (Gid) complex to create loose ends so that the damaged proteins can go into the proteasome to be degraded.  In the nucleas protein degradation, Cdc48 complex helps to unfold and disassemble defected proteins with of its cofactors Ubx4 and Ubx5.  Ribophagy is another process that depends on Cdc48.  Here, mature ribosomes are degraded to make sure that the cell can survive.  Cdc49 pairs up with Ubp3 and Bre5 to deubiquitylate the ribosome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All the different membranous organelles perform different tasks in the cell (animal cells and plant cells). However, they also communicate with each other though ions and lipids. In addition, some of the organelles have membrane that are connected. The others are related by transfer of membrane segments. As we know, structures determine functions in a lot of ways in nature. We can categorize eukaryotic organelles into four categories according to their general functions.

=== Manufacturer ===
In this first category, nucleus, ribosomes, rough ER, smooth ER and golgi apparatus are included. They can perform this task because of they have metabolically active membranes. Some of them can also perform transportation of the products. Below is some examples of the manufacturing task these organelles do.
* Nucleus--DNA and RNA synthesis
* Ribosome--Polypeptide(protein) synthesis
* Rough ER--Membrane protein synthesis, secretory proteins synthesis and hydrolytic enzymes synthesis; formation of transport vesicles
* Smooth ER--Lipid synthesis; detoxification and carbohydrate metabolism in liver cells
* Golgi apparatus--Modificaiton, temporary storage and transportation of macromolecules such as proteins; formation of lysosomes and transport vesicles

=== Waste disposer ===
In this category, lysosomes, peroxisomes and vacuoles are included. They are all consist of single membrane sac that can be used to collect materials and/or break down unwanted/harmful materials.
* Lysosomes--Digestion of bacteria, damaged organelle
* Peroxisomes--breakdown of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by-product
* Vacuoles--Digestion of waste products; collect excess water from the cell

=== Energy provider ===
In this category, chloroplasts and mitochondria are included. They both have metabolically active membranes and intermembrane compartments that can convert energy units to provide to the cells.
* Chloroplast--Conversion of light energy to chemical energy in plant cells
* Mitochondria--Conversion of chemical energy of food to chemical energy of ATP

=== Support, Movement and Communication between cells ===
In this last category, cytoskeleton(such as cilia, flagella and centrioles in animal cells), cell walls(in plants, fungi and some protists), extracellular matrix(in animal cells) and cell junctions are included. They are all responsible for the keeping cells in shape.
* Cytoskeleton--Maintenance of cell shape; movement of organelles within cells; cell movement; mechanical transmission of signals from exterior of cell to interior
* Cell walls--Maintenance of cell shape and skeletal support; surface protection; binding of cells in tissue
*Extracellular matrix--Binding of cells in tissues; surface protection; regulation of cellular activities
* Cell junctions--Communication between cells; binding of cells in tissues

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brief History ==
Finding a cure for cancer has always been a goal for many health care professionals.  Many have tried, but few have made as much of a stride as Dr. Antonio Grillo-López.  He, along with several colleagues, pioneered a new drug named rituximab that serves as the first FDA approved antibody to treat cancer.  Depending on the severity of the cancer, this drug could either completely treat or extend the lifetime of the patient.  This extraordinary feat had very humble beginnings.
&lt;br /&gt;
== The Man Behind the Drug ==
Dr. Grillo-López has his roots in Puerto Rico.  Growing up, he received both his Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine degrees at the University of Puerto Rico, San Juan.  He served as an associate professor at the University of Michigan from 1980 to 1990.  He was also a part of DuPont-Merck Pharmaceuticals Parke Davis.  He was later offered a position at, what was then, a start-up company named IDEC.  Dr. Grillo-López acted as Chief Medical Officer from November 1992 to January 2001 at the company.  Later, he acted as Chief Medical Officer Emeritus from January 2001 to November 2003.  It was at this company where rituximab came to fruition.
&lt;br /&gt;
== About the Drug ==
Rituximab is a liquid drug that is administered into patients’ veins.  It is used in the treatment and care of patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis.  Dosage can vary depending on the desired treatment.  For example, in rheumatoid arthritis patients, it is given as two doses two weeks apart.  But in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, it is given once a week for four to eight weeks.  In the United States, it carries a trade name of Rituxan.  In Europe, it is offered as MabThera.  The main focus will be on non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NHL is a term that encompasses all lymphomas except for Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  Hodgkin’s lymphoma is distinguished by the presence of binucleate giant cells known as Reed-Sternberg cells.  Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphocytes in blood.  Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cells that serve an integral part of the human immune system.  They are classified into B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells.  In NHL patients, an antigen known as CD20 is found on B cells.  The rituximab antibody binds to the CD20 antigen and destroys excess, overactive, or dysfunctional B cells as a result of the disease.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Attacking the Cell ==
Rituximab kills cancerous B cells via three main mechanisms: complement-dependent cytoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytoxcity (ADCC), and apoptosis.  CDC occurs when a large group of plasma proteins (complement) work together to destroy invading pathogens and malignant cells.  Antibody-antigen complexes, such as the one between rituximab and CD20, activate the complement.  The complement protein C1 binds to the tail of the rituximab antibody in a “lock and key” fashion and starts a series of reactions that creates a membrane attack complex lining the B cell membrane and then creating a pore to allow the cellular contents to escape and eventually die.  ADCC is a process where the antibody-antigen complex forms and then attracts other components of the immune system, including natural killer cells.  The receptors on these cells recognize and bind to the tail of the rituximab antibody.  The natural killer cells also carry granules filled with cytotoxic molecules.  When the granules are released after the natural killer cells bind with rituximab, they penetrate the cellular membrane of the B cell and cause pores that facilitate the release of cellular content leading to the cell’s death.  The granules can also destroy the cells by attacking the nucleus.  The final mechanism is known as apoptosis, or programmed cell death.  Apoptosis is defined the death of cells that occurs as a normal and controlled part of an organism’s growth or development.  When rituximab bonds to CD20 and forms the antibody receptor complex, it signals the cell to start the process.  The cytoskeleton collapses upon itself, the nucleus condenses, and the DNA fragments into small pieces via enzymes.  Membrane-bound vesicles are also shredded.  At the end of apoptosis, the cell has effectively destroyed itself.  It is still unclear, however, whether these mechanism act independently or in concert.  Despite this, rituximab still proves to be an effective cure.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Experiments Involved ==
The rituximab antibody was created after several experiments involving mice.  Three mice were injected with cells from a lymphoma tumor.  These malignant cells carried the CD20 antigen that is found only on B cells.  Observations revealed that the mice’s immune system had produced antibodies to fight these foreign substances.  The tail of the antibody is humanized.  Mice and human gene sequences were used together to create the chimeric antibody that is rituximab.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Pathway to Success ==
Dr. Grillo-López accredits much of his success to the 1908 Nobel Prize winner Paul Ehrlich.  The late Paul Ehrlich was a German scientist who had experience in the fields of hematology, the study of the physiology of blood, and immunology.  His work in the latter field gained him the joint Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1908 with Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov.  Ehrlich popularized the concept of a drug that would act as a “magic bullet.”  This meant that a drug would be able to selectively target a disease-causing organism.  This way a toxin could be made to be delivered to only that organism.  This is the basis of Dr. Grillo-López’s work.  The rituximab works by selectively binding to the CD20 antigen and forming the antibody receptor complex that is a vital part of the mechanisms used to destroy infected B cells.  Ehrlich had said that success in research is only attainable with several big “G’s”.  In German, these are Geduld, Geschicklichkeit, Glück, Geld, and Geräte.  These translate to persistence and determination, skill, luck, money, and tools, respectively.  The story behind the approval process for this cure shows the influence Ehrlich had on Dr. Grillo-López.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Speed Bumps along the Road ==
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is an agency that is responsible for protecting public health by passing and enforcing laws and regulations regarding products such as foods and drugs.  All drugs must go through their approval process.  Dr. Antonio Grillo-López likens them to the pace of snails and considers them to be “the single most important obstacle to the timely development and approval of anti-cancer agents.”  He cites examples such as the five-month-review to simply approve the proposed name for rituximab.  PanThera was not approved and had to be revised to Rituxan for the U.S. markets and MabThera for European markets.  During the pre-digital age, where digital books and social networking site were unavailable, everything had to be done manually.  Dr. Grillo-López and his IDEC colleagues, Chet Varns, Alice Wei, and John Leonard, had to send in boxes upon boxes to the FDA for them to review and approve the use of rituximab.  In the data set, there was one patient who the group at IDEC considered to not be evaluable due to some minor errors.  To present an obstacle to the approval process, an FDA medical reviewer asked them to consider that patient as evaluable now.  This only worked in favor of the drug creators because that particular patient had a complete response to the drug.  This increased both the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate.  The team sent in their biologics license application and it was finally approved after a slow nine months on November 26, 1997.  After this, Dr. Grillo-López and his colleagues still faced some obstacles such doubts that a proposed study of using rituximab as part of a combination regimen known as R+CHOP instead of the traditional method of using antibodies following chemotherapy, not in conjunction, would be effective.  Despite these doubts, the combination regimen proved to be a cure for NHL.  Dr. Grillo-López was persistent and determined according to the philosophies of Paul Ehrlich, leading to his success in finding an effective cure for cancer.
&lt;br /&gt;
== End Result ==
Several milestones were achieved during its development.  Clinical trials were completed in record time by patients who would volunteer and even dress up as a mouse, harkening back to the chimeric nature of the antibody.  Ritxuimab became the first FDA approved antibody to treat cancer.  Dr. Grillo-López even paved the way for quicker FDA approvals.  Before, the FDA would take an average of seven years to approve a drug that many patients needed sooner.  He was able to reduce that approval timeframe in half.  The 2004 Discovery Health Channel’s Medical Honors recognized some of these achievements.  Rituximab’s development did not rely on government support.  Investors and partners funded the entire project.  No federal or state grants or incentives or research funding were involved either.
&lt;br /&gt;
== Impact ==
The impact that rituximab had is unprecedented.  It provides a cure for curable lymphomas such as diffused large cell lymphoma.  The lifetime of patients with incurable lymphomas have been extended.  Recent numbers further demonstrate the success of rituximab.  It has been considered the top anticancer drug in the world since 2001.  Sales in 2010 alone totaled $6.7 billion.  Each year, around 50,000 lymphoma patients are cured.  Since its introduction in 1997 until 2010, over two million patients have been treated.  Prior to this discovery, there has been a long of stagnation in finding cures or ways to extend lifetimes.  Hopefully the success of Dr. Antonio Grillo-López will inspire others to follow in his footsteps.  He, himself, has said that he is neither a saint nor a magician.  Geduld led to his success, something that can be replicated by any ordinary person with persistence and determination.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INTRODUCTION==
Mellitus diabetes is categorized as a group of chronic (lifelong) diseases in which high levels of sugar (glucose) exist in human blood.  It is the 9th leading cause of death in the world, killing more than 1.2 million people each year.  Diabetes is categorized in many groups: type 1, type 2, gestational, prediabetes and a few more.  However, the two main groups are type 1 and type 2, type 2 being more common.  Different symptoms correlate to different types of diabetes, but generally, diabetes exhibit similar symptoms such as the following:


&lt;br&gt;Type 1 Symptoms include:
&lt;br&gt;- Frequent urination
&lt;br&gt;-  Unusual thirst
&lt;br&gt;- Extreme hunger
&lt;br&gt;- Unusual weight loss
&lt;br&gt;- Extreme fatigue and irritability
&lt;br&gt;Type 2 Symptoms include:
&lt;br&gt;- Any of the type 1 symptoms
&lt;br&gt;- Frequent infections
&lt;br&gt;- Blurred vision
&lt;br&gt;- Cuts/bruises that are slow to heal
&lt;br&gt;- Tingling/numbness in the hands/feet
&lt;br&gt;- Recurring skin, gum, or bladder infections


Many complications arise and are caused by diabetes.  People may experience problems in their vision which potentially leads to blindness, numbness in their feet and hands, especially in the legs, hypertension (high blood pressure), their mental health, hearing loss, and others that are gender related.  Although there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, maintaining an idea body weight with an active lifestyle and a healthy diet can prevent and sustain type 2 diabetes.

==TYPE 1 DIABETES==
In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce little or no insulin.  Insulin is a hormone that is produced by beta cells located in the pancreas.  It functions as a transporter of sugar (glucose) into cells throughout the body.  Glucose travels through the hemoglobin, an enzyme found in blood, and is stored away and later used for energy by the body’s organs.  The failure to produce insulin results with a lack of an appropriate amount needed for the human body to function at a normal pace.  Without enough insulin, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream, thus raising the blood’s sugar level – this event is called hypertension.
	
There is no exact cure for type 1 diabetes and the exact cause is still unknown.  Researchers believe it is an autoimmune disorder, a condition in which the immune system mistakenly damages healthy tissues.  In this case, the pancreas would have been attacked, preventing its function to produce insulin.  Type 1 diabetes shows hereditary correlation, meaning this disease can be passed down through families.  Also, the adolescent group is the most often diagnosed group of people.  

==TYPE 2 DIABETES==
In type 2 diabetes, fat, liver, and muscle cells become insulin resistant.  Those cells do not respond to insulin correctly and fails to obtain the sugar (glucose) that is being transported.  Because glucose is crucial for the cells’ functions, the pancreas would sustain the equilibrium.  That means, if the cells do not intake the glucose, the pancreas would automatically create more insulin to make sure the cells have enough.  The remaining sugar in the bloodstream would accumulate, resulting with hyperglycemia.  

Maintaining a healthy diet is essential in preventing type 2 diabetes.  Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight increases the risk of type 2 diabetes because increased fat levels slows down the ability to properly use insulin.

==Treatment==
Although there is no known cure for diabetes, it can be managed with certain precautions. 

===Type 1 &amp; 2 Diabetes Management===
Those with type 1 &amp; 2 diabetes, who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight, eating healthy foods, and most importantly monitoring their blood sugar levels.

Diabetics should try to maintain their blood sugar levels between these readings:
Daytime glucose levels: between 80 and 120 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.7 mmol/L)
Nighttime glucose levels: between 100 and 140 mg/dL (5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L)

People with type 1 diabetes need insulin to survive, therefore, they typically inject themselves with insulin using either a fine needle and syringe, an insulin pen,or an insulin pump.

==TESTING==
To determine if one is diagnosed with diabetes, a few tests must be done.  

- Fasting Blood Glucose	(Type 1, 2) - Blood test must be higher than 126 mg/dL twice

- Random (nonfasting) Blood Glucose (Type 1) -	Blood test is higher than 200 mg/dL -	Must be confirmed with fasting test

- Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (Type 1, 2) - Blood level is higher than 200 mg/dL after 2 hours

- Hemoglobin A1c (Type 1, 2) - Normal: &lt;5.7% - Pre-diabetes: between 5.7%-6.4% - Diabetes: &gt;6.5%

- Ketone (Type 1) - Done with urine or blood sample (If sugar level is &gt; 240 mg/dL, when ill (ex. pneumonia, stroke, etc.), when nauseated, vomiting, when pregnant) 

==STATISTICS==

Out of 25.8 million people in the United States, 8.3% of all children and adults are diagnosed with diabetes.  It is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations, kidney failure, and blindness in the United States and contributes greatly to heart disease and stroke.

==CLINICAL RESEARCH==
Currently, thousands of laboratories are focusing on the study of diabetes: type 1, type 2, its relationship with heart, kidney diseases, obesity, and many more.  

One specific research was done by Karolina I. Woroniecka and company in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.  Their topic mainly focuses on the relationship between diabetes and kidney failure, known as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is the prominent cause of kidney failures in the United States.  The research topic is called “Transcriptome Analysis of Human Diabetic Kidney,” and was published in September 2011.  Its objective was to provide a collection of gene-expression changes in human diabetic kidney biopsy samples after being treated.  Gene-expression is defined as the translation of information from a gene into a messenger RNA and then to a protein.  Transcriptome analysis is often used to obtain insight into disease pathogenesis, molecular classification, and the identification of biomarkers, indicates the presence of some sort of phenomenon, used for future studies and treatments.  This study was able to catalog gene expression regulation, identify genes and pathways that may either play a role in DKD or serve as biomarkers.

44 dissected human kidney samples were used in this experiment, portioned out according to their racial status and glomerular filtration rate (25-35 mL/min).  A glomeruli is a cluster of capillaries around the end of a kidney tubule.  Their method included a series of statistical equations to identify expressed transcripts found in both the control and the diseased samples.  Also, algorithms helped the study by defining the regulated pathways.   
  
The human kidneys were obtained from donors and leftover portions of kidney biopsies.  The samples were manually microdissected and only the samples without any degradation were further used through the amplification of the RNA.  Before any treatment, the raw samples were normalized using the RMA16 algorithm.  Its purpose is to obtain a stabilized set of data and reduce any inconsistencies in their patterns.  This is where the Benjamin-Hochberg testing was used at a p value &lt; 0.05.  After, the oPOSSUM software determines the overrepresented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within a catalog of coexpressed genes and is then compared to a control set.  The differentially expressed transcripts that comply with the statistical conditions undergo analysis that uses a ratio to determine the top canonical pathways – the Fischer exact test is used at p value &lt; 0.05.  Immunostaining is a major component in the visualization and final step of the procedure.  This procedure requires the use of a specific antibody to detect a specific protein in a sample.  The following primary antibodies were used: C3, CLIC5, and podocin.  The Vectastain ABC Elite kit was used for the secondary antibodies to bind to the proteins and then, 3,3”diaminobenzidine was applied for visualizations.  Immunostaining is typically scored on a scale of 0-4, correlating to the amount of activity on that specific protein.    

Results from this experiment identified 1,700 differently expressed probesets in DKD glomeruli and 1,831 probesets in diabetic tubuli (seminiferous tubules); probeset is a collection of more than two probes and is designed to measure a single molecular species.  There were 330 probesets that were commonly expressed in both compartments.  Pathway analysis emphasized the regulation of many genes that factored into the signaling in DKD glomeruli.  Some molecules included Cdc42, integrin, integrin-linked kinase, and others.  Strong enhancements for the inflammation-related pathways were shown in the tubulointerstitial compartment.  Lastly, the canonical signaling pathway was regulated in both the DKD glomeruli and tubuli, which are associated with increased glomerulosclerosis.  

With ongoing research about diabetes-linked diseases, results that are obtained contribute to the overall understanding of the biochemical processes and issues.  Dr. Karolina I. Woroniecka and company are one of the many research teams throughout the world that dedicate their jobs to saving or improving people’s well-being.  This study is one of the many that contribute to the complications of diabetic-related kidney diseases.  However there are many more studies that relate to diabetes, such as obesity and heart attack/failure.

Hiroaki Masazuki and company conducted a project relating obesity and diabetes, “Glucose Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity in Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Leptin with Lethal Yellow Agouti Mutation.”  This article was published in August 1999 from the Department of medicine and Clinical Sciences, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine at Kyoto, Japan.  The objective of this research project was to determine the usefulness of leptin for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes.  Leptin is an adipocyte-derived blood-borne satiety factor that increases glucose metabolism by decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure.  Two different types of mice were crossed and examined at weeks 6 and 12 during the experiment.  The first type was a transgenic skinny mice overexpressing leptin breed, with allele Tg/+, and the second is a lethal yellow KKAy mice, commonly used as models for obesity-diabetes syndrome, with allele Ay/+.  The F1 animals’ metabolic phenotypes were examined, noting everything from body weight to their sensitivity of insulin and concentrations of leptin.  This study was able to demonstrate the potential usefulness of leptin along with a long-term caloric restriction for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes.  It demonstrated that hyperleptinemia can delay the onset of impaired glucose metabolism and hasten the recovery from diabetes during caloric food restriction in the crossed F1 bred mice, Tg/+ and Ay/+.  Hyperleptinemia is defined as increased serum leptin level.      

Although leptin may have been found to be potentially useful in treating diabetes, the fact that a caloric food restriction is required suggests that leptin can stimulate glucose metabolism independent of body weight.  Other studies have demonstrated that leptin stimulates glucose metabolism in normal-weight nondiabetic mice and also improves impaired glucose metabolism in over-weight diabetic mice with leptin deficiency.  Masazuki and company have created transgenic mice models overexpressing leptin (allele Tg/+) that exhibit insulin sensitivity and increased glucose tolerance.  A liver-specific promoter controls the overexpression of leptin and insulin sensitivity results with the activation of signaling in the skeletal muscle and liver.  In this study, Masazuki and company genetically crossed the transgenic mice and lethal yellow obese mice.  The resulting 4 genotypes are: Tg/+: Ay/+, Tg/+, Ay/+, and wild-type +/+.  When at week 6, all the mice were at normal body weight and at week 12, the mice with the Ay/+ allele clearly developed obesity.  At 9 weeks, +/+, Ay/+, and Tg/+: Ay/+ were placed on a 3 week food restriction diet and analyzed at week 12.

The research design and methods include: measurements of body weight and cumulative food intake, plasma leptin, glucose, and insulin concentrations, glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and caloric food restriction experiments and later statistical analysis were done.  Body weights were measured daily since the mice were 4 weeks old and food intake was measured daily over a 2-week period.  Blood was sampled from retro-orbital sinus of mice at 9:00AM.  Plasma leptin concentrations were determined using radioimmunoassay (RIA) for mouse leptin.  Insulin and plasma glucose concentrations were determined by the glucose oxidase method with a reflectance glucometer.  The glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were done after an 8 hour fast and injections of 1.0 mg/g glucose.  The insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were done after a 2 hour fast and injection of 0.5 mU/g insulin.  The blood was then drawn from the mice tail veins at periodic times after injection at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes and blood was drawn from before the injections to measure comparable results.  The food restriction experiment was based off of the cumulative food intake at week 12.  The mice were then provided with 60% of the amount of food consumed.  The exact same tests were measured: plasma leptin, glucose, and insulin concentrations were also determined; GTT and ITT were also done.  At the end, all these data were analyzed and expressed at ±SE.  
	
The results identified a large difference in body weights with the four genotypes.  At week 4, all the mice showed no significant difference in body weight.  At week 6 of age, Tg/+ mice gained approximately 20-30% less weight than the control +/+ mice and indicated a sign of developing adiposity compared to +/+, Tg/+: Ay/+, and Ay/+ mice.  At this time, the control, Tg/+: Ay/+, and Ay/+ mice showed no drastic difference in body weights.  However, by week 12 of age, the mice with the Ay/+ allele developed obese.  As for plasma leptin concentrations, 6 week old Tg/+ mice were approximately 12 times those of the control +/+ mice, at week 12, they were 9 times higher.  The concentrations in Ay/+ and +/+ mice were roughly equivalent.  The concentrations of Tg/+:Ay/+ mice were 8 times higher than those of the +/+ mice and at week 12, they were higher than the Ay/+.  At week 12, the body weight of Tg/+ was ~23% less than the control’s.  The food intake of Tg/+ reduced significantly after 6 and 12 weeks of age compared to the control litter.  The food intake of Ay/+ mice increased by 50% compared to the control litter.  The food intake of Tg/+: Ay/+ mice, compared to the +/+ mice, were roughly the same.  The food intake of Ay/+ and Tg/+: Ay/+ were approximately the same.  At week 6, the plasma glucose concentrations among all 4 genotypes were the approximately the same.  At week 12, the glucose levels of Tg/+ and +/+ mice were the same.  However, the glucose level of Ay/+ and Tg/+: Ay/+ elevated significantly compared to the control but compared to each other, they were the same.  As for plasma insulin concentration levels, the Tg/+ mice greatly decreased compared to the control at week 6.  The plasma insulin concentrations in Tg/+: Ay/+ mice were higher than the control.  At this point, the Ay/+ mice demonstrated marked hyperinsulinemia compared to the rest of the genotypes.  GTTs and ITTs showed that the plasma glucose elevation is significant in Tg/+ compared to the control.  30 minutes after the injection, the glucose concentrations increased greatly in Ay/+ mice compared to the control.  

The genotypes’ glucose metabolisms were examined after their food restriction.  60% of their total food intake were given to these mice and after 2 weeks, the body weights of Tg/+ were 17% less and +/+ were 12% less compared to before and the Ay/+, Tg/+: Ay/+ body weights also decreased.  The plasma leptin concentrations in Tg/+ mice were higher than those in +/+ mice and Tg/+:Ay/+ were higher than those of Ay/+.  The leptin concentrations between Tg/+ compared to Tg/+:Ay/+ and those of +/+ and Ay/+ were approximately the same.  After 3 weeks of food restriction, the plasma glucose concentrations among +/+, Ay/+, and Tg/+:Ay/+ were similar.  The plasma insulin concentrations, however, in Ay/+ mice were higher than those of +/+ and Tg/+:Ay/+ mice.  

The results indicated that glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are increased in Tg/+:Ay/+ mice and plasma leptin concentrations in Tg/+:Ay/+ are higher than regular Ay/+ mice.  These indicate that overproduction of leptin can prolong the start of impaired glucose metabolism in Tg/+: Ay/+ mice and endogenous leptin cannot in Ay/+ mice.  Leptin can apply its anti-diabetic effect in normal weight animals at week 6. At week 12, Tg/+:Ay/+ mice developed resistance to the anti-diabetic action of leptin.  In this study, glucose metabolism is somewhat improved in Ay/+ after a long term body weight reduction due to the 3 week food restriction while the metabolism is improved in Tg/+:Ay/+ compared to Ay/+ and control which suggests that hyperleptinemia enhances glucose level when body weight is stable.  Persistent hyperleptinemia delays the beginning of impaired glucose metabolism and quickens the recovery from diabetes in Ay/+ mice in combination with food restriction.

Emilie Vander Haar and her team in the University of Minnesota Minneapolis studied “Insulin signaling to mTOR mediated by the Akt/PKB substrate PRAS40.”  In this study, they were able to identify PRAS40 as a crucial regulator of insulin sensitivity of the Akt-mTOR metabolic pathway which can potentially help target the treatment of cancers, insulin resistance, and hamartona syndromes.  Insulin activates the protein kinases Akt, also known as PKB, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth.  This study was able to identify PRAS40 as a unique mTOR binding partner and is induced under conditions that inhibit mTOR signaling.  Akt phosphorylates PRAS40, which is crucial for insulin to stimulate mTOR.  These findings contribute to the clinical studies of type 2 diabetes insulin related pathways.

mTOR is a kinase-related protein that is a key mediator of insulin.  Inhibition of mTOR in mammals proves to reduce insulin resistance and extend lifespan.  mTORC1 is a nutrient and insulin regulated complex that is formed from mTOR when it interacts with raptor and a G-protein.  This complex is involved in the cytoskeleton regulation and Akt phosphorylation; however the interactions and associated proteins in response to insulin have not been identified.  In order to do so, Haar and her team used a mass spectroscopy method.  An mTOR antibody prepared mTOR immunoprecipitates from T-cells and the proteins that were bound to the regulator were eluted from the precipitates.  The mixtures of proteins were trypsinized and the mass spectra were obtained.  The highest P scores obtained from the derived peptides illustrated that mass spectroscopy isolated mTOR-binding proteins.  Three sequences were obtained and contributed to the finding that Sin1 is crucial in the formation of the mTOR interaction.  The PRAS40 peptide sequence was also identified.  However, in order to confirm the hypothesis that mTOR binds with PRAS40, T-cells’ precipitates, which carries PRAS40, were analyzed using western blotting.  Compared to the control, PRAS40 was found to bind only with mTOR and nothing else.  It was shown that PRAS40 binds specifically in the mTOR carboxy-terminal kinase domain.  Certain conditions inhibit mTOR signaling increases affinity, binding abilities, of the PRAS40 mTOR interaction.  These conditions include depriving leucine or glucose from the media solution, treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor and mitochondrial metabolic inhibitors.  The increase in affinity leads to disrupting the raptor-mTOR interaction, which results with destabilizing the PRAS40-mTOR interactions.  This tightened bond between the proteins under nutrient deprivation conditions proposes a hypothesis that states PRAS40 has a negative role in regulating mTOR.  

In order to further understand the consequence of PRAS40 in mTOR signaling, the regulator was downregulated in 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells.  The phosphorylation process of Akt at Ser 473 and S6K1 (a mTOR substrate) at Thr 389 was studied.  PRAS40 silencing led to a significant decrease in Akt phosphorylation in the cell lines which resulted with negative effects on the Akt components.  PRAS40 silencing also led to increased levels of S6K1 phosphorylation, and suggests that the PRAS40-knockout mTOR complex is still active in S6k1 phosphorylation.  The mechanism was studied and results indicated that PRAS40 silenced cells and resulting activated state of mTOR may contribute to Akt inactivation – a feedback inhibition.  That was the first part of PRAS40 analysis, PRAS40 silencing.  In the second part, PRAS40 was overexpressed.  Increasing the levels of PRAS40 in cells resulted with decreased S6K1 phosphorylation.  These results prove that PRAS40 inhibition of mTOR regulation is likely to require mTOR and raptor binding.  

After determining the inhibitory function of PRAS40 in mTOR signaling, Haar and her team studied the role PRAS40 plays in the regulation of mTOR.  PRAS40 knockdown in mice and human cells weakened the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation.  PRAS40 silencing reduces the levels of phosphorylation in both cell types.  In order to further study the response of mTOR to insulin, sample cells were treated with insulin.  The data collected proposes that PRAS40 silencing detaches mTOR from Akt signals – PRAS40 plays a crucial role in regulating Akt signaling to mTOR.  It also demonstrates that Akt phosphorylation of PRAS40 is crucial for mTOR activation through the use of insulin.  

The next matter that Haar and her team touched upon was the study that nutrient starvation has dominant effects on PRAS40-mTOR interaction.  PRAS40 was hardly released from mTOR when the conditions are deprived of leucine. Also, the amount of 14-3-3, an interaction induced on PRAS40 phosphorylation, bound to mTOR and PRAS40 was significantly reduced under deprived leucine conditions – the interaction was prevented under non-nutrient conditions.  14-3-3 interactions with mTOR and PRAS40 were also prevented under leucine-deprived conditions.  In all, these results prove that PRAS40 is a key mediator of Akt signals to mTOR and a negative effector of mTOR signaling.  PRAS40 is a crucial regulator of in insulin sensitivity of mTOR signaling, an important role in insulin resistance. 

Some methods of this experiment included the use of antibodies in western blotting, plasmid constructions and mutagenesis, the identification of mTOR-interacting proteins, cell culture and transfection, coimmunoprecipitation, chemical crosslinking, and lentiviral preparation, viral infection, and stable cell line generation.  Human PRAS40 cDNAs were provided and mouse PRAS40 cDNA samples underwent PCR amplification and then subcloned into mammalian expression vector.  All these cloned samples were confirmed by sequencing.  PRAS40 Thr 246 was replaced by amino acids: alanine, glutamate, and aspartate.  This is done through a site-directed mutagenesis kit.  The way that mTOR immunoprecipitates is through the use of an mTOR antibody on cells cultured in 10% fetal bovine.  The cell samples were lysed in a buffer and then incubated with 20ul of protein G resin and 4ug of mTOR antibody.  The mTOR precipitates were washed with lysis buffer and the binding proteins were eluted by incubation.  The mTOR binding proteins were diluted with digestion buffer and then incubated overnight with trypsin.  These samples underwent analysis by mass spectrometry.  Data would only be considered accurate when the P score is greater or equal to 0.95.  For chemical crosslinking experiments, T cells were treated with dithiobis and then harvested and lysed in a buffer.  The precipitates were then analyzed using the SDS-PAGE method.  In order to measure the cell-size, T cells were infected with lentiviruses, and then selected in the presence of zeocin.  The cell samples were trysinized the following day and diluted 10 times.  The ViCell cell-size analyzer analyzed the size of 1.0 mL of diluted cell culture sample.

Overall, the study of PRAS40 in regulating mTOR insulin signaling can potentially lead to potential targets for the treatment of different diseases relating to type 2 diabetes, cancers, and insulin resistance.  The results indicate that the Akt/PKB substrate, PRAS40, provide negative effects on the signaling of mTOR.  The binding suppresses mTOR activation and insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1 and Akt, therefore, uncoupling the response of mTOR to Akt signals.  PRAS40’s interaction with mTOR is induced under certain environmental conditions such as nutrient, leucine and serum deprivation.  In general, this project was able to identify that PRAS40 is a crucial mTOR binding partner that intervenes Akt signaling to mTOR.

==Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Stimuli and Beta-Cell Death In Type 2 Diabetes==

Obesity is related with insulin resistance, however Type 2 Diabetes, a complex known for increased levels of blood glucose due to insulin resistance in the muscle and liver tissue as well as impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, solely cultivates in genetically predisposed and insulin resistant subjects with the beginning of beta-cell dysfunction. As research progresses there is clear data that demonstrates that beta-cell failure and death are due to unresolvable endoplasmic reticulum stress, bringing chronic and strong activation of inositol-requiring protein 1.  Endoplasmic reticulum stress can start and generate the characteristics of Beta-cell failure and death observed in Type 2 Diabetes.

==Glucose Transport Deficiency in Type 2 Diabetes==
GLUT4 glucose transporters migrate to the cell surface in response to insulin signaling, thereby upgrading glucose levels in muscle and fat cells.  This is accomplished by stimulating vesicle transport of glucose to where it is needed.  Adult onset diabetes is often the result of gradual increase in insulin tolerance in individuals who overeat.  This desensitization to the effects of insulin interferes with metabolism because vesicles containing GLUT4 are not able to efficiently fuse with the cell membrane therefore glucose uptake into cells is inhibited.  By understanding this pathway, researchers may eventually find a therapeutic workaround to treat those suffering from Type 2 diabetes.  Presumably, this could be accomplished by synthesizing molecules that mimic the function of GLUT4 and its auxiliaries to resolve the trafficking problem.  Alternatively, the insulin pathway could be targeted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Modeling of the Resting Potential.tif|thumbnail|right|Exchanging of ions in the membrane]]
==Membrane Potential==
Membrane potential is the voltage across the plasma membrane. The resting membrane potential is between -60 mV and -80 mV. There are steps in forming the resting membrane potential. First, the known concentration of K+ is 140 mM (millimolar) inside the cell and 5 mM outside of the cell and  the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration is 150 mM outside of the cell and 15 mM inside the cell. Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration is 120 mM outside the neuron and 10 mM inside the cell. Such concentrations of chlorine, potassium, and sodium always remain constant because there is sodium potassium in the plasma membrane of the neurons. Also, ATP is used to transport ions against their concentration gradients to maintain the constant concentrations. For instance, ATP helps sodium to go out of the cell and potassium enter the cell. Since the exchange of ions occur at the concentration gradient, it is important to understand that the concentration of gradients of sodium and potassium across plasma membrane represent a chemical type of potential energy. In addition, ion channels in the selective permeability contribute to the electric potential of neurons. For example, there are K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. There are also ions that move through the membrane through these ion channels to generate a potential across the membrane. Consequently, the diffusion of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
through the potassium channels is very important for forming the resting potential because the outward flow of potassium results in the negative membrane potential of between -60 mV and -80mV. Excess negative charge inside the cell exerts an attractive force that stops the add’l flow of potassium ions outside of the cell. As a result, there is the creation of equilibrium potential which is the membrane voltage for a moving ion when it is at equilibrium. Nernst created an equation to calculate the resting potential of an ion:

E(ion)= 62mV(log [ion]outside/[ion]inside)

The resting potential for potassium is -90 mV. And the resting potential for sodium is 62 mV. &lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The one compartment model with absorption, also known as the single compartment model, is a model that represents a drug that rapidly equilibrates with the extravascular tissue compartment. In another words, the one compartment model is the simplest way of describing a drug that is almost instantaneously distributed throughout the body. For a drug that does not equilibrate immediately, a two compartment model must be used. The two-compartment model generally represents a drug that slowly equilibrates with the tissue compartment. This model involves two compartments which are the central and peripheral compartments.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.rxkinetics.com/pktutorial/1_5.html 1]&lt;/small&gt;

==One-Compartment Model with Absorption==
In a one-compartment model, the body is considered to be one unit; thus there is only one volume of distribution, often denoted Vd. We assume that with the one-compartment model, the drug is distributed throughout the body immediately at the instant when the drug enters the body. The elimination of the drug is assumed to follow first order kinetics in this model. Therefore, when taking the log of the concentration of drug in the body and plotting it against time (“log of concentration vs. time”), the resulting model will be linear. An important thing to remember is that the first order kinetics is an assumption that applies to the linear model, not the one compartment model. That being said, a change in dosage of the drug will not be reflected in the pharmacokinetic parameters (kel, Vd, Cp), but rather in the proportional change in drug concentration within the body. Because elimination follows first order kinetics, the rate of elimination is only dependent on one factor and that is the amount of drug in the body. The amount of drug in the body is proportional to the rate of elimination. &lt;small&gt;[http://www.cop.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/two-compartment-model.pdf 2]&lt;/small&gt;

==First Order Kinetics==
First order kinetics in a one-compartment model can be easily displayed by generating various graphs. 
Firstly, the concentration of drug in the body should be collected at various times. Then a plot of this data should generate a graph similar to this: 
 

* If the rate of change of each point on the “concentration vs. time” plot is taken, a new plot can be generated. (See figure 4.3.1)  &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;





* Taking this rate of change and plotting it against the concentration of drug in blood (resulting in “rate of change vs. concentration” graph), a linear curve can be generated. (See figure 4.3.2)  &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;
 

 


* Simple derivations will lead to this mathematical representation of the behavior of the one-compartment model.(See figure 4.3.3)  &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;


 


* As shown in equation 4.3.1, the kel remains constant regardless of the change in dosage. This proves that in a one-compartment model, the pharmacokinetic parameters do not change with any given dosage. From equation 4.3.1, we can also conclude that the rate of elimination, denoted as -∆Cp/∆t, is only dependent on the concentration of drug in the body, Cp. (See equation 4.3.1) &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/sup&gt;


==Uses of One-Compartment Model==
The one compartment model is a simplification for when a drug rapidly equilibrates in the body. Although the drug is said to be in equilibrium, the drug concentration in fluid or the tissue will not always be equal. Thus, when the drug is said to be in equilibrium, it is assumed that the drug concentration in tissue/fluids is always proportional to the drug concentration in the body at all times.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.boomer.org/c/p4/c04/c0403.html 3]&lt;/small&gt; 

This model is not completely accurate because only a very few drugs have proven to instantly equilibrate and disperse throughout the body. However, for the sake of simplicity, when a drug is said to have minimal distribution we can assume that the one-compartment model will serve as an adequate approximation. &lt;small&gt;[http://www.cop.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/two-compartment-model.pdf 2]&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Minocycline''' is a tetra antibiotic that combats bacteria in the body. It is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, such as urinary track infections, respiratory infections, skin infections, acne, gonorrhea, chlamydia, etc.

[[Image:Minocycline-150.jpg|thumb|right|Minocycline 100 mg Capsules.]]
==Overview==
Minocycline is an oral antibiotic commonly used to treat acne vulgaris (commonly known as cystic acne). Minocycline are able to kill the acne bacteria more effectively as well as reduce the redness and swelling of the acne. It is most commonly dispensed as Minocycline Hydrochloride which is a semi synthetic derivative of tetracycline. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rxlist.com/solodyn-drug.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The medication are antibiotics sold as: Minocin, Dynacin, Vectrin, Solodyn, and generic minocycline.

It's IUPAC Name is (4S,4aS,5aR,12aS)-4,7-bis(dimethylamino)-3,10,12,12a-tetrahydroxy-1,11-dioxo-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydrotetracene-2-carboxamide &lt;ref&gt;http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Along with another one of its tetracycline counterparts, Doxycycline, Minocycline is the most common form of oral antibiotic prescribed to patients for acne. Refrain from taking if allergic to minocycline or other tetracycline antibiotics. 

Occasionally it is used to treat Lyme disease and other skin infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) since the twice a day dosage for minocycline is more tolerable than the four times daily required by other tetracycline compounds. Dosage of minocycline is 100-200mg daily for the adult, but if the dosage is skipped, it is possible this will affect the treatment process.

If a dose is missed, do not take extra to make up for the missed dose. If an overdose is taken, seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.

==Caution==
If pregnant, do not use Minocycline. It can cause harm to the unborn child or permanent tooth discoloration. Minocycline may make birth control pills less effective. It also will pass through breast milk, effecting bone and tooth development of a nursing infant. Minocycline should not be taken by children younger than 8 years of age. Vitamin supplements should not be taken before taking Minocycine. These supplements reduce the effectiveness of it. Avoid excess sun exposure. Those taking Minocycline are easier subject to sun burn. Minocycline should be taken for the full prescribed length. Anything less will result in symptoms resurfacing. Do not take if past expiration date. Expired Minocycline may cause damage to kidneys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Retinoblastoma:	'''

	The gene that cods for retinoblastoma (Rb gene) is an important tumor suppressor of cancer.  Retinoblastoma itself is a childhood cancer that results from the loss of function of both copies of the Rb gene (each cell has two copies of the Rb gene).  People with retinoblastoma can either develop a tumor in one eye (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral).

'''Hereditary vs. Sporadic Cases:'''

	Hereditary retinoblastoma occurs in patients who have a family history of the disease.  Because they inherit one non-functional copy of the Rb gene, only one mutation is needed for total loss of function.  If someone is born with one bad copy, they have an approximately 90 % chance of developing the tumor in both eyes (90 % penetrance).  In other words, being born with one non-functional copy increases the likelihood that a mutation will occur in the second copy and lead to a bilateral tumor.

	Sporadic retinoblastoma occurs in patients with no family history of the disease.  Therefore, they are born with two good, functional copies of the Rb gene.  As a result, in order for these patients to develop retinoblastoma, two mutations in the gene are needed.  This only occurs in 1 out of every 350,000 live births.  Sporadic retinoblastoma is unilateral, meaning that the tumor occurs in only one eye.

	Both sporadic and hereditary forms of the disease require two bad copies of the Rb gene.  This means that the Rb gene is still functional even if one copy is abnormal.  Loss of heterozygosity at the Rb locus on chromosome 13 is one potential mechanism for the development of bilateral retinoblastoma in patients who have a family history.

'''Retinoblastoma as a Tumor Suppressor in Normal Cells:'''

	The normal function of the Rb protein is to act as an assembly factory: it brings together other proteins and has multiple binding sites to accomplish this.  The Rb protein binds to multiple transcription factors and can either activate or repress transcription.  For example, Rb protein strongly interacts with and binds to E2F-DP, a heterodimer that includes the E2F transcription factor.  When Rb is bound to E2F-DP, the protein complex then can go to promoters that are regulated by E2F.  Once there, Rb can recruit histone deacetylase to repress or turn off the transcription of genes regulated by E2F.  This action suppresses cell division, which is why the Rb gene is a tumor suppressor.  Since cancer cells want to divide, retinoblastoma patients lack this repressive function.  In addition to histone deacetylase, Rb protein can also recruit histone and DNA methyltransferases.  These methyltransferases can modify and epigenetically silence the target DNA, leading to inactive heterochromatin (permanent silencing).  Therefore, Rb has a two-fold function.  It can either repress the transcription or epigenetically silence the DNA of genes involved in the cell cycle that promote cell division.


'''How Retinoblastoma Function is Turned Off in Normal Cells and Loss of Tumor Suppressor Ability in Cancer Cells:'''

	In order for cancer cells to grow, divide, and metastasize, they need to somehow inactivate the function of key tumor suppressors, such as the Rb gene.  Since the normal function of the Rb protein is to repress the cell cycle, this ability is an obstacle to cancer cell growth.  Since cancer cells in a retinoblastoma patient operate with non-functional Rb genes, the tumor suppressor function of Rb is non-existent and cancer cells can proliferate uncontrollably.  However, Rb function is also controlled in normal, non-cancerous cells.  We require cell division to survive, so Rb function must be regulated so that the cell cycle is not always repressed.
	As stated above, Rb works to repress the expression of genes regulated by E2F.  These genes include Cyclin A, Cyclin E, and other proteins involved in the cell cycle.  Cyclin/CDK complexes regulate the progression through the cell cycle (they oppose the function of the Rb protein).  Therefore, in order to do their job effectively, they phosphorylate Rb as multiple sites.  This phosphorylation causes Rb to lose its ability to bring proteins together.  Since it can no longer bind E2F, it cannot turn off the expression of genes that E2F regulates and the cell cycle can go on uninterrupted by Rb repression.  Then, E2F can recruit histone acetylases that activate gene expression of cell cycle cyclins.</text>

[[File:Levonorgestrel.svg|300px]][[File:Levonorgestrel3D.png|300px]]

The chemical IUPAC name is 13-ethyl-17-ethynyl-17-hydroxy- 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, 17- tetradecahydrocyclopenta[a] phenanthren-3-one. Its chemical formula is C_21H_28O_2. Levonorgestrel is the left form (D- form) of norgestrel. Herschel Smith first synthesized the drug in the 1960s under Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. This drug is primarily used as an emergency contraceptive
	
This drug is usually taken orally, in pill form and is more commonly known as Plan B or the morning after pill. Many users mistake the drug for an abortion pill. It should be made clear that Levonorgestrel will not terminate a matured fetus. The drug is only effective in preventing pregnancy by means of postponing ovulation and hindering sperm migration. Levonorgestrel is a common ingredient in other birth control pills and acts in the same way, but the levels of hormone in Plan B and other emergency contraceptives are much higher.

==In the Body:==

	As a progestin steroid, Levonorgestrel blocks ovulation by stopping the follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone from being secreted from the pituitary gland. The drug also causes the mucus in the cervix to become more viscous which makes it difficult for sperm to travel far in the uterus, preventing implantation of the egg.

==Usage==
Oral contraception:
At low doses, levonorgestrel is used in monophasic and triphasic formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills, with available monophasic doses ranging from 100-250 µg, and triphasic doses of 50 µg/75 µg/125 µg. At very low daily dose of 30 µg, levonorgestrel is used in some progestogen only pill formulations.

Emergency contraception:
Levonorgestrel is used in emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), both in a combined Yuzpe regimen which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The levonorgestrel-only method uses levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (as a single dose or as two .75 mg doses 12 hours apart) taken within 3 days of unprotected sex, with one study indicating that beginning as late as 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse could be effective. There are many brand names of levonorgestrel-only ECPs, including: Escapelle, Plan B, Levonelle, Glanique, NorLevo, Postinor-2, i-pill, &quot;Next Choice&quot; and 72-HOURS. The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has issued a statement that: &quot;review of the evidence suggests that LNG [levonorgestreol] ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling.&quot;In June 2012, a New York Times editorial called on the FDA to remove from the label the unsupported suggestion that levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills inhibit implantation.

Intrauterine system:
Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in the Mirena intrauterine system.

Contraceptive implants:
Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in Norplant and Jadelle.

==When and How to take Levonogestrel:==


	Plan B should be taken no later than 72 hours after unprotected sex, but is most effective within 24 hours to prevent pregnancy. The sooner you take it, the better. Plan B can be purchased at most local drug stores and pharmacies without a prescription for women 18 years and older.  Anyone under 17 will need a prescription from a doctor.
	Plan B should not be used in place of regular birth controls, but ONLY in emergency if: 
*no condom was used during sex, or the condom broke 
*no birth control was used/or a pill was skipped 
*regular birth control fails 
*the partner didn’t pull out in time 
*sex was forced. 
Do NOT take Plan B if already pregnant.

==Side Effects and Warnings:==


Side effects vary in severity and occurrence for each person. These include:
*headaches
*dizziness
*fatigue
*nausea/vomiting
*abdominal pain
*tender breasts
*irregular menstruation
More serious side effects such as itching and skin rash should immediately be taken to the doctor.
Those with diabetes and those who are breast-feeding should take extra precaution when using Plan B.
	
Always be aware of any possible drug interactions when taking a new medication. Consult a doctor before taking Plan B and inform them of any current medications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Molecular Geometry

==Definitions==
Molecular geometry is the 3-dimensional  shape that a molecule occupies in space. It is determined by the central atom and the surrounding atoms and electron pairs. The shape of most molecules can be predicted using the Valence Shell  Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) method. This method states a few rules to help one determine the shape of a substance without using high technology methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy, or electron microscopy. Some of the most common shapes that can be taken are linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, pyramidal, and angular (or bent). 

==VSEPR Theory==
Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory
Electron pairs around a central atom arrange themselves so that they can be as far apart as possible from each other. The valence shell is the outermost electron-occupied shell of an atom that holds the electrons involved in bonding. In a covalent bond, a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms. In a polyatomic molecule, several atoms are bonded to a central atom using two or more electron pairs. The repulsion between negatively charged electron pairs in bonds or as lone pairs causes them to spread apart as much as possible.
The idea of &quot;electron pair repulsion can be demonstrated by tying several inflated balloons together at their necks. Each balloon represents an electron pair. The balloons will try to minimize the crowding and will spread as far apart as possible. According to VSEPR theory, molecular geometry can be predicted by starting with the electron pair geometry about the central atom and adding atoms to some or all of the electron pairs. This model produces good agreement with experimental determinations for simple molecules. With this model in mind, the molecular geometry can be determined in a systematic way.
Molecules can then be divided into two groups:
Group 1: Molecules with NO lone electron pairs. In this case the molecular geometry is identical to the electron pair geometry.
Group 2: Molecules with one or more lone electron pairs. In this case an extra step is needed to to translate from electron pair geometry to the final molecular geometry, since only the positions of bonded atoms are considered in molecular geometry.

The VSEPR theory says that:

1) The electron pairs and atoms around a central atom will give a molecule its shape.

2) Electron pairs around a central atom in a molecule will attempt to be as far away from each other as possible.

3) Lone pairs around the central atom will have an effect on the shape of the entire molecule, just like an atom would.  

4) Lone pairs of electrons repel each other more strongly than a lone pair and a shared pair, which in turn repel each other more than two shared pairs (or bonds between the central atom and another atom).
 
These are just a few of the basic postulates of the VSEPR theory that, along with the lewis dot structure of a molecule, allow us to determine the shape it will have. 

[[File:VSEPR geometries.PNG|center|whole|600px|VSEPR geometries]]


==Ring Molecular Geometry==
Many organic compounds contain rings of carbon atoms or other atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen. The simplest ring compound contains 3 carbons as in cyclopropane. The most common ring compounds contain either 5 or 6 carbons. These compounds are also called cyclic.

==Bent Molecular Geometry==
The molecule that is made up of 4 equally spaced sp3 hybrid orbitals forming bond angles of approximately 109.5o. The shape of the orbitals is tetrahedral. Two of the orbitals contain lone pairs of electrons. The two atoms connected to the central atom form a molecule with a bent shape.

==Hybridization and Geometry==
There is a simple relationship between the hybridization of an atom and its geometry, i.e., the way or ways in which other atoms can be disposed about it in space. This module examines the allowed bonding patterns for the representative elements B, C, N, O, and F, as well as their geometries as a function of their hybridization and formal charge.

'''Finding Hybridization'''
For Hybridization of molecules:
1. Count total number of valence Electrons
2.Divide by 8, if no of e- &gt; 8.
Divide by 2, if no of e- ≤ 8.
[[File:Hybridization and molecular shape, png|thumbnail|Hybridization and Molecular Shapes]]

==Polarity and Geometry==
The geometry of a molecule determines many properties such as polarity, reactivity, state, and much more. The polarity is directly related to the shape because many molecules with polar bonds can be non polar as a whole due to symmetry of the molecule that has equal electron pull outwards or inward. One such example is carbon dioxide. The electronegative oxygens on either side of the carbon pull atoms toward them selves, cause a partial negative charge on each end, while the less electronegative carbon is left with a partial positive charge. The oxygens are both double bonded to the carbon leaving no lone pairs to bend the molecule, which is linear and has 180 degree bond angles. The equal pull of both partial negative charges balance each other out because the are of equal magnitude and exact opposite directions and the whole molecule is non polar. 
. 
[[File:CO2.png|center|thumb|CO2]]

On the other hand, a molecule can have polar bonds and a different shape that does not balance out the electronegative pull. For example, the hydrogen dioxide molecule, which also contains three atoms but has a different shape. Water is tetrahedral and bent because it has two extra electron pairs which push the hydrogen atoms into a 109.5 degree angle. As a result, the partial negative charge on oxygen is balanced on each side, but is pointed up and inwards, giving the whole molecule polar properties.

[[File:Water with 4 single electrons.svg|center|thumb|Water with 4 single electrons]]


The polarity in turn then affects many properties itself, such as melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, solubility and the types of bonds that can be formed, just to name a few. Polar molecules will have higher melting and boiling points and lower vapor pressure due to the attraction between the molecules. Polar molecules also tend to dissolve other polar molecules while non polar molecules also dissolve other non polar substances. This is often referred to as &quot;like dissolves like&quot; as a quick way to remember this property. 

==Reactivity and Geometry==
Another property determined by molecular geometry is  reactivity. The reactivity is affected in many ways. One example is the type of bonds the molecule makes based on polarity. For example, some polar molecule can react in hydrogen bonds while non polar molecules react in london dispersion forces. But there are other ways that the geometry directly effects sections that a molecule partakes in. Large bulky molecules often react using the unhindered side, even if it is not as favorable of a product, because of the easier reaction. Another example is enzymes and the way the &quot;fit&quot; certain substrates based on their own sake and the shape of the substrates. These are just a couple examples of the many ways that molecular shape can help determine reactivity.

==Determination of Geometry==
Although VSEPR and a few similar methods can be used to determine the geometry of a molecule, there are high tech methods that can show us the shape of much larger molecules, usually proteins, without a doubt. These methods include X-ray crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. X-ray crystallography is one of the best methods because of the very high resolution that is a result of te wavelength, which s very close to that of the bonds between the atoms. 

===1. X-ray Crystallography=== 
The first step in this method is to turn the protein into a crystal, which is done by adding certain salts that crystalize the macromolecule. Once it is in its crystal form, an X-ray beam is aimed at the protein and what happens to the light is observed. Some light will be absorbed, some will be scattered, and some will be diffracted. All of the rays are studied closely and their information, such as amplitude for example, give biochemists information about the atom in the molecule. 

[[File:X-ray crystallography.svg|center|whole|400px|X-ray crystallography]]

===2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy===
 Another technique, called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, allows protein structure to be studied without being first converted into a crystal. It is one of the very few methods that allows the substance to be studied in solution, which is usually CDCl3. The two types of NMRs commonly used are proton NMR and carbon NMR, due to the magnetic resonance of the elements. For H-NMR, when a molecule is exposed to a magnetic and proton get excited and line up, four things can be observed that tell us about the environment of each identical group of protons. The chemical shift (how far downfield the signal is) tells what functional groups are surrounding the proton(s). The signal integration gives us a ratio that compares the amount of protons in each family. The splitting(amount of peaks in one signal, such as a doublet,triplet, etc) tells us how many neighboring hydrogens there are. And finally, the number of signals itself tells us how many different families of protons there are. C-NMR works the same way except for  integration, which is not always clear as it is in H-NMR. So all this information is gathered for a molecule and its exact connectivity can usually be determined, even if it was an unknown molecule. 

[[File:Espectro NMR C-13.jpg|center|whole|400px|Espectro NMR C-13]]

===3.Electron Microscopy===
 The third method is electron microscopy, which uses uses an electron microscope that conducts an electron ray. The electron beams are aimed at the macromolecules and then impose an image of the molecule and its structure upon fluorescent or photographic film for us to see. Sometimes they are even sent directly to a screen, such as a computer screen. This image is a black a white picture but is still very useful in determining structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neural Induction==
Neural Induction refers to the process that induces a region of embryonic ectoderm to form the neural plate on the dorsal surface of the embryo. Neural induction goes through several stages such as neurulation and neural patterning.

During the early stages of the embryonic development, newly formed neural plate forms the neural groove, which then forms the neural tube that eventually develops in to the central nervous system. There are numerous enzymes, hormones and proteins that initiates this formation of neural tissue. But the main protein that contributes the most is the Spemmann's organizer. The ectoderm cells are naturally predisposed to become neural tissues. But the ectoderm cells produces BMPS (TGF-β family protein), which causes it to become epidermal (nonneural). However once the Spemann's Organizer molecules produces neural inducers such as follistatin,noggin, and chordin to block the effects of BMPs, ectoderm can be induced to become the neural tissue. Missing such indcucers cause many birth defects during the early pregnancy such as spinal bifida and anencephaly. *BMPs are bone morphogenic protens that are members of polypeptide growth factor and transforming growth factor familes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Phases of Brain Development==

Phases of early embryonic brain development mainly include seven stages such as neural induction, proliferation, migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis, cell death/stabilization and synaptic rearrangement. Neural induction stage takes from the day 18 to 24 since the fertilization. Proliferation stages takes from the day 24 to day 125. Migration stage takes from the day 40 to day 160. And the differentiation stage takes from the day 125 to the postnatal periods. from the differentiation period to the postnatal period, the brain development becomes very sensitive to the  environmental factors play a role in addition to the genetic factors.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Diabetes mellitus is the medical term given to the chronic condition in which the body is unable to transport the glucose (sugar) in our bloodstream to the rest of the cells in our body.  This has two main consequences: elevated levels of glucose in our blood, and an energy deficiency in our cells.  The first consequence is the result of not being able to remove the glucose from the blood, whereas the second flows from the fact that glucose serves as the primary source of energy for our cells.  Diabetes can be the result of a variety of factors ranging from diet to genetics.  This article will discuss a specific type of diabetes (T1DM) that results from a hyperactive immune system, which means that it belongs under a class of diseases known as autoimmune diseases.

==Autoimmune Diseases and Type 1 Diabetes==
The immune system is an intricate and advanced network that utilizes cell machinery to serve the primary purpose of protecting the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, pathogens, or anything that attempts to disrupt the delicate equilibrium of a multi-cellular organism.  In the case of an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakenly attacks normal, non-threatening body cells or tissues.  In short, the body begins to attack itself.  A hyperactive immune system has the potential to be extremely dangerous, depending on what type or class of cell is targeted by the immune system.  

After a meal, the complex carbohydrates in the ingested food are broken down to simple sugars, and shortly afterward they enter the bloodstream.  Upon secretion from the pancreas, a hormone called insulin regulates the level of sugar in the blood by binding to glucose-transport proteins and signaling them to move the sugar molecules into the cells, where they are either converted into energy, or stored as the polysaccharide gylcogen.  In the case of Type 1 Diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas.  Without any beta cells the body cannot produce insulin, and as a result it cannot properly remove sugar from the blood or provide ample energy for the cells. 

==Treatment== 
In order to solve the problem of not having insulin in the bloodstream, treatment for Type 1 Diabetes involves an intravenous dosage of insulin every time carbohydrates are consumed.  The amount of insulin that is delivered is proportional to the grams of carbohydrates that are eaten, and it is also dependent on the glucose level before the meal.  That said, people with T1DM must carefully monitor what they are eating and what their blood sugar level is, because that will determine how much insulin they inject.  Although traditionally delivered with a syringe, insulin can also be delivered through an insulin pump, which attaches to the stomach and can be remotely controlled to deliver a specified amount of insulin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Migration==

During the migration stage cells that are yet to become neurons begin to move up along the radial glia cells that provide scaffolding system for the cell migration. Cells along the radial glia cells generally move up vertically forming layered stuctures with predominantly radial migration patterns, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation, colliculi, and the cerebellar cortex. There are three groups of molecules that are crucial for migration:

1. Adhesion molecules
: adhesion molecules such as Reln, Astrotactin, Neuregulin, Integrins alpha 3,6, play a role in attaching the cells to the radial glia cell.

2. Microtubule binding proteins
: regulate stability of microtubles 

3.Actin binding Molecules
: regulate protein to protein interactions. Examples are filamin1, Cdk5/p35

      <text xml:space="preserve">The signal recognition particle (SRP) system, which contains the SRP and its receptor, plays a major role in targeting of ribosomes and IMP-encoding transcripts to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes and the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria.

There are 3 essential components of the SRP system in E. coli:
* The SRP protein – Ffh
* The SRP receptor – FtsY
* A small stable 4.5S RNA

The roles of SRP system in E. coli is related to the biosynthesis of IMPs:
* SPR-mediated ribosome targeting (S-MRT)
* SRP receptor-mediated ribosome targeting (SR-MRT)



1. S-MRT is based mainly on in vitro studies with purified components, has 2 stages:
 
  SRP binds to cytosolic mRNA-ribosome nascent chain complexes.
  The SRP-RNC complexes targeted to the membrane-bound FtsY.

2. SR-MRT is based mainly on in vivo studies, has 3 stages:

  During FtsY translation, FtsY and ribosomes are targeted to the membrane in an SRP-independent manner.
  IMP-encoding mRNAs are targeted to the membrane-bound ribosomes.
  SRP interacts with a hydrophobic nascent polypeptide, the ribosomes, and the SRP receptor.
:
&lt;br /&gt;
Both of the models require RNCs, SRP, and SRP receptor to form a complex on the membrane, transfer RNC to the translocon. However, SR-MRT differs from S-MRT by the additional targeting stages:

'''&lt;u&gt;Ribosome targeting:&lt;/u&gt;''' 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! In vitro !! In vivo
|-
| 
* The E. coli SRP can interact with ribosomes and RNCs in aqueous solution and in the cytoplasm.
* The ribosome-SRP interaction does not rule out the possibility that the same interaction may occur between membrane-associated SRP and membrane-bound ribosomes translating IMPs.
* Preformed soluble RNC-SRP complexes can target the membrane-bound SRP receptor. 
|| 
* The E. coli SRP can interact with ribosomes and RNCs in aqueous solution and in the cytoplasm.
* The interactions between the SRP and cytosolic ribosome play role as a quality control mechanism to prevent premature synthesis of IMPs in the E. coli cytosol.
* SRP may not be required for ribosome targeting.

'''&lt;u&gt;mRNA targeting:&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt;

IMP-encoding transcripts in E. coli are targeted to the membrane in a translation-independent manner.

The uracil-bias is an evolutionarily ancient feature of IMP-encoding mRNAs. 

Uracil-richness is required for mRNA targeting to the membrane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differentiation==
:During the differentiation stage the cells acquire an identity (phenotype). Each cell's axon thus begins to grow toward the target and acquires/expresses specific enzymes to produce neurotransmitters and receptors. And the most importantly, myelination of the neurons begin during this stage. There are numerous ways that axons find its target: 1. pathway selection 2. target selection, address selection 3.direct cell to cell communication 4. detection of extracellular signals from other cells 5.communication via diffusable chemical signals from cells at a distance.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Holliday Junction==

A Holliday Junction is the combination of four moving DNA strands that bridge together to form four double-helical arms. This model was proposed by Robin Holliday in 1964 to explain the transfer of genetic information in yeast, now known as homologous recombination. (1) 

[[File:472px-Holliday_Junction.png|2-D View of the Holliday Junction]]

However, this structure is unstable because they contain homologous sequence symmetry, which allows itself to isomerize. These junctions can slide up and down the DNA since they are between homologous sequences. When there are a few single strands with the same length, the free ends of each strand can match up to another DNA helix with free ends. The strands are now crossed over, which creates the Holliday junction. (2)

      <comment>/* Fertilizer methods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fertilizer methods==
Dilute the nutrient solutions in a gallon of water before adding to the system. The water should always be clear after application. Initial nutrient solutions reference points:
* [[w:hoagland solution]]
* non-hydroponic fertilizers - use 1/10 of the label dosing, with the amount of water in the container in mind
* hydroponic fertilizers - labeled directions
* sterilized soil - sterilize fertile soil, then run it through a cheese cloth
* pH meter readability and EC by a multimeter
* aquaponic

==Natural fertilizer==
Potting soil may be sterilized by heating in a covered container. This same soil can be run through a cloth to fertilize the nutrient solution. Only a little bit is needed, and making the water murky is disadvantageous to the nutrient solution.&lt;!--biofertilizer, promoting aerobic bacteria--&gt;

==Aquaponic nutrition==
Initially, nutrient solutions or fish establishment of the water is necessary for aquaponic gardening. New propagation tissue, like seeds and stem cuttings, can tolerate the lack of nutrients, until the levels build up from fish wastes. Aquatic animals do the work of maintaining proper plant nutrition and maintaining salt levels. Once fish are established, nutrient solutions are no longer necessary for maintaining aquaponic gardens, since fish waste provides all of the nutrients necessary. Adding nutrient solutions after this point can be detrimental to the plants, while this may not readily affect fish.
In an aquaponic system, adding less fertilizer is safer than adding too much, especially since aquatic animals immediately make up for the difference.

If the water is changed, the correct nutrient solution has to be compensated. Rooted or established plants may quickly die of nutrient deficiencies.

==Supplements for plants==
Aspirin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantea.com/plant-aspirin.htm|title=Plants feeling under the weather?:
Give them aspirin water!}}&lt;/ref&gt; melatonin and rooting hormones may be beneficial to the plant.

      <comment>/* Netpot biofilter */  grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For a passive [[w:biofilter|biofilter]] to work, aerobic conditions must be met for beneficial bacteria. The concept is to provide a medium for beneficial bacteria to grow in aerobic conditions. Here are numerous nonmechanical subsystem and passive biofilter projects:

==Netpot biofilter==
Put a synthetic screen or scrub pad over a net pot, and this cannot be a material that holds much water or that is easily decomposable. Fill it with sand, gravel, ceramic material, charcoal or any porous substrate of choice, while pushing it inside the net pot. Sand helps remove small particles. This works to remove small particles if water passes from the top.

==Ground layer biofilter==
Gravel in the bottom of the tank will assist with biofiltration. It will help clear up the water.

==Aquaponic symbiosis==
Plants and microorganisms remove fish byproduct waste that is dangerous to aquatic animals. Fish provide properly balanced nutrients necessary for plant growth. Different types of aerobic bacteria complete the symbiotic cycle by providing the proper nutrient fixations and reduction of toxins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5th century BC==
[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|Map of the Delian League (&quot;Athenian Empire&quot;) in 431 BCE.]]

From the perspective of Athenian culture in Classical Greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century BC encroaches slightly on the 4th century BC. This century is essentially studied from the Athenian outlook because Athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works than the other ancient Greek states. In this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 510 BC, with the fall of the Athenian tyrant and Cleisthenes' reforms. However, a broader view of the whole Greek world might place its beginning at the Ionian revolt of 500 BC, the event that provoked the Persian invasion of 492 BC. The Persians (called &quot;Medes&quot;) were finally defeated in 490 BC. A second Persian attempt failed in 481-479 BC. The Delian League then formed, under Athenian hegemony and as Athens' instrument. Athens' excesses caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but Athenian dynamism finally awoke Sparta and brought about the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC. After both forces were spent, a brief peace came about; then the war resumed to Sparta's advantage. Athens was definitively defeated in 404 BC, and internal Athenian agitations mark the end of the 5th century BC in Greece.

Since the beginning, Sparta had been ruled by a &quot;diarchy.&quot; This meant that Sparta had two kings serving concurrently throughout its entire history. The two kingships were both hereditary and were either from the Agiad dynasty or the Eurypontid dynasty. Allegedly, the hereditary lines of these two dynasties spring, respectively, from Eurysthenes and Procles, twin descendants of Hercules. Eurysthenes and Procles were said to have conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War.

===Cleisthenes===
[[File:Cleisthenes.jpg|thumb|Cleisthenes, the father of Greek democracy, reformed traditional Athenian government controlled by ruling tribes into the first government &quot;of the people&quot; (the ''Demos'') democracy.]]

In 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant Hippias. Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras. But his rival Cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by democrats, managed to take over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through his reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions—i.e., ones that all have the same rights—and established ostracism.

The isonomic and isegoric democracy was first organized into about 130 ''demes'', which became the foundational civic element. The 10,000 citizens exercised their power via the assembly (the ''ekklesia'', in Greek) of which they all were part, headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random.

The city's administrative geography was reworked, the goal being to have mixed political groups — not federated by local interests linked to the sea, to the city, or to farming — whose decisions (declaration of war, etc.) would depend on their geographical situation. Also, the territory of the city was divided into thirty trittyes as follows:

* ten ''trittyes'' in the coastal &quot;Paralie&quot;
* ten trittyes in &quot;Asty&quot;, the urban center
* ten ''trittyes'' in rural &quot;Mesogia&quot;.

A tribe consisted of three ''trittyes'', taken at random, one from each of the three groups. Each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors.

This is this corpus of reforms that would in the end allow the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s BC.

===The Persian Wars===
[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the Greek world during the Greco-Persian Wars (ca. 500–479 BC).]]

In Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of Turkey), the Greek cities, which included great centers such as Miletus and Halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid 6th century BC. In 499 BC, these ''poleis'' rose against Persian rule in what it has come to be known as the Ionian Revolt(499 BC-493 BC), and Athens and some other Greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 BC at the battle of Lade. Asia Minor returned to Persian control.

In 492 BC, the Persian general, Mardonius led a campaign through Thrace and Macedonia and, while victorious, he was wounded and forced to retreat back into Asia Minor. In addition, the naval fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied Mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Later, the generals Artaphernes and Datis submitted the Aegean islands through a naval expedition.

In 490 BC, Darius the Great of Persian, having suppressed the Ionian cities, sent a fleet to punish the Greeks. 100,000 Persians (historians are uncertain about the number; it varies from 18,000 to 100,000) landed in Attica intending to take Athens, but were defeated at the Battle of Marathon by a Greek army of 9,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 Plateans led by the Athenian general Miltiades. The Persian fleet continued to Athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault.
[[File:Leonidas statue1b.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of King Leonidas of Sparta.]]

Ten years later, in 480 BC, Darius' successor Xerxes I sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the Hellespont. This army took Thrace, before descending on Thessaly and Boetia, whilst the Persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops. The Greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block Cape Artemision. After being delayed by Leonidas I, the Spartan king of the Agiad Dynasty, at the Battle of Thermopylae (a battle made famous by the 300 Spartans who faced the entire Persian Army), Xerxes advanced into Attica, where he captured and burned Athens. But the Athenians had evacuated the city by sea, and under the command of Themistocles defeated the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis.

In 483 BC, during the time of peace between the two Persian invasions, a vein of silver ore had been discovered in the Laurion (a small mountain range near Athens), and the hundreds of talents mined there had paid for the construction of 200 warships to combat Aeginetan piracy. A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan Pausanias, defeated the Persian army at Plataea. Following the Battle of Plataea, the Persians began withdrawing from Greece and never attempted an invasion again.

The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians from the Aegean Sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the Battle of Mycale; then in 478 BC the fleet captured Byzantium. In the course of doing so Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the Delian League, so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos. The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power.

===The Peloponnesian War===
[[File:Map Peloponnesian War 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|Map of the nations during the start of the Peloponnesian War around 431 BC.]]

In 431 BC war broke out between Athens and Sparta and its allies. The war was not really a struggle between two city-states as it was a struggle between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states. These two leagues were the Delian League in which Athens was the leading member, and the Peloponnesian League, which was led by Sparta.

The Delian League grew out of the necessity of presenting a unified front of all Greek city-states against Persian aggression. In 481 BC, Greek city-states, including Sparta, met in the first of a series of &quot;congresses&quot; that strove to unify all the Greek city-states against the danger of another Persian invasion. This coalition of city-states formed in 481 BC became known as the &quot;Hellenic League&quot; and included Sparta. As noted above, the expected Persian invasion of Greece under King Xerxes occurred in September 481 BC when the Athenian navy defeated the Persian navy. The Persian land forces were delayed in 480 BC, by a much smaller force of 300 Spartans, 400 Thebans and 700 men from Boeotian Thespiae at the Battle of Thermopylae. The Persians finally left Greece in 479 BC following their defeat at Plataea.

The Battle of Plataea in 479 BC was the final battle of Xerxes' invasion of Greece. After the Battle of Plataea, the Persians never again tried to invade Greece. With the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the Hellenic League. In 477 BC, Athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include Sparta. This coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of Delos. Thus, the League took the name &quot;Delian League.&quot; The official purpose of this new League was to liberate Greek cities still under Persian control. However, it became increasingly apparent that the Delian League was really a front for Athenian imperialism throughout the Aegean.

A competing coalition of Greek city-states centered around Sparta arose and became more important as the external Persian threat subsided. This coalition became known as the Peloponnesian League. However, unlike the Hellenic League and the Delian League, the Spartan League was not a response to any external threat — Persian or otherwise. The Spartan League was unabashedly an instrument of Spartan policy aimed at the security of Lacedaemon (the prefecture on the Peloponnese Peninsula in which Sparta was located) and Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese Peninsula. Sometimes the Spartan League is called the &quot;Peloponnesian League.&quot; This term is ambiguous on two scores. The &quot;Peloponnesian League&quot; was not really a &quot;league&quot; at all. Nor was it really &quot;Peloponnesian.&quot; There was no equality at all between the members as might be implied by the term &quot;league.&quot; Furthermore, most of its members were not from the Peloponnese, but rather were located outside the Peloponnese Peninsula. Indeed, the terms &quot;Spartan League&quot; or &quot;Peloponnesian League&quot; are actually modern terms. Contemporaries actually used the term the &quot;Lacedaemonians and their Allies&quot; to describe the so-called league.

The Spartan League had its origins in Sparta's conflict with another city on the Peloponnese Peninsula--Argos. In the 7th century BC, Argos dominated the Peloponnese Peninsula. Even in the period of time after 600 BC, the Argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula. The rise of Sparta in the 6th century, naturally, brought Sparta in conflict with Argos. However, with the conquest of the Peloponnesian city-state of Tegea in 550 BC and the defeat of the Argives 546 BC, the Spartan's control began to reach well beyond the borders of Lacedaemon.

As these two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict. Under the influence of King Archidamus II (who ruled Sparta from 476 BC through 427 BC), Sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 BC, concluded the Thirty Years Peace with Athens. This treaty took effect the next winter in 445 BC Under the terms of this treaty, Greece was formally divided into two large power zones. Sparta and Athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's power zone. Despite the Thirty Years Peace, it was clear that eventual war was inevitable. As noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 BC, Sparta was a &quot;diarchy&quot; with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently. One line of hereditary kings were from the Eurypontid Dynasty while the other king was from the Agiad Dynansty. With the conclusion of the Thirty Years Peace treaty Archidamus II, the Eurypontid King at the time, felt he had successfully prevented Sparta from entering into a war with its neighbors. However, the strong war party in Sparta soon won out and in 431 BC Archidamus was forced into going to war with the Delian League. However, in 427 BC, Archidamus II died and his son, Agis II succeeded to the Eurypontid throne of Sparta.

The immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War vary from account to account. However three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely Thucydides and Plutarch. Prior to the war, Corinth and one of its colonies, Corcyra (modern-day Corfu), got into a dispute, in 435 BC, over the new Corcyran colony of Epidamnus. War broke out between Corinth and Corcyra. Sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle. In 433 BC, Corcyra, sought the assistance of Athens in the war on Corinth. Corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of Athens. However, to further encourage Athens to enter the conflict, Corcyra pointed out, to Athens, how useful a friendly relationship with Corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of Corcyra itself and the colony of Epidamnus on the east shore of the Adriatic Sea. Furthermore, Corcyra promised that Athens would have the use of their (Corcyra's) navy, which was the third largest navy in Greece. This was too good of an offer for Athens to refuse. Accordingly, Athens signed a defensive alliance with Corcyra.

The next year, in 432 BC, Corinth and Athens argued over control of Potidaea (near modern-day Nea Potidaia), eventually leading to an Athenian siege of Potidaea. In 434-433 BC Athens issued the &quot;Megarian Decrees&quot;, a series of economic decrees that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people. Athens was accused by the Peloponnesian allies of violating the Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, Sparta formally declared war on Athens.

Many historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other.

Sparta's initial strategy was to invade Attica, but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused heavy losses, including that of Pericles. At the same time the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnese, winning battles at Naupactus (429 BC) and Pylos (425 BC). But these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421 BC).

In 418 BC, however, hostility between Sparta and the Athenian ally Argos led to a resumption of hostilities. Alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the Athenians to ally with Argos against the Spartans. At the Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. Accordingly, Argos and the rest of the Peloponnesus was brought back under the control of Sparta. The return of peace allowed Athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the Peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order. Soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into Athens. A strong &quot;peace party&quot; arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the Athenian Empire. Concentration on the Athenian Empire, however, brought Athens into conflict with another Greek state.

Ever since the formation of the Delian League in 477 BC, the island of Melos had refused to join. By refusing to join the League, however, Melos reaped the benefits of the League without bearing any of the burdens. In 425 BC, an Athenian army under Cleon attacked Melos to force the island to join the Delian League. However, Melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality. Further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 BC the mood of the people in Athens was inclined toward military adventure. The island of Melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party. Furthermore there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party. Enforcement of the economic obligations of the Delian League upon rebellious city-states and island was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of Athens could be assured. Melos was alone among all the Cycladic Islands located in the southwest Aegean Sea had resisted joining the Delian League. This continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the Delian League.

The debate between Athens and Melos over the issue of joining the Delian League is presented by Thucydides in his Melian Dialogue. The debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between Melos and Athens and Melos was invaded in 416 BC, and soon occupied by Athens. This success on the part of Athens whetted the appetite of the people of Athens for further expansion of the Athenian Empire. Accordingly, the people of Athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by Alcibiades.

Thus, in 415 BC, Alcibiades found support within the Athenian Assembly for his position when he urged that Athens launch a major expedition against Syracuse, a Peloponnesian ally in Sicily. Segesta, a town in Sicily, had requested Athenian assistance in their war with the another Sicilian town — the town of Selinus. Although Nicias was a skeptic about the Sicilian Expedition, he was appointed along with Alcibiades to lead the expedition.

However, unlike the expedition against Melos, the citizens of Athens were deeply divided over the Alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far off Sicily. The peace party was desperate to foil Alcibiades. Thus, in June 415 BC, on the very eve of the departure of the Athenian fleet for Sicily, a band of vandals in Athens defaced the many statues of the god Hermes, that were scattered throughout the city of Athens. This action was blamed on Alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign. In all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of Hermes was the action of the peace party. Having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken Alcibiades' hold on the people of Athens. Successfully blaming Alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened Alcibiades and the war party in Athens. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of Hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet. Such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated.

Even before the fleet reached Sicily, word arrived to the fleet that Alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of Hermes. Due to these accusations against him, Alcibiades fled to Sparta before the expedition actually landed in Sicily. When the fleet landed in Sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster. The entire expeditionary force was lost and Nicias was captured and executed. This was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of Athens.

Meanwhile, Alcibiades betrayed Athens and became a chief advisor to the Spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land. Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time — large enough to challenge the Athenian superiority at sea. Additionally, Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes — the Persians. As noted below, Alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in Sparta when he was accused of having seduced Timaea, the wife of Agis II, the Eurypontid king of Sparta. Accordingly, Alcibiades was required to flee from Sparta and seek the protection of the Persian Court.

Sparta had now built a fleet (with the financial help of the Persians) to challenge Athenian naval supremacy, and had found a new military leader in Lysander, who attacked Abydos and seized the strategic initiative by occupying the Hellespont, the source of Athens' grain imports. Threatened with starvation, Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander, who decisively defeated them at Aegospotami (405 BC). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy. In 404 BC Athens sued for peace, and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions. Lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the &quot;Thirty Tyrants&quot; to govern Athens.

Meanwhile, in Sparta, Timaea gave birth to a child. The child was given the name Leotychidas, son of Agis II, after the great grandfather of Agis II — King Leotychidas of Sparta. However, because of her alleged dalliance with Alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young Leotychidas was actually fathered by Alcibiades. Indeed, Agis II, himself, refused to acknowledge Leotychidas as his son until he relented in front of witnesses, on his death bed in 400 BC.

Upon the death of Agis II, Leotychidas attempted to claim the Eurypontid throne for himself. However, there was an outcry against this attempted succession. The outcry was led by the victorious navarch (admiral) Lysander, who was at the height of his influence in Sparta. Lysander argued that Leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the Eurypontid throne. Accordingly, Lysander backed the hereditory claim of Agesilaus, son of Agis by another wife, other than Timaea. Based on the support of Lysander, Agesilaus became the Eurypontid king as Agesilaus II, expelled Leotychidas from the country, and took over all of Agis' estates and property.

==4th century BC==

The end of the Peloponnesian War left Sparta the master of Greece, but the narrow outlook of the Spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role. Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and in other cities. In 395 BC, the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. Athens, Argos, Thebes, and Corinth, the latter two former Spartan allies, challenged Sparta's dominance in the Corinthian War, which ended inconclusively in 387 BC. That same year Sparta shocked the Greeks by concluding the Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia. The agreement turned over the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus, reversing a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes, which led to a war in which Thebes allied with its old enemy Athens.

Then the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a decisive victory at Leuctra (371 BC). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance, but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at Mantinea (362 BC) the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with Phocis. In 346 BC, the Thebans appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians, thus drawing Macedon into Greek affairs for the first time.

The Peloponnesian War was a radical turning point for the Greek world. Before 403 BC, the situation was more defined, with Athens and its allies (a zone of domination and stability, with a number of island cities benefiting from Athens' maritime protection), and other states outside this Athenian Empire. The sources denounce this Athenian supremacy (or hegemony) as smothering and disadvantageous.

After 403 BC, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived. The first of these turnarounds was managed by Athens as early as 390 BC, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory.

===The Fall of Sparta===

This empire was powerful but short-lived. In 405 BC, the Spartans were masters of all - of Athens' allies and of Athens itself - and their power was undivided. By the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. As noted above, in 400 BC, Agesilaus became king of Sparta.

====Foundation of a Spartan empire====

The subject of how to reorganize the Athenian Empire as part of the Spartan Empire provoked much heated debate among Sparta's full citizens. The admiral Lysander felt that the Spartans should rebuild the Athenian empire in such a way that Sparta profited from it. Lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others. Prior to this, Spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots (which generally discouraged their accumulation) and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property. Without the Spartans' support, Lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him - on Samos, for example, festivals known as Lysandreia were organized in his honor. He was recalled to Sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters.

Sparta refused to see Lysander or his successors dominate. Not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 BC not to support the directives that he had made.

Agesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century BC. This accidental accession meant that, unlike the other Spartan kings, he had the advantage of a Spartan education. The Spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by Cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the Spartan state.

In the Persian Court, Alcibiades now betrayed both: helping Sparta build a navy commensurate with the Athenian navy. Alcibiades advised that a victory of Sparta over Athens was not in the best interest of the Persian Empire. Rather, long and continuous warfare between Sparta and Athens would weaken both city-states and allow the Persians to easily dominate the Helles (Greek) peninsula.

Among the war party in Athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to Sicily in 415 BC through 413 BC could have been avoided if Alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition. Thus, despite his treacherous flight to Sparta and collaboration with Sparta and, later, with the Persian Court, there arose a demand among the war party that Alcibiades be allowed to return to Athens without being arrested. Alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the Athenian controlled island of Samos. Alcibiades felt that &quot;radical democracy&quot; was his worst enemy. Accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in Athens. If the coup were successful Alcibiades promised to return to Athens. In 411 BC, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in Athens, which became known as &quot;the 400.&quot; However, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in Samos failed. Alcibiades was immediately made an admiral (navarch) in the Athenian navy. Later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 was replaced by a broader oligarchy called &quot;the 5000.&quot; Alcibiades did not immediately return to Athens. In early 410 BC, Alcibiades led an Atheneian fleet of eighteen triremes (ships) against the Persian-financed Spartan fleet at Abydos near the Hellespont. The Battle of Abydos had actually begun before the arrival of Alcibiades and had been inclining slightly toward the Athenians. However, with the arrival of Alcibiades, the Athenian victory over the Spartans became a rout. Only the approach of nightfall and the movement of Persian troops to the coast where the Spartans had beached their ships, saved the Spartan navy from total destruction.

Following the advice that Alcibiades had provided the Persian Court, the Persian Empire had been playing Sparta and Athens off against each other. However, as weak as the Spartan navy was after the Battle of Abydos, the Persian navy sought to prove direct assistance to the Spartans. Thus following the Battle of Abydos, Alcibiades pursued and met the combined Spartan and Persian fleets at the Battle of Cyzicus later in the spring of 410 BC. Alcibiades and the Athenian navy won a significant victory against the combined navies.

Agesilaus, the Eurypontid King of Sparta, employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-Hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the Persian empire. Once again, the Persian empire played both sides against each other. With access to Persian gold, the Persian Court supported Sparta in the rebuilding of their navy and supported the Athenians, who used Persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls (destroyed in 404 BC) as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories.

For most of the first years of his reign, Agesilaus had been engaged in a war against Persia in the Aegean Sea and in Asia Minor. In 394 BC, the Spartan authorities decided to force Agesilaus to return to mainland Greece. Sparta had been attacked by Thebes and other allied Greek city-states. While Agesilaus had a large part of the Spartan Army was in Asia Minor, the Spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces from Thebes, Corinth, Athens and Argos. At the Battle of Haliartus the Spartans had been defeated by the Thebean forces. Worse yet, Lysander, Sparta's chief military leader had been killed at Haliartus. This was the start of what became known as the &quot;Corinthian War.&quot; Upon hearing of the Spartan loss at Haliartus and of the death of Lysander, Agesilaus headed out of Asia Minor, back across the Hellspont, across Thrace and back towards Greece. At the Battle of Coronea, Agesilaus and his Spartan Army defeated a Theban force. For six more years, Sparta fought the allied city-states of Thebes, Corinth, Athens and Argos in the Corinthian War (395 BC to 387 BC). During the war, Corinth drew support from a coalition of traditional Spartan enemies — Argos, Athens and Thebes. However, the war descended into guerrilla tactics and Sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with Persia. The long Corinthian War finally ended with the Peace of Antalcidas or the King's Peace, in which the &quot;Great King&quot; of Persia, Artaxerxes II, pronounced a &quot;treaty&quot; of peace between the various city-states of Greece which broke up all &quot;leagues&quot; of city-states on Greek mainland and in the islands of the Aegean Sea. Although this was looked upon as &quot;independence&quot; for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral &quot;treaty&quot; was highly favorable to the interests of the Persian Empire.

The Corinthian War revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in Greece. While Athens and Sparta fought each other to exhaustion, Thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various Greek city-states.

====The peace of Antalcidas====
[[File:Artaxerxes I.jpg|thumb|Artaxerxes I was king of the Persian Empire from 464 BC to 424 BC.]]

In 387 BC, an edict was promulgated by the Persian king, preserving the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Cyprus as well as the independence of the Greek Aegean cities, except for Lymnos, Imbros and Skyros, which were given over to Athens. It dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones. This is an ultimatum that benefited Athens only to the extent that Athens held onto three islands. While the &quot;Great King,&quot; Artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, Sparta was to act as Persia's agent in enforcing the Peace. To the Persians this document is known as the &quot;King's Peace.&quot; To the Greeks, this document is known as the Peace of Antalcidas, after the Spartan diplomat, Antalcidas, who was sent to Persia to negotiate a treaty for Sparta. Sparta had been worried about the developing closer ties between Athens and Persia. Accordingly, Altalcidas was sent to Persia to get whatever agreement he could from the &quot;Great King&quot;. Accordingly, the &quot;Peace of Antalcidas is not a negotiated peace at all. Rather it is a surrender to the interests of Persia, drafted entirely along its interests.

====Spartan interventionism====

On the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences. In accordance with it, the Boeotian League or Boeotian confederacy was dissolved in 386 BC. This confederacy was dominated by Thebes, a city hostile to the Spartan hegemony. Sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in Epirus and in the north of Greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of Thebes, the Cadmea, after an expedition in the Chalcidice and the capture of Olynthos. It was a Theban politician who suggested to the Spartan general Phoibidas that Sparta should seize Thebes itself. This act was sharply condemned, though Sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by Phoibidas. The Spartan attack was successful and Thebes was placed under Spartan control.

====Clash with Thebes====

In 378 BC, the reaction to Spartan control over Thebes was broken by a popular uprising within Thebes. Elsewhere in Greece, the reaction against Spartan hegemony began when, Sphodrias, another Spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on the Piraeus. Although the gates of Piraeus were no longer fortified, Sphodrias was driven off before the Piraeus. Back in Sparta, Sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the Spartan court. Nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between Athens and Thebes. Sparta would now have to fight them both together. Athens was trying to recover from their defeat in the Peloponnesian War at the hands of Sparta's &quot;navarch&quot; (admiral), Lysander in the disaster of 404 BC. The rising spirit of rebellion against Sparta also fueled Thebes' attempt to restore the former Boeotian confederacy. In Boeotia, Thebian leaders, Pelopidas and Epaminondas, reorganized the Thebian army and began to free the towns of Boeotia from their Spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived Boeotian League. Pelopidas won a great victory for Thebes over a much larger Spartan force in the Battle of Tegyra in 375 BC.

Thebian authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that Athens came to mistrust the growing Theban power. Athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second Athenian League. Attention was drawn to growing power of Thebes, when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, Phocis and, particularly, after Thebes razed the city of Platea in 375 BC Platea had been a long-term ally of Athens. The destruction of Platea caused Athens to negotiate an alliance with Sparta against Thebes, in that same year of 375 BC. In 371, the Thebian army, led by Epaminondas, inflicted a bloody defeat on Spartan forces at Battle of Leuctra. Sparta lost a large part of its army and 400 of its 2,000 citizen-troops. The Battle of Leuctra was a watershed in Greek history. Epaminondas' victory over the Sparta forces at Leuctra ended a long history of Spartan military prestige and dominance over Greece and the period of Spartan hegemony was over. However, Spartan hegemony was not replaced by Thebian, but rather Athenian hegemony.

====The rise of Athens====
=====Return to the 5th century BC=====

The Athenians forbade themselves any return to the situation in the 5th century. In Aristotle's decree, Athens claimed its goal was to prevent Spartan hegemony, with the Spartans clearly denounced as &quot;warmongers&quot;. Athens' hegemony was no longer a centralized system but an alliance in which the allies had a voice. The Athenians did not sit on the council of the allies, nor was this council headed by an Athenian. It met regularly and served as a political and military counterweight to Athens. This new league was a quite moderate and much looser organization.

=====Financing the league=====

It was important to erase the bad memories of the former league. Its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid. Instead, ''syntaxeis'' were used, irregular contributions as and when Athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible. These contributions were not taken to Athens — unlike the 5th century BC system, there was no central exchequer for the league — but to the Athenian generals themselves.

The Athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the ''eisphora''. They reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the ''Proseiphora'', in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors. This system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy.

=====Athenian hegemony halted=====

This league responded to a real and present need. On the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century BC, with Athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league. Alliance with Athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained.

The main reasons for the eventual failure were structural. This alliance was only valued out of fear of Sparta, which evaporated after Sparta's fall in 371 BC, losing the alliance its ''sole raison d'etre''. The Athenians no longer had the means to fullfil their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies. Thus, the tyrant of Pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity. From 360, Athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies (such as Byzantium and Naxos in 364) decided to secede.

In 357 BC, the revolt against the league spread, and between 357 and 355, Athens had to face war against its allies, a war whose issue was marked by a decisive intervention by the king of Persia in the form of an ultimatum to Athens, demanding that Athens recognise its allies' independence under penalty of Persia's sending 200 triremes against Athens. Athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy to weaken itself more and more. The Athenians had failed in all their plans and were unable to propose a durable alliance.

====Theban hegemony - tentative and with no future====
=====5th century BC Boeotian confederacy (447–386 BC)=====

This was not Thebes' first attempt at hegemony. It had been the most important city of Boeotia and the center of the previous Boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386.

That confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at Oxyrhyncus and known as &quot;The Anonyme of Thebes&quot;. Thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy. Citizenship was defined according to wealth, and Thebes counted 11,000 active citizens.

It was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a ''Boeotarch'', a certain number of council members, 1,000 ''hoplites'' and 100 horsemen. From the 5th century BC the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders. It also had a small fleet that played a part in the Peloponnesian War by providing 25 triremes for the Spartans. At the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a ''navarch''.

All this constituted a significant enough force that the Spartans were happy to see the Boeotian confederacy dissolved by the king's peace. This dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the Thebans (who had lost the Cadmea to Sparta in 382 BC) from reforming this confederacy.
[[File:362BCThebanHegemony.png|thumb|The Theban Hegemony, 371-362 BC.]]

=====Theban reconstruction=====

Pelopidas and Epaminondas endowed Thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of Athens, the Thebans revived the title of &quot;Boetarch&quot; lost in the Persian king's peace and - with victory at Leuctra and the destruction of Spartan power - the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy. Epaminondas rid the Peloponnesus of pro-Spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-Theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by Sparta. He equally supported the reconstruction of the city of Messene thanks to an invasion of Laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them Messene as a capital.

He decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the Peloponnessus, forming an Arcadian confederacy (The king's peace had destroyed a previous Arcadian confederacy and put Messene under Spartan control.)

=====Confrontation between Athens and Thebes=====

The strength of the Boeotian League explains Athens' problems with her allies in the second Athenian League. Epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the Athenian league and joining a Boeotian maritime league. Epaminondas and Pelopidas also reformed the army of Thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting. Thus, the Thebian army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other Greek states at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC.
[[File:Ivanov, Andrey - Pelopidas's death - 1805-1806.jpg|thumb|&quot;Pelopida's death&quot; by Andrewy Ivanov, 1805-1806.]]

Sparta also remained an important power in the face of Thebian strength. However, some of the cities allied with Sparta turned against her, because of Thebes. In 367 BC, both Sparta and Athens sent delegates to Artaxerxes II, the Great King of Persia. These delegates sought to have the Artaxerxes, once again, declare Greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 BC. That unilateral peace treaty, commonly called the &quot;King's Peace&quot;, or the &quot;Peace of Antalcidas&quot;, breaking all bonds between the various city-states of Greece. As noted above, this had meant the destruction of the Boeotian League in 387 BC. Sparta and Athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar &quot;Kings Peace&quot; by the Great King of the Persian Empire. Thebes sent Pelopidas to argue against this attempt at a new unilateral &quot;peace treaty&quot; guaranteed by the Persian Empire. Now however, twenty years later in 367 BC, the Great King was convinced by Pelopidas and the Thebian diplomats that Thebes, and the Boeotian League, would be the best agent of Persian interests in Greece. Accordingly, the Great King did not issue a new &quot;King's Peace.&quot; Thus, to deal with Thebes, Athens and Sparta were thrown back on their own resources. Thebes, meanwhile, expanded their influence beyond the bounds of Boeotia. In 364 BC, the Thebeans defeated the army of Alexander of Pherae in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, located in southeastern Thessaly in northern Greece. Pelopidas led this Thebian Army to Cynoscephalae. However, during the battle, Pelopides was killed.

The confederal framework of Sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past. Such was the case with the cities of Tegea and Mantinea, which re-allied in the Arcardian confederacy. The Mantineans received the support of the Athenians and the Tegeans that of the Thebans. In 362 BC Thebian general, Epaminondas, led a Thebian army against a coalition of Athenian, Spartan, Elisian, Mantinean and Achean forces. Battle was joined at Mantinea. The Thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for Epaminondas died in the battle, stating that &quot;I bequeath to Thebes two daughters, the victory of Leuctra and the victory at Mantinea&quot;.

Despite the victory at Mantinea, in the end, the Thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the Peloponnesus. This event is looked upon as a watershed in Greek history. Thus, Xenophon concludes his history of the Greek world at this point, in 362 BC. The end of this period was even more confused than its beginning. Greece had failed and, according to Xenophon, the history of the Greek world was no longer intelligible.

The idea of hegemony disappeared. From 362 BC onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in Greece. The Spartans were greatly weakened; the Athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; Thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat Sparta and Athens but not to be a major power in Asia Minor.

Other forces also intervened, such as the Persian king, who was appointed himself as arbitrator between the Greek cities, with the tacit agreement of the cities themselves. This situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for wars. One war led to another, each longer and more bloody, and the cycle could not be broken. Hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the 370 invasion of Laconia.

===Rise of Macedon===

Thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC. The energetic leadership within Macedon began in 359 BC when Phillip of Macedonia was made regent for his nephew, Amyntas. Within a short time, Phillip was acclaimed king as, Phillip II of Macedonia, in his own right with succession of the throne established on his own heirs (Alexander the Great).

----

As we head into the modern period, it is useful to divide this juncture of time into 4 main periods:

==1699-1798==

The first period, 1699-1798, was both a century of decline and of reform. The three great Muslim empires in this period, the Ottoman, the Safavid, and the Mughal, began to suffer economic and political setbacks.   In 1699 (because of the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz), the Ottoman empire lost extensive territories for the first time: they had to surrender Hungary and Transylvania to Austria, and the Ukraine to Poland. 

==1798-1922==

The second period, 1798-1922, was characterized by European domination which began with Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt in 1798, followed shortly thereafter by British occupation of Egypt after the French were driven out. The French, however, would go on to occupy most of North Africa and Syria. The notorious Sykes-Picot Treaty which was concluded between Britain and France in 1916 gave France control of, or in the terminology of the day, designated France the protector of Arab Syria and Kurdish Mosul province, while Britain was designated the protector of Baghdad and Basra provinces.  Up to the time of signing this treaty, the  European powers, particularly the British, had been promising the Arabs that they would be allowed to form independent nations in return for helping the British to oust the Ottoman Turks, and as a consequence defeat Germany and her allies during the First World War.  This treachery on the part of the British and the French was not easily forgotten or forgiven, as one might expect.  In 1920, the League of Nations (the forerunner of the United Nations) gave its seal of approval to the terms of this treaty and awarded France and Britain mandates to rule the newly-created Arab states in 1920.

Before the period of colonialism, there was no concept of a territorial state in the Muslim world.   Muslims were conscious of ethnic, linguistic, and regional differences among themselves, but they saw themselves as politically united first under the caliphate and then the later empires and sultanates.  The nation-state, and thus nationalism, arose in the Muslim world only as a consequence of colonialism.  In a number of cases, some of these nation-states were created in an ad hoc and arbitrary manner to serve the interests of the colonizers: For example, British interests in Persian Gulf oil led to the creation of Kuwait; France carved Lebanon out of Syria to create a friendly Arab Christian state; and Britain created Jordan to reward King Abdullah, who had fought with the British during World War I.  In many cases, this gratuitous recarving of territory aggravated already existing ethnic, linguistic, and religious tensions as in the case of Lebanon, Pakistan, Palestine, and Malaysia, for example.  In some cases, secular nationalism focused on territorial boundaries arose as a consequence of the creation of nation-states, it always remained in competition with a broader religious identity, grounded in Islamic culture.

Specific actions that the colonial powers took against religious institutions had disastrous consequences afterwards and helped create an Islamic backlash.  For example, SHARI‘A COURTS WERE ABOLISHED in many countries by the European colonizers.  This in fact planted the seeds for future fundamentalist reaction against governments in a number of Islamic countries which, due to the abolition of the Shari‘a courts and the adoption of European legal codes, were now no longer seen as following and implementing Islamic law.  The system of charitable endowments (waqf) which financially supported the madrasas and had allowed the madrasas and their professors to maintain independence from the various ruling authorities was dismantled by the British, for example, in Egypt.  As a result, al-Azhar became a governmental institution.  These policies were continued by the post-colonial governments which came to power after the departure of the British, which wanted to restrict the freedom of the ulama and the intelligentsia in general.  The rector (our university president) of al-Azhar is now on the government payroll and widely regarded as a spokesperson for the government.

==1922-1962==

The third period, 1922-1962, was one of decolonization and the origins of nationalism and of political Islam.  In 1922, Egypt gained limited independence from the British.  In 1923, The Republic of Turkey was formed when the Ottoman sultan was sent into exile and the empire dismembered.  In 1924, the caliphate based in Istanbul was abolished by the newly formed secular Republic of Turkey under Kemal Ataturk which ended the Ottoman Empire.  Kemal Ataturk was a zealous secularist and he took a number of drastic steps to initiate modernization of the country, which he equated with adoption of Western ideas and customs and the abandonment of traditional Islamic practices and habits.  Thus, he switched from the use of the Arabic script to write Turkish to Latin.  He banned traditional Islamic forms of clothing, such as the Fez for men and the veil for women, and secularized the school system.  Kemalism, as this deliberate adoption of secularism was called, is still the reigning ideology in Turkey today.

Most Muslim countries under European colonialism gained their independence between 1945-1960.  Another crucial event that occurred in this period was the creation of the Jewish state of Israel on Palestinian soil in 1948 by the League of Nations, which led to the homelessness of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.  This was an event that further embittered the attitudes of Arabs and Muslims toward the West.

==1962 to the present==

And finally the fourth period, 1962 to the present: Nasser’s revolution. This is a period of continuing nationalism and the consolidation of political Islamic movements.  The secular nationalists believed in pan-Arabism; that is the overall unity of the Arab world despite their separation into independent nation-states. However, nationalism began to give way to religiously resurgent movements.  The most dramatic of these revolutions was that of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in 1978-79.

These cataclysmic events fostered the rise of political Islam in this period, the early 20th century.  Some have referred to these highly politicized religious groups as neo-revivalists; the more usual term today is Islamist.

==JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON TERMINOLOGY:==

Scholars in the field refer to Islamic revivalism, Islamic resurgence, political Islam, and Islamism.  Another term that is used is Islamic fundamentalism.  We must remember that fundamentalism was a term coined in the 19th century to refer to particularly Protestant Christian movements which insisted on the acceptance of the Bible as the literal word of God.  In Islam, scriptural inerrancy is simply not an issue.  A Muslim by definition is someone who accepts the Qur'an as the literal word of God; whether one is a conservative or liberal Muslim, there is a consensus on this issue; one cannot be a believing Muslim without accepting that the Qur'an is a divine, revealed text.  From this point of view, it doesn't make sense to talk of Muslim fundamentalists as a separate group within Islam.  With this caveat, this warning, in mind, it is better to speak of Islamic revivalist or resurgent movements in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and, particularly in the 20th century, to talk about political Islam or Islamism.

Political Islam can have many faces; some Islamists take the more militant and radical route, and these are the ones who regularly get into the media today.  The earliest such groups are the Muslim brotherhood, established by Hasan al-Banna (1906-49) in Egypt and the Jamaat-i Islami (“the Islamic society”) established by Mawlana Abul ‘Ala Mawdudi (1903-79) of India.  Both men were personally pious, highly educated men both in the traditional Islamic sciences and in Western learning.  Both came to react strongly against British imperialism, under whose shadow they lived a part of their lives.

Also importantly, they were reacting against a local elite that under European colonial influence had become Westernized to the extent that members of this elite spoke the language of the colonizers, imitated their dress and customs, and considered themselves secular.  Thus they were fighting the influence of both external and internal forces.  Islamists are both religious and social activists; both al-Banna and Mawdudi were very effective at organizing supporters at the grass-roots level.  They set up health clinics and social welfare projects that helped in gaining the loyalty of a cross-section of the middle and working class people.  The activities of these Islamists may be described as being part of a religious, socio-political protest movement that was committed to fighting political corruption and religious laxity, through violence if necessary.

After the departure of the foreign colonial rulers, they continued their opposition to the local governments that were set up, often by the departing colonizers; these local ruling elites were thus perceived as representing Western interests at the expense of national interests.  If you have studied anything about modern Middle Eastern politics and history,  you will know that Arab governments that have ruled after the Second World War have off and on been primarily monarchies and military regimes.  As far as the Islamists were concerned, these governments, often corrupt and despotic, had no legitimacy and therefore they had a sacred mission to set up a just and righteous government that would govern according to Islamic principles.  If they had to resort to violence and lay down their lives for it; they were quite prepared to do so.  For them, jihad primarily came to mean the equivalent of just war or holy war to fight those whom they regarded as compromising Islamic principles.   Many Islamists believe in what Mawdudi called theo-democracy; in other words, a democracy that called for power-sharing through consultation, according to the Qur’anic concept of shura.  They also believed in elections, because the Islamic principle of  bay‘a which is a pledge an individual gives to his or her ruler, gives the right to the people to express their approval or disapproval of the government.  But it would have to be an Islamic democracy, subject to the tenets of the religious law, the Shari‘a, which, as interpreted by them, was practically an unchanging body of law which mandated a specific form of government.  This government, as Mawdudi pronounced, was founded on the notion of God’s sovereignty, in Arabic al-hakimiyyah.</text>

== How Do I Upload A PDF? ==



I have created a PDF of Beyond Blender Render. However when attempting to upload it appeared that it would only allow images on the proper form. Could it be licensed as my own work? Is there a different form I should be using?

:Consider uploading it to http://wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=book_creator&amp;referer=Main+Page

:[[User:Anna Frodesiak|Anna Frodesiak]] ([[User talk:Anna Frodesiak|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anna Frodesiak|contribs]]) 22:47, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
*On http://www.blender.org/ it says right at the top: &quot;Blender is the free open source 3D content creation suite, available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License.&quot;  This means that any screenshots of this software must also be published on that license.  So you cannot claim that part as your own work.  Consider making the whole of your book be licensed the same way, under GNU General Public License, that would be the simplest. --[[User:Mareklug|Mareklug]] ([[User talk:Mareklug|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mareklug|contribs]]) 23:04, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

== Hapangry template ==

Hi Downdate,
Could you check your template please?
The bulletin board posting of it might need a look to.
It looks as though the image has been removed from part of it.
I'm not an experienced editor and there's the possiblity I could be the person who deleted it.
I don't think it was me..I'm pretty sure you have to save changes elsewhere than the sandbox to make them stick.
but I was Examining and experimenting with the code in my sandbox earlier, and now I see that the image is gone.
I'm a bit nervous about trying to fix it. So sorry if this turns out to be my doing.
oh, and by the way...How can I view the history of a page I didnt make?

Does hitting the cancel button not cancel an edit?

      <comment>Editing my to-do list.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm CharmlessCoin. I use Wikibooks quite regularly to learn programming languages. In particular, C. I've noticed some gaps in the books I use, and hope to fill them a little bit when I have free time.

Current Ideas/Projects/Notes to remind myself:

* The C programming book is currently lacking exercises. Either find links to good exercises (Project Euler, r/dailyprogrammer, etc.), or come up with some.

* In short, I think the C book needs major work done. I'm not sure how exactly to go about doing this without a group consensus on how to standardize the book.

I suppose I could copy over most of the book and do some standardizing work on it myself, but that seems a little counter-intuitive in a wiki.</text>

==Welcome!==
[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]]! You do not need to [[WB:LOGIN|log in]] to read or edit books at Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
* A username of your choice for directly attributing [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|your contributions]].
* A personal user page, a [[WB:TALK|talk page]], and a [[Help:Tracking changes#Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that interest you.
* The ability to [[WB:MOVE|rename]] pages and to [[WB:PREFS|customize]] some aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* People will recognize you as a member of the Wikibooks community, and you will be eligible to [[WB:REVIEW|review]] pages.
* Your IP address will be hidden from most users, which may give you a greater sense of security and privacy.

We hope that you choose to join our community as a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this text is to review the design techniques for digital circuits starting from NAND gates and Boolean Algebra. The end result is a student should be able to design these types of circuits:

Throughout this book a '''graph''' ''G(V,E)'' is a pair of sets, where ''E'' is a subset of pairs of elements of the set ''V''. The elements of ''V'' are called '''vertices''', and the elements of ''E'' '''edges'''. For every edge ''(a,b)'' in ''E'' we call ''b'' a neighbor of ''a''. A graph w/boundary is a graph w/chosen subset ''∂G'' of '''boundary''' nodes.

A [[Wikipedia:Surface|surface]] ''S'' is a topological space, such that around its every point ''p'' there is an open set ''U'' homeomorphic to the open unit disc ''D'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p\in U, \\
\phi_U(p) = 0, \\
\phi_U(U) = \mathbf{D}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

or neighborhood homeomorphic to the half of the unit disc for the boundary nodes: 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p\in U, \\
\phi_U(p) = 0, \\
\phi_U(U) = \mathbf{D}\cap\{z: \Im z \ge 0 \}, \\
\phi_U(U\cap\partial S) = (-1,1).
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''simple arc''' in a surface ''S'' is an image of a [[Wikipedia:Homeomorphism | homeomorphism]] of the interval ''[0,1]'' to the surface. An '''embedding''' of a graph ''G(V,E)'' to a surface ''S'' is a representation of the vertices ''V'' of the graph by distinct points of ''S'', w/the boundary of the graph on the boundary of the surface and the edges ''E'' by the simple non-intersecting and non-touching simple arcs connecting corresponding endpoints.

For a graph ''G'' embedded in a surface ''S'' the connected components of ''S\E'' are called faces. The embedding is '''proper''' if the faces are simply connected, except possibly the unbounded infinite one. The embedded graph ''G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' is called dual to graph ''G'' if its vertices are located in distinct (and all) faces of graph ''G'' and vice versa, and its edges connect vertices w/corresponding adjacent faces. The edges of the graph ''G'' and its dual ''G*'' are in the ''1-to-1'' correspondence. The embedded graph and its dual can be unified in a single construction of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_graph medial graph] ''M(G)'' defined later in the book. It will be clear from the context how to slightly modify the definitions for graphs w/boundary.

A graph that can be embedded in the plane or the sphere is called [[Wikipedia:Planar graph|planar graph]].</text>

In this section the endpoints of edges of a considered graph can have an order, making it a '''directed graph'''. A graph with positive function/vector defined on its edges is called  '''weighted graph'''. 

'''[[../Random walk|Random walk]]''' of a particle on a graph G with discrete time is the following process:

* At moment ''t = 0'' the particle occupies a vertex ''v'' of ''G''. 
* At moment ''t = n+1'' the particle moves to a neighbor of its position at the moment ''t = n'' w/probability proportional to the weight of the edge connecting/pointing to the neighbor.

Choosing a subset of vertices of a graph as '''boundary''', the '''[[../harmonic measure|harmonic measure]]''' of a subset ''S'' of the boundary is the function/vector on vertices of ''G'' that equals the probability that a particle, starting its random walk at a vertex ''p'', occupies a boundary vertex in the set ''S'' before a boundary vertex not in ''S''.

It follows from the definition that the harmonic measure at ''p'' of a single boundary node ''b'' equals to the sum over the finite paths through interior from ''p'' to ''b'':

: &lt;math&gt;
u_b(p) = \sum_{p\xrightarrow[]{path} b}(\prod_{e\in path}w(e)/\prod_{q\in (path-\{b\})}\sum_{q\rightarrow r}w(qr)),
&lt;/math&gt; 

or

: &lt;math&gt;
u_b(p) = \sum_{p\xrightarrow[]{path} b}\prod_{e=(qr)\in path}\frac{w(e)}{\sum_{q\rightarrow r}w(qr)}.
&lt;/math&gt; 

Note, that an edge or a vertex may appear multiple times in a path.

The '''[[../Brownian motion|Brownian motion]]''' is a continuous/limiting analog of the random walk. It follows from the averaging property of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator|Laplace operator] that the hitting probabilities of a particle under Brownian motion are described by harmonic functions, defined in the previous section. The harmonic functions are [[../conformaly invariant|conformaly invariant]].</text>

Harmonic functions can be defined as solutions of differential and difference [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation| Laplace equation] as follows.

A function/vector ''u'' defined on the vertices of a graph w/boundary is harmonic if its value at every interior vertex ''p'' is the average of its values at neighboring vertices. That is,

: &lt;math&gt;
u(p) = \sum_{p\rightarrow q} \gamma(pq)u(q)/\sum_{p\rightarrow q} \gamma(pq).
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, alternatively, ''u'' satisfies [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws| Kirchhoff's law] for potential at every interior vertex ''p'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{p\rightarrow q} \gamma(pq)(u(p) - u (q)) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

A harmonic function on a manifold ''M'' is a twice continuously differentiable function u : M → R, where ''u'' satisfies Laplace equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Delta_\gamma u = \nabla\cdot(\gamma\nabla u) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

A harmonic function defined on open subset of the plane satisfies the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;
(\gamma u_x)_x+(\gamma u_y)_y = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The harmonic functions satisfy the following properties:

* mean-value property 
The value of a harmonic function is a weighted average of its values at the neighbor vertices,

* maximum principle 
Corollary: the maximum (and the minimum) of a harmonic functions occurs on the boundary of the graph or the manifold,

* harmonic conjugate
One can use the system of '''Cauchy-Riemann equations''' 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\gamma u_x = v_y, \\
\gamma u_y = - v_x
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

to define the harmonic conjugate.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation| Analytic/harmonic continuation] is an extension of the domain of a given harmonic function.

[[File:Harmonic continuation.jpg|thumbnail| Harmonic/analytic continuation on a square grid]]

=== Dirichlet problem ===
Harmonic functions minimize the energy integral or the sum 

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_{\Omega}\gamma|\nabla u|^2 \mbox{ and } \sum_{e=(p,q)\in E} \gamma(e)(u(p) - u (q))^2
&lt;/math&gt; 

if the values of the functions are fixed at the boundary of the domain or the network in the continuous and discrete models respectively. The minimizing function/vector is the solution of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_problem Dirichlet problem] with the prescribed boundary data.</text>

Same place, different day. Knut is sitting at his desk again, staring at a blank paper in front of him, while nervously playing with a pen in his right hand. Just a few hours left to hand in his essay and he has not written a word. All of a sudden he smashes his fist on the table and cries out: &quot;I need a plan!&quot;
같은 장소, 다른 날짜. 크누트씨는 또 책상에 앉아 있고, 앞의 빈 종이를 쳐다보면서 신경질적으로 오른손의 펜을 놀리고 있다. 리포트를 제출해야하는 시간이 고작 몇 시간 밖에 안 남았는데 한 글자도 쓰지 못한 것이다. 그러다 갑다기 상에 주먹을 내리치며 이렇게 외친다. &quot;계획을 세워야겠어!&quot;

That thing Knut is confronted with is something everyone of us encounters in his daily life. He has got a problem - and he does not really know how to solve it. But [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#What_is_a_problem|what exactly is a problem?]] Are there strategies to solve problems? These are just a few of the questions we want to answer in this chapter.
크누트씨가 직면한 상황은 모두가 일상생활에서 마주치게 되는 종류의 상황이다. 그는 해결해야할 문제가 있고, 그 문제를 어떻게 해결해야하는지 잘 모른다. 하지만 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#What_is_a_problem|문제라는게 정확히 뭔가?]] 문제를 해결할 전략들이 있는가? 이런 것들이 우리가 이 장에서 답하고자 하는 질문이다.

We begin our chapter by giving a short description of what psychologists regard as a problem. Afterwards we are going to present different approaches towards problem solving, starting with [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Restructuring_-_The_Gestalt_Approach|gestalt psychologists]] and ending with modern [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Problem_Solving_as_a_Search_Problem|search strategies]] connected to artificial intelligence. In addition we will also consider [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#How_do_Experts_Solve_Problems|how experts do solve problems]] and finally we will have a closer look at two topics: The [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Neurophysiological_Background|neurophysiological background]] on the one hand and the question what kind of role can be assigned to [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#The_Evolutionary_Perspective|evolution]] regarding problem solving on the other.
이 장의 앞부분에서 심리학자들이 무엇을 문제로 여기는지 짧게 설명할 것이다. 다음에는 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Restructuring_-_The_Gestalt_Approach|게슈탈트 심리학자]]로 시작해서 인공지능과 연결되는 현대의 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Problem_Solving_as_a_Search_Problem|탐색 전략]]까지, 문제해결을 향한 여러가지 접근들을 살펴볼 것이다. 그 외에도 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#How_do_Experts_Solve_Problems|전문가들은 어떻게 문제를 해결하는지]] 생각해볼 것이고, 최종적으로는 2가지 주제에 대해 자세히 살펴볼 것인데, 하나는 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Neurophysiological_Background|신경생리학적 배경]]이고, 다른 하나는 문제해결의 관점에서 [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#The_Evolutionary_Perspective|진화]]에 무슨 역할이 부여될 수 있는지에 대한 질문이다.

The most basic definition is “A problem is any given situation that differs from a desired goal”. This definition is very useful for discussing problem solving in terms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution evolutionary] adaptation, as it allows to understand every aspect of (human or animal) life as a problem. This includes issues like finding food in harsh winters, remembering where you left your provisions, making decisions about which way to go, learning, repeating and varying all kinds of complex movements, and so on. Though all these problems were of crucial importance during the evolutionary process that created us the way we are, they are by no means solved exclusively by humans. We find a most amazing variety of different solutions for these problems in nature (just consider, e.g., by which means a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#Anatomy bat] hunts its prey, compared to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Predatory_techniques spider]). For this essay we will mainly focus on those problems that are not solved by animals or evolution, that is, all kinds of abstract problems (e.g. playing chess). Furthermore, we will not consider those situations as problems that have an obvious solution: Imagine Knut decides to take a sip of coffee from the mug next to his right hand. He does not even have to think about how to do this. This is not because the situation itself is trivial (a robot capable of recognising the mug, deciding whether it is full, then grabbing it and moving it to Knut’s mouth would be a highly complex machine) but because in the context of all possible situations it is so trivial that it no longer is a problem our consciousness needs to be bothered with. The problems we will discuss in the following all need some conscious effort, though some seem to be solved without us being able to say how exactly we got to the solution. Still we will find that often the strategies we use to solve these problems are applicable to more basic problems, too.
문제에 대한 가장 기본적인 정의는 &quot;원하는 목표와는 다른 현재 상황&quot;이다. 이 정의는 사람이나 동물의 삶의 모든 측면을 문제로 이해할 수 있게 해주기 때문에, 문제해결을 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution 진화적] 적응의 면에서 논의하기에 아주 유용하다. 여기에는 추운 겨울에 음식을 찾거나, 어디에 식량을 두었는지 기억하거나, 어떤 길로 갈지 결정하고, 모든 종류의 복잡한 운동을 배우고, 반복하고, 바꾸는 등의 일들이 포함된다. 이런 모든 문제들은 인간의 모습을 만든 진화적 과정 동안 결정적인 중요성을 갖고 있었지만, 결코 인간만이 이런 문제들을 해결한다고 볼 수는 없다. 자연에서는 문제를 해결하는 방법들에 대한 가장 놀라운 다양성을 볼 수 있다([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#Anatomy 박쥐]와, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Predatory_techniques 거미]의 사냥법의 차이에 대해서 생각해보라). 이 글에서는 동물이나 진화는 잘 해결하려고 하지 않는 문제, 즉 체스를 두는 등의 추상적 문제에 주로 초점을 맞출 것이다. 더 나아가 우리는 이런 상황을 명확한 해법이 있는 문제로 보지 않을 것이다.(?) 크누트씨가 오른손으로 머그잔을 잡아 커피 한 모금을 마시려고 했다고 하자.(?) 그는 어떻게 하는지 생각할 필요조차 없다. 이것은 상황 그 자체가 시시하기 때문이 아니라(머그잔을 인식하고, 가득차있는지 확인하고, 크누트씨의 입으로 옮기는 로봇은 매우 복잡한 기계가 될 것이다), 가능한 모든 상황의 맥락에서 시시해지기 때문에 더 이상 의식이 신경써야할 문제가 아니기 때문이다. 다음에서 논의할 문제들은 모두 의식적인 노력을 필요로 하는 것이다. 어떤 것은 어떻게 풀었는지 설명을 못하면서 풀리긴 하지만 말이다. 또 우리가 이런 문제를 풀 때 쓰이는 전략들이 더 기본적인 문제들에 적용될 수 있는 경우가 많다는 것도 볼 수 있을 것이다.

Non-trivial, abstract problems can be divided into two groups:
시시하지 않고, 추상적인 문제는 두 가지로 분류할 수 있다.

===잘 정의된 문제===
For many abstract problems it is possible to find an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm algorithmic] solution. We call all those problems well-defined that can be properly formalised, which comes along with the following properties:
많은 추상적 문제는 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm 알고리즘적] 해법을 찾아서 푸는 것이 가능하다. 이런 문제를 제대로 형식화될 수 있도록 잘 정의된 문제라고 부르는데, 다음과 같은 특성과 함께 나타난다.

*        The problem has a clearly defined given state. This might be the line-up of a chess game, a given formula you have to solve, or the set-up of the towers of Hanoi game (which we will [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis|discuss later]]).
명확하게 정의된 현재 상태가 주어져 있다. 이것은 체스 말의 정렬일 수도 있고, 풀어야하는 공식일 수도 있고, 하노이의 탑([[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis|나중에]] 논의하게 되겠지만)의 판 배열일 수도 있다.

*        There is a finite set of operators, that is, of rules you may apply to the given state. For the chess game, e.g.,  these would be the rules that tell you which piece you may move to which position.
유한한 연산자의 집합, 즉 주어진 상태에 적용할 수 있는 규칙의 집합이 있다. 체스를 예로 들자면, 어느 말을 어느 위치로 옮길 수 있는지 같은 규칙이 될 것이다.

*        Finally, the problem has a clear goal state: The equations is resolved to x, all discs are moved to the right stack, or the other player is in checkmate.
마지막으로, 명확한 목표 상태가 있다. 방정식의 x가 풀렸거나, 모든 판이 오른쪽 기둥에 옮겨졌거나, 상대방을 체크메이트시킨 상태가 될 것이다.

Not surprisingly, a problem that fulfils these requirements can be implemented algorithmically (also see [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Convergent_Thinking|convergent thinking]]). Therefore many well-defined problems can be very effectively solved by computers, like playing chess.
놀랄 것도 없이, 이러한 조건을 충족하는 문제들은 알고리즘으로 실행될 수 있다([[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Convergent_Thinking|수렴적 사고]]를 참고). 따라서 많은 잘 정의된 문제는 체스를 두는 것처럼 컴퓨터에 의해 아주 효과적으로 해결될 수 있다.

===잘 정의되지 않은 문제===
Though many problems can be properly formalised (sometimes only if we accept an enormous complexity) there are still others where this is not the case. Good examples for this are all kinds of tasks that involve [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity creativity], and, generally speaking, all problems for which it is not possible to clearly define a given state and a goal state: Formalising a problem of the kind “Please paint a beautiful picture” may be impossible. Still this is a problem most people would be able to access in one way or the other, even if the result may be totally different from person to person. And while Knut might judge that picture X is gorgeous, you might completely disagree.
많은 문제가 제대로 형식화 될 수 있지만(어떤 때는 엄청난 복잡성을 수용할 때만 그렇지만), 그렇지 않은 문제도 있다. 이것의 좋은 예는 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity 창의성]이 필요한 종류의 작업들이고, 일반적으로 말하면, 현재 상태와 목표 상태를 명확하게 정의하는게 불가능한 모든 문제를 가리킨다. 예를 들어 &quot;아름다운 그림을 그려주세요&quot;와 같은 문제를 형식화하는 것은 아마도 불가능할 것이다. 하지만 사람에 따라 완전히 다른 결과가 나올 수 있긴 해도 이것은 대부분의 사람이 한 가지 혹은 다른 방식으로 접근할 수 있는 문제다. 그리고 크누트씨가 X라는 그림이 아주 멋지다고 판단할 때, 당신은 완전히 반대로 느낄 수도 있다.

Nevertheless ill-defined problems often involve sub-problems that can be totally well-defined. On the other hand, many every-day problems that seem to be completely well-defined involve- when examined in detail- a big deal of creativity and ambiguities.
그럼에도 불구하고 잘 정의되지 않은 문제는 완전히 잘 정의된 하위문제를 포함하고 있을 때가 많다. 한편으로는, 완전히 잘 정의된 일상생활의 문제들이 고도의 창의성과 모호함을 포함하고 있는 경우도 많다.

If we think of Knut's fairly ill-defined task of writing an essay, he will not be able to complete this task without first understanding the text he has to write about. This step is the first subgoal Knut has to solve. Interestingly, ill-defined problems often involve subproblems that are well-defined.
리포트를 쓰는, 크누트씨의 별로 잘 정의되지 않은 작업에 대해서 생각한다면, 먼저 그가 써야하는 주제의 글을 이해하지 않고서는 과제를 끝낼 수 없을 것라고 할 수 있다. 이 단계는 크누트씨가 해결해야할 첫번째 하위목표다. 흥미롭게도, 잘 정의되지 않은 문제는 잘 정의된 하위문제를 포함하는 경우가 많다.

==재구조화 - 형태주의적 접근==

One dominant approach to Problem Solving originated from [[wikipedia:Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] in the 1920s. Their understanding of problem solving emphasises behaviour in situations requiring relatively novel means of attaining goals and suggests that problem solving involves a process called restructuring. Since this indicates a perceptual approach, two main questions have to be considered:
*How is a problem represented in a person's mind?
*How does solving this problem involve a reorganisation or restructuring of this representation?
This is what we are going to do in the following part of this section.
문제 해결에 대한 한 가지 지배적인 접근은 1920년대의 [[wikipedia:Gestalt psychology|게슈탈트 심리학자]]들로부터 유래했다. 문제 해결에 대한 그들의 이해방식은 목표달성을 위해 상대적으로 참신한 수단을 요구하는 상황에서의 행동을 강조하며, 문제 해결이 재구조화라고 하는 과정을 포함한다고 제안한다. 이것이 지각적인 접근을 가리키기 떄문에, 두 가지 주요 질문이 제기된다.
*문제가 사람의 마음에 어떻게 표상되는가?
*그 문제를 해결하는 것이 이 표상의 재조직화나 재구조화를 어떤 식으로 포함하는가?

===문제는 마음에 어떻게 표상되는가?===

In current research internal and external representations are distinguished: The first kind is regarded as the [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Knowledge|knowledge]] and structure of [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory|memory]], while the latter type is defined as the knowledge and structure of the environment, such like physical objects or symbols whose information can be picked up and processed by the perceptual system autonomously. On the contrary the information in internal representations has to be retrieved by cognitive processes. 
현재 이뤄지고 있는 연구에서는 내적인 표상과 외적인 표상을 구분하고 있다. 전자는 [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Knowledge|지식]] 그리고 [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory|기억]]의 구조로 간주되는 반면에, 후자는 환경에 대한 지식과 구조로 정의된다.

Generally speaking, problem representations are [[wikipedia:Mental model|models]] of the situation as experienced by the agent. Representing a problem means to analyse it and split it into separate components:
*objects, predicates
*state space
*operators
*selection criteria
Therefore the efficiency of Problem Solving depends on the underlying representations in a person’s mind, which usually also involves personal aspects.
Analysing the problem domain according to different dimensions, i.e., changing from one representation to another, results in arriving at a new understanding of a problem. This is basically what is described as restructuring.
The following example illustrates this:

:Two boys of different age are playing badminton. The older one is a more skilled player, and therefore it is predictable for the outcome of usual matches who will be the winner. After some time and several defeats the younger boy finally loses interest in playing, and the older boy faces a problem, namely that he has no one to play with anymore.
:The usual options, according to M. Wertheimer (1945/82), at this point of the story range from 'offering candy' and 'playing another game' to 'not playing to full ability' and 'shaming the younger boy into playing'. All those strategies aim at making the younger stay.
:And this is what the older boy comes up with: He proposes that they should try to keep the bird in play as long as possible. Thus they change from a game of competition to one of cooperation. They'd start with easy shots and make them harder as their success increases, counting the number of consecutive hits. The proposal is happily accepted and the game is on again.

The key in this story is that the older boy ''restructured'' the problem and found out that he used an attitude towards the younger which made it difficult to keep him playing. With the new type of game the problem is solved: the older is not bored, the younger not frustrated. 

Possibly, new representations can make a problem more difficult or much easier to solve. To the latter case [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Insight|insight]]– the sudden realisation of a problem’s solution – seems to be related.

===통찰===

There are two very different ways of approaching a ''goal-oriented situation''. In one case an organism readily ''reproduces'' the response to the given problem from past experience. This is called '''reproductive thinking'''.

The second way requires ''something new and different'' to achieve the goal, prior learning is of little help here. Such '''productive thinking''' is (sometimes) argued to involve '''insight'''. Gestalt psychologists even state that insight problems are a separate category of problems in their own right.

Tasks that might involve insight usually have certain features - they require something new and non-obvious to be done and in most cases they are difficult enough to predict that the initial solution attempt will be unsuccessful. When you solve a problem of this kind you often have a so called '''&quot;AHA-experience&quot;''' - the solution pops up all of a sudden. At one time you do not have any ideas of  the answer to the problem, you do not even feel to make any progress trying out different ideas, but in the next second the problem is solved.

For all those readers who would like to experience such an effect, here is an example for an Insight Problem: Knut is given four pieces of a chain; each made up of three links. The task is to link it all up to a closed loop and he has only 15 cents. To open a link costs 2, to close a link costs 3 cents. What should Knut do? 

[[Image:chain solved.svg|thumbnail=chain_task.svg|center|If you want to know the correct solution, click to enlarge the image.]]

To show that solving insight problems involves ''restructuring'', psychologists created a number of problems that were more difficult to solve for participants provided with previous experiences, since it was harder for them to change the representation of the given situation (see [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Fixation|Fixation]]). Sometimes  given hints may lead to the insight required to solve the problem. And this is also true for involuntarily given ones. For instance it might help you to solve a memory game if someone accidentally drops a card on the floor and you look at the other side. Although such help is not obviously a hint, the effect does not differ from that of intended help. 

For ''non-insight'' problems the opposite is the case. Solving arithmetical problems, for instance, requires [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Schema|schemas]], through which one can get to the solution step by step.

===고착화===

Sometimes, previous experience or familiarity can even make problem solving more difficult. This is the case whenever habitual directions get in the way of finding new directions – an effect called '''fixation'''.

====기능적 고착====

Functional fixedness concerns the solution of ''object-use problems''. The basic idea is that when the usual way of using an object is emphasised, it will be far more difficult for a person to use that object in a novel manner. An example for this effect is the '''candle problem''': Imagine you are given a box of matches, some candles and tacks. On the wall of the room there is a cork-board. Your task is to fix the candle to the cork-board in such a way that no wax will drop on the floor when the candle is lit. – Got an idea?

[[image:Candle solved.svg|thumbnail=Candle_task.svg|center|The candle task]]

:Explanation: The clue is just the following: when people are confronted with a problem and given certain objects to solve it, it is difficult for them to figure out that they could use them in a different (not so familiar or obvious) way. In this example the box has to be recognised as a support rather than as a container.

A further example is the '''two-string problem''': Knut is left in a room with a chair and a pair of pliers given the task to bind two strings together that are hanging from the ceiling. The problem he faces is that he can never reach both strings at a time because they are just too far away from each other. What can Knut do?

[[image:Two string.png|400px|center]]

:Solution: Knut has to recognise he can use the pliers in a novel function – as weight for a pendulum. He can bind them to one of the :strings, push it away, hold the other string and just wait for the first one moving towards him. If necessary, Knut can even climb on the chair, but he is not that small, we suppose . . .

====정신적 고착====

Functional fixedness as involved in the examples above illustrates a '''mental set''' - a person’s tendency to respond to a given task in a manner based on past experience. Because Knut maps an object to a particular function he has difficulties to ''vary the way of use'' (pliers as pendulum's weight).

One approach to studying fixation was to study ''wrong-answer verbal insight problems''. It was shown that people tend to give rather an incorrect answer when failing to solve a problem than to give no answer at all.
:A typical example: People are told that on a lake the area covered by water lilies doubles every 24 hours and that it takes 60 days to cover the whole lake. Then they are asked how many days it takes to cover half the lake. The typical response is '30 days' (whereas 59 days is correct).

These wrong solutions are due to an ''inaccurate interpretation'', hence ''representation'', of the problem. This can happen because of ''sloppiness'' (a quick shallow reading of the problem and/or weak monitoring of their efforts made to come to a solution). In this case error feedback should help people to reconsider the problem features, note the inadequacy of their first answer, and find the correct solution. If, however, people are truly fixated on their incorrect representation, being told the answer is wrong does not help. In a study made by P.I. Dallop and R.L. Dominowski in 1992 these two possibilities were contrasted. In approximately one third of the cases ''error feedback'' led to right answers, so only approximately one third of the wrong answers were due to ''inadequate monitoring''.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Dominowski and P. Dallob, Insight and Problem Solving. In The Nature of Insight, R.J. Sternberg &amp; J.E. Davidson (Eds). MIT Press: USA, pp.33-62 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is the study of examples with and without a preceding [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Analogies|analogous]] task. In cases such like the '''water-jug task''' analogous thinking indeed leads to a correct solution, but to take a different way might make the case much simpler:
:Imagine Knut again, this time he is given three jugs with different capacities and is asked to measure the required amount of water. :Of course he is not allowed to use anything despite the jugs and as much water as he likes. In the first case the sizes are: 127 litres, 21 litres and 3 litres while 100 litres are desired.

:In the second case Knut is asked to measure 18 litres from jugs of 39, 15 and three litres size.
In fact participants faced with the 100 litre task first choose a complicate way in order to solve the second one. Others on the contrary who did not know about that complex task solved the 18 litre case by just adding three litres to 15.

==탐색으로서의 문제해결==
The idea of regarding problem solving as a search problem originated from Alan Newell and Herbert Simon while trying to design computer programs which could solve certain problems. This led them to develop a program called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver General Problem Solver] which was able to solve any well-defined problem by creating heuristics on the basis of the user's input. This input consisted of objects and operations that could be done on them.

As we already know, every problem is composed of an initial state, intermediate states and a goal state (also: desired or final state), while the initial and goal states characterise the situations before and after solving the problem. The intermediate states describe any possible situation between initial and goal state. The set of operators builds up the transitions between the states. A solution is defined as the sequence of operators which leads from the initial state across intermediate states to the goal state.

The simplest method to solve a problem, defined in these terms, is to search for a solution by just trying one possibility after another (also called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error trial and error]).

As already mentioned above, an organised search, following a specific strategy, might not be helpful for finding a solution to some ill-defined problem, since it is impossible to formalise such problems in a way that a search algorithm can find a solution.

As an example we could just take Knut and his essay: he has to find out about his own opinion and formulate it and he has to make sure he understands the sources texts. But there are no predefined operators he can use, there is no panacea how to get to an opinion and even not how to write it down.

===수단-목표 분석===

In Means-End Analysis you try to reduce the difference between initial state and goal state by creating subgoals until a subgoal can be reached directly (probably you know several examples of recursion which works on the basis of this).
 

An example for a problem that can be solved by Means-End Analysis are the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_hanoi „Towers of Hanoi“]:

Towers of Hanoi - A well defined problem

 

The initial state of this problem is described by the different sized discs being stacked in order of size on the first of three pegs (the “start-peg“). The goal state is described by these discs being stacked on the third pegs (the “end-peg“) in exactly the same order.

[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|center]]

There are three operators:
* You are allowed to move one single disc from one peg to another one
* You are only able to move a disc if it is on top of one stack
* A disc cannot be put onto a smaller one.

[[Image:ToH.PNG|center]]

In order to use Means-End Analysis we have to create subgoals. One possible way of doing this is described in the picture:

1.   Moving the discs lying on the biggest one onto the second peg.  

2.   Shifting the biggest disc to the third peg.  

3.   Moving the other ones onto the third peg, too  

You can apply this strategy again and again in order to reduce the problem to the case where you only have to move a single disc – which is then something you are allowed to do. 

Strategies of this kind can easily be formulated for a computer; the respective algorithm for the Towers of Hanoi would look like this:

1.   move n-1 discs from A to B

2.   move disc #n from A to C

3.   move n-1 discs from B to C

where n is the total number of discs, A is the first peg, B the second, C the third one.
Now the problem is reduced by one with each recursive loop.
 
Means-end analysis is important to solve everyday-problems - like getting the right train connection:
You have to figure out where you catch the first train and where you want to arrive, first of all. Then you have to look for possible changes just in case you do not get a direct connection. Third, you have to figure out what are the best times of departure and arrival, on which platforms you leave and arrive and make it all fit together.

===유추===

Analogies describe similar structures and interconnect them to clarify and explain certain relations. In a recent study, for example, a song that got stuck in your head is compared to an itching of the brain that can only be scratched by repeating the song over and over again.

===유추를 이용한 재구조화===

One special kind of restructuring, the way already mentioned during the discussion of the Gestalt approach, is analogical problem solving. Here, to find a solution to one problem - the so called target problem, an analogous solution to another problem - the source problem, is presented.

An example for this kind of strategy is the radiation problem posed by K. Duncker in 1945:

As a doctor you have to treat a patient with a malignant, inoperable tumour, buried deep inside the body. There exists a special kind of ray, which is perfectly harmless at a low intensity, but at the sufficient high intensity is able to destroy the tumour - as well as the healthy tissue on his way to it. What can be done to avoid the latter?

When this question was asked to participants in an experiment, most of them couldn't come up with the appropriate answer to the problem. Then they were told a story that went something like this:

A General wanted to capture his enemy's fortress. He gathered a large army to launch a full-scale direct attack, but then learned, that all the roads leading directly towards the fortress were blocked by mines. These roadblocks were designed in such a way, that it was possible for small groups of the fortress-owner's men to pass them safely, but every large group of men would initially set them off. Now the General figured out the following plan: He divided his troops into several smaller groups and made each of them march down a different road, timed in such a way, that the entire army would reunite exactly when reaching the fortress and could hit with full strength.

Here, the story about the General is the source problem, and the radiation problem is the target problem. The fortress is analogous to the tumour and the big army corresponds to the highly intensive ray. Consequently a small group of soldiers represents a ray at low intensity. The solution to the problem is to split the ray up, as the general did with his army, and send the now harmless rays towards the tumour from different angles in such a way that they all meet when reaching it. No healthy tissue is damaged but the tumour itself gets destroyed by the ray at its full intensity.

M. Gick and K. Holyoak presented Duncker's radiation problem to a group of participants in 1980 and 1983. Only 10 percent of them were able to solve the problem right away, 30 percent could solve it when they read the story of the general before. After given an additional hint - to use the story as help - 75 percent of them solved the problem.

With this results, Gick and Holyoak concluded, that analogical problem solving depends on three steps:

1. '''Noticing''' that an analogical connection exists between the source and the target problem.&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Mapping''' corresponding parts of the two problems onto each other (fortress → tumour, army → ray, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''Applying''' the mapping to generate a parallel solution to the target problem (using little groups of soldiers approaching from different directions → sending several weaker rays from different directions)

Next, Gick and Holyoak started looking for factors that could be helpful for the noticing and the mapping parts, for example:

Discovering the basic linking concept behind the source and the target problem.

'''--&gt;picture coming soon&lt;--'''

====스키마====

The concept that links the target problem with the analogy (the “source problem“) is called problem schema. Gick and Holyoak obtained the activation of a schema on their participants by giving them two stories and asking them to compare and summarise them. This activation of problem schemata is called “schema induction“.

The two presented texts were picked out of six stories which describe analogical problems and their solution. One of these stories was &quot;The General&quot; (remember example in [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Analogies|Chapter 4.1]]).

After solving the task the participants were asked to solve the radiation problem (see chapter 4.2). The experiment showed that in order to solve the target problem reading of two stories with analogical problems is more helpful than reading only one story:
After reading two stories 52% of the participants were able to solve the radiation problem (As told in chapter 4.2 only 30% were able to solve it after reading only one story, namely: “The General“).

Gick and Holyoak found out that the quality of the schema a participant developed differs. They classified them into three groups:
*Good schemata: In good schemata it was recognised that the same concept was used in order to solve the problem (21% of the participants created a good schema and 91% of them were able to solve the radiation problem).
*Intermediate schemata: The creator of an intermediate schema has figured out that the root of the matter equals (here: many small forces solved the problem). (20% created one, 40% of them had the right solution).
*Poor schemata: The poor schemata were hardly related to the target problem. In many poor schemata the participant only detected that the hero of the story was rewarded for his efforts (59% created one, 30% of them had the right solution).

The process of using a schema or analogy, i.e. applying it to a novel situation is called transduction. One can use a common strategy to solve problems of a new kind.

To create a good schema and finally get to a solution is a problem-solving skill that requires practise and some background knowledge.

==전문가는 어떻게 문제를 해결하는가?==
With the term expert we describe someone who devotes large amounts of his or her time and energy to one specific field of interest in which he, subsequently, reaches a certain level of mastery. It should not be of surprise that experts tend to be better in solving problems in their field than novices (people who are beginners or not as well trained in a field as experts) are. They are faster in coming up with solutions and have a higher success rate of right solutions. But what is the difference between the way experts and non-experts solve problems? Research on the nature of expertise has come up with the following conclusions:

:Experts know more about their field,
:their knowledge is organised differently, and
:they spend more time analysing the problem.

When it comes to problems that are situated outside the experts' field, their performance often does not differ from that of novices.
 
'''Knowledge:'''
An experiment by Chase and Simon (1973a, b) dealt with the question how well experts and novices are able to reproduce positions of chess pieces on chessboards when these are presented to them only briefly. The results showed that experts were far better in reproducing actual game positions, but that their performance was comparable with that of novices when the chess pieces were arranged randomly on the board. Chase and Simon concluded that the superior performance on actual game positions was due to the ability to recognise familiar patterns: A chess expert has up to 50,000 patterns stored in his memory. In comparison, a good player might know about 1,000 patterns by heart and a novice only few to none at all.
This very detailed knowledge is of crucial help when an expert is confronted with a new problem in his field. Still, it is not pure size of knowledge that makes an expert more successful. Experts also organise their knowledge quite differently from novices.

'''Organisation:'''
In 1982 M. Chi and her co-workers took a set of 24 physics problems and presented them to a group of physics professors as well as to a group of students with only one semester of physics. The task was to group the problems based on their similarities.
As it turned out the students tended to group the problems based on their surface structure (similarities of objects used in the problem, e.g. on sketches illustrating the problem), whereas the professors used their deep structure (the general physical principles that underlay the problems) as criteria.
By recognising the actual structure of a problem experts are able to connect the given task to the relevant knowledge they already have (e.g. another problem they solved earlier which required the same strategy).

'''Analysis:'''
Experts often spend more time analysing a problem before actually trying to solve it. This way of approaching a problem may often result in what appears to be a slow start, but in the long run this strategy is much more effective. A novice, on the other hand, might start working on the problem right away, but often has to realise that he reaches dead ends as he chose a wrong path in the very beginning.

==창의적 인지==
We already introduced a lot of ways to solve a problem, mainly strategies that can be used to find the “correct” answer. But there are also problems which do not require a “right answer” to be given - It is time for creative productiveness!

Imagine you are given three objects – your task is to invent a completely new object that is related to nothing you know. Then try to describe its function and how it could additionally be used. Difficult? Well, you are free to think creatively and will not be at risk to give an incorrect answer. For example think of what can be constructed from a half-sphere, wire and a handle. The result is amazing: a lawn lounger, global earrings, a sled, a water weigher, a portable agitator, ...

===발산적 사고===
The term divergent thinking describes a way of thinking that does not lead to one goal, but is open-ended. Problems that are solved this way can have a large number of potential 'solutions' of which none is exactly 'right' or 'wrong', though some might be more suitable than others.  

Solving a problem like this involves indirect and productive thinking and is mostly very helpful when somebody faces an [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Ill-defined_Problems|ill-defined]]problem, i.e. when either initial state or goal state cannot be stated clearly and operators or either insufficient or not given at all. 

The process of divergent thinking is often associated with creativity, and it undoubtedly leads to many creative ideas. Nevertheless, researches have shown that there is only modest correlation between performance on divergent thinking tasks and other measures of creativity.
Additionally it was found that in processes resulting in original and practical inventions things like searching for solutions, being aware of structures and looking for analogies are heavily involved, too.

Thus, divergent thinking alone is not an appropriate tool for making an invention. You also need to analyse the problem in order to make the suggested, i.e. invention, solution appropriate.

===수렴적 사고===
Divergent can be contrasted by convergent thinking - thinking that seeks to find the correct answer to a specific problem. This is an adequate strategy for solving most of the [[Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_Solving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Well-defined_Problems|well-defined]] problems (problems with given initial state, operators and goal state) we presented so far. To solve the given tasks it was necessary to think directly or reproductively.

It is always helpful to use a strategy to think of a way to come closer to the solution, perhaps using knowledge from previous tasks or sudden insight.

==신경생리학적 배경==
Presenting Neurophysiology in its entirety would be enough to fill several books. Fortunately we do not have to concern ourselves with most of these facts. Instead, let's just focus on the aspects that are really relevant to problem solving. Nevertheless this topic is quite complex and problem solving cannot be attributed to one single brain area. Rather there are systems of several brain areas working together to perform a specific task. This is best shown by an example:

:In 1994 Paolo Nichelli and coworkers used the method of PET (Positron Emission Tomography), to localise certain brain areas, which are involved in solving various chess problems. In the following table you can see which brain area was active during a specific task:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Task 
! Location of Brain activity
|- 
|
* Identifying chess pieces

* determining location of pieces
     
 
* Thinking about making a move
     
* Remembering a pieces move
  
      
* Planning and executing strategies
|
* Pathway from Occipital to Temporal Lobe
(also called the &quot;what&quot;-pathway of visual processing)
* Pathway from Occipital to parietal Lobe
(also called the &quot;where&quot;-pathway of visual processing)
* Premotor area

* Hippocampus
(forming new memories)
* Prefrontal cortex
|}

[[Image:Lobes of the brain.svg‎|framed|center|Lobes of the Brain]]

One of the key tasks, namely '''planning and executing strategies''', is performed by a brain area which also plays an important role for several other tasks correlated with problem solving - [[wikipedia:Prefrontal cortex|the prefrontal cortex (PFC)]]. This can be made clear if you take a look at several examples of damages to the PFC and their effects on the ability to solve problems.&lt;br&gt;
Patients with a '''lesion''' in this brain area have difficulty switching from one behaviouristic pattern to another. A well known example is the [[wikipedia:Wisconsin card sort|wisconsin card-sorting task]]. A patient with a PFC lesion who is told to separate all blue cards from a deck, would continue sorting out the blue ones, even if the experimenter told him to sort out all brown cards. Transferred to a more complex problem, this person would most likely fail, because he is not flexible enough to change his strategy after running into a '''dead end'''.&lt;br&gt;
Another example is the one of a young homemaker, who had a tumour in the frontal lobe. Even though she was able to cook individual dishes, preparing a whole family meal was an infeasible task for her.

As the examples above illustrate, the structure of our brain seems to be of great importance regarding problem solving, i.e. cognitive life. But how was our cognitive apparatus designed? How did perception-action integration as a central species specific property come about?

==진화적 관점==
[[wikipedia:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]] developed the [[wikipedia:Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theory]] which was primarily meant to explain why there are so many different kinds of species. This theory is also important for psychology because it explains how species were ''designed'' by evolutionary forces and what their goals are. By knowing the goals of species it is possible to explain and predict their behaviour.

The process of evolution involves several components, for instance ''[[wikipedia:Natural selection|natural selection]]'' - which is a feedback process that 'chooses' among 'alternative designs' on the basis of deciding how good the respective modulation is. As a result of this natural selection we find [[wikipedia:Adaption|adaption]]. This is a process that constantly tests the variations among individuals in relation to the environment. If adaptions are useful they get passed on; if not they’ll just be an unimportant variation.

Another component of the evolutionary process is sexual selection, i.e. increasing of certain sex characteristics, which give individuals the ability to rival with other individuals of the same sex or an increased ability to attract individuals of the opposite sex.

[[wikipedia:Altruism|Altruism]] is a further component of the evolutionary process, which will be explained in more detail in the following chapter [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions|Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions]].

==요약 및 결론==

After Knut read this WikiChapter he was relieved that he did not waste his time for the essay – quite the opposite! He now has a new view on problem solving - and recognises his problem as a well-defined one:          

His initial state was the clear blank paper without any philosophical sentences on it. The goal state was just in front of his mind's eye: Him – grinning broadly – handing in the essay with some carefully developed arguments.
 

He decides to use the technique of Means-End Analysis and creates several subgoals:

:1. Read important passages again
:2. Summarise parts of the text
:3. Develop an argumentative structure
:4. Write the essay
:5. Look for typos

Right after he hands in his essay Knut will go on reading this WikiBook.
He now looks forward to turning the page over and to discovering the [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions|next chapter...]]

'''The Vrinda project Documentary'''&lt;br /&gt;

It's the story of a travel. From Europe, we went to Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and South America, to cover projects of international cooperation.&lt;br /&gt;

From the original topic assigned to us, the MDG programme, we went on to search why mainstream media finds it so difficult to cover activities of peacebuilding.&lt;br /&gt;

We collected stories on the work in progress for reducing extreme poverty, promoting basic education, empowering women, reducing the child mortality, improving maternal health, fighting against epidemics, protecting the environment, and promoting fair relationship amongst nations.&lt;br /&gt;

We shared these stories on the Internet but we wanted them to be broadcast on television. So, we interviewed policy makers and we shared with them  the story of our effort to narrate how different people are rediscovering their own values by learning to appreciate the values of others.&lt;br /&gt;

It was a difficult journey. We had to overcome media stereotypes of “bad news is news that sells”. We had to bring on board editors that are usually keen on aligning with established prejudices among public, because they sell audiences to advertisers, not awareness to audiences.&lt;br /&gt;
We had to redefine communication as something that isn’t an exchange of preconceived notions but is a new creation that breaks the isolation of people, enables &quot;participation&quot; and builds a sense of &quot;community&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

In this journey, what we really learned was that development cannot be &quot;given&quot; in the same way that education cannot be “delivered” and participation cannot be “bought”. We learned that development is a process that requires communication and cooperation; that this is possible only as far as counterparts act in a reciprocally empowering manner, because they recognize that, in order to fully realize themselves, they need the self-realization of the others.&lt;br /&gt;

Now, we would like to share this journey with you; because this is where we wanted to arrive when we started it.

The video footage collected in &quot;The Vrinda Project&quot; and integrated in the online Development Cooperation Handbook on the Wiki has also been edited to produce an 8-episode documentary meant for television broadcasting. Even if the documentary uses the same video resources that are available in the Handbook, it is altogether a different creation that is meant for the public. It is an effort to bring the development cooperation themes closer to the public. The dialogic approach used in the documentary enables an easier understanding of global human development issues. The fact that it has been narrated by a team of experts from different cultural contexts where all opinions are represented makes this documentary a product that is beyond specific national and cultural delimitation. By framing the whole documentary into a single adventure story, it has been possible to present the MDG thematic in a live and joyful manner. The documentary is a celebration of a cooperating world, of civilizations in dialogue, of evolving traditions in transformation, countries in cooperation. As such , it stands against the certain tendencies of global media to prioritise conflicts, fears and mistrust among peoples. The editorial work is recently completed and we will propose its broadcast to all the countries that have undersigned the MDGs. But since the Kautilya Society is based in India and there are many powerful Indian stories of cooperation and commitment, our greatest desire is that the first broadcasting is done by the Indian public television.


We have woven the story as we jump (with flash-forwards and flash-backs) from what we call the &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories|front-stage scenes]]&quot; that narrate the projects stories and the &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary/Backstage scenes|backstage scenes]]&quot;, i.e. the recording of the TVP team at work and the dialogues among team members.  The &quot;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories|front-stage scenes]]&quot; narrate what the team has seen. The [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary/Backstage scenes|backstage scenes]] reveal the &quot;interpretations&quot; and the work done for integrating the diverse viewpoints collected on the ground.
Besides giving a plot to the various independent stories and opinions of experts, putting &quot;us&quot; in the story removes the typical journalist pretentiousness of being &quot;objective&quot;; and since the team members belong to different cultural contexts, their dialogue enables the articulation of different cultural viewpoints. So, the viewers from different parts of the world will find that they are not only the &quot;observed ones&quot; but also &quot;the observers&quot;.  And enables us to broadcast, without major editorial changes, the same product in the different countries which have been partners of the global effort to achieve the MDGs.

The work is in progress and we have been uploading on Youtube the first cuts and the draft episodes. [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]   ⇒  [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzY9kTw5ufls2Y-VTAV6D30uD_DXrzBZ episodes].  Thanks to the feedback from the network of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/How you can participate to TVP|contributors]], we have received new ideas for  improving the episodes and we have now customized the documentary for specific target audiences. &lt;br /&gt;

In the editorial process of the documentary, we have been proceeding along three different editorial structures:
#  The main editorial line has been moving along the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Introduction to the Millennium Development Goals|8 MDGs]] In the 8 episodes, we included the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories|&quot;stories&quot;]] pertaining to the specific Millennium Goal. [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]  ⇒  [http://www.youtube.com/user/eugadproject/videos?shelf_id=19&amp;view=50&amp;sort=dd The stories related  to the specific  MDGs]&lt;br /&gt;
#  Along with the 8 MDGs subdivision we included for each episode one of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Issues|development issues]] into which we organized the arguments brought forward by the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Testimonials|testimonials]]  [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]  ⇒  [http://www.youtube.com/user/eugadproject/videos?shelf_index=2&amp;view=50&amp;sort=dd The development Cooperation Issues]. This in order to create a dynamic interaction between the specific projects, that are implemented &quot;at the grass-roots level&quot;, and the general debate, taking place among international institutions and the global media.&lt;br /&gt;
#  The third  editorial line instead proceeds along ⇒  [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook/The Documentary Story|the story of our project]] as it unfolds and as team encounters project challenges.  &lt;br /&gt;

*&lt;small&gt;to focus on the challenges and stakes of the Global Agenda for Development&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to analyse the challenges of implementing Development Cooperation Programmes: &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 

::*&lt;small&gt;the effort in progress; and&lt;/small&gt;

*&lt;small&gt;to explore factors that facilitate or contrast global partnerships for development.&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to illustrate the people, institutions and organizations working for the Global Agenda for Development: &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 
::*&lt;small&gt;portraying their stories,&lt;/small&gt;

::*&lt;small&gt; analyzing if their work really benefits target populations and impacts on wider social contexts;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to show ways in which people in richer countries are involved in raising funds and other resources for people of developing nations and in what sense this also benefits the developed countries;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to investigate how work undertaken in international cooperation affects national and international policies and impacts the communication climate amongst nations;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to show how media covers (or does not cover) Cooperation Programmes;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to show how artists and educators relate to global partnerships for development; to see how writers, actors, directors, artists, musicians and other artists take part in the Global Agenda for Development;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to challenge pre-suppositions that most development aid is wasted and that there is little accountability in the way development projects are managed;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to verify the presupposition that most development is sponsored by Western Nations;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to understand how far the local and the global dimensions of sustainable development are interlinked;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to investigate whether lessons learned in international cooperation activities are used to inform national projects and policies, both in developed and developing countries;&lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to compare the aptitudes of peoples of different nations in assuming responsibility for global development and inter-cultural dialogue; &lt;/small&gt; 
*&lt;small&gt;to indicate why the awareness of the global dimension of development and&amp;nbsp; the sense of responsibility towards contributing to making it sustainable and fair&amp;nbsp;are the indicators of the ethical and cultural development of a nation.&lt;/small&gt;

== Why the television? Wasn't Internet the best distributor of the project media?  ==

The interactivity of Internet enables a personalized way of moving through the video resources and the viewer can chose her/his own itinerary through the video playlists and decide what to see first.  On the other side the interactivity of Internet,  left  to itself without a unifying thread, let the viewer to be as alone as a client in a supermarket, who has to choose between the different items, but is not in a process of &quot;dialogue&quot; with the producers, nor in a process of community with the other &quot;clients&quot;.  Rather then a &quot;clearing house&quot; we wanted a &quot;village feast&quot;, where there are shelves with goods, but one can also find a unity of purpose and  a shared identity.   So before and after the interactivity we felt the need to create a unitary &quot;story&quot; of the whole event.  That story has been threaded in a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The video resources linked to this handbook/The Documentary Story|narration]] and had been articulated in the &quot;episodes of the documentary&quot;.  But it could also take the form of a &quot;book&quot;  or a &quot;film&quot;.  In any case something that has a thread that leads the story and gives unity to the various experiences.  Including the experience of exploiting the interactivity and the ubiquity of the Internet.

The other reason why television was conceived as a strategic media in spite of its being already, in many senses,  an &quot;old medium&quot;, is that bringing the product on to the TV screens was the challenge  of exposing to the general public what our group of author wanted to communicate.  It is  like bringing to the public theater of an innovative  cultural and political message,  that was initially framed in alternative circles, but that would have made not much an impact if confined only within a closed group of alternative thinkers unable - or unwilling - to give testimony of themselves to the wider community.

After we assembled a draft version [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]   ⇒  [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzY9kTw5ufls2Y-VTAV6D30uD_DXrzBZ Episodes edited for a television distribution] we created on  a  [[File:Google plus 32.png|17px]]  [https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/105351488204270692301/communities/105969776192653058150 Google+ community]  specifically dedicated to distribution, and we started building the partnerships for distribution and broadcast of the edited episodes.  Which we continued to edit as the story of the documentary moved on in  overcoming the distribution challenges .  And because the feedback from distributors gave us, along with the feedback of the users of [[Development Cooperation Handbook|this Wikibook]], new ideas for improving the editions or for customize them for specific target audiences. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A Modern Model for the Cosmos'''
 
Next to the mystery of the existence of the soul and the afterlife, the mystery of the shape of the universe may be considered as the mystery of all mysteries, and most difficult to solve by scientists. Ebrahim Victory – Cosmologist 
 
He is right, but why this mystery, the most difficult to solve by scientists?
 
To help answer this question is that we are living inside the universe. A child as long as lives at a home can only knows the internal shape of the home. As compared with the universe, that child we are, and only the Almighty God has authority and superiority over the universe and knows its external shape. The intuitions granted by God:
 
Expanding shape of the cosmos
We all have seen a rolled up sheet. If we look at inside of such a sheet, which has as tightly as possible rolled up and then released, which kind of a shape we can see? 
The answer is spiral. (Snail shell shape)
If we wish to roll up this sheet once again, what can we do?
The answer: we start rolling the central layer up, with the upper layers following the central layer, and all the layers roll upon each other. 
 
The mystery of the creation (Big Bang), also to put an end to it (Big Crunch), is as simple as this example.

The particulars of a snail shell
To imagine the universe shape, we can select a snail shell as ‘reference body’ with seven layers and then consider the particulars of the universe shape as following:
1. The major mass and gravity force of this body exist in its core.
2.        Every snail shell grows up and expands from the core. 
3.        The core of this body has not spontaneously created, because it needs an initial motive power.
4.        The further the layers of a snail shell away from the core, the further they expand; and get centrifugal force.
5.        The expansion process of a snail shell follows special rules; hence, it is in order perfectly. 
6.        Every layer has separated from another by a rigid septum.
7.        One of the important particulars of the body with spiral shape is that it can better carry different waves including sound waves. 
This explains:
•                     Why all instruments transmitting sound waves, such as cochlea in the ears, horn, and trumpet, is spiral - shaped. 
•            Why in our modern world, various receivers and transmitters of audio - visual waves are horny shaped; or “spiral” so far as possible. 
 
The cosmic model as a spiral system
Maybe the Almighty God created the lovely snail dragging its cavernous and calcareous shell as a ‘small and temporary home’ on its soft back, to show us the shape of the cosmos, as a ‘Huge and permanent home’ dragging on humanity shoulders, to creep inside, on the Big Crunch.
    
To imagine spiral shape of the cosmos, we can assume our spiral galaxy of Milky Way with a great black hole in its core, as the core of cosmic snail, then consider the galaxy with the seven layers, as the seven layers of the cosmic snail.
 
  
 
Better to imagine mentioned cosmic system with its structure and circumference, we can assume a huge transparent vitreous snail shell, looks dark inside, with some bright spots scattered amongst darkness. So the further the layers of cosmic snail away from the core, the further the bright spots, and in the last layer, everything is bright. Meanwhile we can distinguish the septum of the layers and a blackout core in the center. 
Illumination: every galaxy has two or three layers and snail shells, tree or four layers. Then it is difficult to show a scheme of spiral shape with seven layers, because we need at least twenty meters wide space or area.
 
Explanation of such a system: 
1.        The seven layers with rigid septum form the “cosmic snail”.
2.        The bright spots form visible universe. (4% heaviness of the cosmos)
3.        The rest of the seven layers is Dark matter. (22%)
4. The blackout core, called Dark energy, is “cosmic snail core”. (74%)
5.       “Cosmic snail core” is the main feeding source for the cosmic snail, as the expansive “space time”, so the further the layers of the cosmic snail is near the core, the further the mass and density and slower the time. The time becomes slower because movement becomes slower by gravity, such as no time in the core and the gravity is at the most.
 
 
Super gravitation
In attention to discoveries of the COBE and WMAP (only, until 380000 years after Big Bang is visible) and to assume the cosmic snail shape, the gravitational relationship among the Beings parts is, as following: 
 
1.       The Visible universe: the gravitation of the moons are attached to the planets, the planets to the stars, the stars to the galaxies, the galaxies to the galactic cluster, and them to the galactic super clusters, etc.
 
2.       The Dark matter: the gravitation of the visible universe (4%) attached to the Dark matter (22%) which spread all over the cosmic snail.

 

This artist's representation shows how galaxies' disks tend to be oriented perpendicular to the huge filaments of galaxies forming the large-scale cosmic web. In reality, galaxies are much smaller and farther apart, compared to the size of filaments, than shown here. Gabriel Pérez 



3.       The Dark energy: the Dark matter gravitation attached to the Dark energy (74%). 
 
Super gravitation: the gravitation of the Dark energy attached to the Supreme Being. Then super gravitation is the Almighty God.

Trinity cosmos (3M universes)
In attention to above achievements, we can announce and proclaim that our interpretation of beings is that we can recognize three forms of the universes, which form the ‘cosmos’ as following:
 
Main universe (cosmic snail core) called Dark energy (singularity universe) with these substantive particulars: 
•         It is the main feeding source for the ‘cosmic snail’ as the expansive “space time” with any “space time” and expansion itself. It is the “constants universe” meanwhile is not a “constant universe”.
•         Its essence is of quantum, and its quality is of absolute light.
•         Because of having the most mass and density, seems blackout and invisible; like as a huge and singular powerful black hole. 
•         Like as every other source loses some of its energy, but the changes are very insignificant.
 
Middle universe called Dark matter (light and power universe) with these functions:
•         It is the coordinator and preserver between main and visible universes.
•         It plays the role of an active regulator with safety regulations to control the cosmic system affairs. 
•         It is the factory of galaxy making. It takes energy over ‘main universe’ (input) and after a process of actions and reactions, sends them probably through wormholes to the visible universe (output). Dark energy is so much powerful, that it is actually impossible to produce directly something visible. 
•         Reconstruction: dead stars like as black dwarf, comeback to this factory through black holes for reconstruction; because nothing spoiled in the system and all the changes are merely displacement and rearrangement of the energy, the matters, and the waves. 
 
Mini universe called visible universe (multiplicity universe) we know relatively its specifications. 
 
Scientific justification of the model:
1. ISOTROPIC VIEW FOR THE UNIVERSE
1.        Some years before Edwin Hubble discovery of the universe expansion, Alexander Friedman had got two simple hypothesizes in 1922:
•         The universe looks generally the same from any point of vantage. 
•         No part of it is exactly is identical to any other part, still its overall makeup is the same everywhere. 
2.        In 1965, a couple of American physicists: Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson declared that the sounds come from outer space, before reach us, they have passed through great parts of the universe; furthermore, these waves are monotonous and homogeneous in various directions. Then they came to a good conclusion: The Universe is “Isotropic” in greater scales.
3. No better isotropic shape than spiral (snail shell) shape, among the geometrical shapes can be found. Then THE UNIVERSE SHAPE IS SPIRAL. 
 
2. EINSTEIN’S GRAVITATIONAL VIEW 
1.        According to General Relativity Theory, the matter changes and twists the surrounding space, and contorts it out of the usual shape, then the further the mass and density of the matter in a certain field, the further its curvature.
2.        The center of a snail shell has the most mass, density and curvature. 
3.        According to the Doppler Effect and the achievements of the Big Bang, the center of universe should have the most density and plaits. 
      Then THE UNIVERSE SHAPE IS SPIRAL.
 
3. WAVES RETAINING VIEW FOR THE UNIVERSE
1.       Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered microwave background radiation, using a very large horny shaped receiver, and they declared that the universe entirely filled with this radiation; and this discovery won them the Noble Prize.
 
  
 
2.       Had the receiver not been horny shaped, this discovery would not have been possible (since horn has a partial snail’s shell shape).
3.       Had the universe not been spiral - shaped, it could not have retained this radiation since the Big Bang. 
Then THE UNIVERSE SHAPE IS SPIRAL.
 
Efficiencies of the model:
1. Proving the existence of enough energy in the main universe, to justify the Big Crunch and to believe the universe has purposefully created. Deliver a valuable idea in this case by NASA / WMAP Science Team: 
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is leftover radiation from the Big Bang stretched by the universe's expansion into the microwave region of the spectrum. In this image, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) records minuscule temperature fluctuations in the CMB as different colors. 
In principle, an advanced civilization could create a universe and encode information in the CMB that would let civilizations in the offspring universe, know that their universe has purposefully created. 
 
 
 
2. Substantiation the Einstein view about cosmic curvature and refuting the devious ideas has expressed by some cosmologists in this field.
 
3. Correction of the Hubble Law
Hubble said:
The further a galaxy away from the earth, the greater its velocity of escape. 
He declared this view, because he had not known the shape of the universe; otherwise, he would have said: The further a galaxy away from the main universe, the greater its velocity of escape.
 
4. Correction of the Hawking view about the universe shape
Prof. Hawking has written a book and titled The Universe in a Nut’s shell. He chose such a title, because he had not known the shape of the cosmos; otherwise, he would have titled his book: The Universe in a Snail’s shell; but his idea about hardness of the universe’s shell as a nut’s shell or snail’s shell, is admirable.
 
5.        Resolving many problems in the cosmological fields for example, scientific struggle between Harlow Shapley and Herbert D. Curtis in 1920. Then, Hubble explanation in this field maybe rejected.
In attention to “the further the layers of the cosmic snail near the core, the further the mass and density, and slower the time” and assume hardness of the cosmic snail septum, many of the distance measures according to the Hubble constant measurements, maybe needed to revise.  
It seems our theory will call the Hublle Law defenders to challenge. Because another problem with estimating the size of the universe, is curvature of space-time as we believe in spiral shape for the universe also held by the general theory of relativity. This curvature also would affect measurements of distance based on the passage of light through space from objects.
 
6.        Rejection the idea of colliding and merge the closing galaxies. Galaxies move in the layers of cosmic snail with rigid septum; and the layers are upon each other. The cosmologists suppose all the closing galaxies will collide and merge in together, but at least while two galaxies are in the separate layers, is not so, however near they may be. This viewpoint will solve many of the problems in cosmology field. Some examples:
2005 March 1 
 
NGC 1531/2: Interacting Galaxies 
Explanation: This dramatic image of an interacting pair of galaxies was made using 8-meter Gemini South telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile. NGC 1531 is the background galaxy with a bright core just above center and NGC 1532 is the foreground spiral galaxy laced with dust lanes. The pair is about 55 million light-years away in the southern constellation Eridanus. These galaxies lie close enough together so that each feels the influence of the other's gravity. The gravitational tug-of-war has triggered star formation in the foreground spiral as evidenced by the young, bright blue star clusters along the upper edge of the front spiral arm. Though the spiral galaxy in this pair is viewed nearly edge-on, astronomers believe the system is similar to the face-on spiral and companion known as M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy. 
2005 May 7
 
NGC 3314: When Galaxies Overlap
Explanation: NGC 3314 consists of two large spiral galaxies which just happen to almost exactly line-up. The foreground spiral is viewed nearly face-on, its pinwheel shape defined by young bright star clusters. But against the glow of the background galaxy, dark swirling lanes of interstellar dust are also seen to echo the face-on spiral's structure. The dust lanes are surprisingly pervasive, and this remarkable pair of overlapping galaxies is one of a small number of systems in which absorption of visible light can be used to directly explore the distribution of dust in distant spirals. NGC 3314 is about 140 million light-years away in the multi-headed constellation Hydra. 
7.        Refining the views of cosmologists about the problems which may occur in the future or even nowadays; for example, COBE achievements:  
The maximum frequency of the radiation intensity is different in a special direction rather than others; in other words, we can find a superior direction in the space; WMAP confirmed this viewpoint in May 2005 too. 
None of the existing scientific theories can explain this problem; meanwhile, only belief in the cosmic snail and its powerful core (main universe) justify such special direction.  
 
8. Consideration how the aphelion and perihelion have created:
Perhaps nobody has yet answered this question, why the sun (or any other star or even planet) has not settled in the center of its elliptical orbit, therefore, the aphelion and perihelion, should have be created?    
The answer: it is because of the cosmic spiral shape. In the cosmic snail, the “velocity of escape” is greater than “core’s gravitational attraction”; therefore, the aphelion and perihelion should have created. This also explain how the orbits of the planets and stars, are elliptical.
 
9. Meanwhile, we also shall find the answers of many of the questions; for example, why according to Kepler second law, the orbital velocity is variable; and the planets have retrograde motion?
The answers are also concealed in the cosmic snail, and because the velocity of escape, is greater than core’s gravitational attraction.
 
10. This theory can help us to reach the targets of establishment the Large Hadron collider too. 
 
Some questions and the answers
May Dark matter be really ‘matter’ or only it so called?
It may be just the ‘antimatter’ we looking for, in the universe. At least a part of Dark matter has formed of the antimatter, because the universe is symmetrically and concurrently, in order. 
 
Why velocity of light is invariable? 
- If the source of gravity and something is running away from it, just from the same quality, the velocity of escape is invariable. 
- The main universe is the gravity source and its quality is of light. 
- Then the velocity of light is invariable.  
 
Why the light has two states? 
- The visible light and the other rays all radiate from the main universe.  
- The main universe is invisible quantum source for the rays.
- While the light radiates from its source, has quantum state, but while becomes visible, takes wavy state too.    
- In other words, quantum state is substantive state for light and wavy state is its accidental state. 
 
Why light moves on straight line?
It depends to volatility nature of the light. Everything that runs away from its source has to escape straightly. Light is so, but while be impressed by a gravitational force, becomes curved or deviated towards another direction. WMAP showed this viewpoint to confirm Einstein’s theory for second time in May 2005, after 1919.
 
Are cosmologists searching out a Final Theory? 
It seems this theory would be able unsettlingly to solve all cosmological problems, therefore we can ask: 
Maybe this theory, replace the Theory of Everything, which guides us to a Final Theory?
For accession to a Final Theory in the future, it is better at first we accept this theory; it seems impossible otherwise. 
 
If some cosmologists wouldn’t like to accept this modern model for the universe,
It is better they reject it with strong reasons; reasons stronger than those of this article
 
STEPHEN HAWKING:
&quot;Huge questions remain to be answered before we can hope to have a complete picture of the universe we live in. I want you to share my excitement at the discoveries, past and present, which have revolutionized the way we think. From the Big Bang to black holes, from dark matter to a possible Big Crunch, our image of the universe today is full of strange sounding ideas, and remarkable truths. The story of how we arrived at this picture is the story of learning to understand what we see.&quot; 
 
Question: is really the shape of the cosmos so, that cosmologists suppose for example as following?
 
 
 

Princeton University theorist Paul Steinhardt, who helped pioneer inflation in the early 1980s, calls the WMAP result &quot;a milestone achievement.&quot; He says theorists have spent years developing more exotic types of inflation models that require new fields or fine-tuning mechanisms. &quot;This milestone means that many of these exotic ideas are out the window, which cleans up the field a lot,&quot; he says. But he also points out that the new WMAP results are consistent with another idea that he helped develop: that our universe occasionally collides with another universe in higher-dimensional space-time, leading to endlessly repeating cycles of Big Bangs and expansion. WMAP team members agree that this cyclic model is consistent with their results, and that a next-generation satellite is needed to determine which model, if either, explains our universe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ABAP &amp; COBOL==

I find it odd that in a such an apparently complete listing of languages there's no mention of:
a) COBOL - which is largely obsolete, but still in heavy use. There's oodles (tech term) of programs being used by various institutions; e.g. US government and various banks. The lack of avaialble programmers to maintain this huge library of programs causes said institutions a variety of headaches. Since it's not much taught anymore, and not the sexy new langauge, there's a rapidly diminshing supply of folks capable of doing the job. On the flip side, this may result in a migration to newer products = jobs and projects.

b) ABAP - SAPs programming language. In the last couple of years I've been in a constant search for competent ABAPers and arranging training for exising SAP users who want/need to learn the language.


OK I'm new to this so please forgive me if I'm violating the social mores of the media, and I'm happy to accept constructive criticism if someone wants to point out the error of my ways...

=== Usage ===
Use on user pages or user talk pages when people shouldn't expect them to be answered to quickly. When using simply &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the template produces the message above

=== Parameters ===

There are two unnamed parameters. The first which replaces &quot;this user&quot; with the name placed.&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|He}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|He}}
The second unnamed parameter replaces &quot;in real life&quot; with whatever is put. Unfortunately, at the time being it requires for there to be something in the first parameter (DO NOT use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy||foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
IE &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy|This user|at [[school]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces
{{busy|This user|at [[school]]}}

Let &lt;math&gt;u(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; be a harmonic function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and suppose that 

&lt;math&gt;\int \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} |\nabla u | ^2 (x,y)\, dx\,dy &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Show that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function.
|}

===Solution===
Let &lt;math&gt;C=\int \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} |\nabla u | ^2 (x,y)\, dx\,dy &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Delta u=0&lt;/math&gt;) then so must &lt;math&gt;v=\nabla u&lt;/math&gt; (surely, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nabla u =0&lt;/math&gt;).  Then since the absolute value as an operator is convex, we have that &lt;math&gt;|v|=|\nabla u|&lt;/math&gt; is a subharmonic function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  

Then by the mean value property of subharmonic functions, for any &lt;math&gt;x_0\in\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;we have

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
|v(x_0)|&amp;\leq&amp; \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int_{B(x_0,r)} |v|\,dx\,dy\\
&amp;\leq&amp; \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \left( \int_{B(x_0,r)} 1\,dx\,dy \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_{B(x_0,r)} |v|^2\,dx\,dy\right)^{1/2}\\
&amp;\leq &amp; \frac{C}{\sqrt{\pi r^2}}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the second inequality is due to Cauchy-Schwarz (Hölder) inequality.

This estimate hold for all &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore if we send &lt;math&gt;r\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; we see that for all &lt;math&gt;x_0\in \mathbb{R}^2,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;|v(x_0)|=|\nabla u(x_0)|=0&lt;/math&gt;  which gives us that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

Let &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; be a piecewise smooth weak solution of the conservation law 
&lt;math&gt;u_t+f(u)_x=0,\quad -\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty , t &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

a) Derive the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions at a discontinuity of the solution.

b)Find a piecewise smooth solution to the IVP

&lt;math&gt;u_t+(u^2+u)_x=0,\quad -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty, t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1,&amp;x&lt;0\\-2&amp;x&gt;0.\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;


|}
===Solution===
====a)====
When we solve the PDE by methods of characteristics, the characteristic curves can cross, causing a shock, or discontinuity.  The task at hand, is to find the curve of discontinuity, call it &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  
Multiply the PDE by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, a smooth test function with compact support in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by an integration by parts:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 0 =&amp; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty (u_t + f(u)_x) v\,dx\,dt \\
=&amp;- \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty u v_t\,dx\,dt +\left.\int_{-\infty}^\infty v u \,dx \right|_{t=0}^{t=\infty} - \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(u)v_x\,dx\,dt + \left.\int_0^\infty f(u) v\,dt \right|_{x=-\infty}^{x=\infty}\\
=&amp;- \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty u v_t\,dx\,dt -\int_{-\infty}^\infty v u(x,0) \,dx  - \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(u)v_x\,dx\,dt.
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;V_l&lt;/math&gt; denote the open region in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; to the left of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and simlarly &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt; denotes the region to the right of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  If the support of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; lies entirely in either of these two regions, then all of the above boundary terms vanish and we get &lt;math&gt; 0 = \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty (u_t + f(u)_x) v\,dx\,dt  = \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty uv_t + f(u)v_x\,dx\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose the support of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; intersects the discontinuity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.



====b)====
We can calculate &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F(u_l)-F(u_r)}{u_l-u_r} = \frac{1^2+1-(4-2)}{1+2}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the shock wave extends vertically from the origin.  That is,

&lt;math&gt;u(x,t)=\left\{ \begin{align} 1&amp; x&lt;0\\ -2 &amp; x&gt;0 \end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the evolution equation with initial data

&lt;math&gt;u_{tt}-u_{xx}+u_t=(u_{xt}^3)_x,\quad -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty, t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=f(x), u_t(x,0)=g(x), u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

a)  What energy quantity is appropriate for this equation?  Is it conserved or dissipated?

b)  Show that &lt;math&gt;C^3&lt;/math&gt; solutions of this problem are unique.
|}
===Solution===
====3a====
Consider the energy &lt;math&gt;E(t)=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 u_t^2+u_x^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Then
&lt;math&gt;\dot{E}(t)=\int_0^1 u_tu_{tt}+u_xu_{xt}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Integrate by parts to get
&lt;math&gt;\dot{E}(t)=\int_0^1 u_tu_{tt}-u_{xx}u_{t}\,dx  + \left. u_tu_x\right|_0^1&lt;/math&gt;.
The boundary terms vanish since &lt;math&gt;u(0,t)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u_t(0,t)=0&lt;/math&gt; (similarly at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;).  Then by the original PDE we get

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{E}(t)&amp;=&amp;\int_0^1 u_t((u_{xt}^3)_x-u_t)\,dx\\
&amp;=&amp;\int_0^1 u_t(u_{xt}^3)_x-u_t^2)\,dx\\
&amp;=&amp;\int_0^1 -u_{xt}^4 -u_t^2\,dx + \left. u_{xt}^3u_t\right|_0^1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality is another integration by parts.  The boundary terms vanish again by the same argument.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\dot{E}(t)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; that is, energy is dissipated.

====3b====
Suppose &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; are two distinct solutions to the system.  Then &lt;math&gt;w=u-v&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to

&lt;math&gt;w_{tt}-w_{xx}+w_t=(w_{xt}^3)_x,\quad -\infty&lt;x&lt;\infty, t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w(x,0)=0, w_t(x,0)=0, w(0,t)=w(1,t)=0.&lt;/math&gt; 

This tells us that at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w_x=w_t=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;E(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;E(t)\leq E(0)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;E(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  This implies &lt;math&gt;w\equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;u=v&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded open set with smooth boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider the initial boundary value problem for &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
u_t - \nabla \cdot (a(x)\nabla u) + b(x) u = q,&amp; x\in\Omega,t&gt;0\\
u(x,0)=f(x),&amp;x\in\Omega\\
u_t+\partial u/\partial n +u =0,&amp; x\in \partial\Omega,t&gt;0
\end{array}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial u/\partial n&lt;/math&gt; is the exterior normal derivative.  Assume that &lt;math&gt;a,b\in C^1(\bar\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;a(x)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Show that smooth solutions of this problem are unique.
|}

===Solution===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; are two distinct solutions.  Then &lt;math&gt;w=u-v&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth solution to 

&lt;math&gt;\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
w_t - \nabla \cdot (a(x)\nabla w) + b(x) u = 0,&amp; x\in\Omega,t&gt;0\\
w(x,0)=0,&amp;x\in\Omega\\
w_t+\partial w/\partial n +w =0,&amp; x\in \partial\Omega,t&gt;0
\end{array}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the energy &lt;math&gt;E(t)=\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega w^2\,dx + \frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w^2\,dS&lt;/math&gt;.  It is easy to verify that &lt;math&gt;E(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then 

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot E(t) =&amp; \int_\Omega w w_t\,dx +\int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega w \nabla\cdot(a(x)\nabla w) - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega -\nabla w \cdot (a(x)\nabla w) - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega} w a(x) \frac{\partial w}{\partial n} \, dS+ \int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega -a(x) \nabla w \cdot \nabla w - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega}  -a(x) w^2 - a(x) w w_t \, dS+ \int_{\partial\Omega} a(x) w w_t\,dS\\
=&amp; \int_\Omega -a(x) \nabla w \cdot \nabla w - b(x) w^2\, dx + \int_{\partial\Omega}  -a(x) w^2 \, dS\\
\leq &amp; \int_\Omega - b(x) w^2\,dx \\
 \leq&amp; \| b\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} \int_\Omega w^2\,dx
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\dot E(t)\leq \| b\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} E(t)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;E(t)\leq E(0) e^{\| b\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} t} =0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;E(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;w \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;



==Problem 5 ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded open set with smooth boundary.  Let &lt;math&gt;K=\{u\in H_0^1(\Omega):u\geq 0 \text{ in } \Omega\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and define the functional

&lt;math&gt;I(u)=\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2\,dx - \int_\Omega fu\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Show that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a minimizer of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the variational inequality

&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla(u-v)\, dx \leq \int_\Omega f(u-v)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in K&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

===Solution===
&lt;math&gt;(\Rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt;  Suppose &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;I[u]\leq I[w]\, \forall w\in K&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for any fixed &lt;math&gt;w\in K&lt;/math&gt;, if we let &lt;math&gt;g(t)=(1-t)u+tv&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;I[g(0)]\leq I[g(t)]\, \forall 0\leq t \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;i(t)=I[g(t)]&lt;/math&gt;; then we can say that &lt;math&gt;i'(0)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we must compute &lt;math&gt;i'(0)&lt;/math&gt;.  We have

&lt;math&gt;
i(t)=\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \left|(1-t)\nabla u + t \nabla v \right|^2   - f ((1-t)u+tv)\,dx 
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;i'(t)=\int_\Omega -(1-t)|\nabla u|^2 +(1-2t) \nabla u \cdot \nabla v + t |\nabla v|^2 - (1-t)fu -tfv\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;i'(0) =\int_\Omega -|\nabla u|^2 + \nabla u \cdot \nabla v - fu \,dx &lt;/math&gt;

Since we know &lt;math&gt;i'(0)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then 

&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega f(u-v)\,dx \geq \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 - \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla (u-v)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; as desired.


&lt;math&gt;(\Leftarrow)&lt;/math&gt; Conversely suppose

&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla(u-v)\,dx = \int_\Omega |\nabla|^2 - \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \,dx \leq \int_\Omega f (u-v)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Then 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lll}
\int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 -fu\,dx &amp;\leq&amp; \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v -fv\,dx \\
&amp;\leq &amp; \int_\Omega |\nabla u||\nabla v| -fv\,dx \\
&amp; \leq &amp;  \int_\Omega 1/2|\nabla u|^2+1/2|\nabla v|^2 -fv\,dx
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;1/2 \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 -fu\,dx \leq 1/2 \int_\Omega |\nabla v|^2-fv\,dx&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in K&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, &lt;math&gt;I[u]\leq I[v]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in K&lt;/math&gt;, as desired.

'''TIPS ON LANDSCAPING: What Is The Landscape?'''

'''#1'''. What place is this? If it's on a dry dessert planet you don't want it to have lush green forests. If it's under water you don't want there to be dirigibles flying around. Make a landscape that fits what is going on in the game.}}

'''#2'''. Are there parts of your landscape that you will never get to in the game but still see? If so, photo and then delete them. They'll take up to much space and RAM. Instead make them part of the skybox.}}

{{BBR/tip|
'''TIPS ON LANDSCAPING: Death Defying Drops!'''

'''#3'''. Add some death defying drops and some ponds (but only if they fit the landscape). You may also add a &quot;Physics Mesh&quot; around a pond like this which is invisible but stops you from falling in.

{{BBR/Note|
'''BLENDER NOTE: For Everyone'''

Is your landscape High-Poly? If so you can make your high-poly objects &quot;No Collision&quot; in the physics and add a less high poly model which is invisible around it. This is called a physics mesh. It will make it so that the physics engine doesn't have to handle so much stuff.}}

=== Usage ===
Use on user pages or user talk pages when people shouldn't expect them to be answered to quickly. When using simply &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{busy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the template produces the message above

=== Parameters ===
'''What State Are You In'''

This template says &quot;In a good mood&quot; automatically:

{{Hapgry}}

This is using: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hapgry}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

However you can get it to say a different mode by typing:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hapgry|[Your User Name]|[Your mood starting with &quot;in a&quot;.]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It comes out with this:

{{Hapgry|[Your User Name]|[Your mood starting with &quot;in a&quot;.]}}

End result:

{{Hapgry|Downdate|in a very, very, VERY good mood}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
[[File:Stele Mnesarete Glyptothek Munich 491 n1.jpg|thumb|Funerary stele of Mnesarete; a young servant (left) is facing her dead mistress.[1] Attica, circa 380 BCE. (Glyptothek, Munich, Germany)]]

Slavery was common practice and an integral component of ancient Greece throughout its rich history, as it was in other societies of the time including ancient Palestine and early Christian societies. It is estimated that in Athens, the majority of citizens owned at least one slave. Most ancient writers considered slavery not only natural but necessary, but some isolated debate began to appear, notably in Socratic dialogues while the Stoics produced the first condemnation of slavery recorded in history.

In conformity with modern historiographical practice, this article will discuss only chattel (personal possession) slavery, as opposed to dependent groups such as the ''penestae'' of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel slave is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner who may buy, sell, or lease him or her like any other chattel.

The study of slavery in ancient Greece poses a number of significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing on the city of Athens. No treatise is specifically devoted to the subject. Judicial pleadings of the 4th century BCE were interested in slavery only as a source of revenue. Comedy and tragedy represented stereotypes. Iconography made no substantial differentiation between slave and craftsman.

==Terminology==

The ancient Greeks had many words to describe slaves which need to be placed in context to avoid ambiguity. In Homer, Hesiod and Theognis of Megara, the slave was called δμώς / ''dmôs''. The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as booty, in other words, property. During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used ἀνδράποδον / ''andrápodon'', literally, &quot;one with the feet of a man&quot;, as opposed to τετράποδον / ''tetrapodon'', &quot;quadruped&quot;, or livestock. The most common word is δοῦλος / ''doûlos'', an earlier form of which appears in Mycenaean inscriptions as do-e-ro, used in opposition to &quot;free man&quot; (ἐλεύθερος / ''eleútheros''). The verb δουλεὐω (which survives in modern Greek, meaning work) can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children. Finally, the term οἰκέτης / ''oikétês'' was used, meaning &quot;one who lives in house&quot;, referring to household servants.

Other terms used were less precise and required context:

* θεράπων / ''therápôn'' – At the time of Homer, the word meant &quot;squire&quot; (Patroclus was referred to as the therapôn of Achilles and Meriones that of Idomeneus); during the classical age, it meant &quot;servant&quot;.
* ἀκόλουθος / ''akólouthos'' – literally, &quot;the follower&quot; or &quot;the one who accompanies&quot;. Also, the diminutive ἀκολουθίσκος, used for page boys.
* παῖς / ''pais'' – literally &quot;child&quot;, used in the same way as &quot;houseboy&quot;, also used in a derogatory way to call adult slaves.
* σῶμα / ''sôma'' – literally &quot;body&quot;, used in the context of emancipation.

==Origins of slavery==
[[File:Aias Kassandra Louvre G458.jpg|left|thumb|Women as plunder of war: Ajax the Lesser taking Cassandra, tondo of a red-figure kylix by the Kodros Painter, ca. 440-430 BCE, Louvre.]]

Slaves were present through the Mycenaean civilization. In the tablets from Pylos 140 do-e-ro can be identified with certainty. Two legal categories can be distinguished: &quot;common&quot; slaves and &quot;slaves of the god&quot; (te-o-jo do-e-ro / θεοιο), the God in this case probably being Poseidon. Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal status is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear. The names of common slaves show that some of them came from Kythera, Chios, Lemnos or Halicarnassus, and were probably enslaved as a result of piracy. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and non-slaves were not uncommon and that slaves could be independent artisans and retain plots of land. It appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between slave and free, but between those attached to the palace and those not.

There is no continuity between the Mycenaean era and the time of Homer, where social structures reflected those of the Greek dark ages. The terminology differs: the slave is no longer do-e-ro (''doulos'') but ''dmôs''. In the Iliad, slaves are mainly women taken as booty of war, while men were either ransomed or killed on the battlefield. In the Odyssey, the slaves also seem to be mostly women. These slaves were servants and sometimes concubines. There were some male slaves, especially in the Odyssey, a prime example being the swineherd Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the ''oikos'' (&quot;family unit&quot;, &quot;household&quot;): Laertes eats and drinks with his servants; in the winter, he sleeps in their company. The term dmôs is not considered pejorative, and Eumaeus, the &quot;divine&quot; swineherd, benefits from the same Homeric epithet as the Greek heroes. In spite of this, slavery remained a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares that &quot;Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man's virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him.&quot;

It is difficult to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In Works and Days (8th century BCE), Hesiod owns numerous ''dmôes'', although their status is unclear. The presence of douloi is confirmed by lyric poets such as Archilochus or Theognis of Megara. According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of Draco (c. 620 BCE) mentioned slaves. According to Plutarch, Solon (c. 594-593 BCE) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent at the very moment when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar Moses Finley likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to Theopompus, was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BCE). He concludes that &quot;one aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance hand in hand, of freedom and slavery.&quot;

==Economic role==
[[File:Amphora olive-gathering BM B226.jpg|thumb|Agriculture, a common use for slaves, black-figure neck-amphora by the Antimenes Painter, British Museum.]]

All activities were open to slaves with the exception of politics. For the Greeks, politics was the only activity worthy of a citizen, the rest being relegated wherever possible to non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not activity.

The principal use of slavery was in agriculture, the foundation of the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.

In mines and quarries slave labour was prevalent, with found large slave populations often leased out by rich private citizens. The strategos Nicias leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of Laurium in Attica; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon indicates that they received one obolus per slave per day, amounting to 60 drachmas per year. This was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore has been estimated at 30,000. Xenophon suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.

Slaves were also used as craftsmen and tradespersons. As in agriculture, they were used for labour that was beyond the capability of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of Lysias employed 120 slaves, and the father of Demosthenes owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.

Slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was batman to the hoplite. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.

==Demographics==
===Population===
[[File:NAMA Cheval &amp; esclave éthiopien.jpg|left|thumb|Ethiopian slave attempts to break in a horse, date unknown, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BCE, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BCE and 307 BCE, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 150,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.

According to the literature, it appears that the majority of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains &quot;my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me.&quot; However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves at the time of his death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.

Thucydides estimates that the isle of Chios had proportionally the largest number of slaves.

===Sources of supply===

There were four primary sources of slaves: war, in which the defeated would become slaves to the victorious unless a more objective outcome was reached; piracy (at sea); banditry (on land); and international trade.

====War====

By the rules of war of the period, the victor possessed absolute rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BCE the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as was that of Thebes in 335 BCE by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.

The existence of Greek slaves was a constant source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: in the middle of the 3rd century BCE, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BCE, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.

====Piracy and banditry====

Piracy and banditry provided a significant and consistent supply of slaves, though the significance of this source varied according to era and region. Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid or not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as &quot;the old-fashioned&quot; way of life. Such was the case in Acarnania, Crete, and Aetolia. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with Illyrians, Phoenicians, and Etruscans. During the Hellenistic period, Cilicians and the mountain peoples from the coasts of Anatolia could also be added to the list. Strabo explains the popularity of the practice amongst the Cilicians by its profitability; Delos, not far away, allowed for &quot;moving a myriad of slaves daily&quot;. The growing influence of the Roman Republic, a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and an aggravation of piracy. In the 1st century BCE, however, the Romans largely eradicated piracy to protect the Mediterranean trade routes.

====Slave trade====

There was slave trade between kingdoms and states of the wider region. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the Hermai mentions 32 slaves whose origin have been ascertained: 13 came from Thrace, 7 from Caria, and the others came from Cappadocia, Caria, Scythia, Phrygia, Lydia, Syria, Ilyria, Macedon and Peloponnese. The mechanism was similar to that later seen in the African slave trade: local professionals sold their own people to Greek slave merchants. The principal centers of the slave trade appear to have been Ephesus, Byzantium, and even faraway Tanais at the mouth of the Don. Some &quot;barbarian&quot; slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents. There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but corroborating evidence exists. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of Scythian archers employed by Athens as a police force—originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand. Secondly, the names given to slaves in the comedies often had a geographical link; thus Thratta, used by Aristophanes in The Wasps, The Acharnians, and Peace, simply signified Thracian woman. Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt. It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others.

The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one drachma per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BCE they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance a large slave market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which was in charge of the logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.

===Natural growth===
[[File:Funerary stele Louvre Ma4498.jpg|thumb|Funerary stele for two young children and their pedagogue, killed in an earthquake, Nicomedia, 1st century BCE, Louvre.]]

Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not &quot;breed&quot; their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of black people in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply. This incongruity remains relatively unexplained.

Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that &quot;…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.&quot; The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.

Houseborn slaves (''oikogeneis'') often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were &quot;pedagogues&quot; in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

==Status of slaves==

The Greeks had many degrees of enslavement. There was a multitude of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including Penestae or helots, disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and metics. The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.

Professor Moses Finley proposed a set of criteria for different degrees of enslavement:

* Right to own property
* Authority over the work of another
* Power of punishment over another
* Legal rights and duties (liability to arrest and/or arbitrary punishment, or to litigate)
* Familial rights and privileges (marriage, inheritance, etc.)
* Possibility of social mobility (manumission or emancipation, access to citizen rights)
* Religious rights and obligations
* Military rights and obligations (military service as servant, heavy or light soldier, or sailor)

===Athenian slaves===

Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and children, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / ''dikê blabês''). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / ''graphê'' ''hybreôs''); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / ''hubris'').
[[File:Phlyax scene Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|A master (right) and his slave (left) in a phlyax play, Silician red-figured calyx-krater, ca. 350 BC–340 BCE. Louvre Museum, Paris.]]

Isocrates claimed that &quot;not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial&quot;; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: &quot;was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?&quot; The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (''dikê phonikê''), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BCE, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court which had jurisdiction over unintentional homicide; the imposed penalty seems to have been more than a fine but less than death—maybe exile, as was the case in the murder of a Metic.

However, slaves did belong to their master's household. A newly-bought slave was welcomed with nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part in most of the civic and family cults; they were expressly invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.

Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves: if a person struck what appeared to be a slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It astonished other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves. Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen at the battle of Marathon, and the monuments memorialize them. It was formally decreed before the battle of Salamis that the citizens should &quot;save themselves, their women, children, and slaves&quot;.

Slaves had special sexual restrictions and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships (&quot;A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.&quot;), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae (&quot;A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools.&quot;). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a pedagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.

The sons of vanquished foes would be enslaved and often forced to work in male brothels, as in the case of Phaedo of Elis, who at the request of Socrates was bought and freed from such an enterprise by the philosopher's rich friends. The rape of slaves was against the law, just as with citizens.

===Slaves in Gortyn===
[[File:Gortys law inscription.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the Gortyn code in Gortyn, Crete.]]

In Gortyn, in Crete, according to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BCE, slaves (''doulos'' or ''oikeus'') found themselves in a state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).

Slaves did have the right to possess a house and livestock, which could be transmitted to descendants, as could clothing and household furnishings. Their family was recognized by law: they could marry, divorce, write a testament and inherit just like free men.

===A specific case: debt slavery===

Prior to its interdiction by Solon, Athenians practiced debt enslavement: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became &quot;enslaved&quot; to the creditor. The exact nature of this dependency is a much controversial issue amongst modern historians: was it truly slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as ''hektēmoroi'' working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the Near East and is cited in the Bible.

Solon put an end to it with the σεισάχθεια / ''seisachtheia'', liberation of debts, which prevented all claim to the person by the debtor and forbade the sale of free Athenians, including by themselves. Aristotle in his ''Constitution of the Athenians'' quotes one of Solon's poems:

:And many a man whom fraud or law had sold
:Far from his god-built land, an outcast slave,
:I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,
:Exiles from home through debt’s oppressive load,
:Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,
:But wandering far and wide, I brought again;
:And those that here in vilest slavery (''douleia'')
:Crouched ‘neath a master’s (''despōtes'') frown, I set them free.

Though much of Solon's vocabulary is that of &quot;traditional&quot; slavery, servitude for debt was at least different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth. It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the 6th century BC, which was not intended to free all slaves but only those enslaved by debt. The reforms of Solon left two exceptions: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave, and a citizen could &quot;expose&quot; (abandon) unwanted newborn children.

===Manumission===

The practice of manumission is confirmed to have existed in Chios from the 6th century BCE. It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the theatre or before a public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the 6th century BCE in order to avoid public disorder.

The practice became more common in the 4th century BCE and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries CE, and the 1st century CE. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BCE in the island of Thasos. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).

The slave was often required to pay for himself an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To do this he could use his savings or take a loan (ἔρανος / ''eranos'') from his master, a friend, or a client, which last was often the case for a courtesan, one of the most famous examples of which involved the hetaera Neaira.

Emancipation was often of a religious nature, where the slave was considered to be &quot;sold&quot; to a deity, often Delphian Apollo, or was consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and would guarantee the contract. The manumission could also be entirely civil, in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity.

The slave's freedom could be either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, on the part of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the paramone, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.

In regard to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of Plato in ''The Laws'': presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.

===Spartan slaves===

Spartan citizens used ''helots'', a dependent group collectively owned by the state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.

Some texts mention both slaves and helots, which seems to indicate that they were not the same thing. Plato in ''Alcibiades I'' cites &quot;the ownership of slaves, and notably helots&quot; amongst the Spartan riches, and Plutarch writes about &quot;slaves and helots&quot;. Finally, according to Thucydides, the agreement that ended the 464 BCE revolt of helots stated that any Messenian rebel who might hereafter be found within the Peloponnese was &quot;to be the slave of his captor&quot;, which means that the ownership of chattel slaves was not illegal at that time.

Most historians thus concur that chattel slaves were indeed used in Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BCE against Athens, but not in great numbers and only amongst the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.

==Slavery conditions==
[[File:Black slave Louvre Br361.jpg|thumb|Black captive with tied hands, Ptolemaic Egypt, musée du Louvre.]]

It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: &quot;work, discipline, and feeding&quot;. Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.

Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged; it was a means of forcing them to work, as were control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master or the supervisor, who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of Aristophanes' ''The Knights'' (4–5), two slaves complain of being &quot;bruised and thrashed without respite&quot; by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in ancient Greek comedy:

:&quot;He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh you poor miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'&quot;
:
The condition of slaves varied very much according to their status; the mine slaves of Laureion and the ''pornai'' (brothel prostitutes) lived a particularly brutal existence, while public slaves, craftsmen, tradesmen and bankers enjoyed relative independence. In return for a fee (ἀποφορά / ''apophora'') paid to their master, they could live and work alone. They could thus earn some money on the side, sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was indeed a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate.

Ancient writers considered that Attic slaves enjoyed a &quot;peculiarly happy lot&quot;: Xenophon deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: &quot;as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage&quot;. This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the Peloponnesian War at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at Attica in Decelea. These were principally skilled artisans (''kheirotekhnai''), probably amongst the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by Antiphanes, The Runaway-catcher (Δραπεταγωγός), suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.

Conversely, there are no records of a large-scale Greek slave revolt comparable to that of Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome or the American South. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.

==Views of Greek slavery==
===Historical views===
[[File:Actor slave Louvre CA265.jpg|left|thumb|Depiction of a slave seated on an altar, looking at the purse he is about to steal, c. 400–375 BC, Louvre.]]

Very few authors of antiquity call slavery into question. To Homer and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. Heraclitus states that &quot;War is the father of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free&quot;.

During the classical period, the main justification for slavery was economic. From a philosophical point of view, the idea of &quot;natural&quot; slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as Aeschylus states in ''The Persians'', the Greeks &quot;[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals&quot;, while the Persians, as Euripides states in Helen, &quot;are all slaves, except one&quot; — the Great King. Hippocrates theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of Anatolia produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by Plato, then Aristotle in ''Politics'', where he develops the concept of &quot;natural slavery&quot;: &quot;for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave.&quot; As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but &quot;…has not got the deliberative part at all.&quot;

In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the Sophists and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa. Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of &quot;natural&quot; slavery. The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as Menander stated, &quot;be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave&quot;. This idea, repeated by the Stoics and the Epicurians, was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialisation of it.

The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Slaves exist even in the &quot;Cloudcuckooland&quot; of Aristophanes' ''The Birds'' as well as in the ideal cities of Plato's ''Laws'' or ''Republic''. The utopian cities of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The &quot;reversed cities&quot; placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in ''Lysistrata'' or ''Assemblywomen'', but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the Golden Age, where all needs were met. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' ''Amphictyons'' barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honour of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a &quot;normal&quot; society, one needs slaves.

===Modern views===
[[File:NAMA Masque esclave.jpg|thumb|Theatre mask of a ''First slave'' in Greek comedy, 2nd century BC, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of apologetic discourse among Christians, who awarded themselves the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a ''History of Slavery in Antiquity'' amongst his works for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.

In the 19th century a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a mode of production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (''Slavery in Antiquity'', 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.

Current historiography developed in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.

In 2011, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate, on two questions in particular: can it be said that ancient Greece was a &quot;slave society&quot;, and did Greek slaves comprise a social class?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Four colors of pills.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Four Different Dietary Supplements]]

According to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration Food and Drug Administration] (FDA), a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement dietary supplement] (DS) is a product taken by mouth that contains a &quot;dietary ingredient&quot; intended to supplement the diet. A dietary ingredient can include:
*a vitamin,
*a mineral,
*an herb or other botanical,
*an amino acid,
*a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake (e.g., enzymes or tissues from organs or glands), or
*a concentrate, metabolite, constituent or extract.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2009, December). What is a dietary supplement? http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm195635.htm. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the DS industry was estimated to be a $29 billion industry &lt;ref&gt;IBISWorld. (2012). Vitamin &amp; Supplement Manufacturing in the US Market Research. Vitamin &amp; Supplement Manufacturing in the US: Market Research Report. http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=490&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2008, more than 75,000 DS were available in the U.S. &lt;ref name=&quot;Grollman&quot; &gt; Marcus, D. M., &amp; Grollman, A. P. (2012). The consequences of ineffective regulation on dietary supplements. Archives of Internal Medicine, 172(13).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Current Legislation Governing the DS Industry==

===Dietary Supplement Health and Education (DSHEA) Act===
Since 1994, the DS industry has been regulated by the DSHEA act. DSHEA changed the classification of DS from 'drugs' to a food, eliminating the need for DS premarket safety testing and FDA approval &lt;ref&gt;Mason, S. A. (2010-2011). Dietary supplement regulation: A comparative study. Journal of Transnational Law and Policy, 20, 103-127.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Under DSHEA, DS manufacturers can make claims if product labels state the products has not been tested by the FDA and do not claim to &quot;prevent, treat, or cure a specific disease&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Cassileth, B. R., Heitzer, M., &amp; Wesa, K. (2009). The public health impact of herbs and nutritional supplements. Pharm Biol., 47(8), 761-767. doi:10.1080/13880200902991581.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)===
The FDA has established [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_manufacturing_practice Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)] to require DS manufacturers to establish consistent quality, packaging, and labeling &quot;as specified in the master manufacturing record&quot; &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2010, December). Guidance for industry: Current good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements; Small entity compliance guide. Food website:http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act===
This act requires companies to include an address or phone number on the product label, so consumers may report adverse events they experience.  DS companies are required to report any adverse events to the FDA &lt;ref&gt;S. 3546 (109th): Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, S. S.3546, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act===
The FTC Act gives the [http://www.ftc.gov/ FTC] authority to regulate DS advertising campaigns. The FTC requires advertisers to substantiate any claims before being released to consumers to avoid false and misleading advertising &lt;ref&gt;In the Matter of Regulations on Statements Made for Dietary Supplements Concerning the Effect of the Product on the Structure or Function of the Body; Docket No. 98N-0044 before the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES and FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (1998) (testimony of Bureau of Consumer Protection of the Federal Trade Commission).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Support for the DS Industry==

===Manufacturers and Trade Organizations===

As in any industry, DS manufacturers have formed trade groups to protect their interests. To distinguish themselves from competitors and improve perception of their industry, some companies are taking it upon themselves to make their products, innovations, and advertisements more transparent to consumers &lt;ref name = &quot;Sales&quot;/&gt;.

===Pro-DS Advocacy Groups===

Advocacy groups, such as the [http://www.citizens.org/ Citizens for Health Education Foundation (CFH)], work to influence government policy decisions (such as Senate Amendment 2127 to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_Safety_and_Innovation_Act Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act]) and to challenge unfavorable government actions legally.  In the 1999 case Pearson v. Shalala, two manufacturers, the American Preventive Medical Association (APMA), and the CFH, filed a lawsuit against the FDA, claiming the FDA could not require companies to scientifically validate health claims. The courts initially ruled in favor of the FDA, but later overturned the ruling &lt;ref&gt; Vladeck, D. C. (2000). Truth and consequences: The perils of half-truths and unsubstantiated health claims for dietary supplements. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, 132-138. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Following this case, the FDA lost a number of other cases surrounding the issue of product labels &lt;ref&gt; Emord &amp; Associates. (2010). Significant cases. http://www.emord.com/. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Medical Professionals===
Some doctors do believe that some DS, such as vitamins and minerals, can benefit patients, especially when the &quot;food quality [of patients] is...poor&quot; &lt;ref&gt;BodyLogicMD. (2012). Will you prescribe me vitamins and supplements? [Video file]. http://www.bodylogicmd.com/faq/will-you-prescribe-me-vitamins-and-supplements.&lt;/ref&gt;. Doctors and physicians are increasingly recommending DS to their patients.  A recent study found that health practitioners constituted the third fastest growing sales channel for DS in 2009 &lt;ref&gt; (September 1, 2010 ). Recession Makes Wellness a More Urgent Priority for Most Consumer Groups. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Low Adverse Event Reporting===

Annual reports from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Poison_Control_Centers American Association of Poison Control Centers] revealed 177 deaths linked to DS consumption from 1994-2010, amounting to less than 11 deaths annually &lt;ref&gt;American Association of Poison Control Centers. (2012). Annual reports. http://www.aapcc.org/annual-reports/&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, this annual death rate is low compared to those of many Americans' daily activities, such as falling out of bed (450 deaths annually) &lt;ref&gt;Nationmaster. [http://www.nationmaster.com/ &quot;Mortality&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;. Manufacturers and trade organizations, such as the [http://www.crnusa.org/ Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN)], claim the number of adverse event reports is low because of the industry has a good safety track record &lt;ref&gt; Link, C. (2012, February 23). CRN refutes supplement adverse event statistic as 'outdated and irrelevant'. http://m.newhope360.com/regulation-and-legislation/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Concerns with DS Industry==

===Scientific Concerns===

Some medical professionals, including dietitians and nutritionists, claim their patients misuse supplements &lt;ref&gt;Consumer Reports. (2010, September). Dangerous supplements: What you don't know about these 12 ingredients could hurt you [Video file]. http://www.consumerreports.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desai, K. (2012, August 2). Hidden dangers in vitamins, supplements? CNN, Health.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In fact, 73% of Americans would rather &quot;treat themselves than go to a doctor” &lt;ref&gt;PRoper Starch Worldwide, Inc. (2001). Self care in the new millenium: American attitudes toward maintaining personal health and treatment.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although some medical professionals believe DS are beneficial, many are skeptical of the industry, believing the DS industry is unregulated and manufacturers can &quot;sell whatever [they] want&quot; as long as they do not get caught &lt;ref&gt;Lipson, P. A., M.D. (2009, July 20). DSHEA: A travesty of a mockery of a sham. Science-Based Medicine website: http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;. They believe this because DS manufacturers often do not pre-test their products for safety and effectiveness. Even when third-party testing takes place, it is difficult for scientists and doctors to determine the veracity of product claims &lt;ref&gt;Collins, N., Tighe, A. P., Brunton, S. A., &amp; Kris-Etherton, P. M. (2012). Differences between dietary supplement and prescription drug omega-3 fatty acid formulations: A legislative and regulatory perspective. Journal of the American College of Nutrition, 31(3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, D. R., MD, Slow, S., PhD, Chambers, S. T., MD, Jennings, L. C., PhD, Stewart, A. W., BSc, Priest, P. C., DPhil, . . . Scragg, R., PhD. (2012). Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adults: The VIDARIS randomized controlled trial. JAMA, 308(13), 1333-1339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, K., Kaaks, R., Linseisen, J., &amp; Rohrmann, S. (2012). Associations of dietary calcium intake and calcium supplementation with myocardial infarction and stroke risk and overall cardiovascular mortality in the Heidelberg cohort of the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition study. Heart, 98, 920-925. doi:10.1136/heartjnl-2011-301345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers, H. J. (2003). Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and health. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 77(6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, M. B. (2009). Iodine deficiency. Endocrine Reviews, 30(4), 376-408. doi:10.1210/ er.2009-0011.&lt;/ref&gt;.  It has been so difficult to prove the danger and effectiveness of DS products that only one DS has been banned by the FDA - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine ephedrine] &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2004, November 23). FDA acts to remove Ephedra-containing dietary supplements from market [Press release].&lt;/ref&gt;. Although many products claim to provide benefits, it is unclear what proportion of DS is actually effective.

===Manufacturing Problems===

=====GMP Failures=====
In 2010, the FDA stated there was a 25% failure rate of GMP compliance for DS manufacturers, as opposed to the expected 4-5% GMP violation failure rate &lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; &gt;Wright, J. (2012, February 17). FDA GMP inspections: How to comply. http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Many violations are cited for not meeting ingredient specifications and failure to record product specifications &lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;. Such FDA findings have caused consumer awareness groups, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConsumerLab.com ConsumerLab.com], to alert consumers of the dangers of DS &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2001, July 6). FDA advises DS manufacturers to remove comfrey products from the market [White paper].&lt;/ref&gt;. 


Increasingly, large companies have independent organizations (such as the [http://www.usp.org/ United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP)] and  the Natural Products Association (NPA)) verify they abide by adequate manufacturing and product quality standards.  Further, three leading DS companies, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBTY NBTY], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmavite Pharmavite], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrigo Perrigo], are currently participating in USP conventions to verify the quality and safety of their products &lt;ref name = &quot;Sales&quot;&gt;(June 1, 2010 ). '09 Sales Growth Sputters in Every Nutrition Category as Economy Takes its Toll. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. (2012). Companies participating in the USP verified program for dietary supplements. http://www.usp.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;. Manufacturers like these welcome new regulations as &quot;clean up measures,&quot;  but also fear that bad press from the failing companies may impact their business &lt;ref name = &quot;Sales&quot; /&gt;.

=====Product Adulteration=====
Adebowale et al. (2000) studied the labeled claims of eleven DS that contained chondriotin sulfate and found that the percentage of claimed chondriotin sulfate in the products ranged from 33% to 110% of the claim main ingredients &lt;ref name=&quot;Adebowale&quot; &gt;Adebowale, A. O., PhD, Cox, D. S., MS, Liang, Z., MS, &amp; Eddington, N. D., PhD. (2000). Analysis of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate content in marketed products and the Caco-2 permeability of chondroitin sulfate raw materials. Journal of American Nutraceutical Association, 3(1), 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;. Findings such as these are common and  the FDA issues warning letters to companies that are known to produce adulterated DS products &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (2012, November 20). Warning letters - health fraud. For Consumers website: http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ProtectYourself/HealthFraud/ ucm255474.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Misleading Marketing===
DS are marketed with the use of testimonials and various product claims.  Although there is little scientific evidence to support many DS claims, DS advertisements and product claims are vague and leave room for consumer misinterpretation &lt;ref&gt; (February 1, 2011 ). How Weight Loss Ads Slip Past the FTC. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic &lt;/ref&gt;.   

=====Product Testimonials=====
DS manufacturers often use customer testimonials in advertising. A common technique is the use of before and after pictures. Celebrity endorsements are particularly effective.  For example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Garvey Steve Garvey], a former MLB player, known as &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; for his sterling reputation, was enlisted by Enforma Natural Products in the 1990s to endorse &quot;The Enforma System.&quot; Together, they claimed the system caused weight-loss without dieting or exercise.  The FTC banned the company from advertising the weight loss supplements citing the use of misleading claims &lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2000, April 4). Marketers of &quot;The Enforma System&quot; settle FTC charges of deceptive advertising for their weight loss products, [Press Release].&lt;/ref&gt;. Although some DS advertising testimonials are genuine, many are just an appeal to consumers to purchase their products.

=====Fine-Print=====
Clinical or pre-market tests are often performed in-house, so the “proof” and experimentation of these claims is often unclear &lt;ref name= &quot;ODS&quot;&gt; Office of Dietary Supplements. (2011, June). Frequently asked questions. http://ods.od.nih.gov/ &lt;/ref&gt;. Products with fine print, such as clinically proven or clinically tested on labels and in advertisements, frequently lack specificity, leaving room for consumer misinterpretation, which can eventually lead to adverse effects. In 2009, the FDA warned consumers about the &quot;clinically tested&quot; Hydroxycut products following 23 cases of serious health problems, which prompted manufacturers to the recall the products &lt;ref&gt; (February 1, 2011 ). Weight-Loss Sales in 2010 Return to 2003 Levels in Wake of Hydroxycut Recall. Nutrition Business Journal, www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic &lt;/ref&gt;. As previously mentioned, the USP and the NPA offer &quot;seals of approval&quot; to companies for meeting quality manufacturing standards; however, many consumers may mistake this to mean the product is safe or effective &lt;ref name = &quot;ODS&quot;/&gt;.

=====Snake Oil Salesman=====
DS salespeople have been known to make misleading promises to close a sale. These fraudulent sales techniques are similar to those of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil snake oil salesmen]. To investigate fraudulent sales techniques, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office Government of Accountability Office (GAO)] informants (disguised as elderly people) called DS companies for supplement advice.  The informants were often told by the salespersons that their products would prevent or cure serious conditions.  A video of some of these calls can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=x7S1GyQaDE8 here] &lt;ref&gt; Government Accountability Office, Examples of Deceptive or Questionable Marketing Practices and Potentially Dangerous Advice, Rep. No. GAO-10-662T (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Regulatory Concerns===
The GAO published a report expressing concern about the FDA’s lack of authority and limited access to information, recommending that the FDA Commissioner request additional authority to oversee DS products and new DS ingredients &lt;ref&gt; Government Accountability Office, FDA Should Take Further Actions to Improve Oversight and Consumer Understanding, Rep. No. GAO-09-250 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;.  Further, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)] has expressed concerns to the US Senate about a study which estimated that only 1% of adverse events from DS products are reported to the FDA &lt;ref&gt;Consumer Safety and Weight-Loss Supplements: Hearings before the Oversight of Government Management (2012) (testimony of Michael F. Mangano, Principal Deputy Inspector General Department of Health and Human Services).&lt;/ref&gt;. Senator [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin Richard Durbin] of Illinois attempted to deal with these concerns by adding Senate Amendment 2127 to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, but the amendment was defeated 77-20 &lt;ref&gt;Sen Durbin, R. Senate Amendment 2127 (2012). 112th Congress. http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:sp2127:&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Social Influences on the Consumption of DS==
In the US, 20% of people are regular consumers of DS, 32% are occasional users of DS, and 48% do not use DS &lt;ref name = &quot;blendon&quot; /&gt;.

===Truthiness===
There is a widespread belief by consumers that DS, even if untested, can improve health. This is the concept of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness truthiness] popularized by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert Stephen Colbert] - when you feel it in your gut, you know it must be right.  Most people who take DS do not discuss their DS usage with their doctor because they believe their doctors would not know anything about supplements or would be biased against them &lt;ref name = &quot;blendon&quot;&gt;Blendon, Robert J., DesRoches, Catherine M., Benson, John M., Brodie, Mollyann, Altman, Drew E. Altman. (2001). Archives of Internal Medicine, 161(6). doi:10-1001/&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, 67% of people who take DS would continue to do so even if the FDA found them to be ineffective &lt;ref name = &quot;blendon&quot; /&gt;.

===Placebo Effect===
Some people believe in the power of DS so strongly that they experience what is known as the [[Lentis/Placebos|placebo effect]]. The placebo effect occurs when a patient sees an improvement in their health after a medically ineffective therapy due to their belief in the ability in the treatment to improve their health. The placebo effect can explain why some DS manufacturers can claim success stories even if their product contains no medically active ingredients.

===Risk Compensation===
Many Americans use DS a form of risk compensation, feeling DS are adequate to make up for an unhealthy diet.  Experts, however, say DS products to do not make up for the health effects of a poor diet &lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, M. S. (2004). Nutrition and cancer: A review of the evidence for an anti-cancer diet. Nutrition Journal, 19(3), 1-21. doi:10.1186/1475-2891-3-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, B., Nielsen, F., Spence, J., &amp; Turnlund, J. (2012, November 19) Founding American nutrition science. Agricultural Research Service/USDA website: http://www.ars.usda.gov&lt;/ref&gt;. People who took vitamin supplements were more likely to not exercise and less likely to eat healthier, organic meals &lt;ref name=&quot;Chiou&quot;&gt;Chiou, W.-B., Yang, C.-C., &amp; Wan, C.-S. (2011). Ironic effects of dietary supplementation: Illusory invulnerability created by taking dietary supplement licenses health-risk behaviors. Psychological science, 22(8), 1081-1086.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Chiou et al. (2011) demonstrates risk compensation is linked to DS products by showing people feel they are guaranteed &quot;health protection&quot; and think they are &quot;licensed [to] self-indulgence&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;Chiou&quot;/&gt;.

===Nutritional Insurance===


According to Harvard University researchers, people who eat well and take DS do so often as a form of “nutritional insurance,” just in case they are excluding any necessary nutrients from their diet &lt;ref&gt;Harvard School of Public Health. (2012). Nutrition Insurance Policy: A Daily Multivitamin. The Nutrition Source. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/multivitamin/&lt;/ref&gt;. A good example of this phenomena is children’s multivitamins – The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics American Academy of Pediatrics] does not recommend supplemental vitamin use for healthy children over a year old, yet 32% of children (70% of which are active) are given multivitamins by their parents because parents know they have more to gain by betting that DS work rather than by betting that they don’t worth, especially when the costs are so low &lt;ref&gt;Ulfat Shaikh, M., MPH; Robert S. Byrd, MD, MPH; Peggy Auigner, MS. (2009). Vitamin and Mineral Supplement Use by Children and Adolescents in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Arch Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, 163(2), 150–157.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Since the passing of DSHEA, the DS industry has significantly increased in market size &lt;ref name=&quot;Grollman&quot; /&gt;. People continue to take DS for psychological reasons, despite a lack of supporting evidence for most product claims. Supporters for the DS industry emphasize a desire for &quot;freedom of health choices&quot; and cite the historically low risk from consumption. However, there is broad support for DS industry regulations to ensure that supplements are safe, manufactured with good practices, and advertised truthfully. Americans seem to want the best of both worlds- they want their government to regulate DS safety yet have the freedom and access to choose any DS they desire.  Therefore, the DS industry is an example of a myriad of technologies that are continuously changing in product form and advertising due to the influence of surrounding social groups.

'''Managed C++''' is a shorthand notation for Managed Extensions for C++, which are part of the [[w:Microsoft .NET|.NET framework]] from [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]]. This extension of the C++ language was developed to add functionality like automatic garbage collection and heap management, automatic initialization of arrays, and support for multidimensional arrays, simplifying all those  details of programming in C++ that would otherwise have to be done by the programmer.

Managed C++ is not compiled to machine code. Rather, it is compiled to [[w:Common Intermediate Language|Common Intermediate Language]], which is an object-oriented machine language and was formerly known as MSIL.

[[File:Issues icon.jpg|right|100px]]

In the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda Project|Vrinda Project]], the team interviewed different stakeholders to understand who contributes to the Global Agenda for Development and what are the challenges of raising the required resources. See ⇒ the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/List of questions we have asked to Development Cooperation Stakeholders|List of questions we have asked]].
&lt;br /&gt;
We collected the answers and compiled them in 10 main issues where we compared the aptitudes of stakeholders from different nations while  assuming responsibility for global development and inter-cultural dialogue. Each issue was then included in one of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary|8 episodes of the Documentary]] where we illustrate the work in progress for the achievement of the 8 MDGs and we propose the establishment of 2 new development cooperation goals.&lt;br /&gt;
The discussion on the development cooperation issues is in progress and you are welcome to [[Development_Cooperation_Handbook/Overview_of_the_Handbook_Content#Feedback|contribute]].&lt;br /&gt;

In the main pages of the handbook we have defined the concepts, illustrate the work phases and shared the work tools. These are &quot;authored&quot; pages. Then we linked them to the &quot;issues&quot;,  where the testimonials give their different point of view.  The manual pages define and enclose: the issue pages widens the scope and open the debate. The manual pages synthesize, the issue pages discuss.  So we tried to generate a dynamic forward-backwards movement between questions and answers, thesis and antithesis, leaving the user to make  the synthesis and make her/his own opinion.

Here, below are the issues and the indications of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary|Documentary episode]] related to each one of them.

This material may need to be put in the accessories section or can be left as is. This is quite a full page but since a cable section already exists in the accessories section and consists of nothing more than a sentence redirecting to this page; it might be a better idea if this is all moved to accessories.

As I'm sure you noticed, images cannot be created the same way that regular pages are.  You have to upload them.  By default, the upload link will take you to Wikimedia Commons.  If you have material that they will not accept due to licensing (such as fair use material) ask an admin [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|here]] to upload it to Wikibooks locally.  You will have to provide a rationale for its inclusion at Wikibooks though.  I will delete the logi.gif page that was created in error.  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 12:51, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

=== Usage ===
Use this to show your kindness on Christmas or your evilness on Halloween. Just insert on your user page on those days and fill in the forms.

=== Parameters ===
Most of the time it looks like this:

{{HappyHolidays}}

That's from: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{HappyHolidays}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

However you must set an add and a signature like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{HappyHolidays|[Holiday image]|[Holiday Name]|[Your User Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It comes out with this:

{{HappyHolidays||Holiday Name|[[User:Downdate|Your User Name]]}}

End result:

{{HappyHolidays|Jack-o'-Lantern 2003-10-31.jpg|Halloween|''Downdate''}}

Of:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{HappyHolidays|Jack-o'-Lantern 2003-10-31.jpg|Halloween|''Downdate''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;</text>

 MOLD value /only /all /flat 

= DESCRIPTION: = 
Converts a value to a REBOL-readable string.

MOLD is a native value.

==Converts a value to what?==

The text &quot;Converts a value to a REBOL-readable string.&quot; is the help string of the function. When REBOL is the language, what does &quot;REBOL-readable&quot; mean? This is not hard to resolve, REBOL-readable means &quot;readable by the REBOL interpreter&quot;. To explain it further, it means that the string shall be recognized as a valid Load dialect, i.e., accepted as valid when processed by the LOAD function.

==The &quot;old&quot; syntax==

Originally, Rebol syntax was not able to directly describe some values. For example,

&lt;pre&gt;make object! [field: 1]&lt;/pre&gt;

is a Rebol expression that can be loaded yielding:

&lt;pre&gt;load &quot;make object! [field: 1]&quot; ; == [make object! [field: 1]]&lt;/pre&gt;

, which is a block containing three values: two words and a (sub)block. When evaluated by the DO function, the expression yields an object. The evaluation is based on semantic properties of the Do dialect evaluating the MAKE function (one of the most frequently used constructor functions in Rebol) supplying it two arguments: the type of the value to construct (OBJECT! in this case) and the specification block.

Depending on the way how we interpret it, the above source may either describe certain block (when interpreted as the Load dialect) or it can describe an object (when interpreted as the Do dialect). One may think that this ambiguity is easy to resolve by always using the Do dialect to interpret source text, however, only a slightly more contrived example bites us again:

&lt;pre&gt;string1: mold [make object! [field: 1]] ; == &quot;[make object! [field: 1]]&quot;
string2: mold reduce [make object! [field: 1]] ; == &quot;[make object! [^/        field: 1^/    ]]&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

STRING1 above is a result of molding the block containing three values, while the STRING2 is a result of moding a block containing just one element: an object. It does not matter whether STRING1 or STRING2 is interpreted by LOAD only or evaluated by DO, the result is always a block containing three elements: two words and a subblock, i.e., none of the approaches yields a block containing the object.

==The &quot;new&quot; syntax==

To overcome the difficulties with describing objects by Rebol syntax a new syntactic construction was introduced. It looks as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;#[object! [field: 1]]&lt;/pre&gt;

and as one may easily find out it describes the object in a &quot;syntactic way&quot;, i.e., the LOAD function yields an object when processing it:

&lt;pre&gt;type? load &quot;#[object! [field: 1]]&quot; ; == object!&lt;/pre&gt;

==The &quot;new&quot; syntax usage and name==

After the introduction of the new syntax, the behaviour of the MOLD function was not changed (to maintain backward compatibility, I guess) and the new syntax was used just by MOLD/ALL when bringing an advantage, i.e., in cases like the above.

Some of the users proposed the &quot;serialized syntax&quot; name for the &quot;new&quot; syntax type. Unfortunately, the &quot;serialized syntax&quot; notion is (Paraphrasing Lord Westbury, i love British humour!) just a &quot;redundant and pleonastic&quot; equivalent of the &quot;syntax&quot; notion (&quot;syntax&quot; and &quot;series&quot; are actually the same notions coming one from Greek the other from Latin in the similar way as the words &quot;redundant&quot; and &quot;pleonastic&quot;). Therefore, it is quite inappropriate to use a combination of them thinking it may have some special meaning.

Fortunately, when observing similarities between &lt;code&gt;make object! [field: 1]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#[object! [field: 1]]&lt;/code&gt; we can come to the conclusion that the latter is just describing a list of constructor arguments present in the former. The only part missing is the constructor. That is why the term &quot;constructor&quot; would not be adequate either. Hostile Fork noticing the similarity called the &quot;new&quot; syntax &quot;construction syntax&quot;, which looks adequate and also it can be used as a one-word term &quot;construction&quot; or alternatively as a shortened two-word term &quot;construction spec&quot; or &quot;construction format&quot; etc.

Domino walls, domino pillars, cones moving all over the place, rolling spheres, fragmenting balconies, falling objects... --Breath--

Yes there is a lot that we could have. But let me simplify. Here we learn how to make objects that fall on you or must be pushed over. So let's start.

==Objects To Push==
How do you make an object to push? By creating the model for a start. Make it and then put it in the position you would want it to be in. Set it as Dynamic in the physics. Now play and push it over. Should work.

Sustainability, in a broad sense, is the capacity of maintaining a certain process or state. It is now most frequently used in connection with biological and human systems. In an ecological context, sustainability can be defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future.&lt;br&gt; 

Sustainable development is a pattern of utilizing the existing natural and human resource capitals without decreasing their value for future utilizations. &amp;nbsp;(see also ⇒&amp;nbsp;[[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Development|defining development]]). 

The term was used by the Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as development that &quot;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; &lt;br&gt; 

Sustainable development implies economic growth together with the protection of environmental quality, each reinforcing the other. Sustainable development is maintaining a delicate balance between the human need to improve lifestyles and preserving natural and cultural ecosystems. The field of sustainable development can be conceptually broken into three constituent parts: environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and sociopolitical sustainability. The essence of this form of development is a stable relationship between human activities and the natural world, which does not diminish the prospects for future generations to enjoy a quality of life at least as good as our own. Participatory democracy is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.  (see ⇒  [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The participatory approach|participation]])

By “participated development” we mean a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. For an innovative community effective and comprehensive participation enables exchange of ideas and opinions both among themselves and also from external experts and resource persons, strong interpersonal rapport and sharing of information (communication), that is grounded in mutual respect and shared responsibilities (commitment), and working together towards common and mutual benefit (cooperation). (see also development). Getting the participation of the poor requires strengthening the organizational and financial capacities of the poor so that they can act for themselves. The constructive dialogue between civil society and local authorities is an essential prerequisite for a sustained and participated development.

&lt;br /&gt;

Participation is a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. Participation in political science is an umbrella term including different means for the public to directly participate in political, economical or management decisions. The term is also used in management theory (as in &quot;participatory management&quot;) to denote a style of management that calls for a high level of participation of workers and supervisors in decisions that affect their work. 

Sustainability is about fostering participation - with dialogue, cooperation and communication. 

For an innovative community effective and comprehensive participation enables exchange of ideas and opinions both among themselves and also from external experts and resource persons, strong interpersonal rapport and sharing of information (communication), that is grounded in mutual respect and shared responsibilities (commitment), and working together towards common and mutual benefit (cooperation). 

Participation is a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. 

Through the participatory process, , people can make informed commitments, and, by observing the participatory process, assessments can be made by Bank and government staff, among others, about the presence or absence of the commitment necessary to ensure sustainability. 

Getting the participation of the poor involves a lot more than finding the right technique. It requires strengthening the organizational and financial capacities of the poor so that they can act for themselves. In searching for ways to build local capacity, we found it useful to think in terms of a continuum along which the poor are progressively empowered. On one end of this continuum, the poor are viewed as beneficiaries--recipients of services, resources, and development interventions. In this context, community organizing, training, and one-way flows of resources through grant mechanisms are often appropriate. Although much good work has been done in this mode, the provision of benefits delivered to people in this way may not be sustainable in the long term and may not improve the ability of people to act for themselves. As the capacity of poor people is strengthened and their voices begin to be heard, they become &quot;action sponsors/beneficiaries&quot; who are capable of demanding and paying for goods and services from government and private sector agencies. Under these changed circumstances, the mechanisms to satisfy their needs will change as well. In this context, it becomes necessary to move away from welfare-oriented approaches and focus rather on such things as building sustainable, market-based financial systems; decentralizing authority and resources; and strengthening local institutions. We reach the far end of the continuum when these action sponsors/beneficiaries ultimately become the owners and managers of their assets and activities. This stage ranks highest in terms of the intensity of participation involved. A question we asked ourselves while preparing the Sourcebook was, how can we support and prepare poor people to own and manage assets and activities in a sustainable manner? In part, we found out that the more poor people are involved upstream in the planning and decisionmaking process, the more likely they are to own a development intervention, contribute to it, and sustain it; this alone, however, is not sufficient. Constraints exist at the policy level that impinge on the rights of people to organize, access information, engage in contracts, own and manage assets, and participate fully as members of civil society. Efforts are needed, therefore, to create an enabling policy environment that allows all stakeholders-especially poor and disadvantaged ones-to be part of the definition we noted at the outset. They too must be enabled to: ...influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. 

When all stakeholders collaborate in designing their collective future, it increases the chances of former differences being resolved and a new consensus emerging around issues everyone can agree on. This is probably so because people who have to live and work together can often find ways to agree if given the chance. Unfortunately, people do not often get the chance to work together to determine their collective future. Development projects prepared in the external expert stance do not provide that chance. The participatory process, however, facilitates working together. So participation can be a &quot;conflict avoidance&quot; process to the degree that it helps stakeholders with different interests explore and potentially find common interests.

The concept of “human development” (HD) was developed in the late 80s, by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in order to overcome and expand the traditional meaning of development focused only on economic growth. This different approach reflects an old tension within international organizations, including those which focus their attention primarily on economic growth, identifying it as development and those who are mainly interested in the aspects and the social consequences of development itself. 

(See the chapter [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Development|&lt;u&gt;Defining Development&lt;/u&gt;]] in the section &quot;Development and Aid&quot; of the handbook.)


[[File:Bernhard Hoeper - you cannot &quot;buy&quot; development.webm|thumb|left| You cannot &quot;buy&quot; development; beneficiary communities must own the projects - [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Bernhard Hoeper|B.Hoeper]] ]]
&lt;br /&gt;

The HD approach puts people at the heart of development and rests on the belief that the human dimension of development has been neglected in the past due to excessive emphasis placed on economic growth. Examples of this emphasis are the measure of GNP per capita, used as the primary measure of levels of development among states, and variables such as income or consumption calculated in monetary terms as a measure of wealth or poverty of individuals, families and different social groups. 

From this perspective, the primary objective of policies that support development was industrialisation and the trickle-down mechanism, or rather the “overflow of economic growth”, represented the means by which poverty would be progressively eliminated. 

From this principle, the basic needs concept was born in the 70s (developed by the ILO), which recognised the importance of using elements other than just income per capita for the assessment of development. Per capita income remains an important indicator of development, but only in terms of the acquisition and consumption of a sampling of goods and services essential to the achievement of an acceptable threshold of living. In particular, the ILO pointed out that the pursuit of greater access to basic needs on the part of the poorest groups of people would be facilitated by the achievement of an adequately remunerated employment status. It showed the importance of increasing the profitability of the work of the poor, the need to effect changes in the composition of output and ownership of productive factors and, finally, to make way for radical changes in the organizational structure of production. 

The UNDP distanced itself from the basic needs approach, rejected especially by the least developed countries by formulating the concept of human development and introducing a new index for measuring the development of countries, the HDI (Human Development Index). 

“Human development is the process of enlarging people's choices. Income is certainly one of these choices, but it does not represent the sum total of human experiences. Health, education, a healthy environment, the freedom of action and expression are also important.” (UNDP Report No. 3) 

Human development, therefore, represents a new sense of development and made it possible to redefine the priorities for action and move away from GDP growth to the improvement both of the quality of life, and of the conditions of social and ecological sustainability. Development, therefore, is not promoted by a one-way search of economic growth; the amount of growth is essential but its distribution is equally important, that is, full participation in the growth process. 

The primary objectives of development, considering its new meaning, thus become: the promotion of sustainable economic growth, improvement of the population's health, with priority attention to the most common problems and the most vulnerable groups, improvement of education of the population, with particular attention to basic education, literacy and development education and the promotion of human rights, with particular regard to the right to live peacefully together, the right to democratic participation, to equity of opportunity for development and integration in social life. 

&lt;br&gt;Human development is thus an aim for society, which is why the problem arises of how the process of economic growth - seen as an increase in GDP per capita - can help further this purpose and how human development itself can result in greater economic growth. Human development has thus become, in recent years, the goal of programs, policies and guidelines for development cooperation. 

An example is the decision, voted by the Copenhagen Conference of the United Nations for Social Development, to ensure at least 20% of development interventions are of a social nature. 

Another example are the objectives that the OECD in its Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation conference has set for the near future: 

*Ensuring basic education for all inhabitants of all countries by 2015; 
*Realizing irrefutable progress towards gender equality and strengthening the autonomy of women, the elimination of any gender discrimination in primary and secondary education by 2005; 
*Reducing by two thirds the child mortality rates and children under five and maternal mortality by three quarters by 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Development Cooperation Definitions}} 

Obligation to demonstrate that work has been conducted in compliance with agreed rules and standards or to report fairly and accurately on performance results vis à vis mandated roles and/or plans. For instance, a report to parliament, to a board or a constituency answers to the accountability obligation. 

Political accountability is the accountability of the government, civil servants and politicians to the public and to legislative bodies such as congress or parliament. 

In a few cases, recall elections can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the term for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. Constitution, or statute, can empower a legislative body to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent inquiry. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to impeach the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to resign before trial. Impeachment in the United States has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as district court judges. 

In parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a vote of no confidence in the government. 

Ethical accountability&lt;br&gt;Ethical accountability is the practice of improving overall personal and organizational performance by developing and promoting responsible tools and professional expertise, and by advocating an effective enabling environment for people and organizations to embrace a culture of sustainable development. Ethical accountability may include the individual, as well as small and large businesses, not-for-profit organizations, research institutions and academics, and government. One scholarly paper has posited that &quot;it is unethical to plan an action for social change without excavating the knowledge and wisdom of the people who are responsible for implementing the plans of action and the people whose lives will be affected.&quot; 

&amp;nbsp;Administrative accountability&lt;br&gt;Internal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servant within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bounded by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent “watchdog” units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interest. Apart from internal checks, some “watchdog” units accept complaints from citizens, bridging government and society to hold civil servants accountable to citizens, but not merely governmental departments.&lt;br&gt;</text>

In February 2005, international community came together at the Paris High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, hosted by the French government and organised by the OECD. The role of aid in promoting development was attracting increasing public scrutiny in the run-up to the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, and the global campaigns such as Make Poverty History. 

While some progress had been made in harmonising the work of the different international aid donors in developing countries, it was acknowledged that much more needed to be done. The aid process was still too strongly led by donor priorities and administered through donor channels, making it hard for developing countries to take the lead. Aid was still too uncoordinated, unpredictable and un-transparent. Deeper reform was felt to be essential if aid was to demonstrate its true potential in the effort to overcome poverty. 

At the Paris meeting, more than 100 signatories—from donor and developing-country governments, multilateral donor agencies, regional development banks and international agencies—endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Paris Declaration went much further than previous agreements; it represented a broader consensus among the international community about how to make aid more effective. At its heart was the commitment to help developing-country governments formulate and implement their own national development plans, according to their own national priorities, using, wherever possible, their own planning and implementation systems. 

The Paris Declaration contains 56 partnership commitments aimed at improving the effectiveness of aid. It lays out 12 indicators to provide a measurable and evidence-based way to track progress, and sets targets for 11 of the indicators to be met by 2010. 

The Declaration is focused on five mutually reinforcing principles: 

• Ownership: Developing countries must lead their own development policies and strategies, and manage their own development work on the ground. This is essential if aid is to contribute to truly sustainable development. Donors must support developing countries in building up their capacity to exercise this kind of leadership by strengthening local expertise, institutions and management systems. The target set by the Paris Declaration is for three-quarters of developing countries to have their own national development strategies by 2010. 

• Alignment: Donors must line up their aid firmly behind the priorities outlined in developing countries’ national development strategies. Wherever possible, they must use local institutions and procedures for managing aid in order to build sustainable structures. In Paris, donors committed to make more use of developing countries’ procedures for public financial management, accounting, auditing, procurement and monitoring. Where these systems are not strong enough to manage aid effectively, donors promised to help strengthen them. They also promised to improve the predictability of aid, to halve the amount of aid that is not disbursed in the year for which it is scheduled, and to continue to “untie” their aid from any obligation that it be spent on donor-country goods and services. 

• Harmonisation: Donors must coordinate their development work better amongst themselves to avoid duplication and high transaction costs for poor countries. In the Paris Declaration, they committed to coordinate better at the country level to ease the strain on recipient governments, for example by reducing the large numbers of duplicative field missions. They agreed on a target of providing two-thirds of all their aid via so-called “programme-based approaches” by 2010. This means aid is pooled in support of a particular strategy led by a recipient country—a national health plan for example—rather than fragmented into multiple individual projects. 

• Managing for results: All parties in the aid relationship must place more focus on the end result of aid, the tangible difference it makes in poor people’s lives. They must develop better tools and systems to measure this impact. The target set by the Paris Declaration is for a one-third reduction by 2010 in the proportion of developing countries without solid performance assessment frameworks to measure the impact of aid. 

• Mutual accountability: Donors and developing countries must account more transparently to each other for their use of aid funds, and to their citizens and parliaments for the impact of their aid. The Paris Declaration says all countries must have procedures in place by 2010 to report back openly on their development results. 

A first round of monitoring of the 12 Paris Declaration indicators was conducted in 2006 based on activities undertaken in 2005 in 34 countries. A second survey was organised in early 2008 in which 54 developing countries examined progress against the targets at country level. This 2008 Survey covers more than half all the official development assistance delivered in 2007—nearly USD 45 billion. The evidence so far suggests that progress has been made. For example, more than one third of developing countries surveyed had improved their systems for managing public funds; almost 90% of donor countries had untied their aid; and technical cooperation is more in line with developing countries’ own development programmes. Despite these improvements, however, the results of the Survey show that the pace of progress remains too slow to reach the targets set in 2010. In particular, although many countries have made significant efforts to strengthen their national systems (for instance by improving how they manage their public funds), in many cases donors are still reluctant to use them. The predictability of aid flows also remains low (with just over a third of aid disbursed on schedule), thereby making it hard—or impossible—for governments to plan ahead. In summary, whilst some progress has been made there are still many areas where the pace of change must be accelerated if the targets set for 2010 are to be reached. In addition to the data from the monitoring survey a useful way of understanding donor and recipient country performance is to examine donor and recipient country self-assessments, donor evaluations and Development Assistance Committee Peer Reviews. 

In some quarters, the Paris Declaration is almost synonymous with aid effectiveness; it is expected that aid will be effective and achieve development outcomes when the principles are observed for government sector aid. However, there continue to be criticisms and alternative views, particularly from non-government aid organisations. Implementation of the Paris Declaration still needs to be significantly stepped up, according to the results of the 2008 Monitoring Survey. Concrete targets set for 2010 (such as an increased proportion of aid to be untied; establishment of &quot;mutual accountability&quot; mechanisms in aid recipient countries; and for two-thirds of aid to be delivered in the context of so-called programme approaches rather than projects) may be difficult to meet. Independent NGOs, such as Eurodad, also release their own evaluations, showing that the Declaration is not being implemented as planned. The Overseas Development Institute has specified that better monitoring of the relationship between the Paris Principles and development results at sector level is necessary.&lt;br&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Through community based outreach, consultative processes, local capacity building, creating an enabling environment and carrying out financial interventions, a development actor/ entity/ organization creates platforms and mechanisms of interaction among communities and their municipalities for sustainable development. The methodology of facilitating constructive dialogue and proactive participation contributes to increased community engagement and municipality effectiveness for local economic development based on common local interest and a wider community consensus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Through sector specific value chain analysis in rural economic sectors, based on stakeholder consultations and supported by technical assistance and financial interventions, new economic opportunities can be created, contributing to improved local livelihoods and an increase in incomes and jobs. These analyses combined with investment priorities identified by citizens within the same sectors can help determine real needs and economic opportunities in rural areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When national policies contribute to empowering communities and foster good local governance through local development, it becomes possible to use local resources efficiently and effectively for sustainable national development. As capacity of people is strengthened and their voices begin to be heard, they become capable of being owners and managers of their resources and of choosing the life they have reason to value. Constraints exist at the policy level that impinge on the rights of people to organize, access information, own and manage assets and participate fully as members of civil society. The more people are involved upstream in the planning and decision making process, inform and improve policies, legislative frameworks and implementation processes and procedures, the more likely they are to own a development intervention, contribute to it and sustain it. Efforts are thus required to create an enabling policy environment that allows all stakeholders to participate as active partners of development processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Economy==

The economy of ancient Greece was characterized by the extreme importance of importing goods, all the more so because of the relative poverty of Greece's soil. Beginning in the 6th century BCE, craftsmanship and commerce (principally maritime) developed and became increasingly more important in the classical period.

The idea of an &quot;economy&quot; as it is understood today is relatively anachronistic when used to refer to ancient Greece. The Greek word ''oikonomia'' (οἰκονομία) designates mainly the ''oikos'' (οἶκος), meaning the home or hearth. Thus Xenophon's dialogue entitled ''Oeconomicus'' is concerned with household management and agriculture. The Greeks had no precise term to designate the processes of production and exchange. The economist Murray Rothbard, however, notes that ancient Greek philosophers grappled with questions that today would be identified as economy.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Olive trees.jpg|thumb|Olive trees were one of the bases of Greek agriculture.]]

Greek soil's &quot;stinginess&quot; or &quot;tightness&quot; explains Greek colonialism and the importance of the cleruchies of Asia Minor in controlling the supply of wheat. The olive tree and grapevine were complemented by the cultivation of herbs, vegetables, and oil-producing plants. In fact, the Greeks would cut down all their enemies' olive trees to deprive them of olive oil. Husbandry was badly developed due to a lack of available land. Sheep and goats were the most common types of livestock. Woods were heavily exploited, first for domestic use and eventually to build triremes. Bees were kept to produce honey, the only source of sugar known to the ancient Greeks.

Since it was so labor-intensive, agriculture employed up to 80% of the Greek population. Agricultural work followed the rhythm of the seasons: harvesting olives and trimming grapevines at the beginning of autumn and the end of winter, setting aside fallow land in the spring, harvesting cereals in the summer, cutting wood, sowing seeds, and harvesting grapes in autumn.

In the ancient era, most land was held by the aristocracy. During the 7th century BCE, demographic expansion and the distribution of successions created tensions between these landowners and the peasants. In Athens, the crisis was resolved by Solon's reforms, which eliminated debt bondage and protected the peasant class. Nonetheless, the Greek aristocrat's domains remained small compared with the Roman latifundia.

===Crafts===
[[File:NAMA Travail de la laine.jpg|thumb|Woman working with wool, 480-470 BCE, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

Much of the craftsmanship of ancient Greece was part of the domestic sphere. However, the situation gradually changed between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE, with the increased commercialization of the Greek economy. Thus, weaving and baking, activities, so important to the Western late medieval economy, were done only by women before the 6th century BC. After the growth of commerce, slaves started to be widely used in workshops. Only fine dyed tissues, like those made with Tyrian purple, were created in workshops. On the other hand, working with metal, leather, wood, or clay, was a specialized activity, and looked down upon by most Greeks. The basic workshop was often family-operated. Lysias' shield manufactory employed 120 slaves; Demosthenes' father, a maker of swords, used 32. After the death of Pericles in 429 BC, a new class emerged: that of the wealthy owners and managers of workshops. Examples include Cleon and Anytus, noted tannery owners, and Kleophon, whose factory produced lyres.

Free workers were paid by assignment, since the workshops could not guarantee regular work. In Athens, those who worked on state projects were paid one drachma per day, no matter what craft they practiced. The workday generally began at sunrise and ended in the afternoon.

====Pottery====

The potter's work consisted of selecting the clay, fashioning the vase, drying and painting, baking it, and applying varnish. Part of the production went to domestic usage (dishes, containers, oil lamps) or for commercial purposes, and the rest served religious or artistic functions. Techniques for working with clay have been known since the Bronze Age; the potter's wheel is a very ancient invention. The ancient Greeks did not add any innovations to these processes.

The creation of artistically decorated vases in Greece had strong foreign influences. For instance, the famed black-figure style of Corinthian potters most likely was derived from the Syrian style of metalworking. The heights to which the Greeks brought the art of ceramics is therefore due entirely to their artistic sensibilities and not to technical ingenuity.

Pottery in ancient Greece was most often the work of slaves. Many of the potters of Athens assembled between the agora and the Dipylon, in the Kerameikon. They most often operated as small workshops, consisting of a master, several paid artisans, and slaves.

====Metalworking====

Deposits of metal ore are common in Greece. Of these, the best known are the silver mines of Laurium. These mines contributed to the development of Athens in the 5th century BCE, when the Athenians learned to prospect, treat, and refine the ore. Fortuitously, the composition of the earth below the mines rendered drainage unnecessary, an important provision given that ancient mine drainage techniques did not allow for excavation below the level of subsoil waters. The passageways and steps of Greek mines were dug out with the same concern for proportion and harmony found in their temples. The work was extremely difficult, due to the tunnels' depth—they were sometimes more than 100 meters (110 yd). The miner, armed with his pick and iron hammer and hunched over in two, labored to extract lead ore. The Laurium mines were worked by a large slave population, originating for the most part from Black Sea regions such as Thrace and Paphlagonia. With these metals, Weapons, armor tools and a variety of other goods were created.

Other Greek mines include:

* Gold: Sifnos, Thasos
* Silver: Cyprus, Sifnos
* Iron: Euboea, Rhodes
* Copper: Chalcis, Euboea, and Cyprus

===Trade===
====Maritime trade====
[[File:AGMA Poids plomb 1.jpg|left|thumb|Commercial lead weight found in the Agora, National Archaeological Museum of Athens.]]

Very early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of importing wheat forced the Greek world to engage in maritime trade. The areas which provisioned Greece with wheat were Cyrenaica, Egypt, Italy (specifically the Magna Graecia area and Sicily), and regions surrounding the Black Sea. Athens and Corinth served as waystations of exchange for the isles of the Aegean Sea. Other imported products included papyrus, spices, fabrics, metals, and shipbuilding materials such as wood, linen, and pitch, grain was also imported. For their part, Greek cities exported wine, pottery, and olive oil. Athens sold marble extracted from Penteli, renowned in the Greek world, and also silver coins, known for their elegant workmanship and high proportion of silver. These served not only as a means of exchange, but also as a source of metal: in places that did not use money, they were melted back into silver. Available sources do not provide enough information to evaluate with moderate precision the volume of goods exchanged in Greek trade.

The main participants in Greek commerce were the class of traders known as ''emporoi'' (ἕμποροι). The state collected a duty on their cargo. At Piraeus (the main port of Athens), this tax was set initially at 1%, then at 2%. By the end of the 5th century, the tax had been raised to 33 talents (Andocides, I, 133-134). In 413, Athens ended the collection of tribute from the Delian League and imposed a 5% duty on all the ports of her empire (Thucydides, VII, 28, 4) in the hope (unrealized) of increasing revenues. These duties were never protectionist, but were merely intended to raise money for the public treasury.

The growth of trade in Greece led to the development of financial techniques. Most merchants, lacking sufficient cash assets, resorted to borrowing to finance all or part of their expeditions. A typical loan for a large venture in 4th century BCE Athens, was generally a large sum of cash (usually less than 2,000 drachmas), lent for a short time (the length of the voyage, a matter of several weeks or months), at a high rate of interest (often 12% but reaching levels as high as 100%). The terms of the contract were always laid out in writing, differing from loans between friends (''eranoi''). The lender bore all the risks of the journey, in exchange for which the borrower committed his cargo and his entire fleet, which were precautionarily seized upon their arrival at the port of Piraeus.

Trade in ancient Greece was free: the state controlled only the supply of grain. In Athens, following the first meeting of the new Prytaneis, regulations on trade were reviewed, with a specialized committee overseeing the trade in wheat, flour, and bread.

The number of shipwrecks found in the Mediterranean Sea provides valuable evidence for the development of trade in the ancient world. Only 2 shipwrecks were found that dated from the 8th century BCE. However archeologists have found 46 shipwrecks dated from the 4th century BCE, which would appear to indicate that there occurred a very large increase of the volume of trade between these centuries. Considering that the average ship tonnage also increased in the same period, the total volume of trade increased probably by a factor of 30.

====Retail====

Information about retail activity in ancient Greece is limited. While peasants and artisans often sold their own wares, there were also retail merchants known as ''kápêloi'' (κάπηλοι). Grouped into guilds, they sold fish, olive oil, and vegetables. Women sold perfume or ribbons. They paid a fee for their space in the marketplace. They were viewed poorly by the general population, and Aristotle labeled their activities &quot;a kind of exchange which is justly censured, for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another.&quot;

Parallel to the &quot;professional&quot; merchants were those who sold the surplus of their household production, be it vegetables, olive oil, or bread. This was the case for many of the small-scale farmers of Attica. Among townsfolk, this task often fell to the women. For instance, Euripides' mother sold chervil from her garden (cf. Aristophanes, ''The Acharnians'', v. 477-478).

===Taxation===

Direct taxation was not well-developed in ancient Greece. The ''eisphorá'' (εἰσφορά) was a tax on the wealth of the very rich, but it was levied only when needed — usually in times of war. Large fortunes were also subject to liturgies, that is, the support of public works. Liturgies could consist, for instance, of the maintenance of a trireme, a chorus during a theater festival, or a ''gymnasium''. In some cases, the prestige of the undertaking could attract volunteers. Such was the case for the choragus, who organized and financed choruses for a drama festival. In other instances, like the burden of outfitting and commanding a trireme, the liturgy functioned more like a mandatory donation. In some cities, like Miletus and Teos, heavy taxation was imposed on citizens.

On the other hand, indirect taxes were quite important. Taxes were levied on houses, slaves, herds and flocks, wines, and hay, among others. The rights to collect many of these taxes were often transferred to publicans, or ''telônai'' (τελῶναι). However, this was not true of all cities. Thasos' gold mines and Athens' taxes on business allowed them to eliminate these indirect taxes. Dependent groups such as the Penestae of Thessaly and the Helots of Sparta were taxed by the city-states to which they were subject.

===Currency===
[[File:Syracusa Drachma 405 82000306.jpg|thumb|Syracusa Drachma coin (405-367 BCE).]]

Coinage probably began in Lydia around 600 BCE, and circulated in the cities of Asia Minor under its control; early ''electrum'' coins have been found at the Temple of Diana at Ephesus. The technique of minting coins arrived in mainland Greece around 550 BCE, beginning with coastal trading cities like Aegina and Athens. Their use spread, and the city-states quickly secured a monopoly on their creation. The very first coins were made from ''electrum'' (an alloy of gold and silver), followed by pure silver, the most commonly found valuable metal in the region. The mines of the Pangaeon hills allowed the cities of Thrace and Macedon to mint a large quantity of coins. Laurium's silver mines provided the raw materials for the &quot;Athenian owls&quot;, the most famous coins of the ancient Greek world. Less-valuable bronze coins appeared at the end of the 5th century.

Coins played several roles in the Greek world. They provided a medium of exchange, mostly used by city-states to hire mercenaries and compensate citizens. They were a source of revenue: foreigners had to change their money into the local currency at an exchange rate favorable to the State. They served as a mobile form of metal resources, which explains discoveries of Athenian coins with high levels of silver at great distances from their home city. Finally, the minting of coins lent an air of undeniable prestige to any Greek city or city state.

==Social Structure==

Only free, land owning, native-born men could be citizens entitled to the full protection of the law in a city-state (later Pericles introduced exceptions to the native-born restriction). In most city-states, unlike the situation in Rome, social prominence did not allow special rights. Sometimes families controlled public religious functions, but this ordinarily did not give any extra power in the government. In Athens, the population was divided into four social classes based on wealth. People could change classes if they made more money. In Sparta, all male citizens were given the title of equal if they finished their education. However, Spartan kings, who served as the city-state's dual military and religious leaders, came from two families.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rural life and Agriculture==

Agriculture was the foundation of the Ancient Greek economy. Nearly 80% of the population was involved in this activity.

===Environment===

The Mediterranean climate is characterized by two seasons: the first dry and hot, from April to September (river beds tend to dry up); the second is humid, and is marked by often violent rain storms brought in by west winds, with mild, frost-free temperatures. As such in the mountains winters can be rigorous and snowy. Attica, Cyclades, the south of Peloponnese, and Crete are more dry than the rest of Greece.

===Agricultural products===
====Farming====
[[File:Amphora olive-gathering BM B226.jpg|thumb|Scene of olive-gathering by young people. Attic black-figured neck-amphora, ca. 520 BCE, from Vulci, Italy (British Museum).]]

During the early part of Greek history, as shown in the Odyssey, Greek agriculture - and diet - was based on cereals (''sitos'', though usually translated as wheat, could in fact designate any type of cereal grain). In reality, 90% of cereal production was barley. Even if the ancients were aware of the better nutritional value of wheat, the growing of barley was less demanding and more productive. Attempts have been made to calculate Attican grain production in the period, but results have not been conclusive. It did not take long for demand to outpace production capabilities, as arable land was limited. The &quot;tightness&quot; of the land (στενοχωρία / ''stenokhôría'') also explains Greek colonization, and the importance Anatolian cleruchies would have for the Athenian empire in controlling grain provision.

On the other hand, the Greek land was well suited for olive trees, which provided olive oil. The growing of olive trees dates back to early Greek history. Olive plantations are a long-term investment: it takes more than twenty years for the tree to provide fruit, and it only fruits every other year. Grapes also do well in the rocky soil, but demand a lot of care. Grapes have been grown since the Bronze age.

These core crops were augmented by vegetable gardens (cabbage, onion, garlic, lentils, chick pea, beans) and herb gardens (sage, mint, thyme, savory, oregano). Orchards included those of fig, almond, apple, and pear trees. Oilseed plants such as linseed, sesame, and poppy were also grown.

====Animal husbandry====
[[File:Bronze billygoat Louvre Br197.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze billygoat found in the deme of Kephissia, 5th century BCE, Louvre.]]

Animal husbandry, seen as a sign of power and wealth in the works of Homer, was in fact not well developed in ancient Greece. While the Mycenean civilisation was familiar with the rearing of cattle, the practice was restricted as a result of geographic expansion into less suitable terrain. Goats and sheep quickly became the most common livestock; less difficult to raise and providers of meat, wool, and milk (usually in the form of cheese). Pork and poultry (chicken and geese) were also raised. Oxen were rare and normally used as a work animal, though they were occasionally used as sacrificial animals. Donkeys, mules and their mixes were raised as pack or draught animals.

Horses were raised on the plains of Thessaly and Argolis; it was a luxury animal, signifying aristocracy. ''The Clouds'', a comedy by Aristophanes, illustrates the equestrian snobbery of Athenian aristocrats: Pheidippides, the son of the hero is addicted to race-horses and so ruins his father Strepsiades.

It is likely that most farms practiced some limited animal husbandry; poultry or small animals grazing on waste land or fed kitchen scraps. Combined farm/livestock operations also existed, as well as those specializing in livestock. An inscription also mentions a certain Eubolos of Elateia, in Phocis, the owner of 220 head of cattle and horses and at least 1000 sheep and goats. Flocks of sheep were herded between the valley in winter and the mountains in summer. Taxes existed for the transit or stopover of flocks in cities.

====Other products====

Wood was exploited, primarily for domestic use; homes and wagons were made of wood as was the ''aratrum'', or light plough. The Greek forests located in the highlands were denuded by goats and charcoal production; it was not long before it had to be imported especially for ship production (see trireme).

Beekeeping provided honey, the only source of sugar known to the Greeks. It also was used in medicines and in the production of mead. The Ancient Greeks did not have access to sugarcane. The Hymettus region of Attica was known for the quality of honey produced there. Wax was also produced, used in the lost wax process to produce bronze statues as well as in medicines.

Bronze was used for farm tools and weaponry.

===Agricultural work===
[[File:Olive tree, Thasos.jpg|thumb|The olive; a foundation of Greek agriculture — here in Thasos, Greece.]]

Hesiod's ''Works and Days'', 8th century BCE and Xenophon's ''Economy'' of the 4th century BCE provide information about working off the land.

The olive harvest took place from late autumn to the beginning of winter, either by hand or by pole. They were placed in wicker baskets and left to ferment for a few weeks before being pressed. The screw press, although referred to as the Greek press by Pliny the Elder (XVIII, 37) was a late (2nd century BCE) Roman invention. Oil was preserved in terra cotta vases for use later. This was also the time for pruning of trees and vines and harvesting of legumes.

Spring was the rainy season; farmers took advantage of this to bring fallow ground back into production. They practised biennial crop rotation, alternating from year to year between fallow and cultivated. Attempts to introduce triennial crop rotation with legumes in the third year, ran into problems due to the poor Greek soil, lack of power, and absence of mechanization. The Greeks did not use animal manure, possibly due to the low number of cattle. The only soil additive was weeds ploughed back into the ground after fields came out of fallow.

In summer, irrigation was indispensable. In June, they harvested with sickles; the scythe was not used. Wheat was threshed with animal power; it was trampled by oxen, donkeys or mules, and the grain stored. Women and slaves ground it and made bread.

In early autumn, they collected deadfall and prepared supplies of firewood; while winters were mild on the coast they could be brutal in the highlands. Farmers also had to break the hard crust that had formed over the summer on grain fields. To do this required three passes; the ard plough was wooden (iron ploughshares were rare). A hoe and mallet were also used to break clumps of earth. The fallow land for next year was sown by hand. This was the time of the grape harvest, the grapes were crushed by foot in large vats then the wine was left to ferment in jugs. After that process, people could drink the ambrosial wine and enjoy it.

In the nearly four centuries that passed between Hesiod and Xenophon, no improvements can be found in agriculture. Tools remained mediocre and there were no inventions to lighten the work of either man or animal. It was not until the rise of Romans that the water mill came into wide use, employing hydraulic power to augment muscle power. It took until the Middle Ages for true plows which turned the earth to be widely adopted. Neither irrigation, nor soil improvements, nor animal husbandry saw notable advances. Only the very richest of land, such as that of Messinia was capable of supporting two crops per year.

===Agricultural property===

With the exception of Athens, and a few areas where aerial surveys have permitted analysis of historical land distribution, agricultural property allocation is not well known. Before the 5th century BCE, it is certain that the land belonged to great landowners, such as the Attican Eupatrides. Nevertheless, land use varied regionally; in Attica domains were divided among smaller plots, whereas in Thessaly they had single tenants.

From the 8th century BCE, tensions grew between the great landowners and the peasants, who were finding it more and more difficult to survive. This can probably be explained by population growth brought on by reduced infant mortality, and aggravated by the practice of equally subdividing land amongst several inheritors each generation (attested to by both Homer and Hesiod). In Athens, the crisis was resolved with the arrival of Solon in 594 BCE. He forbade slavery for debt and introduced other measures intended to help the peasants. In the 5th century BCE, the practice of liturgy (λειτουργία / ''leitourgia'' - literally, &quot;public work&quot;) placed the responsibility for provision of public services heavily on the shoulders of the rich, and led to a reduction in large scale land ownership. It is estimated that most citizens of hoplite rank owned around 5 hectares of land. In Sparta, the reforms of Lycurgus led to a drastic redistribution of land, with 10 to 18 hectare lots (''kleroi'') distributed to each citizen. Elsewhere, tyrants undertook redistributions of land seized from wealthy political enemies.

From the 4th century BCE onwards property starts to become concentrated among few land owners, including in Sparta where according to Aristotle, the land has passed into the hands of a few (''Politics'', II, 1270a). Nevertheless, the aristocratic estates in Greece never achieved the scope of the great Roman latifundia; during the classical period, the wealthy Alcibiades possessed only 28 hectares (Plato, ''Alcibiades I'', 123c). In all cases, land remains intimately associated with the concept of wealth. The father of Demosthenes possessed 14 talents and for land owned only a home, but he was the exception. When the banker Pasion made his fortune, he hurried to buy land.

Some Greek land was public and/or sacred. Each city possessed such land and it is estimated that in Athens during the classical period these lands represented a tenth of cultivable land. This was an administrative division and the property of the city itself (for example in Attica, it was a ''deme'') or a temple. These lands were leased to individuals.

In the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda Project|Vrinda Project]], the team interviewed different stakeholders to understand who contributes to the Global Agenda for Development and what are the challenges of raising the required resources. See  [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]  ⇒ the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/List of questions we have asked to Development Cooperation Stakeholders|List of questions we have asked]].
&lt;br /&gt; We collected the answers and compiled them in [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Issues|10 main issues]] where we compared the aptitudes of stakeholders from different nations while  assuming responsibility for global development and inter-cultural dialogue. Each issue was then included in one of the [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The Vrinda project Documentary| episodes of the documentary]] where we illustrate the work in progress for the achievement of the 8 MDGs and we propose the establishment of 2 new development cooperation goals.

An important object containing information about a weighted graph ''G(V,E,w)'' is its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix Laplacian matrix]. Given a numbering of the vertices of the graph, it's an ''n'' by ''n'' square matrix ''L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''n'' is the number of vertices in the graph, with the entries:

: &lt;math&gt;l_{kl}:=
\begin{cases}
\sum_{v_k \rightarrow v_l} w_{kl} \mbox{  if}\ k = l, \\
-w_{kl} \mbox{  if}\ v_k \rightarrow v_l, \\
0,  \mbox{  otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; → ''v''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; means that there is a directed edge from vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; to the vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, and where ''w'' is the weight function.

'''Exercise (*)'''. Given a directed graph ''G'' without cycles, prove that one can number its vertices so that the corresponding Laplacian matrix ''L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is triangular.

Given a weighted graph with boundary it is often convenient to number its boundary vertices first and to write its Laplacian matrix in the block form. 

: &lt;math&gt;
L_G = 
\begin{pmatrix}
A &amp; B \\
C &amp; D
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (*).''' Prove that a function/vector ''u'' is harmonic at the interior nodes of a graph ''G'' if 

:&lt;math&gt;
u|_{int G} = -D^{-1}Cu|_{\partial G}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let

: &lt;math&gt;M=\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

be a block matrix with an invertible square block ''D''.

Then the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement Schur complement] of the
matrix ''M'' w/respect of the block ''D''  is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt; M/D = A-BD^{-1}C.&lt;/math&gt;

The Leibniz definition of '''determinant''' (a multilinear function in the rows and columns) of a square ''n'' by ''n'' matrix ''M'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\det M = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma) \prod_{k=1}^n M_{k,\sigma_k}.&lt;/math&gt;
 
'''Exercise (*).''' Prove the following determinant identity for a square matrix ''M'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\det M = \det(M/D) \det D.
&lt;/math&gt;

The following matrix ''W(G)'' consisting of random walk exiting probabilities (sums over weighted paths in a graph) plays an important role as boundary measurement for inverse problems. Suppose a weighted graph ''G'' has ''N'' boundary nodes, then the ''kl'' 'th entry of the ''N'' by ''N'' matrix equals to the probability that the first boundary vertex, that a particle starting its random walk at the boundary vertex ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' occupies, is the boundary vertex ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''.
For a finite connected graph the columns of the matrix ''W(G)'' add up to ''1''.

'''Exercise (**).''' Derive an explicit formula for the matrix ''W(G)'' in terms of the blocks of Laplace matrix ''L(G)'' of the graph ''G''.

: &lt;math&gt;
W_G = I - D_A^{-1}(A - BD^{-1}C).
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (***).''' Prove the following expansion formulas for entries and blocks of the matrix ''W(G)'', 

* for two boundary vertices ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a graph ''G'' 

: &lt;math&gt; 
w_{kl} = \sum_{v_k\xrightarrow[]{path} v_l}\prod_{e=(p,q)\in path}w(e)/l_{pp},
&lt;/math&gt;

* for two distinct boundary vertices ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a graph ''G''

:  &lt;math&gt;
w_{kl}\det D = \frac{1}{l_{kk}}\sum_{v_k\xrightarrow{path}v_l}\prod_{e\in path}l(e)\det D(\tilde{path},\tilde{path}),
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{path} = V-(\partial G\cup path).&lt;/math&gt; 

* for two disjoint subsets of boundary vertices ''P'' and ''Q'' of size ''n'' of a graph ''G'', see [6],[7] and [14]

: &lt;math&gt;
\det W(P,Q) \det D = \pm\frac{\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n}}(-1)^{\sgn(\sigma)}\sum_{p_k\xrightarrow{paths}q_{\sigma_k}}\prod_{e\in paths}l(e)\det D(\tilde{paths},\tilde{paths})}{\prod_{p\in P}l_{pp}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde{paths} = V-(\partial G\cup paths).&lt;/math&gt; 

The exercises above provide a bridge b/w connectivity property of graph ''G'' and ranks of submatrices of its Laplacian matrix ''L(G)'' and the matrix of hitting probabilities ''W(G)''.

'''Exercise (*).''' Let ''G'' be a planar graph w/natural boundary, numbered circulary. Let ''P'' and ''Q'' be two non-interlacing subsets of boundary nodes of size ''n''. Prove that

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\det\Lambda_G(P,Q) \ge 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

w/the strict inequality iff there is a disjoint set of paths from ''P'' to ''Q''.

'''Exercise (*).''' Show that the numbers of paths in the following graph are equal to the binomial coefficients. 
[[File:Pascal paths (1).jpg|300px|center| The numbers of the paths of the graph are binomial coefficients]]

Gluing the graphs w/out loops corresponds to multiplication of the weighted paths matrices. 

'''Exercise (**).''' Use the result of the previous exercise to it to prove the following [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_triangle Pascal triangle] identity, see[13],

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 1     &amp; 1  &amp;  1 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots \\

 1     &amp; \ldots  &amp; \ldots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \\
\end{pmatrix}
 = 
\begin{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;

'''Exercise (***).''' Give a proof of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem Menger's theorem] based on the results of the exercise above: Let ''G'' be a finite  graph and ''p'' and ''q'' two vertices that are not neighbors. Then the size of the minimum vertex cut for ''p'' and ''q'' (the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects ''p'' and ''q'') is equal to the maximum number of pairwise vertex-independent paths from ''p'' to ''q''.</text>

      <comment>Added WIKI BOOKS note.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! (Important Note: This is my WIKI BOOKS page. I am also interested in, and contributing to: Wikimedia Commons, Wikiversity, and Wikipedia, so far. [[User:Ray Calvin Baker|Ray Calvin Baker]] ([[User talk:Ray Calvin Baker|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ray Calvin Baker|contribs]]) 00:08, 14 November 2012 (UTC)) 

I was searching for &quot;puzzles&quot; on Google, and one of the many links there directed me to a page for the bare beginnings of a book on &quot;Puzzles&quot; in Wikibooks. 
Most of my work occurs in the Wikiversity, so if you are really curious about me, I suggest that you consult my user page (and articles) there. 

I noticed that the &quot;Puzzles&quot; page was (at least once) nominated for deletion (IMHO, deletion would be a great loss), nevertheless, the page is currently in need of a major overhaul. I think it best to read through all the discussions regarding the &quot;Puzzles&quot; page, before I attempt any serious update. However, I am sure such an update is necessary, to support my plans to create a &quot;Department of Puzzles&quot; in the &quot;School of Creativity&quot; of the Wikiversity. 

With regard to PUZZLES, I am interested mainly in 3-D interlocking block puzzles (less so, bent wire entanglement puzzles and string entanglement puzzles) (much less so, word puzzles, crossword puzzles, and jigsaw puzzles). I have an offline map file, to which I am current ently adding links of interest to me. I hope to &quot;see you soon&quot; at the Wikiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Text Processing Instructions ===

SSE 4.2 adds four string text processing instructions &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt;. These instructions take three parameters, &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; an xmm register, &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; an xmm or a 128-bit memory location and &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; an 8-bit immediate control byte. These instructions will perform arithmetic comparison between the packed contents of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the input/output as well as the operation of two intermediate stages of processing. The results of stage 1 and stage 2 of intermediate processing will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; respectively. These instructions also provide additional information about the result through overload use of the arithmetic flags(&lt;code&gt;AF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;). 

The instructions proceed in multiple steps:
#&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; are compared
#An aggregation operation is applied to the result of the comparison with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;
#An optional negation is performed with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;
#An output in the form of an index(in &lt;code&gt;ECX&lt;/code&gt;) or a mask(in &lt;code&gt;XMM0&lt;/code&gt;) is produced

==== IMM8 control byte description ====

IMM8 control byte is split into four group of bit fields that control the following settings:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[1:0]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the 128-bit source data(&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[1:0]
!Description
|-
| 00b || unsigned bytes(16 packed unsigned bytes)
|-
| 01b || unsigned words(8  packed unsigned words)
|-
| 10b || signed bytes(16 packed signed bytes)
|-
| 11b || signed words(8  packed signed words)
|}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[3:2]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the aggregation operation whose result will be placed in intermediate result 1, which we will refer to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;. The size of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; will depend on the format of the source data, 16-bit for packed bytes and 8-bit for packed words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[3:2]
!Description
|-
| 00b ||  &lt;b&gt;Equal Any&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a character set, arg2 is the string to search in. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg2[i] is in the set represented by arg1:
               arg1    = &quot;aeiou&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Example string 1&quot;
               IntRes1 =  1010001000010000
|-
| 01b ||&lt;b&gt;Ranges&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a set of character ranges i.e. &quot;09az&quot; means all characters from 0 to 9 and from a to z., arg2 is the string to search over. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg[i] is in any of the ranges represented by arg1:

               arg1    = &quot;09az&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Testing 1 2 3, T&quot;
               IntRes1 =  0111111010101000
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Each&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is string one and arg2 is string two. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg1[i] == arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;The quick brown &quot;
               arg2    = &quot;The quack green &quot;
               IntRes1 =  1111110111010011
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Ordered&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a substring string to search for, arg2 is the string to search within. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if the substring arg1 can be found at position arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;he&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;, he helped her &quot;
               IntRes1 =  0010010000001000
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[5:4]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the polarity or the processing of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;, into intermediate result 2, which will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[5:4]
!Description
|-
| 00b || &lt;b&gt;Positive Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 01b || &lt;b&gt;Negative Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = -1 XOR IntRes1
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Positive&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Negative&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1 if reg/mem[i] is invalid else ~IntRes1 
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[6]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the output selection, or how &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; will be processed into the output. For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, the output is an index into the data currently referenced by &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, the output is a mask reflecting all the set bits in &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Bit Mask, the least significant bits of XMM0 contain the IntRes2 16(8) bit mask. XMM0 is zero extended to 128-bits.
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Byte/Word Mask, XMM0 contains IntRes2 expanded into byte/word mask
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[7]&lt;/code&gt; should be set to zero since it has no designed meaning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

This report presents the finding of a Women's Tribunal in New York City which calls for systemic changes to end poverty. The findings were presented to the UN Secretary-General and the President of the UN General Assembly on the occasion of the High-level Event on the Millennium Development Goals held on September 25, 2008. The verdicts of this, as in the other Tribunals, arrive at the same general conclusion: the eradication of poverty cannot succeed without equality and justice for women. Prepared by Rosa G. Lizarde, Director, ENLACE and North American Representative of the Feminist Task Force-GCAP &lt;br&gt;

'''UNDP Survey on Knowledge and Information Level of Romanian Citizens on EU Development Policies'''&lt;br&gt; 

A relevant quantitative research report conducted by UNDP to determine the knowledge and information level of Romanian citizens regarding the development policy of the European Union, the visibility of the European policy for development in Romania and the knowledge level regarding the Millennium Development Objectives. 

Also, the study is meant to reveal the public attitude towards shift of Romania’s statute from recipient to fund donor and the most adequate messages to promote the new statute of Romania as a international donor. https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B3jANqe7Hsl3NTQxZWY1NDItNzQxMi00NjliLThmNWYtYTRhN2Q2YmNjNWQ3&amp;amp;hl=en&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; 

Related to any Call for proposal financed by EuropeAid it is recommended, for the optimization of Concept Notes to be sent to EC, to pay attention to the evaluation criteria usually applied by the European Commission to evaluate (and in case approve or reject) the quality of a New proposal asking for Funds. 

&lt;br&gt; 

In the following you can read a list of these criteria.&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt; 

= Relevance of the action  =

- How relevant is the proposal to the objectives and priorities of the Call for Proposals? 

- How relevant to the particular needs and constraints of the target country/countries or region(s) is the proposal? (including synergy with other EC initiatives and avoidance of duplication) 

- How clearly defined and strategically chosen are those involved&lt;br&gt;(final beneficiaries, target groups)? Have their needs been clearly defined and does the proposal address them appropriately? 

- Does the proposal contain specific added-value elements such as&lt;br&gt;environmental issues, promotion of gendere quality and equal opportunities, needs of disabled people, rights of minorities and rights of indigenous peoples... 

&lt;br&gt; 

= Design of the action  =

- How coherent is the overall design of the action? In particular, does it reflect the analysis of the problems involved, take into account external factors and relevant stakeholders? 

- Is the action feasible and consistent in relation to the objectives and expected results? 

&lt;br&gt; 

= &lt;br&gt; Financial and operational capacity  =

- Do the applicant and partners (if any) have sufficient experience of project management? 

- Do the applicant and partners have sufficient technical expertise (notably knowledge of the issues to be addressed)? 

- Do the applicant and partners have sufficient management capacity (including staff, equipment and ability to handle thebudget for the action)? 

- Does the applicant have stable and sufficient sources of finance? 

&lt;br&gt; 

= &lt;br&gt;Sustainability  =

- Is the action likely to have a tangible impact on the stakeholders involved? 

- Is the proposal likely to have multiplier effects (including scope for replication and extension of the outcome of the action and dissemination of information)? 

- Are the expected results of the proposed action sustainable?

      <text xml:space="preserve">This username began to spread in the mid 90's. It all started with a guy named Leif, was very fond of Latin. He read, wrote and studied everything that was on Latin and its history.

Leif gladly shared with him the information he learned to everything and everyone, even if you were not interested. To skojja little with him mention the name leifiuz during a dinner break and then spread it throughout the school. All the students began to call him Leifiuz and then it has also become a user on the Internet.

The name is used today on the Internet by the majority of people on different sides. Rumor has it that some of these users are in China.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What are restrictive and non-restrictive elements?==
An ''element'' is a word, phrase, or clause, whose meaning either narrows the meaning of another part of the sentence (restrictive) or provides extra information (non-restrictive). Following are examples of sentences with the element in bold.
* Non-Restrictive: The dog, '''which I rescued from the shelter''', is named Terrance. (commas)
* Restrictive: The dog '''that I rescued from the shelter''' is named Terrance. (no-commas)

Whether an element is restrictive or not changes the meaning of a sentence. Consider these two examples:
* Matthew's brother''', Alfred,''' arrived late last night.
* Matthew's brother '''Alfred''' arrived late last night.
In the first case, the author is indicating that Matthew only has one brother. The name &quot;Alfred&quot; is in commas to indicate it is extra information; since Matthew only has one brother, you don't need to know the name to figure out which one the sentence is talking about.

In the second case, the one without commas, the author is indicating that Matthew has at least two brothers, so we need the name to know which one we're talking about. This is called a &quot;restrictive element&quot; because it restricts (or limits) the meaning of the word &quot;brother&quot; in the sentence to Alfred. 

==Examples of errors with commas and restrictive or non-restrictive elements==
* The youngest puppy Tiddly is the most adorable pet I have ever seen. (There can only be one youngest puppy, so the element &quot;Tiddly&quot; is extra information and should be set off by commas.)
* Out of all the bowls of soup served tonight, only the one, that has the hair in it, was sent back to the kitchen. (The element &quot;that has the hair in it&quot; should not be in commas, since you need this information to know which bowl was sent back to the kitchen.)

==Fixing commas with restrictive or non-restrictive elements==
You'll need to figure out first what the element in question is doing in the sentence. If you need it to restrict the meaning of another part of the sentence, take away the commas. If it's just there to provide extra information, put commas around it.
* The youngest puppy, Tiddly, is the most adorable pet I have ever seen.
* Out of all the bowls of soup served tonight, only the one that has the hair in it was sent back to the kitchen.

==Tips==
It's generally considered correct to use &quot;that&quot; for restrictive elements and &quot;which&quot; for non-restrictive elements. 
* The essay '''that won the award''' was authored by an international student.
* The best essay in the class, '''which was authored by an international student''', is on display in the English department.

==== Importance of NGOs, their Challenges and Limitations  ====
[[File:Do we really need NGOs to support development processes?-TVP.ogv|thumb|left|Development needs civil society active and responsible engagement ]]
'''Do we really need NGOs to support development processes?''' &lt;br /&gt;
A robust civil society is very important in terms of both democratization and hearing the voice of the people. Civil society as an inclusive definition with NGOs, media, freedom of the press (India’s major strength). If you suppress freedom of the press, internet, twitter, etc. you suppress development. Civil society is massively crucial for the success of a nation state.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Present Role and future challenges of NGOs-TVP.ogv|thumb|Present Role and future challenges of NGOs ]] '''What are the challenges ahead for the NGOs?'''&lt;br /&gt;
NGOs are really having to define their role in a new world order, particularly international NGOs, like Oxfam where we have traditionally capacity built south based organisations for 60-70 years. So the question for us is what is our role now. NGOs cannot continue to deliver services because they undermine the role of the state in doing so. So challenges for big NGOs like BRAC or Grameen Bank in Bangladesh is that they do an awful lot of service delivery that in fact government should do. So my own sense in working for NGOs is that we are moving much more to policy and advocacy and that is the real role we should be playing. We should be arguing to governments like India, that you should be putting in more than 1% of your GDP growth into health, for example, and that is where we have a strong and valid voice – it is about accountability and transparency of governments on how they operate, how they spend aid and where they invest for the future.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Limitations of NGOs-TVP.ogv|thumb|Limitations of the NGOs ]] '''What are the limitations of the NGOs?'''&lt;br /&gt;
NGO limits are whether they have a strong voice. They are good at speaking on behalf of people but they are not democratic institutions in their own right. We do critique the government and the private sector but when it comes to our own internal structure, our own accountability and internal structure, we do not audit ourselves externally very well. I can say that we have good and robust programmes on the ground but that is because it is me saying it. But if I had the same response from Cocacola, BP, Shell or even government, I would be highly skeptical about their statistics. So, if we are going to hold other stakeholders and other sectors, the public sector to account, I think we ourselves have to be more transparent and honest about our structures.

==== What are the factors which generate poverty? ====
[[File:Julian Parr - India is not having an equitable and inclsive economic growth.ogv|thumb|India's failure is around equitable and inclusive economic growth]]

The failure for India, although it has made advances and taken good steps forward, is around equitable and inclusive economic growth. We are seeing a massive rise in the Indian economy but that growth is very uneven. It is about the Geni Coefficiency curve. If you see, there is a dip coming in that Geni Coefficiency curve which is very worrying. If you get that dip, you move towards highly unstable societies and you start getting high unemployment, less inclusion we start moving towards failed states like Afghanistan, Pakistan that is tottering on the brink as well. And this is because there is a huge dispossessed and disgruntled element of society. So you see some of the goals being met but in terms of infant mortality, maternal mortality – the numbers are really horrifying. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

====   What kind of knowledge is required to remove poverty?  ====

[[File:Julian Parr - The new skills required in India for sustaining development.ogv|thumb|Scaling-up workforce and giving access to knowledge and resources: A major challenge for India]]

  
One of the biggest challenges that developing economies like India have, and South Asia generally, is that they have a huge young population where half the population is less than 15 years old. So, India has got to create jobs on a large scale - challenges it has never faced before. In order to do that is has to scale its workforce up. It has got to move them from the informal low-grade economy into the formal economy. India is at the moment famous for its intellectual exports around IT, medical...but that is just a tiny tip of the iceberg... so it is going to be about vocational training, access to the internet, only just about 5% of Indians have access to internet right now. It is getting that access to knowledge and resources that is a huge challenge. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Do you think availability of resources play a role in the generation or removal of poverty? ====
[[File:Julian_Parr_17_Relation_btw_availability_of_resouces_and_poverty.ogv||thumb|Availability of water will be a huge challenge for South Asia]]

Access to resources, pro-poor policies, putting in place social services and social safety nets, etc. - make a huge difference. India is taking some steps in the right direction. Specifically concerning the MDGs, around access to water, for example, there have been positive steps. I think more people now have access to potable water in India. The wider issue, the wider problem for the future of the whole South Asia is going to be water. It is going to be a huge challenge for the region
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Do you think that local communities have say in how the aid is used?  ====
[[File:Julian Parr - The challenge of including the beneficiay choices in development plans.ogv|thumb|The challenge of including the beneficiary choices in development plans]]
That is one of the biggest challenge, I would say. We get it badly wrong in occasion... because if you want to be inclusive and genuine then you need to work at very grass root level and you need to do you over a very long period of time because you want to include the voices of the most disfranchised. To get that authentic voice takes trust, takes time, takes investment... and very often agencies don't have that length of time to achieve the scope of goals they want to. The challenge of listening and being inclusive of community voices means that you have a much stronger solution to their problem... and I genuinely believe that all communities can actually find their own solution if you create the right space around them, the enabling environment and create the resources to make change, they can often come up with the right answers.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

====  Do you think common people can influence policies taken in favor of building a Global Partnership for Development? ====
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Julian Parr - Can an Indivudual make a Difference in the World?.ogv|thumb|Can an Individual make a difference?]]
I think everybody not only can make a difference but has a right to make a difference and should make a difference. It is about how you leverage change. Everyone can do their little bit about the environment, recycling, using water more carefully and all that can add up to change. So for someone like me - who trained as a lawyer - I think I am most effective by holding systems to account. I like prosecuting governments to make sure they really work and are accountable- so around issues of sexuality, bonded and migrant labour, robust laws actually exist. It is just that they are not utiltised. Ocassionally you get test cases up and challenge governments and go to the hearts of the institutions.  And then only can you make a change on a larger scale. 

I think that individuals can make a difference, can make a change, on a small very scale, in their personal choices, in the way they chose to live their personal lives. There are individuals who are community mobilisers, they are dynamic and inspirational. They can make a change. I think that by grouping my efforts around such individuals, like social activists and change makers, you can make a difference.

It's a challenge, isn't it. You have to be very sensitive on how much you challenge and how much you assist countries to achieve MDGs. I think it is how you approach... is about dialogue, about communication, it is certainly not taking a dictatorial or accusatory attitude towards any country or nature.



&lt;br /&gt;

====  What are the factors establishing Coherence for Development? ====

[[File:Julian Parr - Coherence for Development.ogv|thumb|Julian Parr - Need to educate the law makers, law breakers and the population]]

There is no point in putting together a very robust act or legislation to bring about change if you cannot implement the act. Equally if you don’t build institutions and the capacity of institutions to implement and have knowledge about the law of their own country, you will have blockages and breaks. At the same time, if you don’t educate a populous about what their rights are, they don't know that the law exists. You need to do all things simultaneously. You need to be able to educate the law makers, the law breakers and also the population. 

If we put this into an example and look at the domestic violence bill against women - there is no point, for example, in educating a population about what their rights are if those rights are not supported and recognized by the local police station, by the local magistrates. If they don’t know how to implement the law, you have almost achieved nothing. In fact, you have given knowledge out but you have raised exceptions without any realization of change, and that will create frustration. So, the challenge is to work and look on both sides of this value chain... at the national and the state policies. But in order for them to be effective, you need to educate the public about what their rights and their access to rights are. And if you don't do one without the other, it is pointless.

==== What are the important areas of cooperation between India and the EU?  ====
[[File:Daniele Smadja - Areas of Cooperation between India and EU -- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|Areas of Cooperation between India and EU ]]

We have many types of project, but for simplicity let me divide them in three. At first we have budget support at the central level; this is the case for education and health. The second type is at the state level by budget support, providing technical assistance and transferring and exchanging our practices; and we have two state programs right now, one with Rajasthan in the field of water and with Chhattisgarh in health and education. At both, the national and state level, we are not just signing the cheque, we are present in the policy making by helping them with our experience, technical assistance and our models on how to go about their policies. The third level is supporting financially the civil society organizations; we regularly have projects with them. We also try and organize the best synergies and compliment the three levels of cooperation. As an example, when we work with NGOs in education we will target the population which remains outside the main stream services, like the tribal population or remote communities.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== What do you think are [[Development_Cooperation_Handbook/The_factors_causing_poverty_and_suffering|the factors which create poverty?]] ====
[[File:D_Smadja-the_factor_of_poverty.ogv||thumb| What are the Factors which Create Poverty?]]
&quot;The first two things which come to my mind, since i am in India is 'Inclusion'. What strikes me here is that even thought there is a very high economic growth for many years but they do not manage to make the benefit of this growth inclusive and as a result there are 400 million people under 1 dollar a day.

The second thing is education. So many people are uneducated, the illiteracy rate is quite high. In addition to this there are also so many disparities between people. There are other factors too, but inclusion and education are the most important which come to my mind.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Why should an EU citizen fund the education of the poor children in India?   ====


[[File:Daniele Smadja - Why should EU Citizens Fund the Education of India's Poor Children?-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|I think that supporting the education of a child is a wonderful objective, a wonderful approach to defend human rights]]

I think that supporting the education of a child is a wonderful objective, a wonderful approach to defend human rights; because education is a fundamental right of every child.&lt;br /&gt;
The second element is that the money has been worth spending for in 2003 there were 25 million children out of school in India. Thanks to the program of the Government of India and the EU in 2009 there were only 8 million children out of school. 
  
[[File:Daniele Smadja - Opinion on Aid coming from an other Country and an other Culture-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|left|Opinion on Aid coming from an other Country and an other Culture]]
&lt;br /&gt;

The third element is that when a child is educated, when a teenage is going to college and when out with a degree a student is getting a job; i don't think we should think in terms of competitors. We should think in terms of wealth, in terms of world economic growth. The more children are coming to the labor market with a degree, with skills... then you make the world economy run. Today there is so much interdependence between countries; it is important that there is economic growth in India and china for when our countries are lagging behind, and when they are in the middle of a crises it is then important that other countries are the locomotive of the economic growth.  Whenever you give money to somebody you have less for you; but you may have less now... but it will bring you more tomorrow. And your child who is going to school in Europe, tomorrow might need the growth that an Indian child is going to produce. In terms of economic cooperation, today, we always have to look for win win situations.

==== What is your opinion on aid coming from an other country and an other culture? ====

[[File:Daniele Smadja - Opinion on Aid coming from an other Country and an other Culture-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|There has been a lot of discussions over the last 5-7 decades about aid]]

There has been a lot of discussions over the last 5-7 decades about aid.

The most important element is to do what the government of the country we are engaged in wants to do and has decided to do. We cannot impose policies, we have to support the national policies of the country and respect the obligations of the donor country. This doesn't mean that whatever they do we sign the cheque.

Every country has to take charge of the development of their country. The effectiveness of aid then comes from the capacity of the donor country to contribute to the national policies and strategies and to make sure that whatever we are contributing to has a chance of success. Then only we can bring an added value by filling the financial gap (even if on a small scale), bring expertise, experience and policies we use in Europe.

You are with the WHAT and I'm with the HOW... and until you don't know WHAT there is no way I can help you on HOW to do it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

----

==== EU commitment towards Global Partnership for Development ====
[[File:Daniele Smadja - EU Commitment Towards Global Partnership for Development-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|EU Commitment Towards Global Partnership for Development]]
The EU was very committed towards the MDGs when they were put together in the UN. &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Daniele Smadja - EU's Contribution Towards SSA -- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|left| EU's Contribution Towards SSA ]]
What we have in mind with this Global Partnership for Development is that our development assistance should always go hand-in-had and support the national strategies and policies of the country.  We come with the projection of our values, the European values, but we don't come with our own model to impose; we come to support.

&lt;br /&gt;

Why do we do it India? India has 400 million people under poverty, this represents a quarter of the entire population around the world. Europe cannot turn a blind eye to that. 

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

----

&lt;br /&gt;

==== Social integration is the resource ====
[[File:Daniele Smadja - Knowledge and Social Harmony as Resources-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|Social integration is the resource]]

Education is a fundamental right and that is very important. If you say that social cohesion is a resource to go up the economic ladder in the sense that it has to be available for all and it everyone should have the possibility to have it.  Even though we have a number of problems in Europe, even though we have a number of disparities in our society; social cohesion has been for many years in the heart of the architecture of the European Union. Social inclusion and social coherence has been in the heart of Europe and European policies.

We are directly putting money in the big envelope of the government. But this is not limited in just signing a cheque to the government. We are a very important party in a number of discussion of the steering committee which is in charged of the implementation of the program. But we are also helping in designing and monitoring the program. Through our presence we can influence, but this does not mean imposing a model but offering our experience, proposing technical assistance, showcasing are lesson learned and also bad experiences from where they can learn and be a source of inspiration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once you begin programming seriously, you are likely to find yourself writing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again. For instance, suppose you keep  needing to collect 4 numbers from the program's user, and display both the sum and the product of these numbers. (Note: this is not meant to be a representative example. It is just an example meant to be simple enough for beginning programmers to understand). It is easy enough to do this once or twice, with code like this: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int a, b, c, d;
a = b = c = d = 0;
cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c &gt;&gt; d;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sum: &quot; &lt;&lt; (a + b + c + d) &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Product: &quot; &lt;&lt; (a * b * c * d) &lt;&lt; endl;  
&lt;/source&gt;

However, typing all of those commands every time you wish to do this is a bad idea. For a sequence of commands this small, you might believe that the only potential problem could be your hands getting tired from typing too much. This is indeed a problem, but it could arguably be solved by copying and pasting code from one file to another instead of typing it directly. However, for larger sequences of commands, especially complex ones, even this strategy causes problems:

* Modifications: If the requirements for a program change, affecting everywhere the sequence of commands is used, you may forget to update it in one or two of the places. Or you may remember to update it everywhere, but introduce potentially fatal typos into the program as you do so.

* Bloat: The program's source code gets much longer than you, or anyone else reading the code, would like it to be.

* Difficulty Implementing Certain Functionality: Some algorithms (ordered lists of instructions to follow to complete a task) are very difficult to implement using sequential lines of code, even though they are not necessarily complex tasks.

Fortunately, there is a way in C++ (and almost every other noteworthy programming language in existence) to define a sequence of commands that you can run anywhere in your program. This is called ''defining a function.'' 

As an example, we can define a function that will print out our sum and product as shown above. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void sumAndProd(void)
{
    int a, b, c, d;
    a = b = c = d = 0;
    cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c &gt;&gt; d;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sum: &quot; &lt;&lt; (a + b + c + d) &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Product: &quot; &lt;&lt; (a * b * c * d) &lt;&lt; endl;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Once this function has been defined, you can execute (or ''call'') it by typing its name followed by &quot;()&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
sumAndProd();
&lt;/source&gt;

(The semicolon terminating the statement is not part of the function call.)

Now you can copy the above code into any file where you might need its functionality. You can then call the function using the above syntax as many times as you want.
Here's a complete program incorporating this function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

void sumAndProd(void)
{
    int a, b, c, d;
    a = b = c = d = 0;
    cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c &gt;&gt; d;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sum: &quot; &lt;&lt; (a + b + c + d) &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Product: &quot; &lt;&lt; (a * b * c * d) &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you must place the definition of sumAndProd above where it is first used. Otherwise, your compiler will likely complain about a &quot;reference to an undeclared identifier&quot; or the like. However, there is an alternate method to tell your program that a function exists without defining it right away; this technique will be explained in more detail below.

== '''For you, what is important to convey regarding International Cooperation for Development? What are the aims of development cooperation'''?  ==

''Spreading an interest in reciprocity in international cooperation (useful to both rich countries and poor); the ethical duty of implementing it effectively; the need to implement actions that reduce the abysmal gaps between the rich and poor worlds on the planet as a common necessity of survival.'' 

The purpose of international cooperation must be to contribute to the respect of fundamental human rights (enshrined in UN Declarations) in all arenas on the planet. More concretely, to contribute to achieving the Millennium Goals within the time limits established. 

Reduce poverty through the complementary objectives of promoting good governance and active participation of citizens. Fighting poverty also requires a balance between activities aimed at human development, protection of natural resources and creating economic growth and welfare in favor of the poorest people on the planet. 

Finally, conveying that it is essential to focus on the issue of respect for human rights, not as a charitable concession, but as an ethical duty of direct responsibility toward all humanity. Why is international cooperation useful to both rich and poor countries? International cooperation is one of the most appropriate instruments to create the preconditions of a democratic world government, which the planet is in desperate need of . The problems are global and must be addressed in that dimension. The epoch-making processes that affect environmental sustainability, migration, the fight against extreme poverty, respect for fundamental human rights should not apply only to parts of the planet but the whole. 

The rights and sovereignty of nation-states have amply demonstrated the need to resort to supranational bodies to ensure the sustainability of the planet's future. 

This obliges a search for new rules based on social justice and respect for the inalienable right of every man and every woman on the planet to be the subject and the end of every action and every decision taken in rich countries as well as in those of the “South of the world”. A system of rules and decision-making mechanisms in which the weak and the strong have equal rights and equal opportunities, where the criterion of “one dollar one vote” is not the only one that is imposed in areas of decision–making. 

For this we recognise in the United Nations system, reformed in the light of the criteria of greater democracy, better effectiveness and efficiency and greater transparency, the main institutional body in the protection and promotion of peace and justice in the world. 

The authority of the United Nations must be accompanied by an effective desire on the part of single governments to recognise its decisions, and to take responsibility for keeping the commitments undertaken at the international level. But all this would be futile if not preceded and accompanied by concrete measures put in place by governments to reject war and the use of violence to solve national and international conflicts; to implement international agreements banning the use of landmines and light weapons trade as a first step to banning all types of arms trade and for the reduction of the arms race and military spending in the name of unnecessary defense projects . 

Solidarity and international cooperation promoted by the peoples and states must be recognized and supported as the most effective way of overcoming conflicts in many parts of the world. 

The method of participation and involvement of civil society, from both the Global North and South, should set the goals that characterize future work. Governments and supranational bodies must dialogue and interface with the representatives of civil society in their decision–making, particularly relating to the elaboration of policies regarding international cooperation. 

Rich countries can not delude themselves into living well in their locked-up strongholds, leaving out two thirds of humanity in sub-human conditions and without rights. Only by addressing the issue of universal human rights and their effective recognition can we build peace and security on the planet. 

And the strategy adopted cannot be charitable but based on justice and the recognition of the rights of peoples and of every individual. 

It is indispensable to invoke consistency and compliance with what has been freely taken on by governments in signing international treaties (Millennium Declaration) as well as advocacy and lobbying on the part of civil society organizations.

== '''How do you think it is possible to pursue MDGs through a cooperative project?'''  ==

''One of the problems, which is also a challenge, of international cooperation is that of effectively combining the fields and problems of local issues and global ones. ''Ensure that the planning that is done at the macro level to achieve certain goals reaches the local sphere and is transformed into concrete operations. That the general objectives are transformed into specific objectives, achievable and verifiable at any given time. And this is possible by applying the planning logic summarized in the Project Management Cycle taken on by every entity of international cooperation. To this we add the need of combining the project logic with the processes of partnership that should ensure the continuity of operations. This tool has enabled the definition of objectives and of expected results, but it has the limit of trying to solve complex problems in little time. Hence the need to combine the project logic with processes and partnership. Not just partnership, but strategic partnership that should last. It needs to be built by sharing processes, sharing visions, sharing common struggles with the aim of reaching the end goals, that generally are not easy to achieve. More specifically, the question arises as to how much approved funding reaches the direct beneficiaries. How much should be set aside to guarantee the existence and functioning of the society running the project? The resources are aimed at solving very serious problems: lack of basic food, housing, health. But the partners also tell us develop them politically as organizations in order to become the strong players in the countries in which they are. We are on a ridge where it is necessary to define and choose whether cooperation should be participatory and democratic or whether it should be technocratic and efficient. Everything hinges on these points. Do you take into consideration only the logical frameworks, the indicators of effectiveness and efficiency or do you also count the participatory processes that are created? Democratic and civil growth processes. Gifts have always been very important but they are never free. When you give something, you expect to receive in return, in a different form, never the same. In societies where gifts have a real value the debt circulates forever and is never extinguished. So it is an expression of the generosity of the donor who claims involvement and is never disinterested. I believe the strength of a gift as a reciprocal act is an essential component in the discourse on cooperation and partnership. Reciprocity that is not in the thing given or how much is given. But in the special human quality that the gift represents as relationship. And therefore in the existence of a specific interest in giving life to the relationship between giver and receiver. Building the essence of the gift as reciprocity, in fact. This is the challenge of the partnership. In that there is the value of the bond that brings different parties to meet and discuss. Unfortunately the market, the dominant type of economic relations in the world, takes into account only the useful value and the exchange value of things. Forget the fundamental reality that is not measured in GDP, which are the relational needs that exist. In a world that is becoming ever smaller the problem of relations between humans and the environment is essential. Rediscovering that we live in a world with common problems that we must solve together. I think of the Millennium Goals that the global community has proposed to achieve by 2015. They are clear and defined. Assessments that have been made after four years lead to say that we are not going in the right direction for lack of invested resources and for lack of quality in the operations. So walking together, interfacing with each other, being found in great numbers in this event should not remain an end in itself. It must become a reciprocal invitation to participate more, to discuss and to ensure that the current situation changes. The fragmentary nature of the interventions (mostly in response to emergencies and not directed towards sustainable development) and global objectives: How do we improve the effectiveness and significance of the impact in the long term? None of the major goals of the recent “decades of development” proclaimed by the United Nations has been realized. From the monitoring done in the past nine years even the Millennium Goals are unlikely to be achieved. Many conclude that this is a failure of the various development models that the West has tried to impose at every latitude. Development has always been seen as an economic and financial problem. For years GDP has been the only indicator for verifying the well-being of a country. The proposal of human development that the United Nations has carried out since 1990 changes the point of view to seeing people, all people, as the primary subjects of this process. And the world of cooperation has needed to, and still needs to, update their models and revise their goals. Shelve the logic that the market can be the regulating entity of relationships between people; the “trickle down” logic has failed: the goal of creating wealth that will then spread, automatically delivering prosperity to all. Remove, especially in practice, any doubt about the priority objectives to be pursued through international cooperation, not adding spurious purposes that have often prevailed: cooperation used to enhance the hegemony and control over the world, cooperation used to promote international trade for the donor countries, etc... For years the link between emergency relief, rehabilitation and development has been debated. The analysis from experience has led to the definition of certain principles and methodologies currently used by most actors in international cooperation, and in particular the NGOs. The act of humanitarian action by itself does not prevent a return to a state of emergency in vulnerable societies in crisis, especially if this action does not emerge, right from the beginning, from potential development routes. Conversely development programs are faced with the constant risk of a returning crisis, even in peacetime. This contiguity between emergency and development involves passing through stages—called reconstruction, rehabilitation or transition—which have their own dynamics. The effectiveness of humanitarian aid is today doubly important in an era in which it increasingly replaces political will and represents the only alternative to ending the suffering of the people who are in mortal danger. Research aimed at better understanding crises and at creating real synergies between emergency relief and development is today the basis of the work of the majority of aid actors.''It is a widely held view that NGOs submit cooperation and development projects for the sole reason of being able to rake in funding ... What do you think about that? ''The role of NGOs in civil society dialogue is a very complex subject that deserves thorough consideration and debate, and requires the ability and courage to face deliberations with consistency and clarity. NGOs are numerous, small, some locked in their niche—criticism aside, one of the main elements of weakness of NGOs (and not only NGOs) is determined precisely by their inability to work together, to coordinate among themselves, especially in the field. On the one hand the quantitative growth of NGOs creates a real competitive race for ever-decreasing financing, on the other hand NGOs are accused of systematically repeating the same type of project corresponding to their specificity and skills, without facilitating exchange and complementarity with their partners, without sharing strategies and information. Experience gained in working with people, economic and productive realities, political, environmental and cultural realities of various countries in addition to partnership and cooperation with NGOs in other countries, in both the Global North and South. The ability to support a central and fundamental role in bringing together people, through better understanding and greater respect for universal human values, solidarity, dialogue and mutual respect The ability to strengthen and promote partnerships for the realization of social and economic development projects, taking into account the different social, cultural, environmental and economic aspects of each country. The ability and attention toward encouraging and supporting the participation of women in the South The commitment to develop the organization and structure of NGOs and in this context to privilege, promote and develop collaboration networks in order to be functional and capable of addressing common challenges. The understanding of the importance of cultural consideration as a means of better understanding and bringing together peoples. NGOs also believe that men and women of the communities involved should, to the greatest extent possible, be responsible for devising, planning, implementing and evaluating projects and programs, and for the policy development in the North. They believe in constant dialogue with local partners and grassroots participation in decisions taken on the expenditure and policies to be followed. NGOs believe that the public has both the right and the duty to be involved in development cooperation and in achieving social justice. For this reason they urge and encourage direct and indirect support of public opinion concerning their work, holding to the fact that this support should be based on the public's understanding of the motives and objectives of NGOs. For this purpose, they are continually engaged in dialogue with their supporters. 

'''We have seen over the past decade the proliferation of innumerable groups, associations and NGOs aimed at promoting and managing social operations, development projects, education projects, service projects etc ... Has this proliferation always been positive and useful?''' 

It is apparently a growing opinion that: “NGOs are unable to coordinate themselves and increasingly in competition with each other.” The lack of coordination has been widely criticised, as underlined by recent evaluations. This issue sometimes affects the final result of the actions, relations with donors and the very credibility of NGOs. This is not just a problem of coordination, but also a weakness of the overall impact of the efforts on the problems and on the level of “political” impact. Cases of corruption in the '80s, followed by increasing bureaucracy and formal approval of projects subject to public funding. 

'''Is this EC practice effective today&amp;nbsp;? Can it be improved? How?''' 

''In Italy the revelation of cases of corruption led to a climate of mistrust and self-harm within the DGDC [Directorate General for Development Cooperation].'' 

It was concluded that Italy was not able to do cooperation and these activities were delegated to the multilateral sector. The little bilateral cooperation is managed by a structure of DGDC that is demotivated, bureaucratic and therefore inefficient. 

Operations were blocked as the advice on having efficient offices in Rome and in the various third-party countries was not observed. 

The bureaucratic procedures became the only priority, work is done only to fulfill and not to achieve the goals set down in the law. 

There are numerous and contradictory rules and the State accounting always wins. Often the order is made not to pay and excuses are found to postpone the analysis of financial statements, to find quibbles for rejecting the accounting records, thus blocking activities for months. 

A political debate needs to be proposed, which would result in the drafting of a new law on cooperation. 

At the EC level, real coordination of activities should be required, avoiding the return to delegating such matters to the member states. 

Sharing at the multilateral level the planning procedures to achieve the overall shared objectives . 

Achieve, gradually, the goal of earmarking 0.7% of GDP to international cooperation. The targets set by the United Nations conferences and confirmed by the members of DAC. 

The European Union has now decentralized to local delegations most of the cooperation activities and functions on the system of Call for Proposals or Tenders with time limits in ways that claim to be more transparent. 

&lt;br&gt; 

== '''The EC annually donates approximately 10 billion euros to International Cooperation for Development: In your opinion why is this?'''  ==

''“The European Consensus” for the first time in fifty years defines cooperation, the framework of common principles within which the EU and its member states implement their development policies in a spirit of complementarity. ''In the first part of the statement is an outline of the objectives and principles that member states and the Community agree to observe within the backdrop of a common vision. Since the primary objective is to eliminate global poverty as a part of sustainable development, the EU seeks to achieve, by 2015, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by all countries of the UN. 

The Union believes that the main objective of poverty reduction is based on the complementary aims of promoting good governance and respect for human rights, common values that underpin the EU. Fighting poverty also requires a balance between activities aimed at human development, at the protection of natural resources and at creating economic growth and welfare for the poor. The common principles that govern development cooperation activities are ownership, partnership, a close political dialogue, participation of civil society, gender equality and an ongoing commitment to preventing the fragility of states. Developing countries have the primarily responsibility for their development, but the EU takes on its share of responsibility in the joint efforts under the partnership framework. The EU is committed to increasing aid budget to 0.7% of gross national income by 2015, with an intermediate collective target of 0.56% by 2010; half the increase in aid will be earmarked for Africa. The EU will continue to give priority to supporting the least developed countries and those with low and medium income. The resources will be allocated according to objective and transparent criteria based on needs and performance of recipient countries. All the national and regional planning of the Community will follow the principle of concentration, which envisions the selection of a limited number of priority areas for action. The quality of aid will be crucial for the EU, which will monitor compliance of its commitment to ensuring the effectiveness of aid, in particular setting concrete targets for 2010. The fundamental principles in this context are national ownership, coordination and harmonization of donors (starting with the local level), alignment to recipient country systems and results orientation. More predictable mechanisms of aid will be developed that will help partner countries to plan efficiently. The EU will promote better coordination and complementarity among donors, focusing on joint multi-annual planning, based on the strategies and procedures of partner countries, on common mechanisms of implementation and use of co-financing. This will also foster policy coherence in various sectors. In this area, the Community policy and the policies pursued by Member States should be complementary. Through its global presence, its expertise in dispensing aid, its role in promoting policy coherence and best practices and in facilitating coordination and harmonization, its commitment to democracy, human rights, good governance and respect for international law, and its role in promoting civil society participation and the North-South solidarity, the Community brings added value to development. The Commission therefore proposes a series of concrete measures, namely: • Closer coordination among EU donors in policy development; • Closer coordination of multi-annual planning and analytical work; • The development of a common framework for aid implementation procedures; • The development of a Community Action Plan for the coordination and harmonization in any partner country, by which two or more EU donors have a program of cooperation. 

&lt;br&gt; 

== '''What is the communication policy promoted by the EC with regard to development cooperation?'''  ==

''One type of projects that the European Commission funds focuses on raising public awareness across Europe to development problems and relations between industrialized and developing countries.'' 

These actions should place emphasis on the interdependence between Member States and developing countries, promote cooperation between NGOs and enable the active participation of partners in developing countries. The Commission has an interest in emphasizing and highlighting the projects it finances, but delegates to partners their implementation. It funds NGOs' education campaigns, campaigns to fight racism, campaigns to bridge the digital divide. It does not have a dominant role in this area of communication even though it is the first donor in the world in terms of the amount of investments in the sector. Each local delegation and entity of the Union has its own website, a source of highly valuable information, but only for those who look for it. There is a lack of information geared toward the public at large. 

'''Is the inadequate EC communication deliberate (and why?) or unintended (really? The EC has no experts in the field of communication?)''' 

''Policies on cooperation and humanitarian aid are a marginal part of EU policy; policies on agricultural, trade, fisheries, and of course, fiscal policies prevail. ''In the area of cooperation the European Union (and therefore the Commission) is paying a heavy price for not having defined a common foreign policy and joint cooperation for the 27 member states. Methods for aggregating the various member states have not been defined, which makes the EC seem a 28th mega state. Each state has its own policy on cooperation and participates in the Community policies through commissions. Hence the difficulty in effectively communicating a shared position and policy. 

== '''How much space is dedicated to International Development Cooperation by the media?'''  ==

''Major media (newspapers and TV) devote little space to this issue. They deal with it when something unusual happens or following a major international event (kidnapping of aid workers or volunteers, summits of heads of government aimed at dealing with world poverty, etc.). An tear-jerker approach that creates pity prevails. The emotions of the people are lightly glossed over in order to move the public to give alms. Not to understand the complexity of the phenomenon or to find the causes. Helder Camara, a good soul, Brazilian archbishop of Recife used to say: “When I help the poor by giving them something to eat they call me a saint, when I ask something about the causes that make them poor they accuse me of communism.” ''In addition, even in the communication made by NGOs, superficial emotion predominates: the dirty little boy with flies around him, asking to be adopted or for a contribution to feed him or to buy him a school book. This leads to legitimizing the charitable strategy that has totally failed in reaching its objectives. It does not save lives but, in some cases, it helps mere survival in unsuitable conditions and without citizenship rights. It is hard to change this process as it is convenient for too many different interest groups. Emergencies and humanitarian disasters are profitable to fund raising. People in these situations become good and donate. The structural reality does not change and events are repeated over and over. As is the communication. 

'''The charitable strategy: who benefits? Why?''' 

''Under certain conditions humanitarian aid is the only solution (unforeseen disasters, effects of war, epidemics, etc.). But they are also a symptom of weakness, because enough has not been invested in prevention. Emergencies also tend to perpetuate themselves: they become permanent emergencies. ''And so we continue to distribute food in camps that have existed for decades, keeping generations in a precarious situation and dependent on aid. Humanitarian aid for some has become a business. It is easier to manage: you can buy goods and distribute them. They require large investments, public opinion is always favourable in the face of emergencies and is mobilized more easily, and gives generously. Speaking of the complexity of the processes of sustainable development, of the causes of poverty is more difficult, and mobilises less. It takes more effort to convince, it takes more time, more attention, more involvement. Few are willing to do that. And then the legitimization of such interventions is more complicated and difficult. It involves more parties and getting them to agree and coordinate themselves is never easy. 

'''What are the big powers with which media workers clash when they want to promote information to support international cooperation?''' 

''According to the predominant opinion this is an issue that interests few people, the masses want something else. We have house-keeping problems and we must first solve these: security, Gypsies, lack of jobs, traffic. Foreign policy and international cooperation are niches for a few fans in the industry. An article on this theme every now and then is published, but is not a priority to anyone, except those directly involved. ''Are there significant powers that influence the interests of people and make it such that certain issues are not addressed properly? Taking on the logic of the respect for rights entails embarking on a process of redistribution of global wealth and loss of privileges that for too many years have been the preserve only of the West or small local minorities in various countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. 

I reiterate the extreme urgency of democratic governance in the world. For this reason multilateral actions and the United Nations were created. Unfortunately, for too long it has functioned as the UN of the stronger states that, after winning World War II, were granted the special status of permanent members with veto power. A power that too often has been used to protect vested interests, a power that allows the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and China not to be bound by the same rules others play by. But if a rule is not the same for all, it is no longer a rule. Thus, states are constantly tempted to use the UN as and when they wish: to defend vested interests or to do what they can not do alone because it requires the recognition and legitimacy based on consent rather than force. 

Even the strongest countries need the UN but generally do not tolerate interference and meddling in their affairs. Thus some unresolved issues in the international arena cannot be democratically decided: be it about exiting the quagmire of the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, coordinating humanitarian assistance in South Asia or in sub-Saharan Africa, respect for human rights in China, or the persecution that the Kurdish people suffer from the Turkish government; resolutions to resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine or of the American embargo against Cuba. The list of atrocities covered by the principle of non-interference is infinite. On the one hand, governments have approved forty international conventions on human rights and on the other ignore them within their borders without the UN's intervention. This duplicity is the source of many of the contradictions which we are discussing in the UN. 

On one hand the UN is asked to “ensure world peace” and on the other it is denied the means to act; it is entrusted with the task of “promoting economic and social development for all peoples” and then it is excluded from every real decision center. It is charged with tackling all the worst troubles of our time, to promote freedom and human rights, to regulate international life, prevent conflict, assist refugees, combat hunger, poverty, drug trafficking, etc.. and then the Secretary-General is made to declare bankruptcy because the member governments do not pay their quotas. So while there is a growing demand for UN services in the world, criticism and accusations of failure are also on the increase. Lately we have seen also the inclination toward unilateral decisions by the American power in the name of its security and to combat terrorism. It believes it has the right to break every rule of humanity whether it is declaring war or monitoring the compliance to the respect of the rights of the people involved or of prisoners of war. Suffice it to mention the non-ratification by the U.S. of major international treaties (from the Kyoto Protocol on CO2 emissions, to control of trade in small arms, anti-personnel mines or accession to the International Criminal Court) or the different treatment of prisoners sent down from Afghanistan to Guantanamo, depending on their nationality of origin. 

The process of democratization is not simple: there is strong opposition to change on the part of states that do not tolerate any control over their domestic and international policies. Therefore it is important to reaffirm that the UN does not belong to the states, but must be truly of the people. And they must put pressure so that it becomes a truly democratic tool that fulfills the purpose for which it was created. 

The rights and sovereignty of nation-states have amply demonstrated the need to resort to supranational bodies to ensure the sustainability of the planet's future. This obliges a search for new rules based on social justice and respect for the inalienable right of every man and every woman on the planet to be the subject and the end of every action and every decision taken in rich countries as well as in those of the “South of the world”. A system of rules and decision-making mechanisms in which the weak and the strong have equal rights and equal opportunities, where the criterion of “one dollar one vote” is not the only one that is imposed in any area of decision making. 

For this we recognise in the United Nations system, reformed in the light of the criteria of greater democracy, better effectiveness and efficiency and greater transparency, the main institutional body in the protection and promotion of peace and justice in the world. The authority of the United Nations must be accompanied by an effective desire of individual governments to recognize the decisions, take responsibility and keep the commitments undertaken at the international level. 

'''What strategy can be put in place to open a passage in the media (newspapers, TV, etc.)? How can the balance of power be changed?''' 

''Create a network of practitioners and journalists interested in the topic with whom to share a strategy for dissemination and communication of information and ideas that do not pass through traditional media. ''There are a myriad of people and entities that seek to change the situation. Those who work in communications, who with dignity and freedom to seek to create counter-information and to expose situations they deem unfair and wrong for the interests of humanity. 

And thus little that everyone is able to do is not lost. I think that this is the positive energy that has allowed the world to survive, In the face of so much injustice and negativity, the relations of solidarity between people, in the family, in the community, in politics helps to feed the hope that change is possible and that efforts to create a different world should go on forever. Despite the many setbacks, despite the dominance of a few forces, despite few successes. Making campaigns, enhancing the positive experiences, insisting on creating networks, coordinating, working together, repeating attempts and continuing to believe that change is possible. For this reason we are doing this project and spending our time in this process. 

'''Quite often, in campaigns such as those to raise funds for international cooperation, the Other is presented in a negative way as a child, which implies a paternalistic attitude often decontextualized, lonely, poor, dirty, in the midst of disaster ... What sense does it make to think of helping someone whose image you have destroyed? Can we can speak of solidarity, if the premise is to present the other as a person totally incapable of getting out of that situation without outside help? What sense does this kind of solidarity make?''' 

''There is no positive way. No critical reflection, no analysis on the causes, no structural response to resolve the problem. Only assist the poor who were left behind and that in that place should remain. ''The preservation of the privileges and the position of hegemonic and subaltern social groups also involves the control of the production of wealth. Subordination and obedience, resignation and patience, the inability to react to injustice, the acceptance of their condition, comes from a consolidation of a mindset of what is natural, the result of fate. And that salvation is only at the individual level, we hope that I make it, or patterns of self-made man. Did you see that (s)he has broken through because (s)he's good (athletes, actors, show-girls, politicians)? Maintaining social control means imposing appropriate cultural models and controlling the apparatus of education and information. Fighting for change is risky, you pay a very high personal cost, fighting against powers stronger than you is pointless . The world works this way, better to adapt and receive what is possible. Favors not rights, concessions not personal achievements. A cooperation that upholds universal human rights, freedom of peoples and of individuals, is dangerous if carried out for the balance of existing powers . But it must not be fought openly: better to say yes, promise, sign international treaties that recognize this, and then empty them in practice, not fulfil them, not keeping commitments made, finding excuses and justifications in credible unforeseen difficulties presented as objective truth. 

'''In an International Cooperation project people of different cultures interact. This is especially true if one thinks of a cooperation projects between Global North and South, or between realities whose business models and values are completely different (the dominant economic model in the countries of the South is based on gift economics while the typical Western model is based on a monetary economy; one is based on the importance of relationships and deliberate dependencies between people, the other based on the value of independence and making it on your own) In light of these “multiple frames” what kind of dynamics are established between the different individuals who interact within a Cooperation Project? To what extent can you build a relationship of equal exchange and mutually sharing?'''“First of all, justice. Ubi societas, ibi ius: every society draws up its own system of justice. Charity goes beyond justice, because to love is to give, to offer what is “mine” to the other; but it never lacks justice, which prompts us to give the other what is “his”, what is due to him by reason of his being or his acting. I cannot “give” what is mine to the other, without first giving him what pertains to him in justice. If we love others with charity, then first of all we are just towards them. Not only is justice not extraneous to charity, not only is it not an alternative or parallel path to charity: justice is inseparable from charity, and intrinsic to it.” (Benedict XVI, Caritas in veritate, introd. No. 6) 

So far, international cooperation has only partially expressed the possibility of collaboration and coordination between different actors with the peculiarities of fragmented specific niche experiences prevailing, with limited resulting global impact. For this reason the eighth development goal contained in the Millennium Declaration envisions “Develop a global partnership for development” which sees all the countries engaged in pursuing the other 7 goals. Partnership must therefore involve the sharing of a vision of the world and the will to realise together actions that bring about the achievement of those objectives that are the basis of international cooperation, summarized as: globalize human rights and eradicate poverty from the planet. This is possible if among the partners there is a common commitment to consolidate a relationship of solidarity, respect and mutual esteem that lasts over time. Give priority in the planning to a logical process, which inherently binds to the focused centrality of the project. This means working with a clear strategic perspective, never losing sight of the goals in place. It means, keeping in mind and operating in the framework of a Country Programme, consistent with sectoral planning in which all entities present in a territory should reference; it means to privilege in each intervention attention to the aspects of vitality and continuity of the same; it means strengthening local organizations and creating conditions of transparency, greater independence, participation and self-determination. It means that if you start a cooperation activity in a particular region or country with the intention of settling there for an extended period, to collaborate in incisively solving the problems of that area and not only to complete projects efficiently. The logic of the process requires the setting of partnership with local organizations right from the beginning, based on mutual interchange. It presupposes a transition from a logic of emergency to one of sustainable development, with all the organizational and methodological consequences that it entails. This logic requires a continuity of presence and consequent specialization on local knowledge and actors who operate in it . This allows the consolidation of relations with partners and local authorities, gaining trust and guaranteeing the aim of “Institution Building ” it allows local knowledge (particularly of micro-realities) and thus the identification of real needs and how to meet them; it allows for better logistical organization and management while avoiding costly investment; it avoids wastage and increases the impact of interventions. Another important aspect is how partners choose each other. That choice must be made emphasising reliability and managerial ability, as well as a recognized democratic structure, strong presence in the local realities and a clear commitment to solving social problems. In the various realities one cannot fail to consider with due attention the state and governmental institutions. It is, however, more important to create conditions such that local authorities and civil society organizations increase their influence and become privileged partners. The ideal would be to identify “strong partners” in each country with whom to share all aspects of strategic analysis, planning, management, exchange of cooperation activities. Consider then the aspects of subsidiarity and complementarity of actions that local partners and international NGOs need to take on in lobbying and strategic planning activities. Corporate attitudes that give priority to “workshop” claims are harmful to everyone. It would be more fruitful to jointly address the level that relates to policies and that more directly linked to the operating rules of cooperation. Do not forget the strategic goals (globalize the rights, eradicate poverty ...) and demand that the practices and projects are consistent and appropriate to achieve these goals. Doing it together, sharing methodologies and tools, creating the conditions for partnership and ensuring that international cooperation responds effectively to its own purposes. The fragmentation and lack of continuity of planning operations, often concluded without the guarantee of sustainability and vitality of what has been built. Management models are often imposed by the donor entity. It cannot be that relations are created in which those who have the money decide the future of all stakeholders involved. Years ago I read a cartoon in a Mozambican newspaper that depicted an international cooperation worker saying to his local partner, “He who pays, commands!” Our vision of partnership needs to go in the opposite direction to this statement. 

== &lt;br&gt; '''What should characterize decentralized cooperation?'''  ==

''It is simplistic to say that decentralized cooperation is that made by local authorities. It is something more important and ambitious. It means promoting the genuine decentralization of functions from a central state entity to local realities where participation and involvement of different actors is more effective. ''But this new approach is based on certain key and innovative issues: • Recognizing the multiplicity of actors in the field of development cooperation: public, private, local, national and international; • Engaging in dialogue, consultation and seeking common goals between these different actors; • The widest direct participation as an aim and as an operational methodology; • The support for institutional development and training of these actors; • Local and decentralized management of operations; • Constraints and interaction defined between the local and the global • The transition from a purely quantitative view of development (the increase of wealth will bring prosperity to all) to a vision of quality (respect for human rights and sustainable development). This vision leads to a commitment to review our ways of life, to formulate the work of solidarity with local roots but with a global vision. Building permanent partnerships between areas that share common goals. 

&lt;br&gt; 

== '''Example of interaction between local and global spheres?'''  ==

'''In what sense does a vision of this type give rise to a review of our way of life?'''Proper focus of international cooperation: demanding respect for Human Rights. Taking on the centrality of the right to demand one's human rights revolutionizes, or should revolutionize the practice of international cooperation. We overcome the logic of aid, assistance, alms-giving, subjective charity, to take on a different perspective: the ethics of responsibility, the duty to respect the internationally endorsed standards and procedures, reaching goals within the set time-limits. The international community has made specific commitments that it must maintain. When you sign a protocol to respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the Millennium Declaration, it should be respected and translated into consistent operational decisions. Almost all states have fully incorporated into their legislation the first generation of human rights: civil rights and political rights. Nobody questions that these must be pursued and states must be criticized for the use of torture or unlawful imprisonment due to political or religious views. When serious violations to political and civil rights occur outrage is such that it demands immediate action for an international embargo on the offending country or the intervention of international courts sanctioning these crimes. 

&lt;br&gt; '''But it is unrealistic to expect this?''' 

''Even among experts in international law there are differing opinions. ''Law makes the man and, now, it is essential to initiate political action, strengthen international opinion campaigns that ensure that the DESC and justice are payable and executable and also finally to succeed in seeing to it that international law declares the illegality of poverty. Almost all of the states that are part of the United Nations have incorporated the DESC in their constitutions, laws or international commitments through treaties. Nevertheless the courts, tribunals and the national legislation implemented do not recognize, in most cases, measures of protection for these rights. And if there is no penalty when you do not meet a standard that has been approved and endorsed in the legislation, it is normal that the respect for rights will fail and other methods and interests will prevail. At the expense of civil and democratic growth and the welfare of all humanity. 

== '''What about the concept of development&amp;nbsp;?'''  ==

This section aims to define development and understand the conditions that are favourable to its success. Development is an action which ideally should result in a change for the better, without overhtrowing the identity and value systems of the socieities in which it occurs. It is a process in which progress and tradition remain in harmony with each other. For this reason, development cannot be imposed. 

One of the risks of development aid is that the donors and the recipients have different cultural identities. If the former are insensitive to the value system of the latter, this will be detrimental to development.&lt;br&gt;Authentic development assistance aims to develop the potentialities of the beneficiaries, and directly involves them. 

Many scholars have attempted to develop a theory of development, including Malthus, Marx and Schumpeter. A prevalent contemporary view is that of development as modernisation/westernisation. The modernisation theory was elaborated in the U.S. after World War II. This was a period shaped by the Cold War and the proces of decolinisation. Experts were therefore looking into ways of promoting economic growth and political stability in the newly-born states. Modernisation is characterised by innovation and change,&lt;br&gt;and results in a transformation of societal structures and patterns of social organisation. 

Each single country goes through different stages of modernisation, and at different paces. A common factor that occurs at the beginning of this process is the transformation of the society's economy, characterised by a decrease in agricultural activity and an uptake of industrial activity. In the social dimension, there are changes in demographics (in particular,&lt;br&gt;birth rates), in urbanisation and in migration patterns. The relationships between people also change, passing from relationships based on affection to functionally-based relationships. 

A number of variables distinguish the &quot;modern&quot; socities from the &quot;traditional&quot; ones. In traditional societies, status is ascribed (that is &quot;given&quot; to you by others); people develop relationships that satisfy a large range of needs; relationships between people arel argely based on love, trust, close personal involvement, etc; people act differently towards&lt;br&gt;particular people based on the nature of their relationship (for example, you may trust your immediate family, but not a stranger); people put the interests of the social groups to which they belong before their personal interests. In modern societies, on the contrary, status is achieved through personal merit; people enter a wide range of relationships, each of which&lt;br&gt;satisfies a specific need (for example, the relationship between a shop assistant and a customer); relationships are largely based on what people can do for us, and what we can do for them; individuals act according to values and norms that are universal in their society; people give primacy to the pursuit of their own interests rathe than those of the group to which&lt;br&gt;they belong. 

This comparison of ideal traditional and modern societies in addition to being descriptive, also aims to explain the mechanisms and situations that may help or hinder the process of change. In fact, development in some countries is not hindered by lack of resources (economic, logistical, etc), but by social resistance. 

Modernisation is a contradictory phenomenon: the changes it brings about are often traumatic and result in conflict, giving rise to previously unknown phenomena such as unemployment, crime, etc. 

In order to overcome and expand the traditional meaning of development that focused only on economic growth, the UNDP developed the concept of 'Human Development'. This approach puts people, not economic growth at the centre of development. Thus, it takes into account previously-overlooked aspects such as health, education, a healthy environment, and the freedom of action and expression. It remains to be elaborated how economic growth contributes to human development and vice versa.

[[File:Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi.jpg|thumb|Hindu art in the Gupta Age: Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi]]
The peace and prosperity created under the leadership of the Guptas enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors. This period is called the Golden Age of India and was marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture. The Gupta period produced scholars who made great advancements in many academic fields. Of particular importance are: Aryabhata, who is believed to be the first to come up with the concept of zero, postulated the theory that the Earth moves round the Sun, and studied solar and lunar eclipses. Kalidasa, a great playwright, who wrote plays such as ''Shakuntala'', which is said to have inspired Goethe, and marked the highest point of Sanskrit literature. The famous Sushruta Samhita, which is a Sanskrit redaction text on all of the major concepts of ayurvedic medicine with innovative chapters on surgery, dates to the Gupta period. And Vatsyayana, who wrote the ancient Gupta text ''Kama Sutra,'' which is widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit literature.

Chess is said to have originated in this period, where its early form in the 6th century was known as caturaṅga, which translates as &quot;four divisions [of the military]&quot; – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry – represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Doctors also invented several medical instruments, and even performed operations. The Indian numerals which were the first positional base 10 numeral systems in the world originated from Gupta India.

The earliest available Indian epics are also thought to have been written around this period. The high points of this cultural creativity are magnificent architecture, sculptures and paintings.

===Literature===

The classical period of Sanskrit literature coincides with the Gupta period and the successive pre-Islamic Middle kingdoms of India, spanning roughly the 3rd to 8th centuries CE.

'''Drama'''
[[File:Ravi Varma-Shakuntala columbia2.jpg|thumb|Shakuntala stops to look back at Dushyanta, Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906), scene from ''Abhijñānaśākuntalam''.]]


Drama as a distinct genre of Sanskrit literature emerges in the final centuries BCE, influenced partly by Vedic mythology and partly by Hellenistic drama. It reaches its peak between the 4th and 7th centuries before declining together with Sanskrit literature as a whole.

Famous Sanskrit dramatists include Śhudraka, Bhasa, Asvaghosa and Kālidāsa. Though numerous plays written by these playwrights are still available, little is known about the authors themselves.

One of the earliest known Sanskrit plays is the ''Mrichakatika'', thought to have been composed by Śhudraka in the 2nd century BCE. The Natya Shastra (ca. 2nd century CE, literally &quot;Scripture of Dance,&quot; though it sometimes translated as &quot;Science of Theatre'&quot;) is a keystone work in Sanskrit literature on the subject of stagecraft. Bhasa and Kālidāsa are major early authors of the first centuries CE, Kālidāsa qualifying easily as the greatest poet and playwright in Sanskrit He deals primarily with famous Hindu legends and themes; three famous plays by Kālidāsa are ''Vikramōrvaśīyam'' (Vikrama and Urvashi), ''Mālavikāgnimitram'' (Malavika and Agnimitra), and the play that he is most known for: ''Abhijñānaśākuntalam'' (The Recognition of Shakuntala).

Late (post 6th century) dramatists include Dandin and Sriharsha. The only surviving ancient Sanskrit drama theatre is ''Koodiyattam''.

'''Scholarly treatises'''

The earliest surviving treatise on astrology is the ''Yavanajataka'' &quot;sayings of the Greeks&quot; (3rd century). The astronomy of the classical Gupta period, the centuries following Indo-Greek contact, is documented in treatises known as ''Siddhantas'' (which means &quot;established conclusions&quot;). Varahamihira in his ''Pancha-Siddhantika'' contrasts five of these: The ''Surya Siddhanta'' besides the ''Paitamaha Siddhantas'' (which is more similar to the &quot;classical&quot; ''Vedanga Jyotisha''), the ''Paulisha and Romaka Siddhantas'' (directly based on Hellenistic astronomy) and the ''Vasishta Siddhanta''.

The earliest treatise in Indian mathematics is the ''Āryabhaṭīya'' (written ca. 500 CE), a work on astronomy and mathematics. The mathematical portion of the ''Āryabhaṭīya'' was composed of 33 ''sūtras'' (in verse form) consisting of mathematical statements or rules, but without any proofs. However, according to Hayashi (2003, p. 123), &quot;this does not necessarily mean that their authors did not prove them. It was probably a matter of style of exposition.&quot; From the time of Bhaskara I (600 CE onwards), prose commentaries increasingly began to include some derivations (''upapatti'').

&quot;Tantra&quot; is a general term for a scientific, magical or mystical treatise and mystical texts both Hindu and Buddhist said to concern themselves with five subjects, 1. the creation, 2. the destruction of the world, 3. the worship of the gods, 4. the attainment of all objects, 5. the four modes of union with the supreme spirit by meditation. These texts date to the entire lifespan of Classical Sanskrit literature.

'''Stories'''

Sanskrit fairy tales and fables are chiefly characterised by ethical reflections and proverbial philosophy. A peculiar style, marked by the insertion of a number of different stories within the framework of a single narrative, made its way to Persian and Arabic literatures, exerting a major influence on works such as ''One Thousand and One Nights''.

The two most important collections are ''Panchatantra'' and ''Hitopadesha''; originally intended as manuals for the instruction of kings in domestic and foreign policy, they belong to the class of literature which the Hindus call nīti-śāstra, or &quot;Science of Political Ethics&quot;.

Other notable prose works include a collection of pretty and ingenious fairy tales, with a highly Oriental colouring, the ''Vetāla-panchaviṃśati'' or &quot;Twenty-five Tales of the Vetāla&quot; (a demon supposed to occupy corpses), the ''Siṃhāsana-dvātriṃçikā'' or &quot;Thirty-two Stories of the Lion-seat&quot; (i.e. throne), which also goes by the name of ''Vikrama-charita'', or &quot;Adventures of Vikrama&quot; and the ''Śuka-saptati'', or &quot;Seventy Stories of a Parrot&quot;. These three collections of fairy tales are all written in prose and are comparatively short.

Somadeva's ''Kathā-sarit-sāgara'' or &quot;Ocean of Rivers of Stories&quot; is a work of special importance: composed in verse and of very considerable length, it contains more than 22,000 ''shlokas'', equal to nearly one-fourth of the ''Mahābhārata''. Like Kshemendra's ''Brhatkathamanjari'' and Budhasvamin's ''Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha'', it derives from Gunadhya's ''Brihatkatha''.

Fable collections, originally serving as the handbooks of practical moral philosophy, provided an abundant reservoir of ethical maxims that become so popular that works consisting exclusively of poetical aphorisms started to appear. The most important are the two collections by the highly-gifted Bhartṛhari, entitled respectively ''Nīti-śataka'', or &quot;Century of Conduct,&quot; and ''Vairāgya-śataka'', or &quot;Century of Renunciation.&quot; The keynote prevailing in this new ethical poetry style is the doctrine of the vanity of human life, which was developed before the rise of Buddhism in the sixth century B.C., and has dominated Indian thought ever since.

'''Classical poetry'''

This refers to the poetry produced from the approximately the 3rd to 8th centuries. Kālidāsa is the foremost example of a classical poet. But a striking characteristic of Indian literary tradition is that sometimes poets show off their technical dexterity with highly Oulipian word-games, like stanzas that read the same backwards and forwards, words that can be split in different ways to produce different meanings, sophisticated metaphors, and so on. This style is referred to as Kāvya. A classic example is the poet Bharavi and his magnum opus, the ''Kiratarjuniya'' (6th-7th century). Magh is noted for his epic poem (''mahAkAvya'') Shishupala Vadha, the 20 cantos of which are based on the Mahabharata episode where the defiant king Shishupala is beheaded by Krishna's chakra (disc).

The greatest works of poetry in this period are the five ''Mahākāvyas'', or &quot;great composition&quot;s:

* ''Kumārasambhava'' by Kālidāsa
* ''Raghuvamsha'' by Kālidāsa
* ''Kiratarjuniya'' by Bharavi
* ''Shishupala Vadha'' by Māgha
* ''Naishadha-Charita'' by Sriharsha

Some scholars include the ''Bhattikavya'' as a sixth ''Mahākāvya''

Other major literary works from this period are ''Kadambari'' by Banabhatta, the first Sanskrit novelist (6th-7th centuries), the ''Kama Sutra'' by Vatsyayana, and the three ''shatakas'' of Bhartṛhari.

'''Puranas'''
[[File:Bhagavatapurana.jpg|thumb|An illustration of Varaha avatar based on the Bhagavata purana.]]

The ''puranas'' are a genre of important Hindu, Jain and Buddhist religious texts, notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction, genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, and descriptions of Hindu cosmology, philosophy, and geography. The corpus of the Hindu ''puranas'' likewise falls into the classical period of Sanskrit literature, dating to between the 5th and 10th centuries, and marks the emergence of the Vaishnava and Shaiva denominations of classical Hinduism. The ''puranas'' are classified into a Mahā- (&quot;great&quot;) and a Upa- (&quot;lower, additional&quot;) corpus. Traditionally they are said to narrate five subjects, called ''pañcalakṣaṇa'' (&quot;five distinguishing marks&quot;):

Sargaśca pratisargasca vamśo manvantarāņi ca I

Vamśānucaritam caiva Purāņam pañcalakśaņam II

They are:

* ''Sarga'' — The creation of the universe.
* ''Pratisarga'' — Secondary creations, mostly re-creations after dissolution.
* ''Vamśa'' — Genealogy of royals and sages.
* ''Manvañtara'' — Various eras.
* ''Vamśānucaritam'' — Dynastic histories

A Purana usually gives prominence to a certain deity (Shiva, Vishnu or Krishna, Durga) and depicts the other gods as subservient.

===Science===
[[File:2064 aryabhata-crp.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aryabhata on the grounds of IUCAA, Pune. As there is no known information regarding his appearance, any image of Aryabhata originates from an artist's conception.]]

This period is often known as the golden age of Indian Mathematics. This period saw mathematicians such as Aryabhata, give broader and clearer shape to many branches of mathematics. Their contributions would spread to Asia, the Middle East, and eventually to Europe. Unlike Vedic mathematics, their works included both astronomical and mathematical contributions. In fact, mathematics of that period was included in the 'astral science'. The main texts were composed in Sanskrit verse, and were followed by prose commentaries.

One of the most important works of this period is the ''Surya Siddhanta''. Though its authorship is unknown, the ''Surya Siddhanta'' (c. 400) contains the roots of modern trigonometry. Because it contains many words of foreign origin, some authors consider that it was written under the influence of Mesopotamia and Greece. This ancient text uses sine, cosine and inverse cosine as trigonometric functions for the first time. It also contains the earliest uses of tangents and secants. 

Another important text is the Chhedi calendar (594) which contains an early use of the modern place-value Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally.

As mentioned before, one of the most remarkable scholars of the Gupta age was Aryabhata I (476–550). Aryabhata's contributions include: the definition of trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, versine, and the inverse sine) and gave methods of calculating their approximate numerical values; spherical trigonometry; solutions of simultaneous quadratic equations, indeterminate linear equations; and accurate calculations for astronomical constants, such as solar and lunar eclipses, amongst many others. 


Aryabhata wrote the ''Aryabhatiya''. In this work, he described the important fundamental principles of mathematics in 332 ''shlokas''. The treatise contained quadratic equations,and the value of π, correct to 4 decimal places. Aryabhata also wrote the ''Arya Siddhanta'', which is now lost. 

Another scholar of the Gupta age, Varahamihira (505–587) produced the ''Pancha Siddhanta'' (The Five Astronomical Canons). He made important contributions to trigonometry, including sine and cosine tables to 4 decimal places of accuracy and formulas relating sine and cosine functions.

[[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|left|thumb|The Ajanta paintings were made during the Gupta period.]]

===Art===

Chandragupta II gave great support to the arts. Artists were so highly valued under his rule that they were paid for their work — a rare phenomenon in ancient civilizations.

====Architecture====

Gupta architecture show the ornate and beauty seen in Gupta style, and is also a good resource for examining Gupta style sculptures and art.

'''Notable monuments'''
[[File:Ananta Padmanabha Swami Temple.jpg|thumb|Ananta Padmanabha Swami Temple]]

* '''Undavalli caves''' are an example of Indian rock-cut architecture and its main cave is one of the earliest examples of Gupta art. These caves are located in the village of Undavalli in Tadepalle Mandal in Guntur District, near the southern bank of the Krishna River, in India. These caves have been carved out of solid sandstone on a hillside in the 4th to 5th centuries A.D. There are several caves. The best known and largest one has four stories with a huge unknown recreated statue reclining posture sculpted from a single block of granite inside the second floor.The walls of the caves display sculptures carved by skilled craftsmen.

[[File:Deogarh01.jpg|thumb|The Dashavatara Temple or Vishnu Temple also called Gupta temple at Deogarh.]]

* '''Vishnu temple''' (or Dashavatara Temple) is located at Deogarh in Central India built in c. 500 AD. The temple is one of the earliest Hindu stone temples to still survive today. It was the first North Indian temple with a ''shikhara'' or tower, although the ''shikhara'' is curtailed and part of it has disappeared. The temple has a high plinth and is set with a basement porch.The temple faces west, with slight deviation to the south that enables the setting sun's rays to fall on the main idol in the temple. The plinth measures 55.5 feet (16.9 m), about 9 feet (2.7 m) above the bottom step (called the moon stone) of the shrine. In the nine squares layout, the Vishnu temple is in the middle square. Four stairways outside the platform provide access to the temple. However, as per excavation details, combined with the two small shrines with the central shrine seen now, the layout of the temple has been interpreted to represent a typical Panchayatana style of the temples of North India.

====Sculpture====
[[File:Buddha from Sarnath.jpg|thumb|Buddha from Sarnath, 5–6th century CE.]]
The pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture. The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (c. 320-550) which remains a &quot;classical&quot; period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves, though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later. Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief.

====Painting====
[[File:Ajanta Padmapani.jpg|left|thumb|Fresco from Ajanta caves, c. 450-500.]]

It had been around 1st century BC, just before the Gupta period, when the ''Sadanga'' or Six Limbs of Indian Painting, were evolved, a series of canons laying down the main principles of the art that prevailed during the subsequent centuries, including the Gupta era. These 'Six Limbs' were:

* Rupabheda: The knowledge of appearances.
* Pramanam: Correct perception, measure and structure.
* Bhava: Action of feelings on forms.
* Lavanya: Yojanam Infusion of grace, artistic representation.
* Sadrisyam: Similitude.
* Varnikabhanga: Artistic manner of using the brush and colours.

The subsequent development of painting by the Buddhists indicates that these ' Six Limbs ' were put into practice by Indian artists, and are the basic principles on which their art was founded.

Paintings of the Gupta period can be broadly described as murals. Murals are large works executed on the walls of solid structures, as in the Ajanta Caves and the Kailashnath temple. 

The history of Indian murals starts in ancient and early medieval times, from 2nd century BC to 8th - 10th century AD. There are known more than 20 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of Ajanta, Bagh, Sittanavasal, Armamalai Cave (Tamil Nadu), Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Kailasanatha temple in Ellora Caves.

Murals from this period depict mainly religious themes of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu religions. There are though also locations where paintings were made to adorn mundane premises, like the ancient theatre room in Jogimara Cave and possible royal hunting lodge circa 7th century AD - Ravan Chhaya rock shelter.</text>

Hi, on 2012-11-01 at 22:58:20, you added the section title &quot;Compile time optimization&quot; to the wikibook [[Optimizing_C++|Optimizing C++]], but you never added any contents to that section. What is the point of having an empty section? --[[User:Carlo.milanesi|Carlo.milanesi]] ([[User talk:Carlo.milanesi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Carlo.milanesi|contribs]]) 15:27, 4 January 2013 (UTC)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Whoops! I had some things to put in there, but must have not correctly hit save changes or something. I also wasn't sure how to get the right formatting style for that book. It was only a start though, not something huge. Some of the items:
* Put as much code as possible into .cpp files and compile as reusable libraries to minimize the amount of redundant compilation.
* Use templates to speed up compile time by compiling the parts of the interface that you use rather than compiling every possibility all the time, one particular use case here is for macros. 
* Another part was going to be related to minimizing includes and the use of forward declarations to speed up compile time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a Commentary?==

A commentary is a response to another person's argument. Commentaries are most often found in expressions of opinions on current issues and events &lt;ref&gt; Writing Today, Custom Edition for St. Cloud State University. Taken from Writing Today, Second Edition by Richard Johnson-Sheehan and Charles Paine, 2012. Print. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;. The purpose of commentaries is to offer new and insightful perspectives so that readers can understand their own stance on an issue or event. Importantly, readers can find commentaries as similar to an op-ed (opinion/editorial) piece in a newspaper or a magazine.

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 22:37, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

==What Do Commentaries Do?==

Commentaries offer a new angle to an ongoing public conversation &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheen and Paine, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; . The goal of commentaries is to convince readers that the opinion of the person writing the commentary is more convincing. When writing a commentary, it is important to make clear points that are understood easily by readers. At the same time, readers of commentaries want to learn something new while figuring out how someone else views an issue or event of interest. Most commentaries act on the purpose of making their points memorable &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 22:37, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

==Where Can I Find Commentaries?==

Commentaries are not difficult at all to find. Readers can find them in print media (e.g., newspapers, magazines) and visual media (e.g., online news). Many letters to the editor and opinion-editorial (op-ed) pieces have a similar style as commentaries do. In addition, blogs and social networking sites like Blogger or Facebook serve the purpose of creating a space for writing commentaries &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 22:38, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

==What Is In a Commentary?==

The content of commentaries (along with letters to the editor and op-ed pieces) have current events or issues as their primary focus&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;. Commentaries often contain an explanation of the current event or issue. Commentaries often offer support for the opinions written in them. As with any writing genre, commentaries focus on topic, angle, purpose, readers (audience), and context. Writers of commentaries, letters to the editor, and op-ed pieces often view a current issue or event from a unique angle that applies to the issue's timely relevance. In rhetoric, this is known as ''kairos''. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos Kairos] is the Greek word meaning &quot;right or opportune time.&quot; Writers and readers of commentaries should not confuse ''kairos'' with ''chronos'' (chronological time). However, if historical criticism applies to the current event, writers should feel free to put that in their commentaries.

==How Should Writers Organize Their Commentaries?==

One method of organizing a commentary comes from Johnson-Sheehan and Paine &lt;ref&gt;Writing Today, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;. The features included in this method of organizing commentaries are:

     • '''Topic''': This is the basis of the current event or issue

     • '''Introduction''': It is important that writers of commentaries engage their readers immediately by stating the issue clearly. This involves announcing 
       the ''issue'' at hand, the ''thesis statement'', and the ''angle'' or ''position'' taken on the topic in relation to the issue.

     • '''Explanation''': In this part, writers review what has happened or is happening in addition to what other writers have written (or said) about both the 
       topic and the issue.

     • '''Argument''': Writers of commentaries argue for a specific position by using reasoning (also known as ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos logos]'', 
       examples, and eyewitness accounts.

     • '''Clarification''': This qualifies the argument while it attempts to avoid the tendency to make overgeneralizations about the topic. This is also what is 
       known as ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos ethos]''.

     • '''Conclusion''': As with any written task, the conclusion offers an overall assessment of the issue by highlighting its importance to the audience.
       Conclusions make additional implications for the future.

==How Do Writers Know What to Put in Their Commentaries?==

As with reviews, commentaries involve using the techniques of ''preliminary inquiry'' and ''background research'' without necessarily ''experiencing the subject under review''. However, commentaries are different from reviews in lieu of these features. Writers of commentaries should write about something that is important to them by listening to what others say and reading what others write &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;. Writers of commentaries should also take care to listen to what people are ''not'' saying and ''not'' writing; this would mean citing a gap in the conversation. Writers of commentaries, in addition, often follow news events found on Web sites, in newspaper, and in magazines &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;. As it is for reviews, writers and readers of commentaries should play the '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Rhetoric_and_Composition/Reviews&amp;stable=0 Believing and Doubting Game]''' using the three steps of '''believing''', '''doubting''', and '''synthesizing'''. Playing the Believing and Doubting Game can help writers of commentaries see multiple sides of an issue while they tie all of their information together to make it their own.

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 19:04, 6 December 2012 (UTC)

===Preliminary Inquiry===

Another way of stating this is &quot;finding out what you already know&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;. The Believing and Doubting Game applies most fittingly here. The three steps of preliminary inquiry are:

     • '''Believing''': Clearly, this means understanding a topic and seeing an issue from the perspective of a convinced and unquestioning believer. The first 
       step of believing assumes that all of the information and opinions from this angle are all correct, even if all of the assertions of information and 
       opinions contradict each other. Writers using this step should take into consideration of where the believer's angle makes the most sense. Writers should
       also substantiate their claims with supporting evidence that is not only credible but also accurate &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, pp. 175-176&lt;/ref&gt;.

     • '''Doubting''': Writers, in this instance, should imagine themselves understanding their topic and viewing their issue from the perspective of a skeptic.
       When doubting, writers can cite logical fallacies in another writer's argument &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;. Writers can also use the 
       technique of doubt to allow refutation by future writers. In doing so, writing a commentary from a skeptical angle means not taking the believer's 
       argument literally while considering the practical consequences of the same argument. 

     •'''Synthesizing''': Here, writers place the believer and the skeptic at odds with each other to find common ground where possible. Writers, then, give 
      their own perspective on the issue based on the arguments made by the believer and the skeptic. Synthesizing entails consideration of the major issues 
      separating both sides of the issue by analyzing the assumptions made and the terms used to make those assumptions.

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 20:04, 6 December 2012 (UTC)

===Background Research===

This next step of the Believing and Doubting Game is also known as &quot;finding out what others know&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;. Since commentaries are most often responses to current events and issues, writers must comment on how the events are still happening and what that will mean. Not all the facts are present in commentaries because they are happening at that moment. New developments often arise before any publication of the commentary takes place. Nonetheless, sources that writers of commentaries include:

     • '''Online Sources''': These sources are especially useful for commentaries because they are happening immediately. Online sources are most useful if new 
       events continue to happen within a specific topic &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;. With online sources, writers should keep the Believing and
       Doubting Game in mind. Writers, in addition, should assess the bias and reliability of each online source. Assessing bias involves how the arguments made
       use factual information.

     •'''Print Sources''': These sources are useful for conducting background research on a topic &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;. Most background 
      research on a current event or issue is available in newspapers and magazines. Such sources can give impressions on how to frame a debate while considering
      who is involved &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;. Books also work as resources for researching background information. They are useful in 
      exploring the historical dimensions of a topic. From that, writers can develop a better understanding of the issue. Overall, it is important to look for 
      the most recent information available, as some sources can become outdated quickly.

     •'''Empirical Sources''': As with a review, it is likely that an expert on a topic or issue is available, particularly on university campuses. In this case,
      writers of commentaries can correspond with the expert by using e-mail or another mode of correspondence to set up an interview.  Aside from interviews, 
      writers of commentaries can use surveys and/or field observations. This, of course, depends on the topic.

With all of the potential sources to use for writing commentaries, writers should triangulate their sources. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;. Triangulating sources helps confirm facts to gain a broader understanding of an issue.

==How Do Writers Organize and Draft Their Commentaries?==

As mentioned earlier, the best commentaries often grab the readers' attention immediately. In any format, including the commentary, the best writers often lead readers through a series of argument supporting a specific position. There is often the consideration of what type of information is best suitable for the writer's intended audience. In other words, writers of commentaries must focus on what the audience needs to know.

===Introduction===

In the introduction, it is often the case that writers generate reader interest if there is the use of information not previously considered &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;. Within the introduction, it is best to do to two things: 

     •'''State the Purpose''': This usually happens immediately in any genre, but it is especially important for writing commentaries. In other words, readers 
      want their writers to &quot;get to the point.&quot; At the same time, readers have a surprising interest in the angle writers of commentaries take.

     •'''State the Main Point or Thesis Statement''': In the introduction of a commentary, writers should be clear about what they want to either prove or 
      disprove &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;. Sometimes, writers of commentaries state their main point immediately. Solid thesis statements give 
      readers a clear sense of the direction the commentary will take.

===Explanation===

The amount of explanation needed in a commentary depends on how familiar readers are with both the topic and the issue &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;. When explaining the topic and the event, writers should explain what has already happened. Writers should also summarize what others have said about the topic and the issue. If, for example, readers are already familiar with a topic, then the explanation should be very brief. Writers, therefore, should give enough information to remember an event or the origins of an ongoing debate.

If readers are not already familiar with a topic or an issue, then writers should provide enough background to help stimulate the readers' interest &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;. In this case, writers will need to explain who was involved, where and when it happened, how it happened, and why. Additionally, writers should show as many angles to the debate as possible by summarizing what others have said.

===Support===

It is impossible to include all the possible information in explaining why a writer's own position is the most credible&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, writers often pick the best and most important pieces of evidence while they devote an appropriate amount of time explaining them. In most commentaries, each piece of evidence receive one to two paragraphs of coverage. Each piece of evidence should support the main point (or thesis statement) while each piece should provide a solid structure for taking an angle on the topic and issue at hand.

===Clarification===

This section often comes before the conclusion. When writing this section of a commentary, writers should make their readers of the complexities involved in the issue &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;. Here, writers need to make their arguments clear, particularly when they insert new information or events that could complicate the overall argument. In most cases, writers use '''signal phrases''' such as:

     • &quot;I'm not arguing here for a complete ... but only ...&quot;
     • &quot;I understand, of course, but ...&quot;
     • &quot;I'm only suggesting that ...&quot;
     • &quot;I recognize that the people on the other side want to do the right thing, too&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most clarifications are only one paragraph in length, depending on the extent of the issue as well as how much readers already know about the topic and the issue. Often, clarification prevents readers from making accusations of writers &quot;painting with too broad a brush&quot;--generalizing too far or failing to consider the fine but important points of an issue &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Conclusion===

Readers should finish reading a commentary with a clear statement of a position writers make. As with any written task, writers often restate the main thesis but in stronger terms. Writers often reemphasize why the topic is important while speculating on what others will say in the future. Many writers of commentaries finish with an anecdote, a figure of speech, a clever turn of phrase, or a lasting image.

==What Is An Appropriate Writing Style for Commentaries?==

Commentaries often use a style that set their arguments apart from writing done for other genres, such as reviews or proposals. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; With the style, writers should see through the lens of someone making a commentary. Important aspects of commentaries to consider are: how writers want their readers to imagine them and how writers want readers to react to the overall tone.
 
===&quot;Getting into Character&quot;===

Johnson and Sheehan suggest that writers of commentaries play their role &quot;like an actor&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Writing Today, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;. Another term for this is &quot;getting into character.&quot; This allows writers of commentaries to write with less constraints. Depending on the tone writers of commentaries wish to convey--whether angry or upbeat--they can let emotions flow onto a screen or page. Writing multiple drafts of commentaries allows writers to explore the specific emotion they use.

===Imitation===

Some commentaries work best when they imitate the style of a well-known critic or commentator. Examples of well-known commentators include [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Will George Will], Glenn Greenwald [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Greenwald Glenn Greenwald], Jeremy Scahill [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Scahill Jeremy Scahill], and Ariana Huffington [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Huffington Ariana Huffington]. Writers of commentaries look closely at how other commentators achieve their style or tone &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;. In most cases, writers of commentaries look for details or words used in a particular way; sentence length; analogies, similes, and metaphors to express complex thoughts; and expression of emotions. Writers should, however, best to avoid imitating the style of an article on the topic they want to write about so as to avoid plagiarism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a Review?==

A review is an essay expressing an informed opinion about a subject while explaining why a writer came to an opinion &lt;ref&gt;Writing Today, Custom Edition for St. Cloud State University. Taken from Writing Today, Second Edition by Richard Johnson-Sheehan and Charles Paine. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013. Print, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead of simply stating whether a writer likes something or not, a review expresses opinions based on common expectations shared with readers. Opinions in a review are important; however, a review must consider what a potential audience might find successful or unsuccessful. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==What Is In a Review?==

Most reviews are films, books, or events. In a review, the writer determines whether a film, book, or event was enjoyable; with films and books, a writer determines whether a reader should or should not watch or purchase the film or book &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;. Many often read a review after purchasing the film or book to see if others agree.

==What Can I Review?==

In many college courses, the review assignment gives writers the chance to express their personal opinion about anything the writers would like &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;. The main purpose of the interview, however, is to develop the ability of supporting arguments and demonstrating an understanding of a subject at hand. 

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 22:39, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

==How Do I Write a Review?==

At least two methods for writing a review are available. In the '''first''' method, there is the following:

     • '''Introduction''' (Identifying the subject reviewed or evaluated)
     • '''Description or summary''' of the subject 
     • Strengths and weaknesses of the '''first''' feature of the subject
     • Strengths and weaknesses of the '''second''' feature of the subject
     • Strengths and weaknesses of the '''third''' feature of the subject
     • '''Conclusion''' (Offering an overall judgment of the subject) &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the '''second''' method available for writing a review, there is the following:

     • '''Introduction'''
     • '''Description or summary''' of the subject
     • '''Strengths''' of the subject
     • '''Weaknesses''' of the subject
     • '''Weighing the strengths and weaknesses''' of the subject
     • '''Conclusion''' &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===What Should I Say About My Subject in the Review?===

Before writing a review on your subject, many writers use a first-hand experience &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, if the subject of the review is a film, it is best to see the film. For a book, it is best to read it. For a product or service, it is best to use it.

However, before actually experiencing the subject, almost all writers suggest engaging in some preliminary inquiry background research. Both can help form a critical perspective for analyzing the subject. Initial inquiries will also help to determine what both writers and readers of reviews should expect of the reviewed subject. On the other hand, background research can help develop a richer understanding of the subject's history and context. 

[[User:MichaelPickar|MichaelPickar]] ([[User talk:MichaelPickar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MichaelPickar|contribs]]) 01:07, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

====Preliminary Inquiry====

As mentioned above, the practice of preliminary inquiry can help achieve common expectations between writers and readers of reviews. This allows for an interactive understanding of what make the reviewed subject successful or unsuccessful. Both writers and readers of reviews should keep in mind that common expectations are not always stated clearly &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

When engaging in a preliminary of the subject about to undergo review, it helps to do some '''brainstorming''' &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;. This can help sort out common expectations. For instance, if a reviewer wants to write about a recent psychological thriller seen in a movie theater, brainstorming can help break down the characteristics of that genre of film. When brainstorming, it is best to make a list of points that stand out the most. When writers use this strategy in the reviews they write, it helps readers understand what to expect if something about the film--for instance, a trailer--piques the interest of the prospective reader.

====Background Research====

Background research can help both writers and readers of reviews better understand the experience of the person reviewing the subject &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are four possible strategies used to gather background research.

• '''Answering the Five-W and How Questions''': This can involve using online or print sources to find out as much as possible about the subject under review. The &quot;Five-W and How Questions&quot; are:
      
       ° ''Who'' were its creators or original developers?
       ° ''What'' exactly is the subject under review?
       ° ''When'' and ''where'' was it created
       ° ''Why'' was it created? (What is its purpose?)
       ° ''How'' was it made?
     
• '''Locating Other Reviews of the Same Subject''': 

This can involve the use of online search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo!) as well as library indexes and databases &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some questions to consider when locating other reviews involve what others have said about the subject under review. What others have said may bring some important insights. Of course, when using another person's review, it is especially important in academic writing to cite the source properly; otherwise, it is considered plagiarism. 
    
• '''Interviewing or Surveying Others''': 

On many college and university campuses, experts abound, particularly regarding the potential subject under review. In cases like this, experts can help provide some common expectations &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;. If there are no official &quot;experts&quot; around, many writers review other people who have had a personal experience with the same subject. Here, writers often ask what others thought of the subject, how they reacted to it, and what they liked or disliked about it. 

• '''Field Observations''': 

These involve watching the subject closely and paying attention to the reactions of others &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, if the potential subject under review is a film, and if the experience of watching the film under review takes place in a cinema, then it is best to observe the reactions of audience members.

====Experiencing the Subject under Review====

Experience a potential subject under review involves, on the one hand, reviewing it is as a regular person while, on the other hand, it involves stepping back and experiencing the subject from a critic's point of view. When members of an audience, including the reviewer, react to a moment in the film, the reviewer must analyze ''why'' there was that specific reaction. Taking notes while experience the subject can provide an additional help. When taking notes, reviewers should keep in mind the common expectations found when engaging in preliminary inquiry and background research. 

Included in the experience of the subject under review is what Johnson-Sheehan and Paine &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; define as the '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Rhetoric_and_Composition/Commentaries&amp;action=edit Believing and Doubting Game]''' involving three common ideas:

     • '''Believing''' (Writing a positive review)
     • '''Doubting''' (Writing a negative review)
     • '''Synthesis''' (Writing a review with &quot;common ground&quot;)

===What is the Style of a Review?===

The style of the review depends on the readers and where they will see it. The best reviews are often those that are accurate while keeping the expectations of their audience in check &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, if the review appears in a mainstream publication or on a website, the style should appear lively as much as it matches the reviewer's reaction to the subject.

Some important elements of style in writing a review include the use of ''detail'', ''tone'', and ''pace''. 

•'''Detail''': More often than not, reviews use sensory detail to include sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, pp. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is not required for writers of reviews to use all of the senses. However, it is important to keep sensory details in mind while writing a review.

•'''Tone''': This should be a reflection of the subject under the review. The voice should match the tone. If a reviewer shows excitement about the subject under review, then it should show in the tone. The same applies to if a reviewer finds the subject as belonging to &quot;poor taste.&quot; 

•'''Pace''': The length of sentences in a review can determine how readers of that same review should react &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine, p,. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;. Shorter sentences can create a more hectic, fast-paced feeling while longer sentences can create a more languid, slower-paced feel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Proposals===

Proposal writing can seem a daunting task. This is partly because the term is loaded with negative baggage. Consider the following common beliefs about proposal writing:

* Writing proposals is scary and difficult. 
* Writing a proposal is putting your soul on the line. 
* The presentation must be perfect. 
* A proposal must be written at the last minute under extreme stress. &lt;ref&gt;Reeds, Kitta. The Zen of Proposal Writing. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2002. Print. p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These beliefs are common, no matter how large the proposal project is. Do your best to let go of these beliefs and replace them with more productive ones. In addition to limiting beliefs, another common barrier to proposal writing is procrastination &lt;ref&gt;Reeds, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;. If you procrastinate, you will not produce your best work. To avoid this, set a series of short-term goals and give yourself a concrete deadline. Be realistic in setting your goals and leave time for unexpected barriers to arise along the way &lt;ref&gt;Reeds, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;. Begin writing the proposal early.  

During the process of writing a proposal, it is important to keep an attitude that is open to change. Like most writing, a proposal evolves and changes because it is a process. If you are too rigid in your thinking processes and goals, you will likely get stuck &lt;ref&gt;Reeds, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;. Openness to change and a willingness to communicate are key, especially when you are working with an individual or organization to which you’re directing your proposal. Writing a proposal often involves continuous dialogue with a program officer &lt;ref&gt;Moursund, David. Obtaining Resources for Technology in Education: A How-to Guide for Writing Proposals, Forming Partnerships, &amp; Raising Funds. Eugene: International Society for Technology in Education, 1996. Print. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;. This dialogue will include you asking questions of the program officer to guide your research, and filling them in with your progress, using their feedback as a guide. Keeping this cycle of communication going will ensure that your proposal stays in line with the mission of the organization, and keeps you by wasting time and energy from getting off track.

==Preliminary Research==

''Defining the Problem''
A proposal is essentially a solution to ta problem. Proposals often stem from an individual’s heartfelt wish to address this problem. Although personal conviction and passion can give meaning and drive towards the completion of the proposal, these are not enough &lt;ref&gt;Moursund, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;. In order to come up with a viable solution, you need to build a solid foundation of research on the problem. You can use online, print and empirical sources to research the problem (e.g., interviews, field observation, etc.) &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan and Paine 232-233&lt;/ref&gt;. Gathering this research helps you identify possible solutions and eliminate solutions that will not work. You can also include your research in your proposal to show that you have a working knowledge of the issue, strengthening your credibility. 

''Writing with the Reader Mind''
As you write your proposal, it is helpful to imagine your real audience. Doing this acts as an anchor because it reminds you that your goal is to explain your ideas to a real person. Once you have your audience in mind, you can begin analyzing what they want by asking a series of questions. Kitta Reeds describes this in terms of the “buyer” and demonstrates the importance of moving from vague, general questions to specific questions: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- 
! From !! To
|-
| Is my idea any good, anyway? || Who will want to buy this idea?
|-
| What do I want to say?  || What does the buyer want to hear?
|-
| Can I actually write this? || How can I target my idea to this specific buyer?
|-
| What’s the best way for me to say it? || How will that buyer understand it best?
|-
| How can I convince anyone to buy this idea? || What logic of persuasion or entertainment will attract that buyer?
|-
| What do I want to say first? || What will this buyer want to know first?
|-
| How do I want to organize this proposal? || What will the buyer want to know next?
|-
| What do I mean to say here? || What does this buyer need to hear at this point to be convinced?
|-
|} &lt;ref&gt;Reeds, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

By shifting to questions about a real audience, the proposal writer simultaneously reduces their anxiety through depersonalization while producing specific answers that will guide the writing process. Although the above chart targets a specific buyer, this kind of analysis can extend to proposals that are not asking for money (although in a sense, anyone who reads your proposal is a “buyer” of your ideas). 

==Outlining a Solution==
In the process of building and organizing ideas, it’s helpful to use a variety of techniques to help you visualize and play with the structure. Mindmaps, sticky notes, and list making are all good ways of generating and organizing ideas (you can search Google for free mindmapping softwares). A mindmap uses symbols organized spatially and it focuses on relationships between ideas, usually using arrows. Sticky notes can be made into a mindmap and are convenient because they allow you to easily move ideas around &lt;ref&gt;Reeds, p. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt;.   
In addition to using the tools to organize your ideas, you can also do more research to grow your solution. Find similar projects and determine which aspects make them successful or unsuccessful. Once you have a basic outline of your solution, make a chart of its cost and benefits &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand, Richard, Paine, Charles. Writing Today. Boston: Pearson, 2010. Print. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Writing the Proposal==

''Introduction''
A strong introduction is concise and direct. If you choose to give background information, keep it to a minimum &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Johnson-Sheehand, an introduction should contain the following points in some order or another: topic, purpose, background information, importance of the topic to the readers and the main point &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;. 

''Description of the Problem''
Following your introduction is a description of the problem. This should begin by emphasizing why this problem is important and relevant to the reader, followed by its causes and consequences. This section should end with a sense of exigency (creating an urgent need that demands action). Tell the reader what will happen if the problem is not addressed -&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Body''
The introduction to the main body of your proposal should also be concise (notice a theme here?). State what your proposal is and why it is the best &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;. A short and direct explanation and justification of your proposal establishes credibility early, and prepares the reader to follow the details of your proposal. After this brief overview, you can then provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how your plan will be carried out &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;. Your concluding statement should discuss the deliverables of your proposal, that is, the concrete benefits carrying out your proposal &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Costs and Benefits''
Prior to your conclusion, you can further support your argument by including a costs and benefits section &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;. 

''Conclusion''
Once again, the conclusion should be short and concise. In it you should do three things: restate the thesis, restress the importance of the topic, and “look to the future,” which helps the reader visualize how the proposal will result in a brighter future &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Presenting the Proposal
''Before you present your proposal, you should do a thorough revision and proofread. It should be polished, error-free and represent your best work &lt;ref&gt;Moursund, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;. Your style should be persuasive and authoritative &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;. Connecting with your audience important, because you are trying to persuade them to accept your proposal. Rhetorical devices (ethos, pathos, and logos) will enhance your argument. Metaphors and similes can be particularly influential &lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehand and Paine, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lifestreaming and Lifecasting==

Lifestreaming is recording your daily activities online using blog posts, tweets, Facebook status updates, and a whole host of different tools. Lifecasting is the same as lifestreaming, the only difference is, you're broadcasting video to record yourself. These two streaming techniques have taken off in popularity due to the social media craze nowadays. It's very easy to record your daily life. Websites like YouTube and Twitter have lot of people who do blogs and record things to share with others. If you plan on using your phone to stream, it is recommended to have an unlimited data plan because it uses a lot of data in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Computers 13th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;references/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f\in AC[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; be an absolutely continuous function on [0,1] with &lt;math&gt;f&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Prove that &lt;math&gt;1/f\in AC[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

===Solution===
Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is (absolutely) continuous on [0,1] with &lt;math&gt;f&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then there exists some &lt;math&gt;0&lt;m=\min_{x\in[0,1]} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;f\in AC[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;  then for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for any finite collection of disjoint intervals &lt;math&gt;I_k=(x_k,y_k),k=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n|y_k-x_k|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n|f(y_k)-f(x_k)|&lt;\epsilon m^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Then for any such collection of intervals described above, we have 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n |\frac{1}{f(y_k)}-\frac{1}{f(x_k)} =\sum_{k=1}^n |\frac{f(x_k)-f(y_k)}{f(y_k)f(x_k)}| \leq  \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{m^2}|f(y_k)-f(x_k)|&lt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Diabetic Wound.jpg|thumb|right|diabetic neuropathy increases the risk of foot damage]] The type and range of nursing intervention will depend on the gland affected. Most hormone imbalances occur as deficiency, but some as excess. Clients with hormonal problems may be suffering from severe body image distress as a result of their perceived 'deficiency'. Some clients will accept monitoring of their condition which may range from occasional blood assay to hourly pin-prick or urine testing. Nurses have a pivotal role in health screening, during assessment of clients undergoing the care of nursing services.

==Diabetes==

[[File:GlucaGen.jpg|thumb|right|glucagon antidote for insulin overdose]]
[[File:Pucion de dedo.jpg|thumb|blood glucose monitoring]]
[[File:Box of lancets.JPG|thumb|right|lancets for blood glucose monitoring]]
By far the most common endocrine disorder, affecting the majority of people in retirement and over-represented in Aboriginal populations. 
===Symptoms===
*Polydipsia - excessive thirst
*Polyuria - excessive urine production
*Polphagia - excessive hunger and eating

Diabetes management should be deployed with concern for long term complications as well as immediate relief. Impaired circulation is a common problem for patients with diabetes. Circulatory conditions can cause tissue hypoxia (lack of oxygen). Neuropathy associated with diabetes reduces ability to sense pressure. As a result, patients with diabetes may experience trauma, especially to the feet, without realizing it. Diabetic ulcers heal more slowly because of the poor circulation. The wounds are prone to infection because of the high levels of sugar in circulation, and immunocompromise may also be present.
Necrosis of the toes and feet, leading to amputation, are common enough that regular podiatrist appointments are usual.

Diabetes also leads to renal failure and glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye), leading to blindness.
===Management===
Referral for diabetes education and dietetics. A cochrane study showed short term benefit from specialist diabetes nursing.
There may be some benefit from Cinnamon bark &lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007170.pub2/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mendor Discreet All-in-one Blood Glucose Meter.jpg|thumb| sugar monitor]]
==Thyroid disease==
[[File:Thyroid cancer.jpg|thumb|left thyroid cancer]] 
Hypothyroidism is the most common thyroid disease.
Excessive Thyroxine secreted by cancer is most often treated surgically, in which case hypothyroidism is the result and supplemental treatment with thyroxine required.
Iodine deficiency goitre was once common in inland peasant farmers, but this is less an issue due to iodized salt and improved nutrition generally.
Thyroid function Test is part of a routine medical work-up and few cases are missed in industrial societies.

===Symptoms===
Thyroid hormones regulate the body metabolism and changes to this function are expected in illness
*sleep
*libido
*apetite
*activity
*mood
A Goitre is a large soft thyroid mass which forms as the body adapts, to concentrate sufficient electrolytes to manufacture adequate thyroid hormones, in response to dietary lack of Iodine.
Exopthalmos is the protrusion of the eyes in Hyperthyroidism.
Mood alterations are sometimes misdiagnosed as Endogenous depression or mania depending on the direction of affective deflection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Who provides aid&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
----

&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;br&gt;'''Bilateral Aid''' is given by the government of one country directly to another. Many dedicated governmental aid agencies dispense bilateral aid, for example Europeaid, USAID, DFID, MAE.&amp;nbsp; 

&lt;br&gt; 

'''Multilateral aid '''is given from the government of a country to an international agency, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, or the European Development Fund. These organizations are usually governed by the contributing countries. Donations from private individuals and for-profit companies are another significant type of aid. 

Many immigrants move to areas of increased economic opportunity, and send money to friends and family members who still live in the countries they left. These payments are known as remittances and constitute a significant portion of international monetary transfers. 

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a major role in distributing aid. Many non-profit charitable organizations solicit donations from the public to support their work; charitable foundations often oversee an endowment which they invest and use the proceeds to support aid organizations and other causes. Aid organizations may provide both humanitarian and development aid, or specialize in one or the other. SOme &amp;nbsp;NGOs have an affiliation with a religious denomination. 

Many NGOs conduct their own international operations - distributing food and water, building pipelines and homes, teaching, providing health care, lending money, etc. Some government aid agencies also conduct direct operations, but there are also many contracts with or grants to NGOs who actually provide the desired aid. 

Scholarships to foreign students, whether from a government or a private school or university, might also be considered a type of development aid. 

&lt;br&gt; 

'''Private aid''' 

Development charities make up a vast web of non-governmental organizations, religious ministries, foundations, business donations and college scholarships devoted to development aid.

'''European Commission External Cooperation Programme &amp;nbsp;(EuropeAid)'''&lt;br&gt;The European Union, composed of the Member States and the European Commission, is the world’s biggest aid donor. The Commission’s EuropeAid co-operation office manages EU external aid programmes and ensures that development assistance is delivered worldwide. 

EuropeAid's main mission is to implement the Commission’s external aid instruments, both those funded by the Union’s budget and the European Development Fund. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EuropeAid works in collaboration with its various partners: Civil society, international organisations and governments of EU Member States, building synergies and subsidairites, , &amp;nbsp;with the aim to make external aid more participated and effective.&amp;nbsp; 

EU development assistance is distributed through multi-annual programmes (1) which are coordinated by the European Commission’s Directorate General for Development (for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries) and the the Directorate General External Relations for the rest of the world.&lt;br&gt;When formulating and managing these programmes, the Commission consults the authorities in partner countries. This results in an agreed country and regional strategy paper (2), which includes a multi-annual national indicative programme.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==String Theory as a Theory of Everything==
In the past couple of decades, only recently were alternative thoughts of past, present, and future  dimension thought to exist. But as more relative physical and particle data are being discovered, more and more theories of extra dimensions, in which quantum mechanists believe alternatives live in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Supersymmetry=
This chapter on supersymmetry intends to present it WITHOUT the use of Grassmann variables, preferring to use instead the formalism of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; grading.

A '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graded vector space is a vector space together with an assignment of an even (bosoninc) (corresponding to 0 of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and an odd (fermionic) (corresponding to 1) subspace such that the vector space is the direct sum of the even and odd subspaces.

An even vector is an element of the even subspace and an odd vector is an element of the odd subspace. A pure vector is either an even or an odd vector. Any vector can be decomposed uniquely as the sum of an even and an odd vector.

The tensor product of two '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graded vector spaces is another '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graded vector space.

In fact, in this book, we will take the stronger point of view that it makes no physical sense to add even and odd vectors together. From this point of view, we might as well view a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graded vector space as an ordered pair &lt;V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; where V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the even space and V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the odd space.

Similarly, a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graded algebra is an algebra A with a direct sum decomposition into an even and an odd part such that the product of two pure elements obeys the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relations. Alternatively, we can think of it as &lt;A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;.

A '''Lie superalgebra''' is a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-graded algebra  whose product [·,&amp;nbsp;·], called the '''Lie superbracket''' or '''supercommutator''', satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;[x,y]=-(-1)^{|x| |y|}[y,x]&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{|z| |x|}[x,[y,z]]+(-1)^{|x| |y|}[y,[z,x]]+(-1)^{|y| |z|}[z,[x,y]]=0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are pure in the '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading. Here, |''x''| denotes the degree of ''x'' (either 0 or 1).

Lie superalgebras are a natural generalization of normal Lie algebras to include a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading. Indeed, the above conditions on the superbracket are exactly those on the normal Lie bracket with modifications made for the grading. The last condition is sometimes called the '''super Jacobi identity'''. 

Note that the even subalgebra of a Lie superalgebra forms a (normal) Lie algebra as all the funny signs disappear, and the superbracket becomes a normal Lie bracket.

One way of thinking about a Lie superalgebra—it's not the most symmetric way of looking at it—is to consider its even and odd parts, L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; separately. Then, L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a Lie algebra, L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear rep of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and there exists a symmetric L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-intertwiner &lt;math&gt;\{.,.\}:L_1\otimes L_1\rightarrow L_0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all x,y and z in L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{x, y\right\}[z]+\left\{y, z\right\}[x]+\left\{z, x\right\}[y]=0&lt;/math&gt;

A '''supermanifold''' is a concept in noncommutative geometry. Recall that in noncommutative geometry, we don't look at point set spaces but instead, the algebra of functions over them. If M is a (differential) manifold and H is an (smooth) algebra bundle over M with a Grassmann algebra as the fiber, then the space of (smooth) sections of M forms a supercommutative algebra under pointwise multiplication. We say that this algebra ''defines'' the supermanifold (which isn't a point set space).

If M is a real manifold and we define an involution * over the fiber turning it into a * algebra, then the resulting algebra would define a real supermanifold.

==Conformal Transformations==
===The Conformal Group===
The story of string theory begins with two-dimensional conformal invariance. 

Conformal transformations on a manifold preserve angles at every point, an example of such a transformation being the Mercator projection of the Earth onto an infinite cylinder. They may be defined as transformations that leave the metric invariant up to a scale.

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{g}_{\mu \nu}(\underline{x}^\xi) = \Lambda(x^\xi) g_{\mu \nu}(x^\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

The set of invertable conformal transformations form a group. This is the conformal group.

Let us apply this rule to a two dimensional manifold.   

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{g}_{\underline{\mu} \underline{\nu}}(\underline{x}^\xi) = \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{x}^\underline{\mu}}{\partial x^\mu} \right ) \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{x}^\underline{\nu}}{\partial x^\nu} \right ) g_{\mu \nu}(x^\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

For this transformation to be conformal the metrics must be proportional to one another, which means, 

: &lt;math&gt; \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{x}^\underline{\mu}}{\partial x^\mu} \right ) \left ( \frac{\partial \underline{x}^\underline{\nu}}{\partial x^\nu} \right ) \propto \delta_\mu^\underline{\mu} \delta_\nu^\underline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Writing out the components, the following conditions emerge: 

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial z^0}{\partial \underline{z}^0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial z^0}{\partial \underline{z}^1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\partial z^1}{\partial \underline{z}^0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial z^1}{\partial \underline{z}^1}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \underline{x}^0}{\partial x^0}\frac{\partial \underline{x}^1}{\partial x^0}+\frac{\partial \underline{x}^0}{\partial x^1}\frac{\partial \underline{x}^1}{\partial x^1}&lt;/math&gt;

These conditions turn out to be equivalent to the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for either holomorphic or antiholomorphic functions!

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \underline{x}^1}{\partial x^0} = \frac{\partial \underline{x}^0}{\partial x^1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \underline{x}^0}{\partial x^0} = -\frac{\partial \underline{x}^1}{\partial x^1}&lt;/math&gt; (holomorphic)

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \underline{x}^1}{\partial x^0} = -\frac{\partial \underline{x}^0}{\partial x^1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \underline{x}^0}{\partial x^0} = \frac{\partial \underline{x}^1}{\partial x^1}&lt;/math&gt; (antiholomorphic)

In two dimensions, therefore, the conformal group is the set of all invertable holomorphic maps, which is isomorphic to the set of all antiholomorphic maps. For this reason it is convenient to use complex coordinates when discussing two-dimensional conformal fields.

The set of all reversible holomorphic functions is the set of fractional linear transformations 

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{\heartsuit z - \clubsuit }{ \spadesuit z + \diamondsuit}&lt;/math&gt;
:: where
: &lt;math&gt;\heartsuit \diamondsuit - \clubsuit \spadesuit = 1&lt;/math&gt;

It is easily verified by composing two such functions that their composition is equivalent to matrix multiplication for matrices of the form  

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \heartsuit &amp; \clubsuit \\ \spadesuit &amp; \diamondsuit \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that the conformal group in two dimensions is equivalent to the group of complex invertible &lt;math&gt;2\times2&lt;/math&gt; matrices having a determinate of 1. This group is also known as &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">From the 1950s to the present day, the United States has experienced a boom in the prevalence of two convenience technologies - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through drive-thru] restaurants and in-vehicle [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_holder cup holders]. This chapter will discuss the influence of culture on technology, and technology in turn on culture, specifically with regards to these innovations. This chapter considers the perspectives of two major social groups - corporations and drivers - but does not examine the potential impacts of eating in the car on public health or driving safety, or any advocacy groups that may have formed as a result of these concerns. 

==Culture==

===Busy Culture===

More Americans are working than ever before, and the demographic makeup of the labor force provides us with valuable insights about long-term cultural shifts.

====Increase in Workforce &amp; Women in Workforce====

From 1950 to 2000, the ratio of employed individuals to the total population increased from 52.7% to 59.2%&lt;ref&gt;Change in Hours Worked, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review Vol. 28, No. 1, July 2004, pp. 14–33&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time period, the total population of the United States increased from 150 million&lt;ref&gt;1950 Census - http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/1950.html&lt;/ref&gt; to 281 million&lt;ref&gt;2000 census - http://www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This information shows that the American work force has increased dramatically - from 79 million individuals in 1950 to 167 million in 2000.

In addition to increasing in size, the demographic composition of the labor force has also changed. In 1976, women made up just 40.5% of the work force; in 2006, that number had increased to 47.4% &lt;ref&gt;AN OVERVIEW OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL,
AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AFFECTING THE US LABOR MARKET, United States Department of Labor - http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/TrendsI.htm#.UMd_3JPjlqd&lt;/ref&gt;. This is indicative of a larger cultural trend - that of women preferring to pursue a career outside of the home to being a stay-at-home mother&lt;ref&gt;Gallup - http://www.gallup.com/poll/157313/half-women-prefer-job-outside-home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 1950 to 2000, the average number of hours worked per person each week increased from 22.3 to 23.9; however, with the aforementioned increase in size of the labor force, each worker has noticed a decline in hours worked per week, from 42.4 to 40.5 over the same time period&lt;ref&gt;Change in Hours Worked, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review Vol. 28, No. 1, July 2004, pp. 14–33&lt;/ref&gt;. While the average worker is not working longer hours than their historical counterparts, they are spending more time commuting to work, with an average commute time of 50 minutes per day&lt;ref&gt; When Home Seems To Be on the Road - http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/16/AR2008021600750_2.html?sid=ST2008021600970 &lt;/ref&gt; - equivalent to two weeks per year in the car. In addition, there are a variety of other factors that contribute to the perception of constant busyness.

====Social Pressures====

While the following traits are particularly noticeable in Millennials, members of all generations are susceptible to &quot;The Busy Trap&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Busy Trap - http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/&lt;/ref&gt;. While more individuals are working, it is the external social factors that are likely to contribute to the perception of busyness - increased connectivity due to the spread of telecommunications technology, the derivation of pleasure or social cachet from being needed, the fear of missing out&lt;ref&gt;FOMO - http://www.researchgate.net/publication/230766160_An_Ocean_of_Information/file/9fcfd5040cf2fd559e.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; or being passed over for opportunities or promotions if one does not become highly involved&lt;ref&gt;If Time Is Money, Millenials are Broke - http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/05/if-time-is-money-millennials-are-broke-busy-obsessed/2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Too Busy To Notice You’re too Busy - http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/31/business/31shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;.

The pressure to become increasingly involved is also present in the youngest generations - those who have not yet entered the work force.  In 2012, the Common Application (accepted by over 400 institutions of higher learning in the United States) increased the number of spaces in which to list extracurriculars from seven to twelve&lt;ref&gt;Common Application - http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/education/07choice-t.html&lt;/ref&gt;. While it was officially the consolidation of spaces for work experience and extracurriculars, the move is perceived by some as a mandate for involvement in twelve extracurricular activities, or a response to students who needed more than seven slots to list all of their involvements. Student involvement drove the change, and the change, in turn, is driving student involvement.

===Convenience Culture ===

The increase in busyness demonstrated previously has led Americans to seek products and services that will accommodate their schedules. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store#United_States Convenience stores] that are open 24 hours a day began to appear in the early 1960s and are contributing to a phenomenon known as the &quot;death of diurnal time&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Working In A 24/7 Economy: Challenges For American Families - http://books.google.com/books?id=56gXBZzzY7AC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=harriet+Presser+death+of+diurnal+time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uxipfMuGU-&amp;sig=72n6sXB6PBHrymSKsmHv3toUcVM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tgzGULa9IZGB0AHF6IHIBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=harriet%20Presser%20death%20of%20diurnal%20time&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;. Several other industries have been created and supported as a result of an American preoccupation with busyness and convenience.

==Drive-Thrus==

Spending an increasing amount of time in the car has created a perceived need for the on-the-go consumption where over 20% of meals are eaten in the car&lt;ref&gt;11 Facts about American Eating Habits - http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-american-eating-habits &lt;/ref&gt;.

===History of the Drive-Thru===
[[Image:Speedee_in_Gentilly.jpg|thumb|right|McDonald's original mascot, &quot;Speedee&quot;]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-In Drive-in restaurants], popular in the 1950s and 1960s, used to be a quick and social dining experience.  The customer’s food was delivered to the car by a carhop and customer's enjoyed their meals in their parked cars.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's McDonald’s], an influential company in the fast food movement, introduced a “Speedee Service System” in 1948 that allowed drive-in customers to serve themselves to make the dining process quicker and cheaper&lt;ref name = &quot;MD&quot;&gt;McDonald's History - http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mcdonalds_history_timeline.html?DCSext.destination=http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mcd_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Their original mascot was a character named Speedee to represent their commitment to fast service.   However, customers deemed this fast service insufficient and the invention of the drive-thru promoted meals to-go.  The first drive-thru was thought to be Red’s Giant Hamburgs, created in 1947 on Route 66 in Springfield Missouri&lt;ref&gt;When Was the First Drive-Thru Restaurant Created? - http://www.wisegeek.org/when-was-the-first-drive-thru-restaurant-created.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, it wasn’t until 1975 that McDonald’s created their first drive-thru in Sierra Vista, Arizona&lt;ref name = &quot;MD&quot;/&gt;.  It was at this time, during the late 70’s, that the technology really began to take off and proliferate into what exists today.

===Evolution of Drive-Thrus=== 

A drive-thru operation is a highly logistical system that has evolved with technology.  An annual Drive-Thru Performance Study commissioned by QSR&lt;ref&gt;QSR Homepage - http://www.qsrmagazine.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and Insula Research&lt;ref&gt;Insula Research Homepage - http://www.insularesearch.com/&lt;/ref&gt; evaluates businesses’ improvements in drive-thru service.  Researchers use a list of benchmarks for assessment, the most important being: speed, accuracy, service and cleanliness.  Initially, the speed of service increased significantly with advances in technology. However, while speed and accuracy remain desired end goals, current innovation in drive-thrus focuses on streamlining the process as much as possible to increase capacity, improve efficiency, and appeal to the customer.  Companies have begun preparing better for rush periods, teaming drive-thru crewmembers, reducing the number of times the employee reaches out of the window, and using line-busting technologies such as an outside order-taker.  Some chains are additionally considering implementing immediate credit card swipes and mobile ordering&lt;ref&gt;2012 QSR Drive-Thru Study - http://www.qsrmagazine.com/reports/2012-qsr-drive-thru-study?microsite=5&lt;/ref&gt;.  Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPD_Group NPD Group], highlights the importance of drive-thrus for companies as she states, “a successful drive-thru operation translates to higher customer satisfaction, repeat business, and more profit”&lt;ref name = &quot;NPD&quot;&gt;Drive-thru Windows Still Put the Fast in Fast Food Restaurants, Reports NPD - https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr_120530a/&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Starbucks and Bank of America Drive Through.jpg|thumb|left|Drive-thrus are prevalent in other industries, including coffee shops and banks]]

===Prominence of Drive-Thrus and Culture===

Today, the prevalence of drive-thrus is undeniable.  In 2011 there were 12.4 billion visits to fast food drive-thrus&lt;ref name = &quot;NPD&quot;/&gt; and Americans eat nearly 32 fast food meals per person in their cars each year&lt;ref name = &quot;cup&quot;&gt; Cars and Quick-Service. - http://www2.qsrmagazine.com/articles/features/94/car_design-1.phtml &lt;/ref&gt;.  Drive-thrus streamline routines and any slight disruption to convenience is an unwelcome intrusion.  A 2012 report by the NPD Group reported that &quot;when consumers complain about their drive-thru experience it’s because they somehow lost time&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NPD&quot;/&gt;.  However, the need for time-saving conveniences does not stop with drive-thru restaurants as there are also drive-thru coffee shops, pharmacies, postal services, and banks. The popularity of performing tasks from our cars has even led to the creation of National Drive Thru Day, celebrated each year on July 24.


==Cup Holders==

===History of the Cup Holder===
[[Image:Cupholder.JPG|thumb|right|retractable cup holder in a Saab 9-5.]]
The car cup holder was first introduced in the 1950s with the invention of the snack tray, a removable tray that hung from the dashboard of a car. Common 1950s ads pictured the snack tray as a travel experience. In the 1960s coffee cups were redesigned with wider bottoms to provide stability for drinks placed on the floor or dashboard of a vehicle, but created the need for an in car cup holder&lt;ref&gt; How Americans came to have cup holders in their cars. - http://www.slate.com/articles/business_and_tech/design/2004/03/drink_me.html &lt;/ref&gt;
. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubbermaid Rubbermaid] pictured ads in the 1970s for removable cup holders that either attached to the window or glove compartment&lt;ref&gt; Ludington Daily News 1979 - http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qycKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IUoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3622,3117740&amp;dq=cup-holder+car&amp;hl=en &lt;/ref&gt;. The first built in cup holder appeared as shallow grooves in glove compartments. Then in the 1980s, cup holders were integrated into the design of the car and appeared between the front passenger seats or front consoles. The integration of cup holders into the car increased after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Corporation Stella Liebeck v. McDonald’s Corporation] case in 1994 and by the early 2000s over 60% of drivers report using their cup holders every day&lt;ref name = &quot;cup&quot;/&gt;.

===Evolution of In-Car Conveniences===

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Series_60 1948 Oldsmobile] was the first commercial vehicle sold with an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission automatic transmission], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission manual transmissions] now account for less than 10% of vehicles sold in the United States&lt;ref&gt; More Americans driving stick-shift - http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-05-04/news/31576912_1_stick-shift-fuel-efficient-cars-transmission &lt;/ref&gt;. The launch of the automatic transmission in the 1940s enabled food and beverage consumption in the car by freeing the driver’s right hand. Since its introduction, American cars have also incorporated many other technologies that encourage eating or drinking in the car. A study by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil ExxonMobil] found that over 70% of drivers admit to eating while driving and 83% to drinking&lt;ref&gt; Eating while Driving and Distracted Driving Facts - http://www.drive-safely.net/eating-while-driving.html &lt;/ref&gt;. Modern vehicles feature built in or removable pull-down trays with special recesses for dipping sauces, stationary tray tables, and redesigned seating with shared tables. More expensive technologies include cup holders than can heat or cool a beverage, automatic cup lights at night, stain and odor-resistant upholstery, and compact refrigerators&lt;ref name = &quot;cup&quot; /&gt;.

===In-Car Consumption and Culture===

Americans lead increasingly busy lifestyles that necessitate convenience, driving the cup holder to become an integral feature of the car, with some cars having more than 10 cup holders. An article featured on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msnbc MSNBC] depicts a perspective of this relationship, “Most Americans, regardless of how jaded they are about what cup holders represent (our lifestyle of never-ending, on-the-go consumption, […] even when driving), have grown to demand them”&lt;ref name = “msnbc”&gt; Cup holders paved way for interior car design - http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31613390/ns/business-autos/t/cup-holders-paved-way-interior-car-design/#.UMlmGYWs1sU &lt;/ref&gt;. The use of the cup holder is also a reflection of the unique driving culture in the United States as stated by Keith Price of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen Volkswagen], “In Germany, cars are for driving, not for dining, and there is a strong cultural objection to eating in the car”&lt;ref name = &quot;cup&quot; /&gt;.

==Conclusion==

Americans perceive themselves as busier than ever, and are spending more time in their cars, particularly on their way to work. This cultural shift towards busyness and increased time spent in the car has led some Americans to seek products and services that can be obtained or performed on the go. Technology develops as a result of consumer demands.  Consumers adapt to technological innovations and as technologies become normalized, people seek further improvement. In turn, the availability of convenience encourages greater utilization of these services which influences the consumer’s attitude toward a busy lifestyle. Social behavior is shaped by the way technology can be used. More generally, the influence of culture on technology and technology on culture is cyclical. The application of this lesson in the case of drive-thru fast food and cup holders leads to the conclusion that Americans’ cars are becoming dining rooms.

=== Indian commitment to MDGs ===
[[File:The role of Governament in giving access to people to essential services-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|The role of Government in giving access to people to essential services]]

We are committed to our goals. MDGs is an UN terminology; if you want to describe our goals as MDGs that is a different issue. I'm making this distinction because in our program we acknowledge the importance of MDGs but we don't call this a commitment because of MDGs... this has been a been part of our planning process for years. Across the world some governments are commitment some our not; in India also some state are committed and some are not. 
[[File:Indian Public Programmes and MDG objectives-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|Indian Public Programmes and MDGs]]
Ultimately in a democratic environment whatever a government does is because that is what the people who elected it wanted it to do... because if the government recognizes that if carries on doing this it won't be elected again, it won't do it
&lt;br /&gt;

What are the factors which generate poverty?   Low productivity, low access to resource, not having education and the economy not generating productive jobs. This is what underdevelopment means.
&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:The Factors Generating Poverty-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|left|The Factors Generating Poverty]]

In a broader sense resources includes human resources, natural resources, land resources and to the extent the government has to play a role it has to be financial resources, since the government has to spend money. A system that has a lot of resources in the private sector, a financial system that delivers the resources where they can be most productive and a government that can generate resources through the fiscal system... put together can put in place a lot of programs that can address the factors which create poverty.&lt;br /&gt;

Poverty is not to be just defined in income earning possibility, it is also access to essential service… like health, electrification, clean drinking water, sanitation. These are very important part in the efforts to remove poverty and the Government is involved in all of them.

=== How to implement efficiently development programmes ===
[[File:Deliversing results is much more complex than designing Government schemes - social participation is required-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|Delivering results is much more complex than designing Government schemes - social participation is required]]

[[File:In a democracy we need a participated approach to development-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|left|In a democracy we need a participated approach to development]]

No scheme is perfect, it is impossible to have a scheme which has zero leakage. When you say that they don't reach at the bottom do you mean that the leakage is 100... absolutely not! Leakage are high, even as high as 30%, but 70% is reaching at people. The other reason people think that the schemes are not having the effect that the effect that were expected, is that the challenges are very complex one... you can have very good schemes but you don't deliver the result. (Gives example of education) and says that Pratham brings out a report every year and saw that 37% percent of children in class 5 cannot read a text for class 2. Now if you say that therefore the benefits are not reaching the target population, in a sense you are right. But what can the government do? It sets up schools, it higher teachers... we say that you need to have more parent-teacher involvement, you must have local communities enforcing accountability, teachers must be made to teach. These are things that are not just done by governments, these are things done by social pressure, social awareness, social mobilization and it would not surprise me that it takes time.  It is not true that nothing is happening, lots is happening!

&lt;br /&gt;
Difficulties in achieving Human Developments Goals in a Democracy.
You must not think of setting right defects as a mechanical task. Many of the human development goals can be achieved top down in an Autocracy, because you can just enforce things. In a democracy you cannot do that. The other way you do that is social mobilization and social pressure. That requires participation, empowerment, capacity building and social homogeneity.

&lt;br /&gt;

=== What is the relationship between &quot;Global&quot; and &quot;Local&quot; agendas and responsibilities? ===   
[[File:India as Donor and Aid Receiving Country-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|left|India as Donor and Aid Receiving Country]]
India is both a donor and an aid receiving country. We have always felt that we have some capacity to help people. Globally we are among the poorest country so we accept aid... but we also want to show that we can use some of our resources in other to help other countries where possible.&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:The decision of involving the NGOs has to be taken by the local authorities-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|The decision of involving the NGOs has to be taken by the local authorities]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

When good NGOs get involved they improve the quality of implementation and we encourage people to involve good NGOs. But the central government cannot interfere: it is the local authority that chooses the NGOs at local level.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is that if local authorities don't want change, they will surely not choose the NGOs that can make a difference.
&lt;br /&gt;

=== Do you think cultures should dialogue more for better understanding or dialogue less to preserve their cultural identities?  ===   
[[File:The value of diversity and the value of interactions and exchanges-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|left|The value of diversity and the value of interactions and exchanges]]
[[File:The concept of a static identity is a huge mistake-- TVP.webmsd.webm|thumb|The concept of a static identity is a huge mistake]]
The concept of an identity that is static is a huge mistake. Any effort to preserve identity is backward looking, static and frozen. The global environment is increasing the possibilities for countries and cultures to interact and i would strongly in favor of anything which increases that interaction. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

But I'm not a supporter of the idea of all cultures merging into a some pre-digested - homogenized  mush. I would like to see an interaction of cultures where cultures absorb things from outside, contribute things to the outside but yet remain distinctly different. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== The ambiguity of the concept of &quot;global citizenship&quot; ===

There is a concept that each citizen much conduct himself in a manner in which his country is seen as a country to be a good global citizen. But in my view if you don't have global taxation you don't have global citizenship. So the argument that there is global citizenship is an exaggerated claim. You can only be citizen of one government, so if you ever had global citizenship then everybody would be a citizen... the question is whether he would be a good citizen or a bad citizen. Ultimately individuals are citizens of the country they belong to. There may be global values, universal values but each citizen must operate in the confinement of the country he or she is a citizen of.

[[file:Montek_Singh_Ahluwalia_World_Citizenship.ogv|thumb|thumbtime:05| What is &quot;global citizenship ?&quot;]]

If you are moving towards a world which is more peaceful and more prosperous somehow, somewhere, on the whole yu may make a difference to everyone in a positive way. But linking what you do to the poorest in the world is romantic idea but it does not translate itself into anything practical. In my present position i can definitely make a difference to the poorest in India... i may not succeed but can argue for policies in India which can do that. Rather than distract myself with some global objective let us concentrate to do something in India.
&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;There is certainly a concept that we are a global community. There is a concept that each citizen much conduct himself in a manner in which his country is seen as a country to be a good global citizen.&amp;nbsp;There may be global values, universal values, but in my view if you don't have global taxation you don't have global citizenship.&quot;

== Interviewed by Gauri Grazia De Santis on September 2010 ==

=== What do you think development actors and stakeholders can do in order to contribute to and support the activities aimed at achieving the MDGs, specifically the educators and media? ===
[[File:Vrinda-skype-1.ogv||thumb|upright|&lt;small&gt;Each of us is a stakeholder in global development processes and activities and we all have a role to play&lt;/small&gt;]]
However, we can choose only in as much as we are informed.  In order to understand, we look at those we trust more, particularly educators, media professionals and local authorities. These are the interlocutors between national governments, international agencies, local organisations working for development as well as international governments. 
&lt;br&gt;
Media, especially mass media, is one of the most powerful communication tools today and most affects the opinions and choices of people. People's opinions are majorly influenced by what they read, see or hear as facts, by what important journalists and media professionals believe in, support and promote, and by global political and social campaigns across the world. So, media professionals must take on the responsibility of sharing balanced views on events, giving comprehensive and true information to people, promoting peace and justice rather than war and exploitation. 
&lt;br&gt;
In most democracies, it is local authorities that are responsible for policy making and implementation and for ensuring that the participation of local development actors in these processes is proactive and informed. They are also responsible for ensuring that people's voices are brought across and integrated into policy decisions and regulations defined at the national levels.  Where development actors have shared resources, facts and communication tools, the local authorities have been empowered and have shaped people's choices towards more effective development partnerships. &lt;br&gt;

=== Is the EU doing enough to inform about the the scope of EU aid programmes? ===
[[File:Is the EU communicating well.ogv|left|thumb|upright|&lt;small&gt;EU is not adequately informing the public about the good work it is doing&lt;/small&gt;]]
European Union funds various programmes across the world, helping governments achieve their commitments to MDG’s. It is enabling local governments in Development Countries to lead and own the process of making lasting changes in people's lives. &lt;br /&gt;
However, the European Commission does little to inform its citizens about the positive impacts being made by initiatives that it is funding around the world.&lt;br /&gt;
Its citizens don't know about the objectives of its programs and the activities it is funding. And also where development work takes place, few people know that changes are being made possible through the contribution of European tax payer.&lt;br /&gt;
I have observed that where the European Commission is closer to the ground reality, in terms of its own presence, its support to non-government organizations and local governments, the nature of its contribution and the impact of its funding are more visible.
But now the way European Commission communicates is mainly bureaucratic and basic. It does not give enough importance to communicating with the opinion makers and development actors and stakeholders whom people trust and listen to, for e.g. educators, media professionals and local authorities: the interlocutors between the external agencies and the local people. &lt;br&gt;

=== Do you think that common people can support and influence policies targeting the implementation of commitments taken in favour of building the global partnership for development? ===

[[File:Vrinda-skype-3.ogv||thumb|upright|&lt;small&gt;It is the people feed back on policy proposals that will determine the future decisions&lt;/small&gt;]]

I think people can support and influence policies and lead their implementation at all levels of governance. It is only when policies are based on people's choices that people feel ownership of policies and hold governments accountable for implementing the same. 
If, on the one hand, it is vital that people feel a responsibility for participating in policy making processes, it is equally vital that they are empowered by policy makers to be partners in policy making and implementation. 
If people are not on board while making policies and designing policies and people’s voices are not taken in account when policies are developed, these policies will remain on paper and will never be translated into action. 
So without the common man’s voice integrated into policies, no plans or programs will represent people's choices or achieve their objectives.

=== According to you the “world citizenship” is a modality of self-awareness that can be achieved by all? ===

[[File:Vrinda-skype-4.ogv|left|thumb|upright|&lt;small&gt;Our awareness makes us responsible for others&lt;/small&gt;]]
Yes, “world citizenship” is a modality of self-awareness that can potentially be achieved by each one of us. We only need to step outside ourselves and look around us. And we will notice that the consequences of what happens in the world has entered our homes. We can no longer be only local even if we pretend to. We share the  natural environment and we all bear the negative consequences of over exploitation and pollution, wherever they occur. And we share the same economic and governance environment and we all bear the consequence of unsustainable financial practices of nations and terrorist activities of any group. So, in order to face global challenges, we need to take responsibility for the governance of the relationship among peoples and nations &lt;br /&gt;
And this is especially the responsibility conscious and educated people like us - those who have traveled and worked across countries, who have the capacity to look beyond boundaries, to share our thoughts, emotions and positive experiences, share the spirit of tolerance, non-violence, brotherhood and peace.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== What are the current challenges in the implementation of the MDGs agenda by Non State Actors and Local Governments?===
[[File:Vrinda-skype-5.ogv|thumb|upright|&lt;small&gt;The challenge is to overcome inefficiency, indifference and ignorance&lt;/small&gt;]]
I think there are 3 major challenges in the implementation of the MDG’s.&lt;br /&gt;
The first challenge is at the level of &lt;u&gt;policy formulation&lt;/u&gt;: We need to ask, for instance, whether our governments have right policies in place to make sure that the MDG agenda is achieved?. &lt;br&gt; 
The second challenge is at the level of &lt;u&gt;implementing these policies&lt;/u&gt;: Do we have the right structures and the right resources?&lt;br /&gt;
The third challenge is the &lt;u&gt;culture and awareness levels of the local people&lt;/u&gt;. Are people aware about MDGs and what it means to achieve them and how will this benefit them. What are the traditional values and beliefs that go against the MDGs? For instance, if we want to achieve the MDG on universal primarily education for all children and the belief in many communities is that girls should not attend school because it has a negative impact on them, then we will not be able to achieve the MDG’s.

=== What are the factors establishing coherence for development? ===
[[File:Vrinda-skype-6.ogv|thumb|left|upright|&lt;small&gt;Coordination and commitment are the main coherence drivers&lt;/small&gt;]]

There are two major factors that establish coherence for development.  One is good coordination, between the world’s governments, international agencies and the international community as well as their coordination with local NGOs and civil society and community based organisations that implement development plans and policies. The second factor that is very important is the commitment that all of us have that the basic rights of people are ensured and that MDGs are achieved. If we do not have this coordination and commitment, most policies we design – whether affecting economy , social services, financial system of a country- will negatively impact the MDG goals. This is because all MDG goals are inter-related. So, if an MDG for instance the universal primary education aims at so we must ensure that all policies, whether economic, financial or social are coordinated in order to make this happen.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

=== What do you think is the relationship between possessing a strong cultural identity and the capacity to understand and share the values of others? ===
[[File:Vrinda-skype-7.ogv||thumb|upright|&lt;small&gt;Not arrogance, nor isolation generate strong cultural identities; dialogue and tolerance do&lt;/small&gt;]]
I think it is important to have a strong cultural identity. However, it is also important that one does not confuse a strong cultural identity as meaning a strong geographical identity or a strong religious or community identity. Many of us have strong cultural identities that are formed or based on the interactions we have had with people in different communities, people of different religions, people living across the world; maybe even tourists who come to our countries. 
So, if our identity is based on this and I believe that our identity is not static. It is always in flux. So, we are continuously evolving our identities. So, if this is what we mean by strong cultural identities, I do not think it has any negative impact on our capacity to understand it has a positive will help us share the value of others. But the moment the identity gets confused with religion, language, community, village and narrow restrictive categories of what identity means,  the more difficult it will be for us to share the values of others, the less open we will be and the less capacity we will have to understand and dialogue about it.

We must feel it our moral responsibility to help our fellow citizens.  The idea of a country or a nation state is history. Today, our economies are intertwined and so are people intertwined both electronically and ecologically. 

Once, crossing the oceans was like crossing a whole world. Today people move back and forth easily. Today, boundaries do not matter. So, we cannot remain oblivious to suffering anywhere in the world. And this is what global citizenship is all about.

::'''Abstract'''

::We report progress in defining a program for expanding human civilization to more difficult environments, on Earth and eventually into space.  This expansion is enabled by improved technology, including self-expanding distributed production, cyclic material flows, and automation.  The improved technology benefits the bulk of civilization both by direct increase in productivity and reduced resource needs, and by increased access to resources from new locations.  The ability to manage difficult environments and mitigate space-based hazards reduces civilization-level risks, and meets other desirable goals.  The proposed program appears to have enough potential improvement over existing programs to justify continued work.


'''1. Introduction'''

Previous space programs have been criticized as being too “mission oriented” and not sufficiently tied to earthly needs to be obviously desirable on their merits.  The present program attempts to remedy this issue by starting with human goals and allowing the technical results to proceed from them, rather than dictating a space mission as an initial assumption. We treat the Earth as another planet in space, which even in temperate environments we have not yet learned how to inhabit fully, and in the more difficult and extreme environments cannot inhabit at all without outside support.  In this context, space becomes a somewhat more extreme environment than those found on Earth.  Technologies for living sustainably from local resources would apply everywhere, from the most agreeable locations on Earth to the most extreme ones in space.  Developing them then both improves life for the great majority of people, and enables expansion to the more difficult and extreme locations, tying earthly needs to developing space in a natural way.

The program concept grew as part of the online textbook '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods Space Transport and Engineering Methods]''' (STEM). It started as a set of tutorial examples for students studying Space Systems Engineering.  The author gradually realized that the collection of examples, taken together, seem to be a better approach to future space programs, and also apply back to Earth.  For example, learning how to extract useful materials from random asteroid or Lunar rock works just as well for extracting useful materials from random Earth rock.  Since more people live on Earth, the first application for such a technology would be here, and then later in space. We have adopted this approach generally - develop the technologies for where people live now, then extend them to more difficult locations, including to space.
In this paper we summarize the work so far by leaving out most of the technical details worked out as examples in the textbook.  We will also look at what further work can be done to improve it.

The textbook and the details of the program contained in Parts 4 and 5 are both works in progress.  They follow a software-like model of incremental improvement rather than a paper-based textbook and journal model of publication as a finished product.  As open-source works, any competent contributor is invited participate in further work, and the results are available for anyone to use.  The present author (Eder) has done most of the work to date.  


'''2. Program Approach and Status'''

Early concept studies for a proposed program such as this must make assumptions about who is the eventual “customer” – the entity who has needs and desires to be met, and who is the designer who will perform the work.  For our study we assume the customer will be civilization as a whole, rather than a particular nation or corporation.  The designer is assumed to be a non-profit foundation, with later transition to other organizations to implement.  To go beyond concept studies, the designer must demonstrate to the customer that the proposed new program has enough merit to implement it over current programs and plans.  That is one of the goals of such a study.

As a technical approach we are using Systems Engineering methods.  Systems Engineering has evolved as a way to develop complex projects over their complete life cycle.  A complex program, such as expanding human civilization, will have multiple desired features.  These include cost, performance, risk, schedule, and a number of others.  We want to balance these often conflicting desires and produce a &quot;best&quot; solution from the customer's perspective.  To do this we define a number of measurable criteria based on what is important to the customer, and then combine them to a single scoring function. Best is then whatever design alternatives produce the highest score.

By their nature, complex programs are too complex for any one individual to design.  The System Engineering approach also includes breaking down such a complex program into a hierarchy of elements to the point that the smallest parts can be comprehended and worked on by individuals or small teams.  At the top level, the program goals define what the overall design objectives are.  These are turned into detailed explicit statements, then divided and passed down the hierarchy as &quot;Requirements&quot; to the lower tiers.  The lowest level elements will then be designed according to their assigned subset of requirements.  The intent is when these individual elements are combined into the complete program it will then accomplish the desired top level goals.  Managing complexity by dividing it into many smaller parts, and then assembling the parts into larger and larger functional elements is not simple or easy, but at present no better way is known.

The Systems Engineering process in practice is one of continual refinement, with later work affecting earlier assumptions, and finer detail being developed over time.  However it can be described as a set of discrete steps for presentation purposes, which are applied repetitively at various levels of the program:

* &lt;u&gt;Requirements Analysis&lt;/u&gt; - The higher level goals are converted into measurable statements of performance, cost, and other desired features.  Customer preferences are also modeled with measurable criteria and a scoring function.  The requirements and criteria are then used to evaluate designs as they are developed.
* &lt;u&gt;Functional Analysis&lt;/u&gt; - Divides the program into lower level elements, leading eventually to individual functions that can be designed for.  It concentrates on what needs to be done rather than how to do it, so as not to exclude possible solutions.
* &lt;u&gt;Requirements Allocation&lt;/u&gt; - Distributes subsets of the requirements to lower level program elements.  Single upper level requirements often must be divided into more specific components to accomplish this.
* &lt;u&gt;System Modeling and Concepts&lt;/u&gt; - Builds mathematical models of the system elements based on alternate identified design concepts to meet the requirements.
* &lt;u&gt;Optimization and Trades&lt;/u&gt; - Varies model parameters for a design alternate to find the optimum values, then trade off optimized alternatives against each other to select the best result.
* &lt;u&gt;Synthesis and Documentation&lt;/u&gt; - Combines results from lower level design work into a coherent higher level whole, and documents the results as a baseline for further work.

At present, the overall program goals, program level criteria and scoring function, and the program level requirements have been defined.  The structure of program elements has been established, and functional analysis to populate the lower levels of of the structure has been started.  A concept for the overall program has been formulated, and a number of individual design concepts have been identified for lower level elements.  The potential advantages of the new program are evident, but much work remains to be done to complete a conceptual design and demonstrate the potential can be realized in practice.  The remainder of this paper summarizes the current state of the design.  For full technical details see parts 4 and 5 of STEM.


'''3. Program Goals'''

A well defined program should have a set of goals to work towards, against which current and new projects can be compared, and progress measured.  We identified a set of such goals that are assumed to be desirable for civilization.  They are human goals, rather than space mission goals as such. The expectation is a space component will be part of the final program concept, but it is not specified as an input.  Our initial goals include:

* &lt;u&gt;Improve Life on Earth&lt;/u&gt; - by developing better technology for living sustainably from local resources.
* &lt;u&gt;Understand the Earth Better&lt;/u&gt; - by observing our home planet, its environment in space, and other planets and environments.
* &lt;u&gt;Reduce Hazards from Space&lt;/u&gt; - by identifying what they are, followed by developing methods to deal with them.
* &lt;u&gt;Increase Biosphere Security&lt;/u&gt; - by adapting to more difficult environments, including future changes in the Earth itself.
* &lt;u&gt;Expand Accessible Resources&lt;/u&gt; - by improved access to currently difficult Earth and space locations.
* &lt;u&gt;Long Term Survival&lt;/u&gt; - by dispersal to multiple locations and acquisition of critical new resources.
* &lt;u&gt;Increased Choice and Freedom&lt;/u&gt; - by opening unoccupied locations to habitation.
* &lt;u&gt;Increased Opportunity&lt;/u&gt; - by access to unclaimed resources and more efficient technology.

Additional benefits from reaching these goals include:

* &lt;u&gt;Low Cost Access to Space&lt;/u&gt; - by removing barriers that keep current costs high.
* &lt;u&gt;Spin Off Technology&lt;/u&gt; - since technology developed for one purpose inevitably finds uses in other areas.
* &lt;u&gt;Optimism for the Future&lt;/u&gt; - by demonstrating we are not limited to a finite, closed, and degrading world.


'''4. Overall Program Concept'''

We expand the range of human civilization to a series of more difficult environments, building production capacity, habitation, and transport for each location.  Once established, we then start building the next location.  The first locations are temperate Earth ones, where improved technologies are demonstrated in areas like remote operations, automation, resource extraction, and recycling.  Temperate locations are where most people live today, so the technologies have the widest immediate application there.  It is also easier to start developing them without contending with difficult environments, and with local access to people and supplies.

As the technology improves, successive locations are built in more difficult Earth locations such as the oceans, deserts, ice caps, or deep underground, and then eventually moving out into progressively more distant space locations.  Production capacity from previous locations is used to help build starter hardware for later ones.  The locations provide places to live and work for increasing numbers of people, and interact with the rest of human civilization as any community does.  The intent is to use the improved technologies to provide a better quality of life for the residents, and a surplus to send to the rest of the world.  Newly started locations, like any construction site, will take a while to reach that level.  Expanding to new locations provides new places for people to live, which increases choice and allows freedom to try new social and business arrangements. It also increases access to new unclaimed resources.  This increases opportunities and the resource base on which human civilization depends.

A particular idea we consider important is the “Seed Factory”.  This is a starter set of equipment for a new location, which can make parts for more equipment for itself, as well as finished products for other uses.  As the seed expands to a full production capacity, it makes an increasing range of products and needs a smaller percentage outside parts and supplies.  This is a more powerful idea than a replicating system which copies itself:

*  A seed factory does not have to be able to make full copies of itself. It can retain a percentage of outside supplies.  This makes it smaller and simpler to design, and less expensive to start with.
*  A seed factory can not only grow by building copies of existing equipment, but by building larger versions of the equipment, and by building new types of equipment that widen the range of possible outputs.

The design of a seed factory should make optimal use of human labor and technologies like automation, robotics, and remote control.  In temperate locations this is for cost and efficiency reasons. In difficult environments it enables early construction when the location is not yet set up for human residents.  Besides the seed idea, we also consider as important technologies the local extraction of resources, recycling, and high efficiency transport. These reduce long term dependency on, and costs of, a location from outside support.

:'''4.1 Reference Architecture for Self-Expanding Systems'''

*  Consider customer, business/organizational, and technical contexts in presenting the architecture.
*  The reference abstracts multiple instances of applications, and shows their relationship.
*  Contains mission, vision, and strategy details, customer needs, and opportunities to use technology.
*  Provides guidance for multiple users and organizations for how to develop instances.
*  Flow from technology R&amp;D into new elements &amp; output products, using distribution network for designs &amp; hardware.


'''5. Program Structure'''

Technology development, both in civilization as a whole, and particular technologies within the program, is expected to be a continuing process rather than a one-time event.  Therefore the first level of structure below the whole program is a series of program phases implemented when sufficient levels of technology are reached.  Each phase includes upgrades and expansions to existing locations, and establishing new locations enabled by the improved technology.  We cannot predict in detail what new technologies will be developed, or how well they will work.  Thus the later phases are more in terms of goals and direction to follow than specific design details.  Prior to the first permanent locations, we have a Technology Development Phase (Phase 0), and currently identify three Construction Phases (I, II, and III), marked by improved technology and performance.  At present the phases target program criteria total scores of 30, 40, and 50 points, although this may change as the work progresses.

The next level of structure is the set of locations to be built or upgraded within each program phase.  The specific locations will not be identified until much farther into detailed design.  At present we have identified five general ranges of locations, and are working towards defining them in more detail:

* &lt;u&gt;Temperate Earth&lt;/u&gt; - Defined by environment parameters within which 90% of people currently live, with 5% at each extreme outside these limits.
* &lt;u&gt;Difficult Earth&lt;/u&gt; - Where one or more environment parameters are 10% or more beyond their temperate ranges.
* &lt;u&gt;Extreme Earth&lt;/u&gt; - Where one or more environment parameters are from 20% beyond their temperate ranges, up to the limits of practicality.
* &lt;u&gt;Near Earth Space&lt;/u&gt; - These are locations less than 10% beyond escape energy of the Earth-Moon system relative to the Earth's surface.
* &lt;u&gt;Distant Space&lt;/u&gt; - These are locations beyond Near Earth Space in energy terms.

The level below locations, which is Level 4 in the structure counting the program as Level 1, is the set of functions that occur at each location, and the systems that implement those functions.  The primary functions of production, habitation, and transport are expected to recur in multiple locations.  The system design to implement these functions is likely to be the same or similar across multiple locations, so it makes sense to approach their design from the general standpoint at first, and then adapt to specific locations as variations to the basic designs.  More detailed analysis from the functional standpoint is just starting.  There are a large number of candidate systems and designs identified to satisfy the functions and higher level program goals.  We will note them in this paper, but we have not established if they are needed in the program at all yet, nor when or with what specific features.

The program is intended to benefit civilization as a whole, but we cannot ask every person what their design preferences are.  It is both impractical to ask 7 billion people what they want, and most of them don't know enough about the subject to make an informed decision.  Therefore we act as a proxy for them and make our best estimate of what they would tell us if we could overcome the impracticalities.  The preferences are embodied in a set of evaluation criteria, which are derived from the program goals and other sources.  Each criterion is scored on a relative scale, nominally 0 to 100%.  The criteria are weighted against each other in importance by assigning points out of a nominal total of 100.  The score for each criterion times its weight is then summed across all the criteria to produce a total score.  Selecting the best design is then a matter of choosing the one with the highest score.  The scale used in this scoring system is arbitrary.  What is important are the relative values among different features of a program.  The formulas implicitly define exchange ratios, such as how much extra cost are you willing to accept for better performance, or how much quality of life is worth relative to risk.  This scoring system also simplifies evaluating a design with features that have different units of measurement by converting them all to a common numerical scale.  A summary of the program level criteria are listed in Table 1, and a more detailed table and how they were arrived at can be found in '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Combined_Systems4 STEM Section 5.1]'''

The program goals (noted in section 3 above) are too general to design to, so they are converted to more specific and measurable statements. These are called &quot;Requirements&quot;, from the fact that the design is required to meet each statement.  The initial values for the requirements were set from our best understanding at the start of the study.  As the conceptual design progresses, and what is feasible and optimal emerges, they will be updated to a more specific and final set of requirements.  These will then be allocated to lower level program elements for design and implementation.  The initial set of requirements are listed here, and how they were arrived at can be found on page 3 of STEM Section 5.1.


::'''1. Objectives'''

* 1.1 &lt;u&gt;Program Goal&lt;/u&gt; - The program shall expand human civilization to a series of new locations with increasingly difficult environments and distance.
* 1.2 &lt;u&gt;Program Scale&lt;/u&gt; - Expansion shall be demonstrated by permanently supporting at least 95,000 humans total among new Earth locations and at least 2,000 humans per new space location.
* 1.3 &lt;u&gt;Choice&lt;/u&gt; - Specific locations and their internal organization, function, and operation shall be chosen by program participants and location residents within the limits of design constraints.


::'''2. Performance'''

* 2.1 &lt;u&gt;Number of Locations&lt;/u&gt; - The design shall maximize the number of new locations, where new is defined by at least a 10% increase in an environment parameter or distance measured in time or energy terms.
* 2.2 &lt;u&gt;Growth&lt;/u&gt; - Each location shall increase the capacity for production, habitation, and transport in a progressive manner.
* 2.3 &lt;u&gt;Improved Technology&lt;/u&gt; - Locations shall increase the levels of self-production, cyclic flows, and autonomy in a progressive manner.
* 2.4 &lt;u&gt;Improved Quality of Life&lt;/u&gt; - Completed locations shall provide an improved physical and social quality of life relative to the upper 10% of Earth civilization.
* 2.5 &lt;u&gt;Data&lt;/u&gt; - The program shall collect and disseminate [TBD] data about the Earth's environment, surrounding space, and objects therein.
* 2.6 &lt;u&gt;Resources&lt;/u&gt; - The program shall output a life cycle surplus of at least 100% of internal material and energy resource needs.


::'''3. Schedule'''

* 3.1 &lt;u&gt;Completion Time&lt;/u&gt; - The expansion to a new location shall be completed before expected progress in technology indicates a re-design is required.


::'''4. Cost'''

* 4.1 &lt;u&gt;Total Development Cost&lt;/u&gt; - The total program development cost for new technology and hardware designs shall be less than 50 times the unit cost on Earth, and 5 times the unit cost in space of the hardware.
* 4.2 &lt;u&gt;New Location Cost&lt;/u&gt; - The peak net project cost for a new location shall be less than 50% of the expected long term net output.
* 4.3 &lt;u&gt;Earth Launch Cost&lt;/u&gt; - The program shall progressively lower the Earth launch cost component of total system cost, with a goal of $0.08/kg of total system mass.


::'''5. Technical Risk'''

* 5.1 &lt;u&gt;Risk Allowances&lt;/u&gt; - Program designs shall include allowances for uncertainties and unknowns in knowledge, performance, failure rates, and other technical parameters.  New designs with higher risk can be included in program plans, but a process shall be included to resolve the risk, and an alternate design with lower risk maintained until resolved.


::'''6. Safety'''

* 6.1 &lt;u&gt;New Location Risk&lt;/u&gt; - New locations shall progressively lower internal risks to life and property, with a goal of significantly lower risk than the general population.

::'''7. Sustainability'''

* 7.1 &lt;u&gt;Biosphere Security&lt;/u&gt; - The program shall increase biosphere security by establishing alternate biospheres and long term storage of biological materials.
* 7.2 &lt;u&gt;Survivability&lt;/u&gt; - The program shall design for the long term survival of life and humanity from changes to the Earth which will render it uninhabitable and depletion of critical resources.


::'''8. Openness'''

* 8.1 &lt;u&gt;Open Design&lt;/u&gt; - Technology and design methods developed within the program shall be open for others to use. Specific instances of a design and produced items may be proprietary.
* 8.2 &lt;u&gt;Access&lt;/u&gt; - Development of a new location shall not prevent reasonable access for transit or to unused resources.


'''7.  General Design Features'''

We identified three important functions that seem to be required for civilization as a whole.  These are (1) production of material goods and energy, (2) human habitation for protection, comfort, and enjoyment, and (3) transport to move people and goods from one place to another.  Varying subsets of these functions occur at most developed locations, new or existing. Since the functions will recur in multiple locations, we look at their general design first, then specific instances for particular locations.  Production of food at a minimum is required for survival. Production of other goods and energy is required to build not only habitation and transport elements, but more production capacity.  Therefore we see improved production technology as the first area to concentrate on, but improvements in the other areas are also desired.

We have not yet determined what specific technologies are needed for improved production, but we have identified a number of candidates.  In addition to well-developed technologies like automation and robotics, these include:

* &lt;u&gt;Self-Expansion&lt;/u&gt; - Using a minimal starter set which not only produces useful output, but grows by helping make more equipment for itself.
* &lt;u&gt;Modular Design&lt;/u&gt; - Using standardized sizes and interfaces so that production elements can be added or rearranged without custom design.
* &lt;u&gt;Generalized Resources&lt;/u&gt; - Using materials and energy found everywhere as sources, rather than requiring high grade sources only found in certain places.
* &lt;u&gt;Distributed Operations&lt;/u&gt; - Decoupling humans and production tasks from needing to be in the same place at the same time(i.e. a traditional factory).
* &lt;u&gt;Cyclic Flows&lt;/u&gt; - Including reuse/repair/reprocessing of materials into the original system design rather than an afterthought.

Work on general habitation and transport technologies has not started yet.


'''8.  Specific Candidate Designs'''

The author is a Systems Engineer with long experience on space projects, and the examples developed in the STEM textbook were initially all related to space.  Now that a program concept has emerged with a large Earth component, more work is needed to fill in that part, add missing space elements, and draw all the parts into a coherent program.  The following list of designs should be considered candidates for the space parts of the total program.  They have not reached final selection, nor have been optimized.

::'''8.1  Earth to Orbit Transport'''

* &lt;u&gt;Startup Launcher&lt;/u&gt; - The task here is to deliver the first parts for an orbital assembly and production platform.  A small, three stage, fully reusable rocket and some other alternatives will be considered, or to buy transportation on other existing launch vehicles.  The intent is to upgrade or replace this method by more advanced launchers once the cargo traffic justifies it.

* &lt;u&gt;Bulk Cargo Transport&lt;/u&gt; - On Earth we use different methods to deliver bulk goods and humans/delicate/priority cargo.  When sufficient traffic justifies specialized launch methods, we consider a Hypervelocity Launcher as a substitute for the first stage of a conventional rocket. A rocket stage is still needed to complete reaching orbit.

* &lt;u&gt;Low G Transport&lt;/u&gt; - The complementary system for delivering humans and delicate cargo has a number of options.  Existing and planned launchers outside the program are definitely candidates, as are combined air-breathing/rocket systems, or a low-g gas accelerator.

::'''8.2 Near Earth Production'''

* &lt;u&gt;Orbital Platform(s)&lt;/u&gt; - These are one or more platforms that start by simple assembly of themselves from pre-made parts launched from Earth.  They progress to assembling and fueling larger payloads, eventually adding production functions.  The first platform would be in Low Earth Orbit, with later locations to be determined.  They would start out mostly remote controlled from Earth, and add permanent crews once sufficient supplies and crew modules are in place.

* &lt;u&gt;Orbital Mining&lt;/u&gt; - Replacing supplies from Earth with supplies extracted locally has an estimated 50:1 leverage on being able to do things in space sustainably.  We consider three early mining candidates: air from the upper atmosphere via a compression scoop, human-made debris in Earth orbit, and natural Near Earth Asteroids.

Eventually we intend to study other production tasks like materials processing, parts fabrication, and growing food.

::'''8.3 Near Earth Transport'''

* &lt;u&gt;Electric Propulsion&lt;/u&gt; - This is another high leverage technology with about 10 times the fuel efficiency of conventional rockets.  Options include electrostatic ion, microwave plasma, and electrodynamic.  Large scale use of electric propulsion is necessary to enable orbital mining and other space activities effectively.  Although the efficiency gain is large, the thrust levels are relatively low.

* &lt;u&gt;Chemical Propulsion&lt;/u&gt; - The high thrust provided by chemical propulsion is still needed for some near Earth tasks.  These include landing on the Moon, and crew transport through the Earth's radiation belt.  Once in a shielded habitat or transfer vehicle the higher efficiency electric propulsion is preferred.

* &lt;u&gt;Skyhook&lt;/u&gt; - This is a practical form of space elevator which can be built with existing materials by only spanning about 20% of the Earth's gravity well.  It rotates, which provides artificial gravity for the crew, and a velocity difference above and below its orbit. Compared to a non-rotating elevator it is much shorter, and so less exposed to meteoroid damage.  Rather than needing to climb a very long cable, you need only ride for half a rotation and then let go to reach higher orbits. The Skyhook is built incrementally when traffic can support it. It helps build itself by lowering the required velocity of an Earth-to-Orbit vehicle, thus increasing payload.  The increased payload can be used to carry more Skyhook hardware.  Propulsion is still needed on a Skyhook to deliver net cargo upwards, but the effect is to replace part of the chemical rocket velocity by higher efficiency electric propulsion.

::'''8.4 Distant Space'''

Expansion beyond Near Earth locations is expected to be in later phases of the program, so is not well defined yet.  We can describe some general concepts, which may change as more work is done.  The Skyhook can only partially span the Earth's gravity well, but can span a larger part or all of the Moon's and Mars' gravity wells.  One in a high Earth orbit can be used to inject into interplanetary transfer orbits.  In gravity wells this allows you to replace chemical propulsion with more efficient electric propulsion.  For transfer orbits it allows faster trip times and less exposure for crews.  Carbonaceous asteroids can supply the materials for carbon fiber to build the Skyhooks.  A network of Skyhooks provides easy access to all inner Solar system destinations.

Asteroid material at first provides simple radiation shielding for crew habitats.  As processing and production is developed, an increasing range of fuel, oxygen, metals, and more complex products are made via advanced production methods.  At first, all the starter equipment is brought from Earth or previous locations.  The need for this goes down until only rare materials or hard to make items need to be delivered.  The location makes surplus items beyond its own needs, which pays for the things it cannot make itself.  Thus it becomes self-supporting and a part of the general civilization.  Development of the Moon, Mars, and the larger asteroids in the Main Belt follows the same progression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Classifying Solutions=
A solution is when two or more things mix together homogeneously. These things are called the solvent and the solute. Solutes can be solid, liquid or gas. One of the most popular solvent is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;&gt;Jenkins, F., van Kessel, H., Tompkins, D., Lantz, O., (1996). Nelson Chemistry, British Columbia, Nelson Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Solutions of Electrolytes and Non-Electrolytes==
An electrolyte is an aqueous solution that conducts electricity. Pure water isn't an electrolyte, but if you dissolve something in water, it can conduct electricity. [[Chemistry Friends/Acids and Bases|Acids and bases]] are electrolytes. Molecular compounds usually aren't.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Acidic, Basic, and Neutral Solutions==
Solutions can be acidic, basic, or neutral. The stronger the acid, the more elecricly conductive it is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

=Understanding Solutions=
When something is dissolved into a solution, the compound dissociates. This means each molecule and ion goes off in its own with water. If you put NaCl in water, in would dissociate and become Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. The sodium chloride wouldn't be separated, the ions would just get farther apart. 
Dissociation makes solutions electrolytes. The Na is positive and the Cl is negative, so if they are dissociated in water, the charges help electricity flow through the solution. This works with acids and bases too. If an acid or base dissolves, it dissociates. Then one of the ions is negative and one is positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Substances in Water==
Some things dissolve in water better than others. Ions' solubility is very predictable. There are tables to show how soluble different ions are. Molecules are trickier. There is no simple was to predict how soluble different molecules are. You just have to remember.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

=Reactions in Solutions=
Chemicals are put into solutions to make it easier to transport, load and store them. It also helps with reactions. If something is in a solution, it can have a faster, more complete reaction and can change the results.
Reactions are faster and more complete for this reason: a dissolved chemical has more surface area than if it were on its own. &lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Net Ionic Equations==
Let's say you have sodium oxide and chlorine and you mix it into a solution of sugar water. The equation might look like this.
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;+C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;+ Cl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;= NaCl + C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
Now we put the theory of dissociation into effect.
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;+O&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;+ C&lt;sub&gt;6(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; +H&lt;sub&gt;12(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; +O&lt;sub&gt;6(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; +Cl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; =NaCl + C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
The thing is, this equation seems pretty cluttered and some of the ions don't even seem to change. Let's cancel them out!
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;s&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/s&gt;+ &lt;s&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; +H&lt;sub&gt;12(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; +O&lt;sub&gt;6(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/s&gt; +Cl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; =NaCl + &lt;s&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/s&gt; + &lt;s&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
This leaves us with the equation
:Na&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;+ Cl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;= NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
That makes more sense!&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Qualitative Chemical Analysis==
There are two kinds of measurements: qualitative and quantitative. 
Qualitative is looking at litmus paper to see if it is blue or red, noticing bubbles in a solution and seeing rust is forming. You can see results but there are no units or numbers you can put in.
That's what quantitative measurements are. A pH of three, twenty seven grams of HCl and two moles of oxygen are all quantitative. They are more exact than qualitative measurements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
===Qualitative Analysis by Colour===
Some substances can be identified by colour. The colour of the solution might change, there might be a coloured gas or a flame. Litmus paper changes colour based on if the solution it is placed in is acidic or basic. When burned, copper(II) has a green flame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
=Concentration of a Solution=
If a solution has very little solute in it, it is a dilute. If a substance has lots of solute in it, it is a concentrated solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Communicating Concentration Ratios==
Use this ratio to find the concentration of a solution.
:concentration=quantity of solute /quantity of solution
If there are 2 mL for every 100mL of solution, the ratio would be:
:2mL/100mL and the answer would be 2% v/v. 
The v/v thing means volume to volume. Some times you need to calculate w/v which is weight to volume. This would be like if there were 4 grams of sugar in a 100mL sugar water solution.
There are ways to express very small units. Parts per million is one. If there was three grams of salt in a million mL lake, the concentration of salt would be 3ppm. 
There is a ratio to find the molar concentration. It is the amount of the solute in moles when dissolved in a liter of water.
:Molar concentration= amount of solute (in moles)/ volume of solution (in liters)
Molar concentration is measured in (mol/L)
===Calculations Involving Concentration===
In chemistry, it is nice to know the quantity, volume and concentration of a solution. If you only know two of these things, you can use a formula to figure the thrid one out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
:mass/volume=concentration

==Preparation of Standard Solution from a Solid==
Standard solutions are solutions with a precise concentration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
===Preparation of Standard Solution by Dilution===
Dilution is a way of changing the concentration of a solution by adding more of the solvent or some other liquid. If your lemonade is too strong, you might try adding water. This would be diluting the lemonade. Dilution is a pretty easy was to alter the concentration of a solution. 
Diluted solutions are used a lot today. If a chemical reaction happens too fast, a chemist can dilute the chemical and slow down the reaction. If a doctor needs to prescribe a thousandth of a mL of medicine to you, he might instruct you to take a mL of the medicine, mix it with a L of water and take a mL of the solution. It is easier to measure in milliliters and liters than it is to measure in thousandths of a milliliter.
There are many tools to make exact measurements. Volumetric flasks like graduated cylinders and beakers and scales are very common tools. Another tool is called a volumetric. It is a long tube that looks like an eye dropper except the measurements on the side have 0 on the top and the biggest number on the bottom. To use, you fills the tube all the way to the zero and moves the volumetric over the container you want the measured solution in. Since the solution reaches the 0 mark, no solution has dropped into the container. Let's say you need three units of solution. Jiggle the nob on the top of the tube. This lets little bits of air into the tube so the solution drips out the bottom. Carry on until the solution line drops to the three. Put the volumetric away and you have 3 units of solution!&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
=====Calculating Dilution=====
It isn't too hard to calculate a concentration of a solution after it has been diluted. If the amount of solvent doubles, the concentration halves. There is a simple formula to figure it out.
:v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=v&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;
The v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume before you diluted the solution. v&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume after the solution was diluted. c is for the concentration. i for initial and f for final.
As long as you know three of the pieces of information, you can use the equation to find out the fourth one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

=Solubility=
Every solution has a limit to how much of a solute can be added. If more than the limit is added, the access won't dissolve. It'll just sit there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Solubility Rules and Examples==
When mixing substances, there are rules the solutions follow. They are nice to know so you can dissolve things better.
* If you heat water to a higher temperature, more solids solute can dissolve into it.
* If you want to get more gas to dissolve in the water, cool it down. Gas always dissolves better in cold water.
* Gases also dissolve better at high pressure.
* Some oils won't ever dissolve in water because they are immiscible. It's pretty much imposable so don't bother trying.
* The opposite to some thing that is immiscible is something that is miscible! This means there is no limit to how much of the substance you can dissolve. Well, the limit is how much of the substance you can get your hands on. 
* Most elements don't dissolve well in water, but halogens and oxygen do alright. Also, metals from group I and II can dissolve pretty well.
You can see evidence of solutions all around. If you let the water evaporate from the solution, any solid solutes left behind form crystals. Stalagmites and stalactites are good examples of left behind minerals. You might also notice that when you open a can if pop, some air escapes. What that is is carbon dioxide that use to be dissolved in the drink when it was cold, but undissolved as the pop warmed up. Fish survive because of the oxygen dissolved in the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
=Concentration of Ions=
==Moles of Ions and Ionic Compounds==
In chemistry, it can be very useful to know the molar concentration of ions. First, let's remember that a mole is a number, like a dozen. It isn't an amount, it is a number. A complicated number, but a number none the less. 
So if we have one mole of an ion like CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, There is one mole of CaCl&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, one mole of Ca, and &lt;u&gt;2&lt;/u&gt; moles of Cl. Just like if there were a dozen cats, there would be a dozen tails, two dozen eyes and four dozen paws. (Unless, of coarse, there were any mutant cats with three eyes or unfortunate cats who lost an eye.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

==Molar Concentration==
So anyway, another thing we need to know is the symbol for molar concentration. It is square brackets. So [NaCl] is the molar concentration of sodium chloride.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

==Calculating Molar Concentration==
When we calculate molar concentration, we [[Chemistry_Friends/Solutions#Understanding_Solutions|dissociate]] the ions and calculate them separately. So let's say we are looking for the molar concentration of CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a 0.123 mol/L solution.
First thing we do is dissociate the ions.
:CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2Cl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
Let's find the molar concentration of Ca first! We multiply the concentration by how many moles there are. In this case, there is one mole.
: [Ca&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;] = 0.123 mol/L × 1 = 0.123 mol/L
So, There are 0.123 mol/L of carbon in the solution. Now for the chlorine. Remember, there are 2 moles of chlorine.
: [Cl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;] = 0.123 mol/L × 2 = 0.246 mol/L
There are 0.246 mol/L of chlorine!&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;
==Molar Concentration of Hydrogen==
It is very important to know the molar concentration of hydrogen ions because hydrogen ions make [[Chemistry_Friends/Acids_and_Bases|acids]]. The higher the hydrogen concentration, the more acidic the solution. Pure water is neutral. It has a pH of 7. What this means is the hydrogen concentration of water is 1×10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; mol/L. Something more acidic, like vinegar, has a pH of about 2 and therefore a hydrogen concentration of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. Something basic with a pH of 11 would have a hydrogen concentration of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew-Large|&lt;u&gt;הכרזה על הקמת מדינת ישראל&lt;/u&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;


{{Hebrew-Text|
בארץ-ישראל קם העם היהודי, בה עוצבה דמותו הרוחנית, הדתית והמדינית, בה חי חיי קוממיות ממלכתית, בה יצר נכסי תרבות לאומיים וכלל-אנושיים והוריש לעולם כולו את ספר הספרים הנצחי.


לאחר שהוגלה העם מארצו בכוח הזרוע שמר לה אמונים בכל ארצות פזוריו, ולא חדל מתפילה ומתקוה לשוב לארצו ולחדש בתוכה את חירותו המדינית.


מתוך קשר היסטורי ומסורתי זה חתרו היהודים בכל דור לשוב ולהאחז במולדתם העתיקה; ובדורות האחרונים שבו לארצם בהמונים, וחלוצים, מעפילים ומגינים הפריחו נשמות, החיו שפתם העברית, בנו כפרים וערים, והקימו ישוב גדל והולך השליט על משקו ותרבותו, שוחר שלום ומגן על עצמו, מביא ברכת הקידמה לכל תושבי הארץ ונושא נפשו לעצמאות ממלכתית.


בשנת תרנ&quot;ז (1897) נתכנס הקונגרס הציוני לקול קריאתו של הוגה חזון המדינה היהודית תיאודור הרצל והכריז על זכות העם היהודי לתקומה לאומית בארצו.


זכות זו הוכרה בהצהרת בלפור מיום ב' בנובמבר 1917 ואושרה במנדט מטעם חבר הלאומים, אשר נתן במיוחד תוקף בין-לאומי לקשר ההיסטורי שבין העם היהודי לבין ארץ-ישראל ולזכות העם היהודי להקים מחדש את ביתו הלאומי.


השואה שנתחוללה על עם ישראל בזמן האחרון, בה הוכרעו לטבח מיליונים יהודים באירופה, הוכיחה מחדש בעליל את ההכרח בפתרון בעית העם היהודי מחוסר המולדת והעצמאות על-ידי חידוש המדינה היהודית בארץ-ישראל, אשר תפתח לרווחה את שערי המולדת לכל יהודי ותעניק לעם היהודי מעמד של אומה שוות-זכויות בתוך משפחת העמים.


שארית הפליטה שניצלה מהטבח הנאצי האיום באירופה ויהודי ארצות אחרות לא חדלו להעפיל לארץ-ישראל, על אף כל קושי, מניעה וסכנה, ולא פסקו לתבוע את זכותם לחיי כבוד, חירות ועמל-ישרים במולדת עמם.


במלחמת העולם השניה תרם הישוב העברי בארץ את מלוא-חלקו למאבק האומות השוחרות חירות ושלום נגד כוחות הרשע הנאצי, ובדם חייליו ובמאמצו המלחמתי קנה לו את הזכות להמנות עם העמים מייסדי ברית האומות המאוחדות.


ב-29 בנובמבר 1947 קיבלה עצרת האומות המאוחדות החלטה המחייבת הקמת מדינה יהודית בארץ-ישראל; העצרת תבעה מאת תושבי ארץ-ישראל לאחוז בעצמם בכל הצעדים הנדרשים מצדם הם לביצוע ההחלטה. הכרה זו של האומות המאוחדות בזכות העם היהודי להקים את מדינתו אינה ניתנת להפקעה.


זוהי זכותו הטבעית של העם היהודי להיות ככל עם ועם עומד ברשות עצמו במדינתו הריבונית.


לפיכך נתכנסנו, אנו חברי מועצת העם, נציגי הישוב העברי והתנועה הציונית, ביום סיום המנדט הבריטי על ארץ-ישראל, ובתוקף זכותנו הטבעית וההיסטורית ועל יסוד החלטת עצרת האומות המאוחדות אנו מכריזים בזאת על הקמת מדינה יהודית בארץ ישראל, היא מדינת ישראל.


אנו קובעים שהחל מרגע סיום המנדט, הלילה, אור ליום שבת ו' אייר תש&quot;ח, 15 במאי 1948, ועד להקמת  השלטונות הנבחרים והסדירים של המדינה בהתאם לחוקה שתיקבע על-ידי האספה המכוננת הנבחרת לא יאוחר מ-1 באוקטובר 1948 - תפעל מועצת העם כמועצת מדינה זמנית, ומוסד הביצוע שלה, מנהלת-העם, יהווה את הממשלה הזמנית של המדינה היהודית, אשר תיקרא בשם ישראל.


מדינת ישראל תהא פתוחה לעליה יהודית ולקיבוץ גלויות; תשקוד על פיתוח הארץ לטובת כל תושביה; תהא מושתתה על יסודות החירות, הצדק והשלום לאור חזונם של נביאי ישראל; תקיים שויון זכויות חברתי ומדיני גמור לכל אזרחיה בלי הבדל דת, גזע ומין;  תבטיח חופש דת, מצפון, לשון, חינוך ותרבות; תשמור על המקומות הקדושים של כל הדתות; ותהיה   נאמנה לעקרונותיה של מגילת האומות המאוחדות. מדינת ישראל תהא מוכנה לשתף פעולה עם המוסדות והנציגים של האומות המאוחדות בהגשמת החלטת העצרת מיום 29 בנובמבר 1947 ותפעל להקמת האחדות הכלכלית של ארץ-ישראל בשלמותה.


אנו קוראים לאומות המאוחדות לתת יד לעם היהודי בבנין מדינתו ולקבל את מדינת ישראל לתוך משפחת העמים.


אנו קוראים - גם בתוך התקפת-הדמים הנערכת עלינו זה חדשים - לבני העם הערבי תושבי מדינת ישראל לשמור על שלום וליטול חלקם בבנין המדינה על יסוד אזרחות מלאה ושווה ועל יסוד נציגות מתאימה בכל מוסדותיה, הזמניים והקבועים.


אנו מושיטים יד שלום ושכנות טובה לכל המדינות השכנות ועמיהן, וקוראים להם לשיתוף פעולה ועזרה הדדית עם העם העברי העצמאי בארצו. מדינת ישראל מוכנה לתרום חלקה במאמץ משותף לקידמת המזרח התיכון כולו.


אנו קוראים אל העם היהודי בכל התפוצות להתלכד סביב הישוב בעליה ובבנין ולעמוד לימינו במערכה הגדולה על הגשמת שאיפת הדורות לגאולת ישראל.


מתוך בטחון בצור ישראל הננו חותמים בחתימת ידינו לעדות על הכרזה זו, במושב מועצת המדינה הזמנית, על אדמת המולדת, בעיר תל-אביב, היום הזה, ערב שבת, ה' אייר תש&quot;ח, 14 במאי 1948.

==Translation==
ERETZ-ISRAEL [(Hebrew) - the Land of Israel, Palestine] was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.


After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.


Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses. Pioneers, ma'pilim [(Hebrew) - immigrants coming to Eretz-Israel in defiance of restrictive legislation] and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the Hebrew language, built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood.


In the year 5657 (1897), at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, Theodore Herzl, the First Zionist Congress convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country.


This right was recognized in the Balfour Declaration of the 2nd November, 1917, and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and Eretz-Israel and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home.


The catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people - the massacre of millions of Jews in Europe - was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Eretz-Israel the Jewish State, which would open the gates of the homeland wide to every Jew and confer upon the Jewish people the status of a fully privileged member of the comity of nations.


Survivors of the Nazi holocaust in Europe, as well as Jews from other parts of the world, continued to migrate to Eretz-Israel, undaunted by difficulties, restrictions and dangers, and never ceased to assert their right to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their national homeland.


In the Second World War, the Jewish community of this country contributed its full share to the struggle of the freedom- and peace-loving nations against the forces of Nazi wickedness and, by the blood of its soldiers and its war effort, gained the right to be reckoned among the peoples who founded the United Nations.


On the 29th November, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel; the General Assembly required the inhabitants of Eretz-Israel to take such steps as were necessary on their part for the implementation of that resolution. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of the Jewish people to establish their State is irrevocable.


This right is the natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate, like all other nations, in their own sovereign State.


ACCORDINGLY WE, MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S COUNCIL, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF ERETZ-ISRAEL AND OF THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT, ARE HERE ASSEMBLED ON THE DAY OF THE TERMINATION OF THE BRITISH MANDATE OVER ERETZ-ISRAEL AND, BY VIRTUE OF OUR NATURAL AND HISTORIC RIGHT AND ON THE STRENGTH OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, HEREBY DECLARE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH STATE IN ERETZ-ISRAEL, TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATE OF ISRAEL.


WE DECLARE that, with effect from the moment of the termination of the Mandate being tonight, the eve of Sabbath, the 6th Iyar, 5708 (15th May, 1948), until the establishment of the elected, regular authorities of the State in accordance with the Constitution which shall be adopted by the Elected Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October 1948, the People's Council shall act as a Provisional Council of State, and its executive organ, the People's Administration, shall be the Provisional Government of the Jewish State, to be called &quot;Israel&quot;.


THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.


THE STATE OF ISRAEL is prepared to cooperate with the agencies and representatives of the United Nations in implementing the resolution of the General Assembly of the 29th November, 1947, and will take steps to bring about the economic union of the whole of Eretz-Israel.


WE APPEAL to the United Nations to assist the Jewish people in the building-up of its State and to receive the State of Israel into the comity of nations.


WE APPEAL - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.


WE EXTEND our hand to all neighbouring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighbourliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East.


WE APPEAL to the Jewish people throughout the Diaspora to rally round the Jews of Eretz-Israel in the tasks of immigration and upbuilding and to stand by them in the great struggle for the realization of the age-old dream - the redemption of Israel.


PLACING OUR TRUST IN THE &quot;ROCK OF ISRAEL&quot;, WE AFFIX OUR SIGNATURES TO THIS PROCLAMATION AT THIS SESSION OF THE PROVISIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE, ON THE SOIL OF THE HOMELAND, IN THE CITY OF TEL-AVIV, ON THIS SABBATH EVE, THE 5TH DAY OF IYAR, 5708 (14TH MAY,1948).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook is designed to teach standard English Grammar as taught in English-speaking countries. Although the English page has a separate section for grammar, it seems harder to follow if you are using it for self study or classroom use. If you plan on taking a course for grammar, this resource may help. The layout and structure is based upon the 1963 edition of Warriner's English Grammar and Composition, but does not use any resources or text derived from that resource. All text in this Wikibook is self-made or taken from another public domain resource. As this Wikibook is new, it is very easy to add any additional information about particular parts of a part of speech (i.e. helping verbs, subordinate clauses, etc...). Any additions to this Wikibook are greatly appreciated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''lemon battery''' is a simple type of electrical battery that is commonly made for school science projects. Typically, a  piece of zinc metal and a piece of copper metal are inserted into a lemon. Everyday objects such as galvanized nails and copper pennies can be used. A single lemon is usually just studied using an electrical meter. Several lemons can be wired together to form a more powerful battery that will light up a light-emitting diode, or power a buzzer or a digital clock.

The lemon battery is similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta in Italy. Volta used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice. The lemon battery is described in some textbooks in order to illustrate the type of chemical reaction (oxidation-reduction) that occurs in batteries. The zinc and copper are called the electrodes, and the juice inside the lemon is called the electrolyte. There are many variations of the lemon battery that use different fruits (or liquids) as electrolytes and metals other than zinc and copper as electrodes.  

This article contains instructions for making a lemon battery. If you want to know more about the science involved, there is an article in Wikipedia that you can read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lemon battery |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_battery |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and equipment==
Here's the list of pieces you need to assemble before you can start your experiment. Many pupils will need the help, and money, of an adult to obtain them.
*'''Device'''. An LED is a common choice of a device that will be powered by the battery. LED stands for &quot;light emitting diode&quot;. A red one is best. This item is the most complicated. Some more ideas are given below in the section &quot;Alternatives&quot;.
*'''Lemons'''. You'll need 3 or 4. Any citrus fruit, like limes, grapefruits, or oranges, or even a potato will work. 
*'''Zinc electrodes'''. You'll need 3 or 4. Most likely you'll use a piece of metal that's been coated with zinc. This is what the word &quot;galvanized&quot; means. A galvanized metal washer that's about one inch (2 - 3 cm) in diameter will work well. Galvanized roofing nails, galvanized screws and bolts, and even paper clips can also work. If you can find some zinc sheet, and some shears or tough scissors to cut it, that will work very well. Be careful if you do this; the edges of sheared metal sheets are ''sharp''. If you can, file the edges to make them less sharp.
*'''Copper electrodes'''. You'll need 3 or 4. Copper or copper-coated pennies work well. You may find some good copper fittings in the plumbing section of a hardware store. Again, if you can find some copper sheet, and some shears or scissors to cut it, that will work. Again, be careful about sharp edges.
*'''Leads'''. You'll need 5 or 6. The easiest thing is to get hold of a packet of insulated lead wires with &quot;alligator clips&quot; on each end.
*'''Multimeter''' (optional). If you know how to use an electrical multimeter, it can be helpful in getting your battery to work.

There are some little photos of these components below. If you click on the photo, you can see it larger.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Diodos LED foto.png|'''LEDs''' (light emitting diodes) of different colors. Red is best for lemon batteries. The colored plastic that surrounds each diode isn't important, and some LEDs use clear plastic. There's a centimeter ruler at the right that tells you the plastic cases is are about 0.8 cm long.
File:Lemons on a plate.JPG|'''Lemons'''. Grapefruits, limes, or potatoes also work.
File:Delta (Dacromet).jpg|'''Zinc''' electrodes (a collection of galvanized hardware). The flat, circular washers with holes in their center would be a good choice for a lemon cell.
File:Pennies.jpg|'''Copper''' electrodes (a collection of copper pennies).
File:Jumper Wires with Crocodile Clips.jpg|'''Lead wires''' (contents of a packet of insulated lead wires with alligator clips on the ends).
File:Digital multimeter.jpg|'''Multimeter''' (optional). The multimeter in the photo is set to its 20 V scale, which means 20 volts. For this experiment, you'd set it to read 2000 m, which means 2000 millivolts or 2.000 volts. To measure the current, you rotate the center switch to the scale that reads 200 mA, which means 200 milliamperes (or 0.200 amperes).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Making a single lemon cell==
Make the first lemon cell. Your battery is going to have at least 3 lemon cells, but each cell is made the same way.
#Clean your electrodes carefully. Your goal is to get any dirt or grease off of them, and also to scrub away the thin &quot;oxide&quot; coatings on them. It should work fine if you clean them in the same way that you'd clean a pan in the kitchen to make it clean and shiny. Scrubbing with steel wool or with an abrasive sponge will work fine.
#Stick one zinc electrode into the lemon (or other fruit). You may need to use a small knife to cut a slit into the lemon. You want the electrode to go into the lemon as deeply as possible, but you'll need a little bit of the electrode to stick out of the fruit so you can attach a lead wire to it. Wiggle the electrode around a little to smash the membranes inside the fruit.
#Next, stick the copper electrode into the lemon. You want this electrode to be close to the zinc electrode, but it ''must not touch'' the zinc inside the lemon. If they do touch, your cell will not work. As for the zinc electrode, you want to stick the copper electrode into the fruit as far as you can, and you want to wiggle it a bit to make sure the membranes near the electrode are broken.
(Optional) If you are using a multimeter, you can do the following tests to make sure your lemon cell is working.
#Hook up two alligator clips from your leads to the two electrodes. Connect the two clips to the leads of the multimeter.
#Measure the voltage from your lemon cell. It should read about 0.9 - 1.0 volts.
#Measure the current from your cell. You should read a few tenths of a milliampere. Some multimeters are not sensitive enough to measure currents less than one milliampere, in which case you'll just see 0.0 as the reading.

==Making the lemon battery==
[[File:Lemon Battery With LED.svg|thumb|right|Three lemon cells wired together so that they energize a light emitting diode (LED). Each individual lemon has a zinc electrode and a copper electrode inserted into it; the zinc is colored gray in the diagram. |alt=A drawing showing three lemons and a glowing red object (the LED). The LED has two lines coming out of its bottom to represent its electrical leads. Each lemon has two metal pieces stuck into it; the metals are colored differently. There are thin black lines, representing wires, connecting the metal pieces stuck into each lemon and the leads of the LED.]]
When several lemon cells are wired together, the collection is called a battery. We usually call a single lemon cell a battery also. Most batteries that you may purchase to use in toys and electronics have just one cell inside.
#You need to make 3 lemon cells. If you're using a multimeter, make sure that each cell generates the correct voltage and the correct current.
#Using two lead wires, connect the three cells together. Connect the zinc electrode on the first cell to the copper electrode on the second. Connect the zinc electrode on the second cell to the copper electrode on the third lemon. This is called a &quot;series&quot; connection; the three cells make up the lemon battery.

==Connecting the LED==
Connect a lead wire from the copper electrode of the first lemon cell to the longer lead wire from the LED. Connect a lead wire from the zinc electrode of the third cell to the shorter wire of the LED. You may need to gently pull the lead wires that come from the LED apart; the alligator clips on the ends of the two lead wires that connect your battery to the LED must not touch each other.

The LED should now light rather faintly if all the many details are correct. If you cannot see it glowing, turn down the room lights to make sure it isn't working. There's a guide to troubleshooting your setup below if it still doesn't work.

==After the LED lights==
If you've succeeded in getting your LED (or other device) to work, there are a few more experiments that you can try.
*What happens if you switch the two lead wires on the LED?
*What happens if you switch the two lead wires on the lemon in the middle?
*Stick a second zinc electrode into one of the lemons, but don't connect it to anything. Any effect on the LED?
**Now move the wire from the copper to the zinc. This lemon now has 2 zinc electrodes instead of one copper and one zinc. What happens?

If you are using a multimeter, you can record the voltage across the LED for each of these experiments to see if you understand it.

LEDs are made out of materials called semiconductors. The chips (integrated circuits) inside your electronic toys and computers are made out of silicon, which is also a semiconductor. However, silicon doesn't work for LEDs. Instead they are made out of materials like &quot;gallium arsenide&quot; which glow better than silicon. The three letters LED stand for '''L'''ight '''E'''mitting '''D'''iode. Diodes are sandwiches of two or more similar semiconductors. Diodes have the property that they only let electrical current flow in one direction. This is why your LED only works when it's hooked up correctly. Once the electrical current from your lemon battery is flowing through the diode, the flowing electricity can make some light. It's related to something called the &quot;photoelectric effect&quot;. It might interest you to know that Albert Einstein, the great scientist who is best known for his theory of relativity, actually won the Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect.

==Troubleshooting==
*A typical problem is that the electrodes or the bare metal parts of the lead wires are touching each other accidentally. The zinc and the copper electrode must not touch each other inside the fruit. The alligator clips must not touch each other where you connect them to the LED.
*The LED must be connected correctly. Trying switching the connections to the two wires that come out from the LED case.
*The series connection of the three cells must be right. Each lemon has one zinc and one copper electrode. The wires from lemon to lemon run from zinc electrode to copper electrode.
*Citrus fruit should be juicy inside. Unripe fruit may need to be gently crushed to break up the internal membranes.
*Three lemons is the minimum number needed to light an LED. If you can make a fourth lemon cell and add it to your battery, you may be able to get the LED to light this way.
*The LED may be broken, or may not be the correct type. There is an LED selection guide below, but selecting the right LED is difficult for younger people. Get some help from an adult if you think LED selection is your problem.

==LED selection guide==
The section is mainly for people who know something about electrical circuits.
*A red LED is preferred because it needs a lower voltage to glow than do orange, yellow, green, or blue LEDs. Some red LEDs work with about 1.6 - 1.8 V, which will need 3 lemon cells. A dim glow may be observable with only 2 cells. There are different types of red LEDs that glow at different wavelengths, and need slightly different voltages.
*Some LED packages contain series resistors, and are typically designed to work with a 12 V battery. These packages will not work with a lemon battery, which provides a much lower voltage.
*The best LEDs for lemon batteries are designed to glow with a current of about 1 mA (at a voltage of 1.6 V). One example is: Avago Technologies part HLMP-K150, which is a red LED (645 nm wavelength) with a 1.6 V forward bias voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HLMP-D150 |url=http://www.avagotech.com/docs/AV02-1562EN |publisher=Avago Technologies, Inc. |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An LED is included in some commercial kits for constructing lemon batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enviro Battery |url=http://www.4m-ind.com/product_view.php?id=19&amp;page_no=1&amp;type=1 |publisher=4M Industrial Development Limited |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, science teachers often use parts from the Radio Shack company, which has many stores. A 1998 paper listed several products from this company, but most of them are no longer available.&lt;ref name=Swartling&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lemon Cells Revisited—The Lemon-Powered Calculator |first1=Daniel J. |last1=Swartling |first2=Charlotte |last2=Morgan |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=75 |year=1998 |pages=181-182 |issue=2 |doi=10.1021/ed075p181 |url=http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/gr8ps/zz_old-files/green/wheres_the_juice/lemon_battery.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative devices==
In these instructions, we assumed that you will be using your lemon battery to make a light-emitting diode (an LED) glow. 
There are alternatives to an LED. Some low-power buzzers work.&lt;ref name=Swartling /&gt; You can also connect the lemon battery to devices that use one or two batteries inside like some digital clocks and calculators. If the device requires a 9 volt battery, it will not work with your lemon battery. For other devices, first remove the battery or batteries that are normally inside. Then, use the alligator clips from the lemon battery to connect to the terminals inside device. The copper electrode from the lemon battery needs to be connected to the terminal in the device that is marked +. The zinc electrode from the lemon battery needs to be connected to the terminal in the device that is marked -.

* {{keep}} This does not appear to be a mere collection of quotes. The quotes seem to be grouped into four categories, ''pointing out which quote belongs to author’s which idea''; such useful grouping does not seem to exist anywhere on author’s works and webpages, except when it comes to the fourth category. -- [[Special:Contributions/115.109.11.205|115.109.11.205]] ([[User talk:115.109.11.205|discuss]]) 05:25, 30 October 2012 (UTC)
::Granted; however in my opinion that does not make this into a book. Grouping quotes together by topic is certainly useful and should be encouraged; but as Pi zero has pointed out, a better place for it would be Wikiquote, which is meant to be for quotes; and quotes could be grouped together there as easily as here.

&lt;small&gt;(The proposal advanced by Msaikens, as originally proposed, was targeting the page [[MagicJack/Support Resources/FAQ]] for the RfD, but the statement is not clear about the subject as it refers to the book. Since the project is greater than that single page and the page does not present any disallowed content in itself, it must be examined in the full context of the book). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:19, 17 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

This &quot;book&quot; servers no true educational purpose. It is simply a product FAQ and guide. Wikibooks isn't the place for a company to post their FAQ's or guides. The company has their own comprehensive FAQ and ticket base on their website found at http://magicjack.com/faq/ .
{{unsigned|Msaikens}}

:I presume this concerns the whole book rather than just the FAQ page.  I'd be inclined to agree with the above comment though.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:09, 17 January 2012 (UTC)

:The issue of this book has previously been discussed in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#The_magicJack_wikibook_seems_to_be_a_company_promotional_tool_-_should_it_be_allowed.3F Wikibooks:Reading_room/General]. I support the RfD, I first examined the work in 30 December 2008 and found it too mercantile and not of an instructional nature, at the time [[User_talk:Az2008#MagicJack|I contacted the main editor]] and some minor corrections were made to the praises and criticism section, but the content itself has not improved beyond the simple exposition of a commercial product, that does not compare to other commercial user manuals that we normally would see as having educational value. I also do not see any other project that would welcome such content,&lt;s&gt; '''delete'''.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:30, 17 January 2012 (UTC)

:If the book diversified and looked at all VOIP devices, especially ones with relevance to the rest of the world then it could become more like a book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:59, 17 January 2012 (UTC)

:&lt;b&gt;ORIGINAL POST UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;I noticed there was a previous discussion. I still was not satisfied with the &quot;book&quot; being allowed to remain. If it were edited to include all VoIP services, I may change my mind. Though, I don't see this as likely.

*{{keep}} There is a long tradition of such &quot;books&quot; on Wikibooks. An FAQ being available elsewhere is not an argument for not having it here. It doesn't matter who put it here as long as it was freely licensed - this isn't Wikipedia and we do not have a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; rule that prohibits companies creating books about their own products as long as they are useful (i.e., not adverts). Other examples of this type of book include:
:*[[nVidia]]
:*[[Internet over GPRS on BSNL South India Prepaid Connection and Nokia 3650 Phone]]
:*[[Render a SolidWorks Model in Maya]]
:*[[How to use a Motorola DVR]]

: The MagicJack book is not an advert - it contains useful support information - and I see no valid reason to delete. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:39, 27 February 2012 (UTC)

::Most of the content of the project is advertisement and blatant product promotion almost all content is not educational, except for the FAQ and the How-to section. It also seems to fail to point out alternative products. I'm not a supporter of keeping FAQs (in that form as the main content of a project on Wikibooks, I see them as viable seeds to develop books (or textbooks) an exception would be those of the type [[Anarchist FAQ]] that do not seem created by questions raised (the normal way a FAQ is created) but by the need to offer answerers, this permits it to have a good structure and the flow needed for a textbook.
::I've changed my position to neutral, but to me it is on the gray area of what should be acceptable here. It also interesting to note that no one involved with that project so far participated in the RfD...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:00, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

* I see there is a [[Voice over IP]] book for those suggesting a broader book about VoIP would be more appropriate. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:11, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

{{Comment}} I obviously support deletion since I nominated this book in the first place. But, just because there are other books that provide educational purposes on a product, doesn't mean this book is automatically exempt. Yes, it does contain useful support information, but I don't feel it is truly for an educational purpose. The general &quot;language&quot; of the book strongly favors the promotional and advertising aspect of authoring. --[[User:Msaikens|Msaikens]] ([[User talk:Msaikens|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Msaikens|contribs]]) 13:41, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

: ЗAНИA suggested something that looks at all VoIP devices would become more like a book. One solution might be to merge it with [[Voice over IP]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:01, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

: I find the Magicjack entry, in total, useful. and find info in it that is not easily replaceable, such as starting the mj without splash screen. the manufacturer doesn't provide any manual or detailed instructions. this entry provides this missing information. {{unsigned2|18:47, 7 June 2012‎|69.211.104.17}}

:I created a category to track all images which are used in that book. [[:Category:MagicJack/Images]] The anti mail spam image should be kept local, the three photos can be transfered to commons, but moreover the 5 screenshots have major problems: a) the GUI of the Firefox isn't addressed (MPL/GPL/LGPL) and I highly doubt that (although there is nothing really copyrightable) we/Az2008 simply can release them under CC-BY-SA/GFDL.

== Additions to the course content ==

Hello,
I noticed that the Hebrew contents of this wikibooks is incomplete. I can offer and incorporate my portion of lessons; I teach Israeli (modern) Hebrew, and biblical Hebrew..so I believe that I can help out on this matter. I'll give my examples later, and see what you guys think.

== Number and Number Systems ==
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Number All Around Us  ===
&lt;br /&gt;
Understand the characteristics of the denary number system .
The number system that we use in every day life is the denary number system. So called because it uses ten digits to form numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. You can access some interesting facts on the [http://www.archimedes-lab.org/numeral.html history of numbers] at the following link. History of Numbers. After reading write five(5) short sentences on the history of numbers. (Link up with your learning partner to discuss each other's points in the discussion area.)
==== Numbers all around us ====
&lt;br /&gt; 
We us numbers every day. They are all around us. View the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWaQt6XwOV8 video]  on numbers around us and then see if you can list a couple other examples of numbers around us.
==== Understanding number systems ====
&lt;br /&gt;
In the denary number system the place value of the digits in the numbers are very important. Each digit has a value determined by where it is in the number.Learn more about the Place Value of numbers by following this [http://www.math.com/school/subject1/lessons/S1U1L1GL.html link].

=== Read classify and write different types of numbers ===
&lt;br /&gt;We must be able to read numbers and write them in numbers and in words. We therefore have to learn to spell words like hundred, thousand, million, ninety, eighty, seventy and so on.
Check out the [http://www.basic-mathematics.com/reading-and-writing-whole-numbers.html link] to make sure you can read and write numbers
==== Different types of numbers ====
&lt;br /&gt;
Numbers can belong to different groups. These groups include odd numbers, even numbers, prime numbers, composite numbers, rectangular numbers to name a few.
Prime numbers are of particular importance and we must be able to identify these. We can use a cool tool call [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes Eratosthenes Sieve] to identify these numbers.
==== Writing numbers in index form ====
&lt;br /&gt;Writing a number in index form means writing a number with a power. Remember 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a short way of writing 10x10x10. The digit 3 in 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is called the index or power.
==== The Metric system ====
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the system we use to measure. It is similar to the denary system in that it makes use of the number ten. We must know how to convert our measurements from one unit to another.This [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS-8FCqYo5M video] gives an easy method for doing this.

==Organization==

It will make things easier for you if you use the / system to organize the pages. Hebrew/Intro, Hebrew/Verbs, etc. The secondary page, Intro or Verbs, has an automatic link that is created to the parent page, Hebrew. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 23:15, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

== Transliteration ==

Would it be possible for you to put in more transliterations of new vocabulary so that learners could be sure of their pronunciations?

== suggestion ==

Lesson 2 and 5 on verbs should be merged, they're bascially the same.

== Other Suggested Lessons ==
I don't know enough Hebrew to create these, but I'll try to help where I can.

usage: gender and number agreement &lt;br&gt;
adjectives: good, bad, happy, sad, hungry, sick, healthy, fresh, dangerous, delicious, beautiful, kind, tired/sleepy, excited

sentences: I am hungry.  He is healthy.  She is happy.  We are tired.  The food is fresh.  The wine is delicious.  Where is a good hotel? &lt;br&gt;

===Hello and Goodbye (More Greetings)===
Actually, after looking more at the current structure, I suggest we pull some of the greeting stuff out of the current locations and create a [[Hebrew/Greetings]] lesson.&lt;br&gt;
noun: name &lt;br&gt;
phrases:  Good Morning, I'm happy to/It's good to meet you.  My name is X.  Welcome.  Good-bye.  See you.  Good afternoon.  How are you?  I'm fine.  She is sick.  What is your name?

===Feedback===
Is this helpful?  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 05:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

IMHO the Hebrew course is quite helpful, at least for beginners (such as myself).

==General Guidelines==
#I suggest that most lessons should not introduce more than 20 vocabulary words (fewer if possible).  More advanced lessons can have &quot;prerequisite&quot; lessons.  For example, a lesson on cooking terms could have some basic food lessons and measurement as prerequisites.
#Lessons should have a common format and components.  There are several options.  Here's one example, [[Hebrew/Lesson formats]].  Some language books put vocabulary first; others start with a dialog and then explain it with vocabulary etc.  Some common components could be
**vocabulary (broken into parts of speech:  Nouns - Verbs - Pronouns - Adjectives - Adverbs - Conjunctions - Prepositions - Interjections) with diacritic marks and transliterations/phonetic guidelines
**dialog
**usage hints (modern versus prayerbook Hebrew, colloquial use, more polite forms)
**related lessons (prerequisites, more advanced, overlapping topics -- for instance days of the week and numbers are related)
**exercises (translate individual words, phrases, sentences, first with the diacritic marks and then without) link to correct answers

Other ideas?  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 04:35, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

==Layout and Formatting==
As a suggestion, i think you should go over the book and make the layout and formatting consistent and then try and keep it consistent as the book develops.
===Fonts===
:The fonts &quot;Ezra SIL SR&quot; &amp; &quot;Ezra SIL&quot; display the Dagesh badly (too much to the left of the letter). If no one objects, I'll remove it from the Hebrew templates. [[User:Dan Pelleg|Dan Pelleg]] 21:23, 28 November 2007 (UTC)
::Since no-one has objected for almost a month, I'm removing these fonts from the templates. [[User:Dan Pelleg|Dan Pelleg]] ([[User talk:Dan Pelleg|talk]]) 23:28, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

== Orphaned pages ==

The following pages are not linked to and should be marked with {{tlx|delete|reasoning}} if no longer needed, linked to, or merged into another page and marked with {{tlx|now merged|destination page}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Advantages of a dropdown ==

OpenClinica can be presented in several ways, one of which is a single-select dropdown.  This is a particularly useful format because:
*It comes preset (the first item on the list or a specified default is selected).  In comparison Radio buttons don't come preset (all selections are empty).
**This preset nature allows calculations within the form to detect whether the question has been answered or not.  This is useful for scored questionnaires where the number of questions answered affects the calculation.  Unset fields (e.g. radio buttons) can't be calculated in such a way.
*It can be unset back to the first item in the list or the default.  In comparison, Radio buttons can't be unset.
**Unset items can be hidden by the actions of other fields (so the user can back out of making changes)

== Adding an empty option value ==

Single-select dropdowns store their values in one field (RESPONSE_VALUES_OR_CALCULATIONS) and their displayed text (RESPONSE_OPTIONS_TEXT) in another.  The list of values can include blank, e.g. this YESNO single-select has a '(select)' option that has a blank associated value:

{| border=1
  |+ OpenClinica CRF spreadsheet
|-
  ! RESPONSE_LABEL
  ! RESPONSE_OPTIONS_TEXT
  ! RESPONSE_VALUES_OR_CALCULATIONS
|-
  | YESNO
  | (select),Yes,No
  |, 1,2
|}

By setting this field as REQUIRED, the user has to select one of the none-empty values.  In this example either 'Yes' or 'No' has to be selected, (select) can't remain selected on save.

If an option that doesn't appear in the RESPONSE_VALUES_OR_CALCULATIONS list is specified as the DEFAULT, then this will appear in the single-select list.  However, this method has at least one limitation due to an associated bug in version 3.1.2 of Openclinica - [https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=10611 Issue 10611] (login required).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Privatization=

by Chris Edwards

==Overview==

Governments on every continent have sold off state-owned assets to private investors in recent decades. Airports, railroads, energy utilities, and many other assets have been privatized. The privatization revolution has overthrown the belief widely held in the 20th century that governments should own the most important industries in the economy. Privatization has generally led to reduced costs, higher-quality services, and increased innovation in formerly moribund government industries.

The presumption that government should own industry was challenged in the 1980s by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and by President Ronald Reagan. But while Thatcher made enormous reforms in Britain, only a few major federal assets have been privatized in this country. Conrail, a freight railroad, was privatized in 1987 for $1.7 billion. The Alaska Power Administration was privatized in 1996. The federal helium reserve was privatized in 1996 for $1.8 billion. The Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve was sold in 1997 for $3.7 billion. The U.S. Enrichment Corporation, which provides enriched uranium to the nuclear industry, was privatized in 1998 for $3.1 billion.

There remain many federal assets that should be privatized, including businesses such as Amtrak and infrastructure such as the air traffic control system. The government also holds billions of dollars of real estate that should be sold. The benefits to the federal budget of privatization would be modest, but the benefits to the economy would be large as newly private businesses would innovate and improve their performance.

The Office of Management and Budget has calculated that about half of all federal employees perform tasks that are not &quot;inherently governmental.&quot; The Bush administration had attempted to contract some of those activities to outside vendors, but such &quot;competitive sourcing&quot; is not privatization. Privatization makes an activity entirely private, taking it completely off of the government's books. That allows for greater innovation and prevents corruption, which is a serious pitfall of government contracting.

Privatization of federal assets makes sense for many reasons. First, sales of federal assets would cut the budget deficit. Second, privatization would reduce the responsibilities of the government so that policymakers could better focus on their core responsibilities, such as national security. Third, there is vast foreign privatization experience that could be drawn on in pursuing U.S. reforms. Fourth, privatization would spur economic growth by opening new markets to entrepreneurs. For example, repeal of the postal monopoly could bring major innovation to the mail industry, just as the 1980s' breakup of AT&amp;T brought innovation to the telecommunications industry.

Some policymakers think that certain activities, such as air traffic control, are &quot;too important&quot; to leave to the private sector. But the reality is just the opposite. The government has shown itself to be a failure at providing efficiency and high quality in services such as air traffic control. Such industries are too important to miss out on the innovations that private entrepreneurs could bring to them.

==Stand-Alone Businesses==

The federal government operates numerous business enterprises that should be converted into publicly traded corporations, including the U.S. Postal Service, Amtrak, and a number of electric utilities.

• '''Postal Services'''. The mammoth 685,000-person U.S. Postal Service is facing declining mail volume and rising costs. The way ahead is to privatize the USPS and repeal the company's legal monopoly over first-class mail. Reforms in other countries show that there is no good reason for the current mail monopoly. Since 1998, New Zealand's postal market has been open to private competition, with the result that postage rates have fallen and labor productivity at New Zealand Post has risen. Germany's Deutsche Post was partly privatized in 2000, and the company has improved productivity and expanded into new businesses. Postal services have also been privatized or opened to competition in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Japan is moving ahead with postal service privatization, and the European Union is planning to open postal services to competition in all its 27 member nations.

• '''Passenger Rail'''. Subsidies to Amtrak were supposed to be temporary after it was created in 1970. That has not occurred, and Amtrak has provided second-rate rail service for more than 30 years while consuming more than $30 billion in federal subsidies. It has a poor on-time record, and its infrastructure is in bad shape. Reforms elsewhere show that private passenger rail can work. Full or partial rail privatization has occurred in Australia, Britain, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, and other countries. Privatization would allow Amtrak greater flexibility in its finances, its capital budget, and the operation of its services — free from costly meddling by Congress.

• '''Electric Utilities'''. The U.S. electricity industry is dominated by publicly traded corporations. However, the federal government owns the huge Tennessee Valley Authority and four Power Marketing Administrations, which sell power in 33 states. These government power companies have become an anachronism as utility privatization has been pursued across the globe. TVA and PMA privatization would eliminate artificially low power rates that cause overconsumption and would increase efficiency in utility operations and capital investment. President Bill Clinton proposed to sell off the four PMAs in his 1996 budget. It is time to dust off those plans and move ahead with reform.
 
==Infrastructure==

Before the 20th century, transportation infrastructure was often financed and built by the private sector. For example, there were more than 2,000 companies that built private toll roads in America in the 18th and 19th centuries.1 Most of those roads were put out of business by the spread of the railroads. Then, during the 20th century, roads and other infrastructure came to be thought of as government activities. By the 1980s, that started to change, and governments around the world began selling off airports, highways, bridges, and other facilities.

Any service that can be supported by consumer fees can be privatized. A big advantage of privatized airports, air traffic control, highways, and other activities is that private companies can freely tap debt and equity markets for capital expansion to meet rising demand. By contrast, modernization of government infrastructure is subject to the politics and uncertainties of government budgeting processes. As a consequence, government infrastructure is often old, congested, and poorly maintained.

• '''Air Traffic Control'''. The Federal Aviation Administration has been mismanaged for decades and provides Americans with second-rate air traffic control. The FAA has struggled to expand capacity and modernize its technology, and its upgrade efforts have often fallen behind schedule and gone over budget. For example, the Government Accountability Office found one FAA technology upgrade project that was started in 1983 and was to be completed by 1996 for $2.5 billion, but the project was years late and ended up costing $7.6 billion.2 The GAO has had the FAA on its watch list of wasteful &quot;high-risk&quot; agencies for years.3 Air traffic control (ATC) is far too important for such government mismanagement and should be privatized. The good news is that a number of countries have privatized their ATC and provide good models for U.S. reforms. Canada privatized its ATC system in 1996. It set up a private, nonprofit ATC corporation, Nav Canada, which is self-supporting from charges on aviation users. The Canadian system has received high marks for sound finances, solid management, and investment in new technologies.4

• '''Highways'''. A number of states are moving ahead with privately financed and operated highways. The Dulles Greenway in Northern Virginia is a 14-mile private highway opened in 1995 that was financed by private bond and equity issues. In the same region, Fluor-Transurban is building and mainly funding high-occupancy toll lanes on a 14-mile stretch of the Capital Beltway. Drivers will pay to use the lanes with electronic tolling, which will recoup the company's roughly $1 billion investment. Fluor-Transurban is also financing and building toll lanes running south from Washington along Interstate 95. Similar private highway projects have been completed, or are being pursued, in California, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. Private-sector highway funding and operation can help pave the way toward reducing the nation's traffic congestion.

• '''Airports'''. Nearly all major U.S. airports are owned by state and local governments, with the federal government subsidizing airport renovation and expansion. By contrast, airports have been fully or partly privatized in many foreign cities, including Athens, Auckland, Brussels, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, London, Melbourne, Naples, Rome, Sydney, and Vienna. Britain led the way with the 1987 privatization of British Airports Authority, which owns Heathrow and other airports. To proceed with reforms in the United States, Congress should take the lead because numerous federal roadblocks make cities hesitant to privatize. For example, government-owned airports can issue tax-exempt debt, which gives them a financial advantage over potential private airports.

• '''Seaports'''. Nearly all U.S. seaports are owned by state and local governments. Many operate below world standards because of inflexible union work rules and other factors. A Maritime Administration report noted that &quot;American ports lag well behind other international transportation gateways such as Singapore and Rotterdam in terms of productivity.&quot;5 Dozens of countries around the world have privatized their seaports. One Hong Kong company, Hutchinson Whampoa, owns 30 ports in 15 countries. In Britain, 19 ports were privatized in 1983 to form Associated British Ports. ABP and a subsidiary, UK Dredging, sell port and dredging services in the private marketplace. They earn a profit, pay taxes, and return dividends to shareholders.6 Two-thirds of British cargo goes through privatized ports, which are highly efficient. Because of the vital economic role played by seaports in international trade, this should be a high priority reform area in the United States.

• '''Army Corps of Engineers'''. The Corps of Engineers is a federal agency that builds and maintains infrastructure for ports and waterways. Most of the agency's $5 billion annual budget goes toward dredging harbors and investing in locks and channels on rivers, such as the Mississippi. In addition, the corps is the largest owner of hydroelectric power plants in the country, manages 4,300 recreational areas, funds beach replenishment, and upgrades local water and sewer systems.

Congress has used the corps as a pork barrel spending machine for decades. Funds are earmarked for low-value projects in the districts of important members of Congress, while higher-value projects go unfunded. Further, the corps has a history of scandals, including the levee failures in New Orleans and bogus economic studies to justify expensive projects.7

To solve these problems, the civilian activities of the corps should be transferred to state, local, or private ownership. A rough framework for reform would be to privatize port dredging, hydroelectric dams, beach replenishment, and other activities that could be supported by user fees and charges. Levees, municipal water and sewer projects, recreational areas, locks, and other waterway infrastructure could be transferred to state governments.
 
==Federal Assets==

At the end of fiscal year 2007, the federal government held $1.2 trillion in buildings and equipment, $277 billion in inventory, $919 billion in land, and $392 billion in mineral rights.8 The federal government owns about one-fourth of the land in the United States.

Many government assets are neglected and abused, and would likely be better cared for in the private sector. It is common to see government property in poor shape, with public housing being perhaps the most infamous government eyesore. The GAO has found that &quot;many assets are in an alarming state of deterioration&quot; and the watchdog agency has put federal property holdings on its list of activities at high risk for waste.9

The GAO also notes that the federal government has &quot;many assets it does not need,&quot; including billions of dollars worth of excess and vacant buildings. The federal government spends billions of dollars each year maintaining excess facilities of the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Veterans Affairs.

The solution is to sell federal assets that are excess to public needs and to better manage the smaller set of remaining holdings. For example, there are substantial maintenance backlogs on facilities of the Forest Service, Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service. The solution is not a larger maintenance budget, but trimming asset holdings to fit limited taxpayer resources. Another part of the solution is to scrap the Davis-Bacon rules, which require that artificially high wages be paid on federal contracts, including maintenance contracts.

Federal asset sales would help reduce the federal deficit and create budget room for improved maintenance of remaining assets. Perhaps more importantly, economic efficiency and growth would increase as underused assets were put into more productive private hands. 

==Conclusions==

Privatizing federal businesses and infrastructure would allow new managers to extract greater efficiencies out of existing assets and to improve customer services. Private entrepreneurs can often innovate where government workers cannot, and they can more easily end unneeded and failed activities. Federal policymakers should:

• end subsidies to passenger rail and privatize Amtrak;

• privatize the U.S. Postal Service and repeal restrictions on competitive mail delivery;

• privatize the air traffic control system;

• help privatize the nation's airports, while ending federal subsidies;

• help privatize the nation's seaports;

• privatize federal electricity utilities, including the TVA and PMAs;

• privatize parts of the Army Corps of Engineers, such as hydroelectric dams; and

• sell excess federal assets, including buildings, land, and inventory.

These are some of the high-profile reform targets, but federal departments should be scoured for other large and small activities to transfer to new owners in the private sector.

=Researching privatisation: some notes about public policy evaluation=

by Luciana de Oliveira Miranda Gomes 

==INTRODUCTION==

The objective of this paper is to present state of the art about public policy evaluation, with specific reference to privatisation. The basic research goal is to evaluate the purpose and reach of the public policy objectives relating to privatisation, particularly in relation to their socio-economic outcomes at regional and community levels. 

What are the concerns that underpin the research focus on socio-economic effects? Jackson and Price (1994) comment that the success (or otherwise) of privatisation should not only be judged in terms of improvements in corporate performance indicators such as productivity and profitability. Such measures focus upon the distribution of benefits primarily to shareholders. They suggest, instead, that &quot;there are other stakeholders in the benefits of privatisation, especially consumers, who need to be considered&quot; (Jackson and Price, 1994, p. 17). According to authors, consumers can benefit from privatisation by paying less for their service, by facing more stable prices, or by receiving an improvement in the quality of the service. 

The present discussion seeks to go further and address issues of a wider socioeconomic impact. What are the consequences of privatisation of an industry for the inhabitants of a certain place? Was privatisation of state corporations advantageous or not to stake-holding communities' quality of life?

==ABOUT PRIVATISATION: SOME APPROACHES TO DISCUSS==

This section will discuss some approaches to privatisation and studies that try to demonstrate this impact. 

The policy of privatisation has been adopted by an ever-increasing number of countries since the 1980s, starting in the UK but spreading widely over the ensuing years. Seeking to reduce its asset base in the economy and to concentrate on the so-called functions of State, the State transfers its assets and patrimonies to the private sector. This is a quasi-permanent arrangement, as distinct from the contracting out of public interests - known as temporary privatisation. 

The wisdom of privatisation exercises has been hotly contested by researchers around the world (Bishop and Green, 1995; Hossain and Malbon, 1998), despite some research evidence on potential efficiency gains (Parker, 1998; Chisari et al., 1999). 

Three distinct tactical approaches have been adopted in the process of privatisation (Hossain and Malbon, 1998). They suggest that these tactics have been pursued with different levels of vigour in differing regions of the world economy. The big-bang approach is being pursued in Latin America and Caribbean region, the go-slow and institutional approach is characteristic of the Asian and East Asian nations, and the marketisation political approach of the Eastern Europe. The more developed countries have been directing their strategies towards industries and utilities such as electricity, water and gas. Regardless of these distinctions, a momentum to privatise state industries has been adopted throughout the world. What are the claimed benefits that underpin privatisation? Gould (apud Hossain and Malbon, 1998), said that privatisation will: 

. raise funds and reduce borrowing to improve a nation's effective fiscal and macroeconomic management; 

. increase efficiency at the enterprise level; 

. reduce government and bureaucratic interference in the day-to-day business of an enterprise; 

. increase the share in enterprise ownership; 

. create competition in the market; 

. promote discipline in the market place. 

The term privatisation can be defined in an inclusive manner, encompassing reductions in the welfare state, promoting at the same time entrepreneurial and voluntary activity. More narrow definitions conceive privatisation as the substitution of a private labour force for what is effectively an entirely identical group of public employees, to carry out a defined task. 

Bishop and Green (1995) present the concept of privatisation as a political mainstream. In 1978, a policy document prepared for the then opposition Conservative party in England proposed state a sell-off as a possible means of reducing the power of public sector trade unions. Analysing the privatisation that took place in UK in the 1980s/90s and the situation of firms transferring to competitive markets, the authors concluded that these firms took advantage of commercial and managerial freedoms that had been denied them prior to privatisation. 

In particular, some firms were able to restructure their operations and reduce their workforce in anticipation of the onset of recession whilst others were able to limit their exposure to recession by diversifying into less cyclical business. Bishop and Green (1995), however, fail to address at any point the consequences of the privatisation for the local and regional economy, nor do they address consumers' or customers' opinions. 

Hossain and Malbon's (1998) edited contribution is explicitly dedicated to analysing the distribution of benefits from privatisation. This book attempts to comment on the impact of privatisation and some questions from it for the purpose of regulatory reform. The contributors analyse the losses and benefits of privatisation in a variety of countries from various perspectives. In many nations, regulators have been established for the privatisation process and subsequent performance of the privatised firms. Their remit is to protect the interests and activities of three major players, namely consumers, privately-owned new companies and governments. Despite the research showing undoubted benefits in some privatised industries, as Malbon (1998) comments, the overall impacts of privatisation remain unclear. 

Malbon (1998) argues that privatisation should not be confused with deregulation. For example, the UK consumer was promised a great deal from privatisation: competition would force prices down and consumers would benefit from increased allocative efficiency. The idea was that competition would bring choice, promote efficiency within companies and provide the strongest possible incentive to keep retail prices as low as possible. However, as Meek (1998) observes, privatisation did not necessarily bring great competition in the UK. Analysing the privatisation of utility industries, he argues that, while consumers wanted a new market to develop benefits for them, the shareholder obviously sought healthy returns from a monopolistic player through the earning of economic rents. 

Meek (1998) defends the lack of competition associated with the British privatisation experience in the utility industries. He contends that greater competition was not a central policy objective when the industries were sold and, at the time of writing, the only competition that domestic consumers had seen is in the market for telephone and communications. On this basis, the regulators may be judged to have failed in their efforts to extract a proportion of the net surplus from privatisation for domestic consumers. 

Brown (1998), examining the economic issues relating to privatisation of telecommunications, in particular of the Telstra Corporation in Australia, concludes that the implications of privatisation are complex and depend upon a number of factors. These include whether or not the enterprise will be more profitable under private than continued public ownership, and the amount of underpricing and transactional costs. Longitudinal studies like these certainly shed light on the dynamic efficiency and impact of the privatisation process on monopolistic state firms. However, the socio-economic effects of privatisation in firms that were already operating in deregulated and competitive markets appear not to have been explored in the same way. 

Wilding (1990) analysing the experience of the three Thatcher administrations in the UK suggest that privatisation policy can be analysed under three headings: economic, political and social factors. The economic focus was predicated on the belief that market provision is always more efficient than public sector provision. Two further propositions underpinned this idea: 

. that management practice in the private sector is superior to that in the public sector and that such practices are transferable to newly privatised industries; 

. that in market situations, the consumer has much more power relative to producers. This implies that economic freedom is enhanced when individuals buy and sell goods and services in market relationships and reduced when services are publicly provided. 

The contention of the beneficence of the free market lay at the heart of government's privatisation policy in United Kingdom in the 1980s. Wilding's (1990) analysis of the political factors focuses on 1982, which he perceives as a crucial year. The Conservative Party needed a cause, to displace other problems with its strategy. Macroeconomic policy appeared in serious disarray. In addition, there was a more pervasive belief in the dead hand of the state, in the inherent inefficiency of public activity and public enterprise, the belief that what the state touches becomes relatively inefficient quite rapidly. The political agenda in this case pushes in two directions: a displacement of other potential failures elsewhere in economic policy; and a very conscious effort to roll back the interventionism of the Keynesian consensus. Finally, Wilding's (1990) social factors concern the moral benefits to a society where individual responsibility is clearly established, and this is to be achieved through expanding private ownership of homes and firms and liberating people from trade union restrictions. The author argues: how can we choose between public or private provision in differing, context-specific, socio-economic environments? 

Privatisation policies change the structure of incentives and the criteria used to judge success. Jackson and Price (1994) are surely correct to argue that the literature on privatisation has tended to focus upon technical efficiency and ignore allocative efficiency - i.e. who gains and who loses. Technical efficiency requires that the firms produce the output demanded by consumers at the lowest possible cost subject to the technical constraints of production. The input mix is, therefore, efficient. On the other hand, allocative efficiency requires that firms produce the level, mix and quality of output at a price where it is not possible to re-arrange the outputs of an economy and make one consumer better off without making another worse off. The singular focus on technical efficiency may result in policies that are directed at cost-cutting while policies that might result in price reflecting costs more closely are often ignored. Besides, Jackson and Price (1994) ask the following question: has privatisation resulted in improvements in efficiency as was hoped for by the advocates of the programme? 

Aylens' (1988) study of the UK steel industry concludes that the performance of the British Steel Corporation have been improved since privatisation. In 1980, British Steel was one of the lowest performing UK companies producing steel at prices significantly higher than its competitors. By the middle of the 1980s this had been reversed and the privatised British Steel Corporation was among the world's leading steel producers. This turnaround was not only achieved by changing ownership. Aylens (1988) describes the radical managerial and organisational reforms that were introduced. Decentralised business units with clear commercial objectives, which focused on outcomes, were established. Productivity bonuses were paid which, in 1987, represented about 20% of steelworkers' total earnings. The improvement in performance reflects the changes that were made to the incentive structure facing both management and the work force. 

Raju and Thanassoulis (1994) researched a number of privatisations of large publicly owned UK companies. Their analysis identified the factors that explained in large measure, the dividend yield, market capitalisation and the change in the market value of the company on the first day of trading of its shares, after privatisation. The objective was to see how the experience gained from past privatisations might be used to the taxpayer's advantage. Their research provides guidance for any future privatisations on how best to price assets and state enterprises to maximise the benefits to taxpayers. 

Parker and Martin (1996) examine the effects of privatisation on the use of inputs and hence on labour, capital and other supplies in eleven firms which were privatised in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Their findings indicate that privatisation does seem to have been associated with higher profitability and labour does seem to have lost out in terms of income shares, though to a lesser degree in terms of employment and wage relativities and in purchases and out-sourcing. However, both sets of results need further investigation. Parker and Martin (1996) also suggest that the performance of each privatised company should be partly determined by the environment in which it operates. For example, in 1985 the UK steel industry had surpassed the steel industries of Germany, France and the USA in terms of technical efficiency. However, since then it has become more lacklustre. The authors suggest that the change in the capital market did not lead to obvious performance gains, although whether British Steel would have weathered the economic recession after 1989 worse (or better) under state ownership is impossible to determine. This observation, that performance appears environmentally contingent, underscores the potential relevance of the research programme being pursued here. 

In a further study, Parker and Wu (1998) analysed the performance of British Steel before and after privatisation in December of 1988. They measure performance in terms of trends in labour and total factor productivity and profitability, on the one hand, and by comparing the technical efficiency in the UK steel industry with that in six other major steel producing countries, on the other. Their research method uses data envelopment analysis (DEA). The results confirm the existence of efficiency in the British Steel gains before privatisation but since then performance has been more lacklustre once again. 

Parker (1998) reviews privatisation in each of the European Union member states, identifying differences in the level of privatisation activity between countries. He also explains why privatisation may not lead to efficiency gains because of the specific form that privatisations are taking and the nature of capital market within the European Union. The author argues that privatisation implies a redistribution of income and wealth and therefore of economic power. However, these effects have yet to be widely discussed and researched. Parker (1998) suggests concentrating on the long-term effects on the competitiveness of European industry and the implications for social welfare. 

This brief review indicates the range of research methods being used by many authors to try to establish the impact of privatisation on the performance of the firms concerned over time. It also suggests a continuing concern with the impact of privatisation on differing interest groups. 

==KEY CONCEPTS==

The literature on privatisation is full of so many complementary definitions of key terms in regard to it. Hossain and Malbon's (1998) definition seems to be the most complete. According to the authors, privatisation is the desire to strengthen and expand the market at the expense of the state and increase the exposure of the public sector to market forces. Privatisation involves the selling of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), government business enterprises (GBEs), and others government activities to the private sector. The most common privatisation mechanism includes direct sale of a GBE, public offer of a GBE, concession sale, joint venture, management buyouts, liquidation and lease. In many nations, regulators have been established to oversee the privatisation process and to protect the interest and activities of three major players: namely consumers, privately owned new companies and governments. 

Defining the policy is a complex problem and several authors discuss this theme. Palfrey et al. (1992) outlines some of the more important differences. Academic researches contrast policy as an aspiration of a political party, as a general purpose and a particular programme. In this way, public policy should be understood as a process by which proposals are transformed into activities that will produce some kind of output (effects and impacts) in the society directly affected. 

The evaluation of public policy could be understood as the whole process of checking afterwards how far policy objectives have been achieved and how effectively and economically. Evaluation frequently relates to existent, measurable and most often segmental aspects of the policy process. However, subjective values are admissible in some cases. Evaluations try to provide answers to causal questions (impact or efficiency), and are conducted post facto (Geva-May and Pal, 1999). This perspective is denominated a summative evaluation. This discussion will be presented later in this paper. 

The several stages in the public policy cycle, agenda setting, policy formulation, policy legitimating, policy implementation, evaluation and policy reconsideration could be comprehended as a system where inputs, outputs, effects and impacts have a particular importance and must be distinguished as a part of the chain of value creation. 

Inputs are the resources required for formulating and executing the policy. So, outputs are specific activities that directly result from inputs. Effects (or outcomes) should be defined as what actually happened. It refers to direct consequences or results that follow from an activity or process, the resulting change in previous conditions. Ultimately, the impact is the consequence of a policy, both good and bad, expected and unexpected, reflecting those implications for society as whole, for example, the long-range improvements in attractiveness or the improvement of the quality of life in the community. 

Evaluation's literature has been giving emphasis at, firstly, the importance of the shareholders and stakeholders. Who should command the evaluators' attentions first? The answer to this question depends on the objectives of evaluation. For example, if the aim is to analyse the financial performance of a privatised company, the focus will be the shareholders and financial assets. On the other hand, if the intent is to understand the various interests that encircle the whole process of public policy making, then it is necessary to identify persons or groups who make decisions or desire information about that program, which means the stakeholders (Patton, 1997). 

==PRIVATISATION AS A PUBLIC POLICY==

The authors have discussed above how to approach privatisation from a public policy perspective, seeking to analyse the broad range of impacts arising from the privatisation process. Besides, the study of public policy requires attention to its initiation, formulation, implementation and impact. 

Hogwood (1995) traces the growth of interest in a policy focus in Britain during the 1970s and early 1980s and its subsequent partial displacement by the emphasis on public management. Despite this partial displacement, the policy focus is now institutionalised in academic research, textbooks, journals and teaching. One area in which the British debate has assumed a leading role has been implementation planning and management. However, the literature about evaluation continues to be dominated by the huge volume of American material. 

Pollitt (1996) confirms this conclusion about the development of Britain's research about public policy. He suggests that British public administration has endured radical anti-state reforms since 1979. However, he concludes that &quot;UK academic public administration is still more that of a North American Satellite than a core European State&quot; (Pollitt, 1996). 

Nevertheless, Geva-May and Pal (1999), describing the differences about policy evaluation and policy analysis, argue that evaluation is a subset or phase of policy analysis that is primarily research-oriented. Evaluation of a public policy tries to provide answers to causal questions, like impact or efficiency. It is conducted post facto, and concentrates its analysis in process and costs issues. On the other hand, policy analysis is about making recommendations for future improvement and will be based in part on research evidence derived from previous evaluation studies. Defined in these terms, policy analysis is intended to assist policymakers in choosing the best policy alternative among a set of alternatives, with the aid of evidence and reason, based on multiple methods of inquiry and argumentation. 

The act of evaluating a public policy may thus be thought of as the compiling of a retrospective argument. It relates to existent, measurable and often artificially segmented aspects of the policy process. Frequently, evaluators are required to use evidence and present policy makers with data that may assist them in the decision-making process. This informs (but never determines) the choice of the best policy among a set of alternatives, which is ultimately made on the basis of subjective reasoning. The target information of evaluators is goals, programme design, the implementation process and the outcomes of the evaluation process. 

The study methods are another area of controversy and considerable experimentation. Evaluation typically uses strict and objectivist social science research methods to assess the worth of the various organisational structures, ongoing programs, personnel, budgets and operating procedures. Policy analysis could be compared to journalism. It uses empirical methods and social science theories to figure out the expected consequences of anticipated alternatives; it requires data gathering and communication skill similar to those practised in journalism. After all, the policy analyst must provide good information to convince that his conclusion is the best. 

Evaluation does make use of case studies, mostly experimental or comparative studies whether quantitative or qualitative, or a combination of the two. It sets strict criteria and emphasises reliability and validity measurements. On the other hand, the data used by policy analysis are derivative and have been gathered, created or developed by others, in different settings and times, and for different needs. 

Therefore, what is the evaluation's problem definition? Geva-May and Pal (1999) says that it is to determine the research method, target population and research tools, but particularly avoid predicting results. The analyst of public policy should finish this part of the work. Since evaluation is primarily retrospective, it looks at context in terms of factors that facilitated or impeded policy success. 

When evaluators suggest policy options based on their evaluation research, they are using faithful data to make unfaithful recommendations. That is because the selection of options depends on a much wider range of information than can be provided through standard evaluation methods. This is the domain of the policy analyst. But, under certain circumstances, the boundaries can be crossed. The big question is how to recognise the transition from one mode to another. 

==RESEARCHING PUBLIC POLICY EVALUATION: SOME KEY METHODOLOGIES==

Geva-May and Pal (1999) propose a theoretical distinction between policy analysis and evaluation concepts, marking the potential divergence between them. They suggest some methods to evaluate a public policy: 

. cost-benefit analysis; 

. system analysis; 

. the use of case studies (experimental or comparative); 

. the use of qualitative and quantitative research, with the objective being to emphasise reliability and validity of measurements. 

Beneath each of these methods lies a panoply of specific tools and procedures that are spelt out in considerable detail in the Centre European Evaluation Expertise (1999). Geva-May and Pal (1999) also suggest that the act of evaluation should be oriented to the particular problem under investigation and avoid predicting results. 

Goldman, Nakazawa and Taylor's (1997) article proposes eight steps to evaluate the economic impact of a public policy. For them, economic impact studies need to provide information about the impact a project will have on the community's overall environment as well as on jobs, income and housing. The idea is not only to estimate total benefits and costs, but also to gauge the differences in distribution of income and costs arising from an intervention in the community. They argue that the evaluator must analyse the effects of each alternative on the individual economic areas being considered and also the indirect effects (or cross-impacts, as they term them) among the economic areas. It is also necessary to identify both the aggregated and the distributional impacts of each alternative. 

Reese and Fasenfest (1997) consider which kind of evaluation works best. The article discusses the values underpinning the evaluation of public policy, specifically economic programme. The authors argue that, firstly one must identify what the locality is trying to achieve, particularly what they think development is. The answer emerges between economic growth and a large systematic change. Economic growth objectives use indicators like job creation, less tax. The large systematic change defines development rather as a quantum shift development than simply growth, but the distributional impacts, that is, those that affect some individuals, groups, institutions, business and communities more than others. 

A proposal to narrow the gap between generating evaluation findings and actually using those findings for program decision making and improvement is demonstrated by Patton (1997), with his utilisation-focused evaluation methodology. In this approach, the first question is what has to be done to get results that are appropriately and meaningfully used. For this, the author presents four standards for evaluation: utility, feasibility, propriety and accuracy. 

Utility is intended to ensure that an evaluation will serve the practical information needs of intended users. Feasibility is intended to ensure that an evaluation will be realistic, prudent, diplomatic, and frugal. Propriety focuses on evaluation practice (the process) in order to ensure that an evaluation will be conducted legally, ethically, and with due regard for the welfare of those involved in the evaluation, as well as those affected by its results. Finally, accuracy is intended to ensure that an evaluation will reveal and convey technically adequate information about the features that determine the worth or merit of the program being evaluated. 

The first challenge in evaluation is therefore to answer the following question: who needs evaluation? Who cares about its findings? Following this, the task is to localise and identify the primary users, narrowing the list of potential stakeholders to a much shorter, more specific group of primary intended users. Their information needs, that is, their intended uses, focus the evaluation. Another important observation is that a particular evaluation may involve multiple levels of stakeholders and therefore need multiple levels of stakeholder involvement. 

Patton (1997) identifies three primary uses of evaluation findings: first, to judge merit or worth, for example, summative evaluation, accountability, audits, quality control, cost-benefit decisions, decide a program's future, and accreditation or licensing. The second use is to improve programs. He highlights this in terms of specific approaches, formative evaluation, the identification of strengths and weaknesses, continuous improvement, quality enhancement, constructing a learning organisation, managing more effectively, local adaptation of national model. Lastly, with the objective of generating knowledge, Patton (1997) indicates the following examples of evaluation: 

. generalisations concerning effectiveness; 

. extrapolation of principles about what works; 

. theory building; 

. synthesising of patterns across programs;

. the production of research output. 

Where the answers to the evaluator's questions indicate a major decision about a programme's merit or worth, then the evaluation should be designed to render an overall judgement: in other words, to conduct a summative appraisal. Where dialogue with primary intended users indicates, however, an interest in identifying strengths and weaknesses, clarifying the program's model, and generally working at increased effectiveness, the evaluation should be framed to support improvement-oriented decision making. In pursuit of this, the evaluator must employ skills in offering formative feedback. Beyond this, where the intended users are more concerned about generating knowledge for formulating future programs than with making decisions about current programs, then some form of synthesis or cluster evaluation will be most appropriate to discover generic principles of effectiveness. 

Pawson and Tilley (1997) present proposals for realistic evaluation. Firstly, they discuss the following proposition: programmes work (achieved desired outcomes) only in so far as they introduce the appropriate ideas and opportunities (mechanisms) to groups in the appropriate social and cultural conditions (contexts). These three concepts inform the authors' overall rationalist theoretical contribution. The choice of method has to be carefully tailored to the exact form of hypothesis developed earlier in the realist evaluation cycle. 

Pawson and Tilley's (1997) objective of constructing realistic data leads them to analyse four different interpretative currents of key informants (the stakeholders): policy-makers, subjects, practitioners and evaluators. According to the authors, doing a cross fertilisation analysis with these items of information will design a more significant data, because the researcher's theory is the subject matter of the interview, and the stakeholder (the subject) is there to confirm, to falsify and, above all, to refine that theory. 

Lichfield (1996) presents proposals for community impact evaluation, an interesting discussion about how to devise planning interventions that can be clearly justified in terms of need, cost of planning, the impact on individual freedoms and the bureaucratic implications. In other words, what options are available to produce better results in terms of value for money? Starting the discussion with cost-benefit analysis, the author sets out several questions to criticise this methodology: 

. Whose cost and benefits are to be taken into account?

. Which costs and benefits in geographical terms?

. Should the decision relate simply to efficiency or also to equity and social justice?

To answer these reflections, Lichfield (1996) proposes a methodology to show the importance of analysing not only the impact as output, but also the effect of that on people (the community). The author shows the gulf between effects and impacts. The effects could be defined as the physical and natural changes resulting, directly or indirectly, from development. On the other hand, impacts are the consequences or end products of those effects represented by attributes of the environment on which we can place an objective or subjective value. There are several categories of impact, but the main ones are direct and indirect. 

Lichfield (1996) argues that the direct (or first order) impact manifests directly on the environment as a result of the project impact. However, the indirect (or second order, induced or secondary) impact is generated by activities that result from the project. Other impact categories highlighted by the author are cumulative; short, medium or long-term; permanent or temporary; reversible or irreversible; positive or negative effects. Finally, the impact could be evaluated ex ante, with the objective to predict the scale, magnitude and significance of the impacts or ex pos, after the event. 

==THE LACUNA: THE PROPOSAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE PUBLIC POLICY EVALUATION==

Following Palfrey et al.'s (1992) idea, the policy evaluation literature has been dominated by American contributions, in two kinds of publications: a general texts on the process of evaluation research; and titles relating to the methods for evaluating particular social programmes. In Britain, after the development of cost-benefit analysis in the early 1960s, the main preoccupation since the 1970s seems to have been the construction of performance indicators. 

However, the lacuna highlighted by Palfrey and others is that targets may be met and objectives achieved but at what cost to considerations of equity and social justice. According to the authors, a properly conducted piece of evaluation research has ultimately to relate the findings not just to specified, measurable objectives but to prior considerations about the values involving particular policies. The relevance and importance of processes in determining both efficiency and effectiveness are too often ignored. 

Therefore, succeeding the Hossain and Malbon's (1998) backing, let us return to the initial question: who benefits from privatisation? If privatisation can be understood as a public policy programme, the literature suggests a number of further questions: 

. Have privatisation programmes shown any sensitivity to socio-economic impacts on local and regional communities? 

. What research methodologies have been used to analyse this impact? 

. Are these research methodologies serving their purpose? 

The answers to these questions above will contribute to public policy evaluation as a discipline and as a comprehensive view on reality. 

For a further study, the author wishes to demonstrate a research proposal that could supply the gap described above with new reflections. The proposition is to research Brazil and England's privatisation experiences, and answer the questions implied for the following reasons. 

==CONCLUSIONS BUT NOT THE ENDINGS==

The first question will analyse an important public policy programme which took place in both countries. In the case of England, the especial importance is that it was the first country in the world to start this kind of economic public policy on a large scale. Brazil's study figures as an interesting case because it is one of the first countries in Latin America to follow the neo-liberalism perspective of Mrs. Thatcher on a government level. Another reason is that, in Latin America, Brazil had greatly different kinds of business which were state-owed in the earlier 1990's. For example, metallurgy, petrochemical, fertilisers, electric, rail, mining, port, financial, computer systems, and others sectors have been privatised since 1991. 

The second question needs to understand if the usually research methodologies have been discuss the difference shows above in this paper between outcomes and impacts. For in such a way, one of the proposals of this research is to made a vigorous literature review on public policy evaluation, mainly in privatisation programmes.

The third question is to reflect on the possible gaps in the research methodologies that propose to analyse and evaluate public policy impacts. The results of the second question will be the data of these considerations. The final aim of the study will contribute to public policy theory in terms not only of evaluation, but also of policy formulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Yugoslavia''' (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Macedonian, Slovene: ''Jugoslavija'' or ''Југославија'') was a country in south-eastern Europe in the Balkans region.  It was formed by present-day [[../Serbia|Serbia]], [[../Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[../Bosnia Herzegovina|Bosnia Herzegovina]], [[../Croatia|Croatia]], [[../Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[../Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[../Slovenia|Slovenia]]

== History of Yugoslavia ==

== Geography of Yugoslavia ==
Yugoslavia, from 1954 to 1991, had an area of ​​255,804 km ². It had a long coast on the Adriatic Sea with numerous islands. The Northeast region was relatively flat, the rest of the country rather mountainous. '''The highest mountain was Triglav''' (2864 m, in the Julian Alps near Jesenice, Slovenia). The main rivers were the Danube and its tributaries Drau (Drava), Save (Save) and Morava.  The inland areas around present-day Serbia, eastern Croatia and eastern Slovenia are mostly flat, western Slovenia and much of Bosnia Herzegovina and Montenegro are mountainous.

== People of Yugoslavia ==

Yugoslavia was an extremely diverse country with several languages spoken and many religious groups. [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Islam]], [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Roman Catholicism]], [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Judaism|Judaism]], Protestantism as well as various Eastern Orthodox faiths were practiced across the country.  Most Catholics lived in present-day Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina.  Most Muslims lived in Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro.  Most Orthodox Christians lived in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia Herzegovina and Macedonia.  In 1991 over 23 million people lived in Yugoslavia.  Yugoslavia was popularly described as consisting of: seven frontiers, six republics, five nationalities, four languages, three religions, two alphabets and one boss.  Both the Latin alphabet (the alphabet we use in English) and Cyrillic alphabet (as used in the Russian language) were used.  Today the Cyrillic alphabet is only used in Bosnia Herzegovina (mainly in Serbian areas), Serbia and Montenegro.

== Sights of Yugoslavia ==

The islands and beaches of present-day Croatia attracted most of the tourists.  Belgrade (Serbia), Sarajevo (Bosnia) and Zagreb (Croatia) attracted many visitors for the culture, nightlife and arts.  The Slovenian mountains, Croatian islands and lakes attracted adventure tourists.  The 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo.  Because Yugoslavia tried to remain friendly with both the West (Western Europe and the USA) and the East ([[../USSR|Soviet Union]] and Russian-influenced countries) it was popular with tourists from all over Europe and never closed off to foreigners as with many communist countries.

==The Possibilities of Passenger Airlines==
When Orville and Wilber Wright first left the ground in December of 1903, airplanes have been thought of as a great means to move people across large distances or across heavy terrain. As aircrafts generally improved with changing technologies, aircrafts could fly further, and carry more passengers between locations than other modes of transportation such as railroads and automobiles. Airplanes could fly at very high speeds between distant places, and by the 1950’s after World War 2 and the jet engine had been developed, airlines had found a market niche for long distant travel.
The airlines traveled these long distance trips that took automobiles, trains, or boats days to complete. Unlike these other modes of transit airplanes offered people the ability to travel anywhere in the world. Air New Zealand was able to offer a flight from Hong Kong to London in a matter of 25 hours which are at almost opposite ends of the world &lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;. This long distance travel provided in such a short time cannot be matched by any other mode of transportation, and gives airlines passengers who need to travel across country or the world quickly.

==Developments in the market==
===Jet Engine===
[[Image:Whittle Jet Engine W2-700.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Whittle W.2]]/700 engine flew in the [[Gloster E.28/39]], the first British aircraft to fly with a turbojet engine, and the [[Gloster Meteor]]]]
The jet engine was invented by English aviation engineer and pilot Sir Frank Whittle. Whittle first thought up the idea of a gasoline engine in the 1930’s and by the year 1937 had a patent and the first test of a jet propulsion engine&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;. In the next four years he used this technology to develop an engine to fly an experimental plane that was modified to use the jet engine. In 1941 the Pioneer was one of the first jet propelled aircraft to fly. Although it was not the first jet propelled aircraft to fly, this model of the engine had the fundamental elements of jet engines produced today.

When the Jet engine was put into service on passenger jets, the airline became a viable option for transportation in the US. Unlike the automobile, an airline could fly from city to city across the country in the matter of hours instead of days. Jet engines provided the airline a way to fly at speeds of 900-1150 kilometers per hour. Most interstates in the country only had a speed limit of 110 kilometers per hour. This difference in speed is the main reason why airline ridership took off in the 1950’s and created the fastest mode of transportation in the country.

===Airline Fuel===
Another key component to providing flight across the country is the jet fuel that is used for the jet engines. Kerosene was the first fuel used in Whittle’s jet engine and is still the primary source for jet fuel today&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;. As planes became more advanced and flew at higher elevations, higher grade kerosene was used that had a lower freezing point and could withstand the low temperatures sometimes near -40 degrees Celsius. Another addition to the fuel standards was enforcing a high flash point to decrease the risk of fire. These fuel standards provided planes with fuel that would increase the safety of the plane.  

==Boeing’s shift from military planes to passenger airplanes==

As aircrafts became more and more suitable for flying, one company revolutionized airplane design and production. After World War two the demand for military planes ended and Boeings production of military aircrafts ended. But instead of letting the company die, Boeing shifted its focus to the development of passenger planes. By the 1950’s and 1960’s Boeing had released some of the first jet aircrafts intended for passenger use in the form of the Boeing – 717 or more commonly known as the DC-9 and DC -10 planes&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;. These aircrafts began transporting millions of people across the country, and by 1965 the annual passengers domestically exceeded 100 million people. This switch between propeller planes and jet airplanes created a market for fast, long distance travel that only an airline could provide.

==Development of Airports==
As airplanes began to find a market niche in passenger travel across the country, many airports began to spring up and form in major US cities. These airports were initially designed to handle small amounts of air traffic mostly for US mail flights and very scarce passenger flights. But as airplane producers developed passenger jets, airports across the country had to build new terminals for the increased demand for air transport, and add improved runways to handle these new airplanes&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;. Passenger growth during the 1970’s and 1980’s continued to force airports to add additions onto terminals in order to support the increase in passengers trying to fly domestically as well as internationally.

As airports began to shift from handling a few flights a day to handling millions of passengers a year, terminals began to offer services to people who were waiting for flights. Terminals offered restaurants and shopping kiosks to passengers who had time to kill, and many hotels were built either connected to the airport or a short bus ride away. These types of amenities offered by airports attracted more and more passengers to airplanes, and created the image of luxury for air travel. As air travel continues to be a large percentage of transportation across the country, airport terminals will continually adapt to the services that passengers expect. 

==Market development==

Airlines in the 1940’s and 1950’s were almost exclusively for first class businessmen, and the amenities that the airlines provided reflected that. Meals were served on china with linen napkins, there were beverage lounges, and everything about the flight was luxurious &lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;. These airlines flew with federal subsides through 1954. These subsides allowed airlines to continue to serve the first class businessmen with the protection against the economy taking a downturn. When this federal subsidy ended, airlines had to expand to offer couch service to offer transportation to the lower market share. 
Government regulation also hindered new airline companies from entering the market. The same big name companies dominated the market until deregulation in 1978. This allowed many smaller airlines to enter the market, and airline traffic surged throughout the 1980’s. The gulf crisis in 1989 caused airline companies to lose a huge market, and caused many airlines like Pan Am to go into bankruptcy. Chapter 11 bankruptcies have allowed companies like Continental to stay afloat during tough economic times, and by helping out these struggling aircraft companies, service throughout the United States has continued to be affordable.

==Growth of Airlines==

Airlines started out mainly for the purpose of airmail, and because of federal funding and support the growth of airplane service to cities grew. One of the first airline companies Pan Am began flying between the southern US and Latin American countries in the Caribbean.  These planes acted as island hoppers, and connected the islands together. Pan Am was also the first company to adapt the Boeing 707 which was the first jet plane in production. Although these jets offered fast reliable service, the price was still very high. Juan Trippe the president of Pan Am pressured Boeing to build a larger plane that could carry more passengers so that the price of an airline ticket could be dropped&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;.. Trippe and Boeing’s CEO William Allen worked out a deal to mass produce the new Boeing 747. Although the 747 was a great airplane for providing customers with cheaper flights, the fixed costs of the plane almost bankrupted both Pan Am and Boeing.

Attempts were made to expand on the technology that made airplanes so convenient for domestic travel in order to serve international travel needs. The United States along with the English and French governments all funded the Concorde program which was a supersonic jet that could fly between Europe and the United States in the matter of 2-3 hours. This shorter travel time was a huge innovation over a conventional airplane that could take upwards of 8 hours to make the Atlantic crossing. Because of high ticket prices needed to pay for the costs, Concorde was unable to stay in operation and the fleet was retired in 2003. This shows that although the technology is available to improve travel time on airplanes, the costs are too high to implement any of these technologies on a wide scale&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;.

==Methodology==
In order to understand the amount of passengers using airlines and to estimate the future demand of the airlines industry, we developed an S-curve to fit the number of passenger enplanements in the United States annually&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;. We found this curve by fitting an equation with three independent variables to the data by using a sum of squares regression. We used Microsoft Excel’s Solver feature to derive the values for our inflection time t_0, our global maximum for passenger enplanements K, and a shape variable b. Using the following equation, we fit the curve to the data with an R2 value that is greater than .99 &lt;br /&gt;
N(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t_0)]&lt;br /&gt;
This high R2 value shows that this S curve is a very good fit for the given data. The following values were found using the solver derivation in excel.


===Table 1: Regression Statistics for Predicted Model===

|-
| Adjusted R Square || 0.9902
|-
| Standard Error || 20519700
|-
| Observations || 57
|-
|}

Using the data calculated from our s-curve equation, we then preformed a regression analysis on the data. This regression analysis found the R squared value along with the standard error and the upper and lower 95th percentiles.

|-
|}

===Table 4: S-curve Model Parameters===

Using the equation for the S-curve S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)] , and using solver in Excel to find the least sum of squares of the differences in the data and the curve, we estimated the values for the S-curve below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:275px; text-align:left;&quot;
|-
| K value || 676,248,778
|-
| b || 0.098891674
|-
|t0 || 1982.477415
|-
|}
We plotted this calculated S-Curve vs the given data from the RITA data set. As you can see from the figure, the fit line accurately represents our R squared value of .99. This curve fits the data very well, and should be a good estimate of the passenger enplanements in the coming years.

==Maturity of the Mode==
This data confirmed that the S-curve fit the data, and was a good estimate for the passenger enplanement in the future. Since our calculated K value was equal to 676,248,778 annual passengers, this is a good estimate for the amount of people who will be traveling in the next 5-10 years. Depending on the market and other technology improvements in other transportation modes, airlines could be near its maximum annual passengers or it could continue to grow. The biggest conclusion we can make from the S-curve is that policy makers should not plan for airlines to keep growing at the pace seen in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Policy makers and planners should plan on airlines being a major part of domestic and international travel for many years to come, but since the rate of growth has been shown to decrease, domestic airlines have reached their saturation point.

==Conclusion==
By looking at both the qualitative and quantitative sections, airlines can be seen as a very effective mode of transportation for long distance trips. They offer passengers long distance travel in the shortest amount of time for a reasonable price. These three factors have made airplanes a series mode of transportation in the last decade, and will be a major mode of transportation for years to come. The data that we have calculated show that the rate at which airlines have been growing has leveled out. Over the last 8 years, domestic airline passengers have stayed relatively steady at 650 million annual trips. From our given S-Curve and knowledge that most modes of transportation follow this type of growth, we can state that airlines will not increase in domestic passengers unless there is a new technology or major incentive introduced.

==Background== 
Obesity is defined as having a BMI (Body Mass Index) greater than 30 due to too much fat. 
&lt;ref&gt;Dugdale, DC; Vorvick, LJ; Zieve, D.  Obesity.  PubMed Health. May 12, 2012.  Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004552/&lt;/ref&gt; On average, an uninsured non-obese person spends $512 per year on medical costs, whereas as an uninsured obese person spends $3,271 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Bengley, S.  As America’s Waistline Expands, Costs Soar.  Reuters.  April 30, 2012.  Retrieved from http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/30/us-obesity-idUSBRE83T0C820120430&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally, the total medical spending on obesity equals to $190 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;Ilbid&lt;/ref&gt; These costs have even surpassed the costs of smoking. (Smoking added 20% to average medical costs whereas obesity added 50%)&lt;ref&gt;Ilbid&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BMI_Chart.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|right|160px|&lt;ref&gt;Vorvick, LJ; Zieve, D.  Body Mass Index.  PubMed Health. July 23, 2010.  Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004463/&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In this chapter, we will further explore the economic issues of obesity by examining the correlation between diets of individuals from various economic classes and obesity rates within those classes.  Note that the term diet refers to its medical definition, which is any food that is ingested, and not the mainstream definition of diet, which is the limitation of food ingestion for losing weight.  Also note that we have delineated the economic classes as lower, middle, and upper class, but have not specifically limited them based on annual income or other such variable.  

====Average Food Expenses====
Each month the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) puts out four food budgets: Thrifty, Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost, and Liberal Food Plans.  Each plan or budget corresponds to different income levels; however, USDA does not specify the income brackets matching the plans.  USDA does subjectively categorize the budgets by income while stating that the Thrifty Food Plan is used to determine food stamp allotments, the Low-Cost Food Plan is used by Bankruptcy Courts to determine food expenses allotments of bankrupt people, and the Liberal Food Plan is used by the Department of Defense to determine the Basic Allowance for Sustenance for service members.&lt;ref&gt;The Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost, and Liberal Food Plans, 2007.  United States Department of Agriculture.  2007.  Retrieved from http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/FoodPlans/MiscPubs/FoodPlans2007AdminReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A USDA study in 2000 reported that low-income groups tend to have lower quality diets &lt;ref&gt;Basiotis, P.P., Carlson, A., Gerrior, S.A., Juan, W.Y., &amp; Lino, M. (Authors in alphabetical
order.) (2002). The Healthy Eating Index: 1999-2000 (CNPP-12). U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. 
&lt;/ref&gt;, while a more recent study stated that there are no significant differences in diet quality between various income groups &lt;ref&gt;Diet Quality of Low-Income and Higher Income Americans in 2003-04 as Measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2005.  United States Department of Agriculture.  December 2008.  Retrieved from http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/NutritionInsights/Insight42.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.




====Obesity in the Economic Strata==== 
It is generally thought that obesity and poverty have a positive correlation in America as Maheshwari’s research proved, but more recent studies point to an opposite trend.  A recent study reported at the American Heart Association’s 45th Annual Conference showed that the richest Americans (those with an annual income of $60,000 or more) have the highest obesity growth rate from all the economic classes.  Obesity is still most common in poor households, but the gap is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;American Heart Association's 45th Annual Conference on Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention, Washington, April 29-May 2, 2005. News release, American Heart Association. CDC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid Electric Vehicles==
[[File:2nd-Toyota-Prius.jpg|thumb|Toyota Prius]]
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are a cross between an electric car and an internal-combustion car.  They combine the electric motor and battery of an electric car with a small internal-combustion engine.  The electric motor receives power from the batteries which are charged by the internal-combustion engine batteries as needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;wouk&quot;/&gt;  The Hybrid separates itself from electric vehicles by its much greater range.  Unlike electric vehicles, which are typically limited to 130&amp;nbsp;km between charges, HEVs can run until both the batteries and gasoline are depleted, giving it a substantially greater range.&lt;ref name=&quot;wouk&quot;/&gt;  The electric motor tends to run at lower speeds, while the internal combustion engine is used at higher speeds and to charge the batteries when they are depleted.  Also, because the internal-combustion engine charges the batteries, HEVs don't need to be plugged in as electric vehicles do. 

Compared to a typical internal-combustion vehicle, the main advantage an HEV provides is increased fuel efficiency.  This leads to fewer emissions and fuel savings.  In particular, HEVs excel in their fuel efficiency over internal-combustion vehicles in city driving.  The electric motor tends to be more efficient in dealing with the frequent acceleration and deceleration.  This is partly because HEVs are able to capture some of the power lost during breaking.  This is done by reversing the engine and charging the batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;  This leads to even greater fuel savings over internal-combustion vehicles.  When stopped completely, HEVs can shut off their engine automatically, conserving energy, while  internal-combustion vehicles (ICVs) continue to run unless the driver manually switches them off.

One feature of HEVs and EVs which is both advantageous and, at the same time, a safety concern is their lack of noise.  When operating their electric motor (typically at low speeds), HEVs are much quieter than their ICV counterparts.  Quieter vehicles are typically desirable because they reduce noise pollution, an expensive transportation externality.  The problem is that pedestrians are accustomed to the noise of internal-combustion vehicles.  Pedestrians rely on the noise generated by vehicles to warn them that they are nearby.  The lack of noise generated by slow moving HEVs presents a concern for pedestrian safety.  The U.S. Congress enacted the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act which includes a minimum sound requirement for motor vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;/&gt;  Manufacturers have begun adding vehicle noise and warning sounds to help protect pedestrians.

The primary market for HEVs includes economically and environmentally conscious consumers who are looking to reduce emissions and save on fuel but do not want to be confined to the limitations of electric vehicles.  Most HEVs are smaller vehicles and so the market revolves around drivers willing to drive compact cars.  This trend has been changing, however, with the development of hybrid SUVs.  Due to the higher cost of HEVs over ICVs, the market tends to include higher income drivers.  Also, because HEVs are relatively new, fewer used HEVs are available on the market.  This restricts the market further to those willing to purchase new, or nearly new, vehicles.

The success of HEVs in the market is largely dependent on the price of gasoline and the prevalence of environmental concerns.  This can be seen by looking at the history of HEVs sales in comparison to gasoline prices.  As oil prices rise, the fuel savings from driving HEVs also increases.  As seen in the 1970s however, a sustained period of high oil prices is needed for HEVs to capture sufficient market share.  In '' Encyclopedia of Energy'', German discusses new vehicle purchasers lack of concern for the cost of fuel.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;  Often, the short term savings of ICVs win out over the possible long term fuel savings of HEVs.  

One problem HEVs have encountered in trying to establish their market share is that manufactures continue to make enough improvements to ICVs.  The improvements limit the benefits of HEVs.  As concerns about fuel efficiency rise, manufactures produce more fuel efficient ICVs.  If fuel prices drop, no action is necessary from manufacturers as consumers will continue to purchase ICVs.  The internal combustion engine continues to win out because the &quot;incremental advantages [of HEVs] are less than the cost of switching infrastructure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;

==History==

HEVs were not new to the U.S. in 1999 as the sales data seems to suggest.  In fact, their origins go back all the way to 1905.  At that time, American engineer H. Piper came up with the concept of a hybrid vehicle.  His motivation was an increase in performance.  His hybrid electric vehicle could accelerate to 40&amp;nbsp;km/h in 10 seconds while internal-combustion vehicles of the time were requiring 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;wouk&quot;/&gt;  Although this was a drastic improvement, the internal-combustion engine caught up by the time Piper received his patent.  A major disadvantage of the gasoline engine was the requirement to start by crank.  Once Piper received his patent, this barrier had been overcome and the internal-combustion vehicle went on to dominate the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;wouk&quot;/&gt;  

Some electric vehicles had been developed around the same time as Piper with the help of electricity pioneers like Edison and Tesla.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;  Like EVs today, the major drawback was the battery technology which greatly limited the vehicles' range.  However, this originally was less of a concern due to the limited road infrastructure between cities.  The range was sufficient for city driving.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;  As roads began to expand, though, the internal-combustion vehicle made its run.  The heavy batteries required for EVs weighed them down.  Adding additional batteries had diminishing returns because of the extra weight.  Hybrid's had to rely on mechanical means of switching between the electric and gas motors.  This was complex and less efficient than today's HEVs which have computers optimizing and controlling its operations.  

Until the oil crisis in the mid-1970s, the gasoline car went virtually unchallenged by electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;wouk&quot;/&gt;  With gasoline prices relatively low, oil plentiful, and with existing dominance over the market, gasoline cars were not threatened.  Improvements in power and efficiency further helped to prevent any potential competitors from entering the market.  

In the 1970s, with the oil crises causing gas prices to rise, a brief opening appeared for alternative vehicles.  Wouk discusses his own attempts at bringing an HEV during this time.  His model was able to achieve much higher fuel efficiency and seemed to be on for manufacturing.  However, the crisis was too short-lived and once oil was readily available again, funding for alternative vehicles such as his declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;wouk&quot;/&gt; The oil crises did bring about the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) requiring new fuel efficiency standards.  HEVs such as Wouk's immediately met these standards but automakers had until 1985 to comply with their ICVs.  This allowed them sufficient time to improve ICVs and left little chance for alternative vehicles to enter the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;

Nearly 20 years later, President Clinton makes a deal with major U.S automakers.  Instead of raising CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards, the deal requires GM, Ford and Chrysler to establish a &quot;Supercar.&quot;  The program would combine government and corporate money in the development of an 80 miles per gallon vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;  The biggest problem with the deal was this somewhat arbitrary milestone of 80mpg.  The goal was attainable, but required automakers to use very light, and therefore expensive, materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt; The automakers were successful in developing an 80mpg vehicle, but due to its enormous expense, it was simply not marketable to the public.  Perhaps a more modest goal would have produced a marketable vehicle which was still drastically more fuel efficient than ICVs of the time.  Nevertheless, the Supercar program did help spur innovation in the alternative vehicle industry.  Several years later, Toyota and Honda rolled out their hybrid vehicles, first in Japan.  Their cars achieved more modest fuel efficiency than the Supercar but still double the average ICV.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;  The Japanese market was also more suited to an HEV.  With higher gasoline prices, higher density driving and culture more accustomed to compact cars, Toyota and Honda saw success in their home market.  Driver demand for vehicle performance was also less than in the U.S.  Both companies worked to adapt their hybrid technology to suit the U.S. market.  Beginning as early as 1999, but primarily in 2000, Americans began purchasing HEVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nts&quot;/&gt;

==Innovation in HEV Technology==
Technological innovations in the last 100 years has made all types of vehicles safer, faster, more efficient and cheaper.  HEVs are no exception.  They have greatly benefited from technological breakthroughs between the Piper HEV of 1905 and Toyota's Prius of the 1990s.  A difficulty of early 20th century hybrids was the mechanical method of switching between electric and internal-combustion power.  This had to be controlled mechanically, whereas today's hybrids are controlled by tiny microcomputers.  In fact, even ICV's systems are computer controlled.  The implementation of computers into HEVs allows for optimal control between the two power sources.

An area which has seen less advancement and continues to be a limiting factor in HEVs is battery technology.  Although batteries in today's hybrids are certainly an improvement over previous models, they have improved at a much slower pace than other vehicle technologies.  The batteries continue to add substantial weight to the vehicles and are greatly limited in their capacity.  As mentioned earlier, the great weight of the batteries means a non-trivial amount of energy must be taken from all the batteries to transport the weight of the additional battery.

==Policy and Market in the Birth of HEVs==
Initially, HEVs served a niche market, appealing to the economically and environmentally conscious community.  As the technology has improved and HEVs have become more popular, the market has expanded.  Initially, HEVs were compact cars in order to be as fuel efficient as possible.  However, as HEVs have looked to expand and gain more of the market share from ICVs, manufacturers have begun developing larger HEV models.  One can now buy SUV hybrids, proving that the hybrid is no longer restricted its initial niche market.  EVs on the other hand, are limited in their range and require charging stations.  Although they pose some advantages of HEVs, their limitations cause them to primarily serve a niche market where electricity is cheap, readily available and distances are short.&lt;ref name=&quot;chan&quot;/&gt;  Drivers in this market must have a high value on reduced emissions and smaller need for driving long distances.  Additionally, EVs require extra infrastructure such as charging stations to be readily available.  In contrast, HEVs are able to capture some of the ICV market because they don't require additional infrastructure and have fewer limitations. 

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 was legislation during the oil crisis of the 1970s which contained new requirements aimed at improving fuel economy.  The act imposed new fuel efficiency standards on automakers, but allowed manufacturers 10 years to comply.  Similar policies such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would appear to be helpful in encouraging alternative vehicles.  By creating stricter fuel efficiency standards, new vehicle types may be able to capture a share of the market if gasoline cars cannot keep up.  Car manufacturers may decide to invest additional capital in alternative vehicles.  On the other hand, the policies require car manufacturers to improve the fuel economy of their ICVs or to stop producing them.  Demand for ICVs is not affected by the policies and therefore, manufacturers go ahead with improving the fuel efficiency.  This has the effect of reducing the net benefit which HEVs provide over ICVs.  With more efficient ICVs on the market, the fuel savings provided by HEVs is reduced.  It's possible that the cost of ICVs could rise as well if manufacturers passed on this additional cost.  However, policy such as CAFE causes a reduction in price for high efficiency vehicles as manufacturers encourage their sales to offset the low efficiency vehicles.  This further hurts the market for HEVs.

President Clinton took alternative approach to increasing fuel economy standards by agreeing to a deal with major American automakers to develop an 80mpg Supercar.  The program had some benefits but ultimately, didn't directly lead to the development of a domestic HEV due to the high cost of the Supercar materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;German&quot;/&gt;

==Growth and Maturity of HEVs==
As can been seen in the quantitative analysis below, hybrid electric vehicle sales in the US experienced a very rapid lifecycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond&quot;/&gt;  If we consider 1999 the birth of HEV sales in the US, maturity occurred just 8 years later.  The birthing years encompass roughly the first 4 years.  

Most government tax incentives occurred during the rapid grown between 2004 and 2007.  During this time, various tax deductions were available at a national and state level.  The monetary incentives, however, seem to have played little role in the growth of HEVs.  One possible explanation including that dealers may have factored these incentives into their prices, leaving the consumer with little or no net benefit.&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond&quot;/&gt;  More likely, was the influence of the economy, especially fuel prices.  The rise in fuel prices around the country between 2004 and 2008 likely played a significant role in the growth of HEVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond&quot;/&gt;  The decline of fuel prices between 2008 and 2009 and the recession correspond to the decline in HEV sales.  However, HEV sales continued to decline even as fuel prices steadily rose between 2010 and 2012.  Perhaps this suggests that HEVs matured in 2007?  Although fuel prices rose between 2009 and 2012, the American economy was still in recession, influencing sales of all vehicles.  Consumers that absolutely need a vehicle will continue to buy, but will be less likely to pay the additional upfront cost necessary to purchase a HEV.

The infrastructure for HEVs is certainly not going away.  Unlike past transportation modes which have seen rapid decline after their maturity, HEVs will likely experience slower decline after maturity.  This can be seen in the data since 2007.  Modes such as railroads, which saw their tracks being removed and highways built instead, experienced rapid decline.  As long as highways continue to be used and energy is of concern, HEVs will likely remain an alternative to the internal-combustion vehicle.  The most likely scenario to contribute to a more rapid decline of HEVs, would be improvements to electric vehicles or discovery of a new energy source.  Battery technology has seen little improvement in 100 years.  If that were to change, EVs may experience growth, leading to the further decline of HEVs.  In any case, the last 100 years are a pretty clear indication that the internal-combustion vehicle is not going away anytime soon.

====Analysis====

The following model was used to predict HEV sales

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]

where:

S(t) is the status measure, 
(HEV sales traveled)

t is time (years),

t0 is the inflection time (year in which 1/2 K is achieved),

K is saturation status level, b is a coefficient.  K and b are to be estimated

The regression equation derived is:

Y=LN(Sales/(K-Sales))

In completing the regression, a K value of 352863 was used.  This value represents the HEV market maturing in 2007.  Whether this is the case or not is difficult to determine.  Since 2007, HEV sales in the U.S. have been on the decline.  The recession certainly has been a factor in this.  What remains in question is whether HEV will begin to climb again and reach a higher peak, or whether 2007 will remain the peak.  Factors such as the economy and gas prices will certainly influence this.  Since no one can say with certainty where future gas prices will go, it's difficult to say with certainty that the HEV market has peaked.  If gas prices skyrocket, HEV sales will certainly increase, but their decline may also be sped up by a drop in fuel prices.  The trend now puts HEV sales on a slow, but steady decline.  This regression model assumes that 2007 was the peak of HEV sales in the U.S..  Alternative vehicles as a whole are still in the birthing phase.  If HEVs continue to decline, other alternative vehicles are likely to step up and experience growth.  Due to the relatively slow decline since 2007, however, HEVs may make a comeback.  Only time will tell.

The regression resulted in an R-squared value of 0.9708 and t-statistic of 19.125.  An R-squared value close to 1.0 and t-statistic as high as possible are desirable.  A b-value was estimated in order to achieve the most desirable fit, and therefore, the best R-squared and t-statistic values.  Analysis of the curve shows that the model originally underestimates sales, then overestimates during the growth period before tapering off in 2007 for the mature phase.  Unlike the real data, the model does not predict the decline after the peak in 2007.  Also, the t-naught value was chosen based on the 2007 peak and the slope between years 2004 and 2005.  T-naught represents half of the peak which occurs between '04 and '05.

Although HEV sales can be volatile due to the various influencing factors such as fuel prices, tax credits, regulations and the economy all changing, the data between birth in 1999 and maturity in 2007 represents a fairly consistent S-curve of transportation modes.  Since 2007, the decline has been somewhat different and HEVs may reach a higher peak in years to come which would greatly influence the model.  However, due to the nature of growth between 1999 and 2007, the model was able to generate a fairly good fit.  As data from future years comes out, the model will continue to be modified.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview of the Streetcar==
The streetcar is a mode of transportation which consists of cars, powered by overhead wires, running on rails.  A trolley pole is used to collect electrical current from the overhead wire to send through a control device to the streetcar's electric motor.  The motor of the streetcar is mounted directly above the vehicle's wheels.  Used current from the system is then routed back to generators to complete the circuit of the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

Although there were many attempts at building a streetcar, the first successful streetcar was built by Frank Sprague.  Sprague had previous associations with Thomas Edison and created other electrical inventions, such as the high-speed elevator.  Sprague eventually developed a superior electrical engine that was for the streetcar.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;  The first streetcars that Sprague sent into operation were in Richmond, Virginia in 1888.  The streetcars in Richmond were a great success and Sprague became inundated with orders from across the country.  Sprague's company, The Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company, could eventually no longer keep up with demand and was taken over by Edison General Electric Company in 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;  Other electric companies, such as the Thomson-Houston Company, were competing for the streetcar market as well; however, Thomas Lowry was impressed by Sprague's streetcars, and thus, they were the ones chosen to eventually operate in the Twin Cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

==Modes Prior to the Streetcar in the Twin Cities==

===The Horsecar===
The history of the streetcars in the Twin Cities dates back to 1866.  It was at this time that Parker Paine, John Merriam, Louis Robert, and A.H. Wilder, prominent businessmen in the area, decided to form a corporation and introduce horsecars to the streets of St. Paul.  The venture was initially delayed but was eventually implemented six years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  Minneapolis also initiated its horsecar ventures around the same time in 1867.  The mayor of Minneapolis gathered some of the city's wealthiest businessmen to start a horsecar company.  The company's initial tracks were laid on Second Street South, which is now Washington Avenue South.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

Following the initial formation of horsecar companies in the Twin Cities, the St. Paul Street Railway Company was founded on May 9, 1872.  The company initially laid two miles of track, and the first car began operation on July 15 of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  The St. Paul Street Railway Company had a rolling stock of six cars, fourteen drivers, and thirty horses.  The company was very popular, especially due to the horsecar's speed of six miles per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

The cars first used in the Twin Cities horsecars were initially very primitive.  Each car was about ten feet wide and weighed about 1,000 pounds.  Each horsecar could hold approximately fourteen passengers and was pulled by a single horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;  There were several horsecar lines, and each car was painted to represent that line that it traveled on.  The track and equipment used at the time were also very primitive, which resulted in horsecars often becoming derailed.  Passengers would then have to get out of the car and help the drive get the horsecar back onto the tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; 

The St. Paul Street Railway Company was operated by James Cochran, Jr. October 1878.  At this time, bondholders created a new company and the name was changed to St. Paul City Railway Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  James R. Walsh became general manager of the new company, until a group of businessmen, led by Thomas Lowry, took it over in 1886.  It was at this time at the systems in Minneapolis and St. Paul were merged and began operating under the new company title of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;

===The Motor Line===
It was clear that horses were not an ideal power source for transportation, so businesses experimented with placing a steam locomotive on the streets of Minneapolis.  The primary line that was experimented with for this mode was located near Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet.  The Motor Line stopped at all intersections along its route and operated until 10:15 P.M., when people were assumed to have gone home for the night.  An extension of the Motor Line was eventually built to Excelsior to reach the lucrative Lake Minnetonka market.  Additional Motor Line routes were constructed, however, by 1890 they ceased operation due to complaints regarding soot and noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;
 
===Cable Cars===
Since the topography of St. Paul possessed so many hills, it was difficult for horsecars to operate in certain areas.  Cable cars were thought to be a viable option in these hilly areas.  The first cable car was built in St. Paul in 1887.  Several other cable car routes were constructed over time; however, the system overextended itself and was very limited in speed.  Therefore, the cable car was eventually abandoned in order to focus time and resources on the streetcar.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;

==Early Streetcar Market==
In 1889, the Stillwater Street Railway was the first line to implement Sprague's electric streetcar in Minnesota.  The entire transit system in the Twin Cities, except for two cable lines, was converted to electric streetcars by 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

The electric streetcars were much heavier than the previous horsecars.  Therefore, the roads required repavement using a material that provided a firmer base.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  In addition to the cost of the road pavement, the Twin Cities Rapid Transit company was also required to standardize the gauges on the tracks.  The horsecars previously operated on narrow gauges; thus, a large investment in new infrastructure was required.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;

==Policies Affecting Streetcars in the Twin Cities==

One policy that largely affected the streetcars in the Twin Cities was a decrease in wages for the streetcar drivers.  In 1889, Thomas Lowry sent a notice to the streetcar driver's that he believed that the only way for the Twin Cities Rapid Transit Company to increase profits was by decreasing their salaries.  The men were very upset with the decrease in wages and eventually went on strike.  The strike did not last long, though, and after two weeks of partial service, the drivers went back to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

A second strike occurred in 1917, when the president of the Twin Cities Rapid Transit Company refused to negotiate with the streetcar employees or their union.  After much violence and destruction, the Commission of Public Safety demanded an end to the strike, and the workers followed the commission's orders.  The TCRT workers eventually went on strike again in November when the company threatened to dismiss any employee wearing union apparel or engaged in union activity.  This strike finally broke on December 2, 1917, and the union was defeated.  The end of this strike resulted in 800 workers losing their jobs, which were replaced by non-union employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;

==Growth of the Streetcar==
Passenger travel increased in the 1890s and larger cars were demanded on the streetcar lines.  As larger streetcars were installed, the infrastructure needed to be replaced to support the heavier cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

Between 1880s and the 1920s, the streetcars grew with development.  The first phase of development occurred in the Midway area between Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the Interurban Line was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  Another significant line, the Como-Harriet line, opened on July 1, 1898.  This was the second interurban line and was a large upgrade from the first.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  The Selby-Lake and the Snelling-Minnehaha were the other two interurban lines that were created.  Several suburban routes were developed over time to serve new populations that emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

===Development===
In addition to his position with the Twin Cities Rapid Transit Company, Thomas Lowry was also a developer.  Lowry's development interests in Minneapolis were what initially triggered his interest in the streetcar industry.  He planned to use the streetcars to spur development in areas that he owned real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;R9&quot; /&gt;  Two specific areas of interest for Lowry were St. Louis Park and Columbia Heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

===Amusement Parks===
One aspect that aided in the growth of the streetcar were amusement parks at the end of the lines.  One such amusement park was the Wildwood Amusement Park in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.  This was originally a rather crude amusement park, but it was eventually bought out by the Twin Cities Rapid Transit Company in 1898 so that they could improve the park and attract greater streetcar ridership.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;   Once the park was owned by the TCRT, the customers could pay one fare for both the streetcar and the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br&gt; 

The park had many popular amenities including amusement park rides, a beach, fishing, a picnic area, and a dance pavilion.  Thousands of visitors went to Wildwood Amusement Park each week for several decades.  As time passed, and with the rise of the automobile, attendance at the park diminished and the TCRT could no longer afford to keep the park open.  TCRT closed Wildwood Amusement Park in 1932 and eventually sold the land to developers.&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;

The TCRT also developed an amusement park in the western suburbs, near Excelsior, on Big Island.  This park contained amusement park rides, picnic facilities, and a band shelter.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;  Customers could also pay one fare for a streetcar ride to the park, admission to the park, and a steamboat ride from the dock to Big Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;  Beginning in 1907, Big Island Park began earning less revenue than the expense to operate the park.  This trend continued, and the park was eventually closed in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;

==Maturity==

Twin Cities Rapid Transit built its final tracks in 1932.  By this time, TCRT operated 530 miles of track, which extended from Stillwater on the east to Excelsior on the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

==Decline==

The streetcar was the most prominent form of transportation the Twin Cities until the rise of the automobile in the 1920s.  The Great Depression had both positive and negative effects on the streetcar system in the Twin Cities.  Due to the financial stress, streetcar ridership severely decreased and many of the lines were discontinued.  The Great Depression, as well as World War 2, positively impacted the streetcar system since they stalled suburban development and automobile usage.  Automobiles were either difficult to acquire or too expensive to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;  &lt;br&gt; 

Following the end of the war, ridership was maintained at significant levels.  The Twin Cities Rapid Transit company sought to further maintain these ridership levels and invested in modernized equipment.  Attempts to further the streetcar industry were eventually suppressed when outside investors took control of the company in November 1949.  Since streetcars were more expensive to operate than buses, these investors drastically substituted buses for the streetcars.  By 1954, the streetcars in the Twin Cities were gone.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

==Data and Analysis==
[[File:Historic Lifecycle of Twin Cities Streetcars.jpg|framed|center|Birth, growth, maturity, and decline of streetcars in the Twin Cities]]

===Lifecycle of the Twin Cities Streetcar System===
The lifecycle of the streetcar system in the Twin Cities follows the S-curve similar to many modes of transportation.  Ridership on the streetcars grew very gradually from 1881 to 1900.  Following 1900, however, ridership on the streetcars grew steadily from about 1900 to 1920.  Ridership on the Twin Cities' streetcars peaked in 1920 and never returned to those ridership levels again.  From 1920 to 1933, there was a steady decline in streetcar ridership, and by 1933, there were only 95,724,190 rides on the Twin Cities' streetcars.  This was during the time period that the automobile was becoming more popular and fewer people were reliant on the streetcar.  Buses began to replace the streetcars in 1922, which also significantly contributed to the decline in streetcar ridership.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;  Ridership increased again from 1933 to 1936 but then decreased from 1936 to 1940.  Due to the gas rationing during World War 2, ridership rose significantly again from 1940 to 1946.  Following the end of the war, streetcar ridership in the Twin Cities steadily declined until the rails were eventually removed through the entire system.

===Methodology===
A three-parameter logistic function was used to create two S-curves for the Twin Cities streetcar ridership data.  Each S-curve used the following equation:

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)] 

S(t) is the ridership, &lt;br&gt; 
t is time (in years), &lt;br&gt;
t0 is the inflection point (the year in which ridership reaches 1/2 K), &lt;br&gt;
K is saturation status level (the highest ridership achieved), &lt;br&gt;
b is a coefficient (the slope). &lt;br&gt;  
K and b had to be estimated. &lt;br&gt;
[[File:Statistics for the Twin Cities Streetcar Lifecycle Model.jpg|framed|right|The intercept, slope, R-squared and inflection point for the S-curves fit to the Twin Cities streetcar data]]
The first S-curve was calculated from 1881 to 1919 since the saturation status level was reached in 1920.  This S-curve represented the birth, growth, and maturity of the streetcar system in the Twin Cities.  The second S-curve was estimated for the remainder of the data from 1920 to 1954 and represented the decline of the streetcar system.

===Statistical Outcomes===
The S-curve for the birth, growth, and maturity of the streetcar ridership in the Twin Cities fit the data very well.  This is reflected by the r-squared value of 0.9817.  The S-curve for the decline in streetcar ridership, however, did not fit the data very well.  This is likely because the decline in ridership experienced several shocks to the system, such as the Great Depression and World War 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{merge|Transportation Deployment Casebook/Bay Area Rapid Transit System|same topic and audience}} 

As a rapid transit system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) has served the San Francisco Bay Area for 40 years from its beginning operation at September 11, 1972. Cities of San Francisco are highly connected by the heavy-rail public transit subway system form East bay and suburbs in northern San Mateo County.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; In those four decades BART has carried more than 2.7 billion people around the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt; In this case, the life cycle of ridership of BART between 1973 and 2012 is analyzed, and future trend is estimated. Then the birth of the system is studied, especially focus on the market and policies at the beginning operation. After that, the growing phase is discussed and a hypothesis on its future development is provided.

==Life cycle modeling==
The annual ridership data of BART is obtained from the official report of Bay Area.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt; The data is used for descript the S-Curve and estimating the birthing, growth and maturity of the system. In the dataset, the annual ridership of BART from the first year operation (1973) to the present year (2012) is extracted. It is described below in Table 1 and Figure 1:



Then the data is used to estimate a three-parameter logistic function as follow:

S(t) = K/(1+exp(-b(t-t0))                     (1)

In this equation, S(t) is the status measure, t is time (in years), t0 is the inflection time (year in which 1/2 K is achieved), K is saturation status level, b is a coefficient (K and b are to be estimated). In this case, S(t) is the annual ridership of BART(short for R(t)). 

Then we change the equation as follows:

exp(t-t0)=  (R(t))/(K-R(t))                   (2) 

And

Y=Ln ((R(t))/(K-R(t)))=bt-bt0                 (3)

Form the equation 3, single liner regression is used to study the relationship between the annual ridership and the year. The independent variable of the function is fiscal year and the dependent variable is the natural log of annual ridership (R(t)) over the value of saturation ridership (K) minus annual ridership. However, the K value should be estimated first. Different K value based on the growing trend of annual ridership should be tested in order to get the best regression. In the K value test, I choose 15 K values for regression, from 111,000,000 to 170,000,000 (the interval of first 10 values is 1,000,000, and of the last 5 values is 10,000000), and part of the regression summary is as table 2.

[[File:K and r square.PNG|thumb|center|500px|Table 2 Summery of regression of estimated K]]

To get a better regression result, the values of R-square and t-stat are important. For the value of R-square, it is better to close to 1 and for the value of t-stat, the greater the better. The following chart gives us a clear view of the fluctuation of R-square and t-stat basing on different K. 

[[File:K and r square draft.PNG|thumb|center|500px|Figure 2 Fluctuation of R-square and t-stat]]

From the table 2 and figure 2, it is clear to find out that the optimal regression result could be get when K value is 116,000,000, which means the saturation annual ridership of BART is 116,000,000, as estimated. 

Hence, when K=116,000,000, 
The regression result is as follows:

[[File:Regression result.PNG|thumb|center|500px|Best regression result]]

From the regression result, we can get b=0.101. According to the equation 3, -bt0 =-201.238, so we get t0=int [(-201.240)/(-b)] =1988, which means half of annual ridership of saturation is reached in the year of 1988. Then we put the estimated K, b and t0 to the equation 1, we get the new function as follow: 

R(t)=  116000000/(1+exp(-0.101(t-1988))       (4)

According to function 4, the predicted ridership is obtained as Figure 3.

[[File:Final graph.PNG|thumb|center|500px|Regression Model]]

From the Figure 3, we can see the ridership of BART birth in 1973 and reach the inflection time in 1988, and will reach the peak in several decades. At the birth stage of BART, there is a difference between the real ridership and the predicted, partly because that BART was so popular at the beginning. Large demand of travel and current advanced technology contributed the early popularity of BART. While, during the operation, problems of BART emerges and policy changes gradually to cope with the market. At the present day, the BART system approaches maturity. Through the scope for innovation and revolution is small, BART still seeks opportunities to improve itself by adopting proper policy continually.

==Prior to BART==
In the mid-1950s, nearly 20 years before the birth of BART, there are two independent public agencies providing mass transportation service within San Francisco metropolitan area. One is the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (short for AC Transit), which was created in 1956. Operating a connected bus service, the AC Transit has been providing local, express, intercity and transBay service for more than a decade. The other public agency is the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which was created in 1957 and based on fixed rail technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt; Both of them became the major transit providers later and their impact lasts several decades till the present day. 

Long before the birth of BART, ferry transit has played a significant role in San Francisco Bay for almost 120 years. Began in 1850, the ferry service established its routes between San Francisco and the Oakland Estuary. It reached its peak in the 1930s and became the second busiest transportation terminals in the world. Every year, there are nearly sixty million people and six million vehicles crossed the bay. For a single day, 250,000 persons travelled through the Perry Building to work or other destinations, and 170 landings by ferry.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; The success of the ferry transit largely owned to the highly connected bus and rail feeder service.

Actually, the ferry transit, together with the bus and rail service, built a transit system during the first decades of 20th century, called a “Key System”. It was built by a privately-owned mass transit company that operated electric railcars, streetcars and ferries which linked ten East Bay cities and San Francisco. The horse-drawn carriages and steam trains as ways to travel between cities in the area was quickly replaced since the system beginning in 1903. It connected to San Francisco by a train line across the Bay Bridge, and a ferry pier that stretched 16,000 feet over the water. The Key System played a significant role on the city sprawl of Bay area. Travel was limited before the emergence of the system, because cars and horses were needed for the town-to-town travel, which few people could afford. Key System filled in the gap and became popular and achieved great success by 1930s. However, the service level of the system went down since late 1940s because of the financial problem, which resulted in largely lost of ridership. Some section of the rail line could only run five to ten miles an hour because of the aging track. Finally, the Alameda and Contra Costa counties took over the system in 1958, which accelerated the foundation of AC Transit.&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;

==The birth of BART==
Although began to operate in 1972, the implementation of BART had its start in the 1940s, for Bay Area business leaders were becoming concerned with urban sprawl and lack of central business activity that came with the suburban migration. Decentralization moved fast after the Second World War, hence jobs were never concentrated in the city center. Planners of BART faced the challenge of making urban cores stronger while fostering development outside the city center and along the rail lines. BART aimed to bring peak-hour commuters from their suburban homes to their downtown offices, give an alternative to automobile drivers, and most importantly, be financially viable. In addition, because of the growing and sprawling population, traffic congestion was also a main problem that developers of BART attempted to cope with. 
===Invention of the technology===
Borrowed the operation and management experience from the Key System, BART aimed to build a highly connected system covering the Bay Area (although it was largely achieved by late 20th century). AC Transit provided bus service, including transbay service, in the East Bay counties of BART operation. In San Francisco, the MUNI system (San Francisco Municipal Railway) operates street-cars, trolleys, and bus throughout the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt; Moreover, the common railroad format and construction know-how was used in the implement of the BART. For financial concern, some funding was secured in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; Modern high-tech was also going to be tested on the new system. Combining all the advantages, BART system was ready to take over the market which originally belonged to the Key System.  
===Early Market===
At the beginning operation, the Concord line crossing the Bay to San Francisco had the highest mode shift of the BART system. This is mainly because of the high corridor volumes and the difficulty of parking at central city travel destinations. It seems that people who cared about travel time, cost and location of origins and destinations would have a trend to choose BART system. A survey study in 1978, five years after the operation of BART, shows that there is a large proportion of BART riders between eighteen and thirty-four. According to the age distribution, further step of survey shows that the two major groups who used the BART frequently were downtown employees and college students.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt; For the downtown employees, the reasons for them to choose BART were because of the congestion along the corridor which made their arrival time uncertain and the difficulty on parking in downtown area. BART also offered an alternating transit mode for college students who could not get better served by the campus commuter. While, for the older people who always made short trip, they preferred to choose the traditional transportation mode, like auto or bus, for travel. Hence, this could explain the steady growth of the ridership at the early time of the operation of BART.

===Major constrain===
BART had not met all the objectives expressed by local offices, community and business organizations in the five years operation. For example, trains on each line run on twelve minute headways rather than the six minute headways originally planned, and only three of four planned lines are now in operation. Moreover, night service has only operated since 1976, Saturday service only begin in Nov. 1977 and Sunday service is not expected until spring 1978 at the earliest.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; 

Four areas of constraint on BART were summarized as characteristics of unreliability and inconvenience, hours of system operation, fare policy and service priorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt; For the first constrain, BART failed to provide a reliable time schedule for the passengers at the early time, which brought the problem to those who relied on BART system for commuting. Moreover, the frequency of the feeder connection was low and uncertain. Those problems together indirectly increased the travel time by extending the delay, waiting time and transfer, and also made the arrival time uncertain. For the second constrain, BART could not provide the night and weekend service at the early time. This constrain made BART lost the ridership of the most of car owners who likely to travel during the night and weekend. Their travel pattern might change if BART offered the operation time they demand (it is proved later). For the third constrain, the fare of the BART made the system noncompetitive compared with other mode. For instance, it is much cost-effective for individual interest to drive a car with two to three passengers than taking BART.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt; The off-peak and group discount is not satisfying. For the last constrain, fairness issue rose because of the inequity in station sitting and hours of operation. Some minority and blue collar employees could not be well served or even not be served by the BART system.

===Early policy impact===
At the early time of the BART system, transportation scholars could find only small impact of the BART on public policy. For the Bay Area public officials, they just took few policy actions because of BART, which was not expected before the operation. However, within the few action, most of were intended to protect against, rather than take advantage of BART.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; One of the reasons should be the variety of local government and transportation agency. The operation of BART covered nearly all the Bay Area, but each local government made its own policy on BART. For other public organizations of the Bay Area, they intended to use the existing government policy decision making processes. Briefly speaking, the government seemed to cope with the need of the BART system, rather than creating new policies. Hence little policy impact was gained during the early operation of BART, largely because of the lack of central organization for decision making.

However, BART still had some significant impacts on the land use policy and transit finance policy at the early time. According to the final report of BART Impact Program (Apr.1979), many planning studies, zoning changes, and incentives and public improvement projects were initiated because of the BART program. The BART operation led to the zoning change near the lines and stations in some cities. For example, Mission and Rockridge community groups supported lower density development than was projected and succeeded in reducing zoning in the station area. And for San Francisco, zoning allowances were increased in order to encourage development near BART.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; For finance policy, new form of investment policy was initiated because BART needed permanent public fund for its operation. This urged the state legislature took measures on two things: first, authorizing additional funds for BART, and second, giving the MTC increased authority for monitoring the use of this fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; 

The BART operation, like many transpiration experience, formed the policy making, and inversely, policy on BART would also reshaped its operation experience. The interaction of the policy making and BART operation experience at the early time is important. It could form the operation and development pattern for the future. As we see, the early constrain of BART development seek policy solution for better decision making environment, which means a central policy making group with coordinated strategy. On the contrary, policy on BART somehow was going to led BART on the way of transit-oriented development, which has a far-reaching influence even till the present day.

==Steady growth of BART==
During the development of the operation, BART tried to make effort on attracting ridership. The effort is separated into two ways: one is to improve the serving level, and the other is to follow the step of the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). 
===Service level improvement===
At the early time, unfixed schedule, non-service at late night and weekend made the group of people who had an alternating travel mode be away from taking BART. Although BART had its own consideration that off-peak service might not cost-effective for the system operation and the existing ridership was satisfying somehow, it could not work as a regional transit system that accepted by the majority of people. BART recognized the problem and made improvement step by step. Policies were made base on the problems rise. At the beginning, the white collar group felt disappointed about the delay and the uncertain transfer and tired to shift the travel mode back to private cars or other regular transit bus. Five years later, the policy on BART helped achieve the goal of fixing schedule and headways with fundamental priority to peak-hour commuting availability. This improvement benefited the people who had the fixed and regular travel demand on peak hours (especially the employees and students). Since BART ensured their concerns (delay, uncertain of headway and transfer), not only the original group back to BART, BART also attracted infrequent travel with a reliable time arrangement. This fast growth of ridership from the 1980s partly reflects the policy impact. Besides, the goal of late night and weekends service is achieved gradually based on the people’s travel demand. And for long trips, policy on the fare structure made the BART more competitive than other transit mode, which benefits those who care about the cost-efficiency of long travel. Aiming at be adjust to the market, improvement on BART are made step by step. It tried to provide a rapid, convenient and comfortable service to passengers by changing its policies, and the public response is reflected by its fast ridership growth.
===Trend of TOD===
Although BART is just a transit line operated in the Bay Area, it tends to follow the way of transit-oriented development. According to the California Department of Transportation, “Transit-Oriented 	Development (TOD) is moderate to higher-density development, located within easy walk of major transit stop, generating with a mix of residential, employment and shopping opportunities for pedestrians without excluding the auto”.&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt; The reasons that people choose a transit mode are various, but mostly based on the convenient, cost-effective and high service level. If a transit system cannot cover all the three standards, it will not build a large operation scales. By the end of 20th century, BART has achieved the last two standards and tried to build a whole transit system that covered the whole Bay Area and accepted by majority of the people. However, as we know, transit system cannot force people to use, but attract and lead people to use. BART knows what people want, and its Board of Directors adopted a Transit-Oriented Development Policy in July 2005. Two key recommendations underpinned the adoption of the new policy are as follows: the first one is to pursue Transit-Oriented Development, not Joint Development. BART should work proactively with cities to plan for development over a larger area around its stations that is both supportive of transit service and maximizes the value of the land. The second is to shift Access Approach. Developers, cities and funding agencies view BART’s application of a 1:1 parking replacement practice as a significant barrier to joint development and TOD. Refining this replacement practice and developing alternative implementation approaches will enhance development opportunities.&lt;ref name=&quot;R9&quot; /&gt; Increasing ridership is the prior reason for the transit-oriented development, but it may not everything. BART also wants to create physical connection with the communities and provide service to passengers of various travel demand. Accessibility is important. Ridership grows as more and more TOD projects completed. The station area is not a single station anymore, and it becomes the central place where living and working areas around. The mix-use land for housing, working and retail together with the pedestrian friendly transit stations benefit people living around. BART seems to shape or shift people’ s choice of travel mode by providing adaptive, reliable and accessible service that attract more and more ridership during the system growth.

==Current BART and the future==
Now BART has become a mature transit system with high-technology support in Bay Area. It operates five lines on 104 miles (167&amp;nbsp;km) of track with 44 stations in four counties. With an average weekday ridership of 379,300 passengers, and 309,420 weekend day passengers, BART is the fifth-busiest heavy rail rapid transit system in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; High technology also contributes the success of the transit system. For instance, the automated fare collection system was first used on BART. It helps save the time and make the ticket process much easier. Computerized train control was also first used on the BART operation and it proved work pretty well. This technology eliminates much uncertain during the operation and enhances the safety and accuracy. Other passenger friendly technological improvements are achieved by BART. For example, BART is the first transit system in the US to offer cellular telephone communication to passengers of all major wireless carriers on its trains underground, and it also offers service of “Library-a-Go-Go ”vending machines that give out books.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt; With those technologies, market opens for those who need them. 

According to the estimated life cycle of BART ridership, it will reach the peak in a few years. When the ridership comes to the mature stage, it might only grow steadily with the population growth. Besides, BART system nearly occupied all the new transit technology that has less scope to improve much. However, it does not mean that BART is going to wane in a few years. It is still looking for opportunities to expand its system. Not long ago, BART has adopted a System Expansion Policy, and plan to sprawl in several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt; However, we cannot estimate the accurate ridership or impact of BART in the future. But, basically, it will not make a remarkable achievement as several decades ago.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
== Introduction ==
Before Wyoming became a series of borders within the map of the United States, the land was part of a large expanse known as the great plains. This land was inhabited and traversed by many native tribes before the appearance of European settlers. To assume that all the tribes were the same is a mistake as each tribe had their own culture, rituals, and understanding of nature and life. Some evidence of very old tribes remains in rudimentary cave drawings found in various locations across the state.

== Native Wyoming Prior To European Contact ==
=== Early Migration ===
The first people to settle in North America came from Asia by way of the Bearing Strait around twenty-thousand years ago.  Archaeological findings date back to eleven thousand years ago for evidence of human inhabitation in the Wyoming area.  The Native Americans of Wyoming were nomadic people and moved to where food sources were available, living as hunters and gatherers. By the time the first European settlers came to the area there were around thirteen different tribes such as the Arapaho, Arikara, Bannock, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Crow, Gros Ventre, Kiowa, Nez Perce, Sheep Eater, Sioux, Shoshone, and Ute.  Some of the tribes were in conflict over resources, therefore establishing different groups and alliances. 

[[File:MedicineWheel.jpg|thumbnail|Medicine Wheel]] 
Archaeologists have discovered the Medicine Wheel in Wyoming which was built as a shrine by the Native Americans and gives us an insight into their religious practices. From these findings we can conclude that the tribes were well established and had formed societies complete with chiefs, warriors, and religion before the &quot;white men&quot; arrived.

The first large tribe to make their way into the area of Wyoming was the Shoshone tribe, who entered before the 18th century.  Coming from what is now Nevada, it was not until the 1800s that their vast war power was diminished enough for the tribe to be pushed back into the western part of Wyoming (as well as eastern Idaho and southern Montana ). Following the Shoshone, coming from the north-east, were the Arapaho, Crow, and Cheyenne in the 1700s.  The final addition to the Wyoming Native Americans was the Lakota Sioux; another vast warrior population, this group allied with both the Arapaho and Cheyenne.

=== The Cheyenne Tribe ===

The Cheyenne were a nomadic group who moved frequently in pursuit of buffalo. These sudden shifts in location allowed the Cheyenne tribe to view the entire land as a home, which provided food and shelter. The buffalo were their primary source of survival and were used not only as a source of food, but for clothing, shelter and trade. This lifestyle was not easy as the tribe would travel for miles, tracking down the buffalo. Once they had found them, there was a true danger and difficulty in killing them. The Cheyenne people used the lay of the land to their advantage in the hunt.  The men would drive the buffalo into a pen made under a bank or a bluff to trap them and then shoot them with their arrows once they had been corralled. Once the killing was done the women had to work fast as the stark heat in the open expanse of land quickly spoiled the meat. As soon as the Buffalo had been butchered, the meat was either dried as jerky or cooked in pots and the hides stretched on pegs to be preserved by the sun. Each part of the buffalo was used and valued. The great plains land also provided other sources of food for the tribe as they travelled. The women would go out to gather wild berries and forage in the ground for root vegetables. The roots were eaten, but were also sold and used for trade. In this way the prairies provided for the tribe.Furthermore the tribe respected the natural elements that sustained their lives. 

Among the historical accounts made by white European men there have been conflicting representations of the stability of the political nature of these tribes, with particular reference to the Cheyenne.  With such varying reports - and it is important to note that these are white reports - it becomes more prudent to focus upon what is fact. As with many large Native tribes, the Cheyenne was broken up into bands.  Since the Cheyenne were a matriarchal society a child became part of the band their mother was living in at the time of their birth. It was not uncommon for a child to belong to a different band than their mother. With relation to marriage, a Cheyenne was not allowed to marry within their own band, and once married, the husband would come to join the bride's band.

=== Establishing Trade ===  
While most tribes functioned prominently as hunter-gatherer societies, Native Americans of the Great Plains were also craftsmen and artisans.  The articles produced were for daily use and also for religious practices. As previously stated, the buffalo herds were bountiful in the Wyoming region before the arrival of European settlers. Buffalo represented a great resource to the Native Americans because they were used as a source for food, clothing and shelter.  With the arrival of European settlers, trading became an essential aspect of life for the Native Americans, and trading routes gave way for other settlers to discover America.  Some of the Native Americans became guides for traders and trading with other European settlers became a very important element in the Indian way of life.  Beaver pelts and buffalo hides were the main products that were traded in exchange for horses, weapons and other articles that would be of benefit to the Native Americans.  Because the beaver and buffalo products were in high demand across Europe the animal resources in Wyoming and across North America became exploited and came close to extinction. [[File:The Last of the Buffalo.jpg|thumb|right|The Last of the Buffalo]]Since the trading of animal hides declined, other resources such as mineral resources found on the land invited more white European men to come and settle the area thus encroaching on the land of the Native Americans.

After the Civil War ended in the United States, the Great Plains experienced a great migration of people coming to settle Native American lands.  This led to incidents of violence becoming more prominent on the Great Plains, where Native Americans would attack travelers and steal their possessions.  As many more settlers arrived in the Great Plains, the violence started to escalate between the white men and the Natives. As a result of these conflicts the government of the United States decided to call the tribes’ chiefs in to meet as a council and agree to the terms of a peace treaty.  One of these treaties was held at Fort Laramie in September 1851. During this particular treaty the Native Americans promised to end the violence against the white men, accepted the government of the United States and allowed for territories to be drawn up in exchange for the government’s protection and $50,000 in goods for fifty years.  The United States government did not comply with the agreed upon conditions of the Fort Laramie treaty and many other treaties and eventually rounded up the Indians who had survived and placed them onto reservations.

== American Expansion Into The West ==
In the centuries following the European discovery of North America, European influence as far west as Wyoming was dominated by the French. They maintained the best relations with Natives, and had ventured the farthest west in search of trade. Following the conclusion of its conquest of New France in 1763, Britain attempted to limit westward expansion by promoting an Indian buffer-zone west of the American colonies. When trading companies still began to move west, Britain promoted French-Canadian voyageurs over their American counterparts, and forbade Americans “the fruits of their success in the Ohio Valley.” These traders’ presence in Wyoming remained limited for decades, for despite the American Revolution, Spanish authority over the Louisiana territory restricted American influence. It was only following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 that Americans gained access to Wyoming. Although large-scale settlement would not occur until later in the century, the American presence in Wyoming following the Louisiana Purchase was significantly unlike that of earlier French or English influences in the area.

=== Wyoming after the Louisiana Purchase === 
[[File:Frank bond 1912 louisiana and the louisiana purchase.jpg|thumbnail|Map of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase]]
The Louisiana Purchase gave Americans unrestricted access to the west, which meant for a much stronger influence over Wyoming than the European fur-trade ever had. It also had allowed Americans to explore out towards the west where despite their trials and tribulations that would result from the elements, animals, the Sioux chiefs and other vigilantes many Americans undertook this harrowing journey. The 1803 “treaty with France did not contain any [definite] boundaries for Louisiana,” and this led to several expeditions to map out the West.  In 1807, John Colter left the Lewis-Clarke Expedition to help found a jumping-off for the fur trade in Wyoming. From there he became the first American to “bring back account[s] of the Yellowstone Park Area.”  Settlement would not occur for decades, and Wyoming country’s main significance remained as a route connecting the East to the West, especially following the discovery of South Pass and Oregon Trail, which were routes through the Rockies. Wyoming's lack of development during this period is demonstrated by accounts of lone caravans traveling across the Laramie River in 1834 just to rendezvous for the fur-trade.

The first Americans saw ‘wild’ bands of Shoshonis, Crows, Cheyenne, and Arapahos. The 1830s brought the final Indian migration into the area, when in 1834 American trader Robert Campbell invited the Sioux to move into the vicinity of Fort Laramie;   this shows that Americans had already claimed political authority over the region. Tension and violence began to emerge in the 1840s as more Americans began making the trip across the Rockies, and rogue Sioux began attacking them. Sioux chiefs explained that they had no control over their younger warriors – a common excuse for violence heard over the next 30 years. These tensions led to a peace council commissioned by the US government and involving over 10,000 Indians on the 1st of September, 1851. High Plains Indians agreed to some fixed boundaries and would allow Americans to build roads.  Despite the peace treaty however, violent skirmishes frequently erupted. These were often due to military officers attempting to arrest local Indians for perceived injustices, which then escalated into bloodier conflicts. This periodic violence would gradually culminate into widespread Indian resistance to US encroachment.  This resistance is shown by one particular instance in 1864, when thousands of Sioux grouped together to block further caravan travel over the Plains.

=== Horse Creek Conference ===	
[[File:Photograph of General William T. Sherman and Commissioners in Council with Indian Chiefs at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, ca. 1 - NARA - 531079.jpg|thumb|left|A Meeting for a Later Treaty (Fort Laramie 1868)]]Throughout the 1800s the fur trade and western migration began to bring more whites into &quot;Wyoming&quot;, leading to growing hostilities as contact between the whites and natives grew more frequent. Forts and roads began to pass through the area and, in 1851, one of the first obvious moves of white control came in what is known as the &quot;Horse Creek Conference&quot;.  A government-funded conference, co-commissioned by David Mitchell and Thomas Fitzpatrick, the goal of the conference was to create defined 'property' lines for each tribe within the 'Wyoming' area. From the beginning, the conference, set to start on the first of September at Fort Laramie, was plagued with problems. A severe lack of buffalo and no wagon train meant that food at the treaty council would be in short supply for both the natives and the United States representatives. The Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes had refused to come, while the uninvited Shoshone tribe came in great numbers. While en route, the Cheyenne had attacked and scalped two Shoshone warriors, adding to the already hostile relationship that the two tribes shared. Fitzpatrick and Mitchell also feared that the 300 men stationed at Fort Laramie would not intimidate the natives and would be unable to defend the un-walled fort on the open plain if it were to come under attack. These many difficulties caused - among other things - a change of location (30 miles east, at the mouth of Horse Creek on the North Platte River) and a seven day delay.

It was decided that the Platte’s north bank was to be designated for tribal encampments and Horse Creek’s west side to the traders and interpreters. The east side of Horse Creek was then established as the meeting grounds. After smoking from the peace pipe, Commissioner Mitchell informed the council that the government “do not come to you as traders,” and “do not want your land, horses, robes, nor anything you have, but have come to advise with you, and to make a treaty with you for your own good.” After much deliberation over the designated tribal territories, twenty-one chiefs representing the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow, Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara and Assiniboine signed the Horse Creek Treaty on September 17th. Each tribe was meant to select a chief and a couple of tribal men that the government would recognize, and in return the government would give each tribe 50 000 dollars in goods for fifty years, a time frame they changed to ten years after the original contract was signed. As an example of white control over the conference (and by extension the natives) not only were all the boundary lines created with no input from the people from which they would be enforced upon, but when the Sioux had yet to select a single chief, claiming it went against their politics, Mitchell selected one for them. Although the boundary lines were not reservations and, according to Mitchell, were &quot;not intended to take any of [the Natives] lands away or to destroy [their] rights to hunt, or fish, or pass over the country”,this was inevitably the beginning of the white man's control over the lives of these Natives and it would not be long before further freedom was lost. Many more disputes were created later, not only over land, but over the white men not relinquishing the money and gifts that they had promised.

== Fort Laramie ==
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Fort Laramie - Walters 37194049.jpg|thumb|left|Alfred Jacob Miller - Fort Laramie]]
William Sublette and Robert Campbell established Wyoming’s first trade post, Fort William, in 1834 at the bottom of the Laramie River and the North Platte Rivers. Fort William spanned over 800 miles and became crucial as it was strategically placed geographically, serving as a vast port during the buffalo and fur trade to the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains. In 1836 Fort William was sold to an American fur company and subsequently sold in 1849 to the military, which became the Fort Laramie. During its tenure as a military headquarters many people migrated to Fort Laramie causing tensions with Indian Groups to increase. After many years of coinciding with each other, friction between these two parties resulted in the Grattan Massacre. 
[[File:Old Fort Laramie - NARA - 294441.tiff|thumb|right|&quot;Old Fort Laramie.&quot;]]
In 1854 a group of soldiers invaded a large Sioux colony with the intention of arresting a man accused of taking a local cow. After attempted negotiations with the soldiers, Sioux Chief Conquering Bear refused to complete such requests. During a stalemate due to the lack of Indian Agent, a soldier shot Chief Conquering Bear instigating the Lakota and Sioux to retaliate. This invasion was a violation of the Laramie Treaty of 1851, which states any matters in regards to the detainment of a Sioux must involve the local Indian agent on behalf of the United States government.  Among other soldiers, the battle resulted in the death of Lieutenant John Grattan, dubbing it the “Grattan Massacre”. The following September, Lieutenant William Harney organized a fleet of combatants to seek out revenge on the Sioux and Lakota people, resulting in the Battle of Ash Hollow. The Grattan Massacre amplified tensions between the military and the Great Plains Indians. This incident, among others, caused warfare in the Great Plains. 

A path along the Powder River was created in 1863 by John Bozeman, acting as the most direct route for workers with the prospect of gold. In 1864, due to the massacre of 150 women and children, the Lakota and Arapaho tribes were forced to migrate. The outraged tribe members attacked white settlements along the Powder River in repent for what had been taken from them, eventually creating camps.  In 1866 a treaty agreement was called at Fort Laramie in order to secure the safe passage of travellers through the Bozeman Trail, however also gave the U.S. military 700 troops along the Powder River. Insulted, leader of the Lakota tribe Red Cloud declined this treaty beginning a series of attacks known as Red Cloud’s War. The Council’s attempts to bring peace were finally acknowledged in 1868 when the final Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed. The Treaty surrendered Fort Laramie to the military, however it granted the Lakota tribe the Black Hills in order to guarantee the well being of the people.

== The South Pass ==
====Overview====
[[File:South pass marker2.jpg|thumb|right|Markers were situated along the South Pass differentiating the varying paths running through it. This boulder located at the summit of the Pass distinguishes the famous Oregon Trail.]]
Located along the Continental Divide in Wyoming, the South Pass was absolutely crucial in American history as it created a manageable pathway for settlers and emigrants to travel west. Without its existence, the Northern Pacific of the US would have most likely fallen under control of the British permanently. Not only that, but the southern regions of the country would have similarly remained a part of Mexico. Without the South Pass it is hard to imagine the United States in its present manifestation and ultimately might never have risen as the superpower it has become.
==== Search For An Alternative Route West ====
If the United States were to be successful in their expansion west of the Mississippi, a route expediting the tasking journey through the Rocky and Bitterroot Mountains was absolutely imperative. During the early 19th century the only option in moving west was to traverse these mountains directly. This daunting journey nearly ruined the famous expedition of Lewis and Clark. Having run from 1804-1806, Lewis and Clark were forced through the elements, fighting both starvation and the extreme cold. It was clear that a new passage was needed if the US was going to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
==== Discovery Of The South Pass ====
In 1812, a group of seven men led by Robert Stuart traveled through the South Pass. This represented the first time it had been crossed by those of European descent. The South Pass is a gap between the Central and Southern Rocky Mountains running through the Continental Divide of Wyoming. Stuart and his men used local native knowledge of the Pass to successfully discover and navigate through it. The Pass had been used by local aboriginal groups for millennia prior, but was completely unknown to settlers before 1812. These astorians finished their campaign through the south of the Sweetwater valley, a route that would eventually become the Oregon Trail. Despite Stuart's discovery, the South Pass didn't become widely known and many fur traders continued heading west by way of northern routes.
==== Rise To Prominence ====
In 1832, as the Pass was still relatively unknown, Captain Benjamin Bonneville lead the first group to take wagons over the Continental Divide. Following this, in 1836, Marcus Whitman and a number of fellow missionaries, including his wife, traveled across the South Pass, marking the first time a white woman had ever crossed the divide. Within only a few years the South Pass transformed into a emigration highway as it became integrated through a number of prominent trails, most notably the Oregon Trail. The Oregon Trail was the primary route in travelling between Missouri and Oregon and became very important during the Civil War. The South Pass continued to develop as time passed, becoming an essential route for freight and stage coaches as well. Both the famous Pony Express, delivering mail from Missouri to California, and the transcontinental telegraph line utilized the South Pass. During its peak, from 1841-1869, it is recorded that between 350,000 and 500,000 emigrants passed through the South Pass. Also, the discovery of gold in the South Pass created a temporary boom in the surrounding area mining as much as $15,000 worth of gold in a period of two years. However, the mines were exhausted within only a few years and South Pass City quickly followed suit.

== Red Cloud's War ==
	
==== Overview ====

Red Cloud’s War, or the Bozeman War, was a violent conflict that occurred in northern Wyoming from 1866 to 1868. The war occurred between a coalition of native Sioux peoples and the United States government.  The allied Sioux forces of the Northern Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho, and Oglala Lakota peoples initiated hostilities when, during peaceful negotiations with the American government, the US army sent 700 soldiers under Colonel Henry B. Carrington into native territories inside the Powder River Basin. This betrayal of trust offended many in the coalition, who mobilized warriors to punish the offenders.  After a crushing military defeat, the United States government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty, ceding the entire northeastern section of Wyoming to the Sioux. 

==== Background ====

[[File:JohnBozeman.JPG|thumb|right|John Bozeman, blazer of the Bozeman Trail that would spark Red Cloud's War]]In 1863, a pioneer by the name of John Bozeman blazed the Bozeman Trail to connect the well-established Oregon Trail to the gold rush occurring in Montana. Although the most direct route, the trail cut through Arapaho and Lakota hunting grounds. The intrusion aggravated the tribes. The first waves of whites through the trail in 1864 provoked harassment from the American Indians.  To crush the native resistance, Colonel John M. Chivington was sent into the region with Colorado volunteer troops that same year. As Chivington and the volunteer troops made their way across the Bozeman trail, 150 peaceful Cheyennes and Arapahos were massacred near Sandy Creek, Colorado. Incensed by this brutality, small conflicts erupted across the Bozeman trail. In an effort to negotiate passage for settlers and prospectors along the Bozeman Trail, the U.S. Interior Department assembled thousands of Oglala Lakota and Brule at Fort Laramie in 1866.  Simultaneously, the U.S. War Department sent Colonel Carrington’s men down the Bozeman Trail to construct a series of forts along it. This outraged Red Cloud, an Oglala Lakota leader, who took his people and allies to war against the intruders.

==== The Conflict ====

Red Cloud and his men ruthlessly attacked travelers along the Bozemen Trail. The northernmost forts of Phil Kearny and Smith were harassed, with lumber gatherers and livestock being frequent victims.  On December 21, 1866, a captain under Carrington, William J. Fetterman, was sent out of Fort Kearny with 80 men to aid an assaulted supply caravan.  Despite orders to the contrary, Fetterman pursued Lakota decoys into an ambush that resulted in the total slaughter of him and his men.  After the massacre, Carrington was relieved of his command by President Grant. 
The following year was marked by small, indecisive skirmishes such as the August 2nd Wagon Box Fight.  In 1868, Red Cloud and his coalition began negotiations with the US government at Fort Laramie. The Treaty of Fort Laramie was a resounding victory for the native peoples, securing the entire northeastern section of Wyoming as their undisputed territory.  The Forts of Kearny and Smith were razed by the coalition after the American forces retreated outside the new borders.

==== Conclusions ====

Red Cloud’s War is a concrete example of the American Indians’ oft-ignored agency. In response to egregious infringements on their territory, Sioux peoples mounted an extremely effective retaliation. Delivering to the US their most serious military defeat until Little Big Horn a decade later, the coalition brought the government to bargain, securing favourable terms.

=== Remembrance ===
----
The land was viewed as a living entity that met the fundamental needs of the people and was not an object to be possessed or divided. The tribes did, at times, wage war with one another but it was never because of land disputes. Land was not defined by boundaries until the migration of white settlers to the great plains. It was at this time that the land became politically defined. Modern day Wyoming, with its borders and boundaries, came into existence and little by little the native tribes saw what was once a free expanse of land, divided, sold and made inaccessible to them. The migration patterns of the buffalo were changed by the white settlements, and numerous tribes were forced onto reservations, but the descendants of these tribes preserve the memory of a time when the land was undefined, an endless expanse, a border-less home.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Wyoming became the forty-fourth state admitted into the Union in 1890. However, to announce statehood in the year which Wyoming was inducted would be a significant misjudgment of its prolonged adversity, downfalls, and success. Culture was very defined throughout the state. Wyoming is often known for it's bison, cowboys, and oil. Wyoming's capital city, as well as it's largest city, is Cheyenne with a population of around 60,000 people.

The State of Wyoming has been a excellent patriotic state by putting forth training bases for the First and Second World War and having a extremely large air force base called Francis E Warren AFB which has about 4000 regular members. This also serves as the base of the Auxiliary Air Command. The US Army has limited personal in that area because of the close proximity to other large military bases. Wyoming has had a excellent history in the USN (United States Navy)for being the namesake for three surface ships and one submarine all of which have served in conflicts around the world. The USS Wyoming (BB-32) served in the Second World War and was severely damaged several times but survived the war and was honourably decommissioned in 1947. The State of Wyoming kept the ship's flag and battleship markings and put them into their Museum (Carter Museum of Naval History). They also kept their items and the hull was scrapped in New York in 1947. The current namesake of the state is the submarine USS Wyoming (SSBN-742) which is an Ohio Class submarine. The captain of this submarine wears a cowboy hat with the cow markings of its home state. She was also the first to allow female officers aboard and trains new officers for their first rotation.    

Much of the state's history revolves around it's well known nickname of the 'Cowboy State'. This name was coined due to its vast heritage of cattle, cowboys and various western traditions. Cowboys have often been over dramatized in various books, movies, and television shows. However, their duties were quite simple throughout the state. They were hired by ranchers to care for the cattle until they were ready for the market. Although these tasks may have been simple or mundane, they often meant long hard hours and were essential to the Wyoming economy.

[[File:Cattle Roundup, Great Falls, MT, Geo B Bonnell, c1890.jpg|thumbnail|Cowboy performing his daily duties]]

	Cattle were not the only animals which aided the state of Wyoming. The introduction of the Spanish Horse was vital for 'hunter gatherers'. Spanish horses were replaced with agile horses. These animals also provided transportation which made daily activities easier which ultimately shaped the culture of Wyoming.
	 It is important to note that a less prominent and less praised culture that occurred within Wyoming. During a ten year cattle depression throughout the state, vigilantes began to emerge through the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. These men would lynch those who were a threat or became an enemy. Little to no effort was made to punish these murderers. In addition to somewhat barbaric measures of murder, immigrant Americans also did not cooperate with Native American Indians. The Indian wars which lasted from the 1850s throughout the 1870s consisted of broken treaties, encroachment of land, and conflicting hunting grounds. These events did not prove to be proud moments of Wyoming history, however remained to shape that state as it is viewed today.
[[File:Bison bison 009.jpg|thumbnail|left|Bison - Wyoming Native Animal]]
[[File:Flag of Wyoming.svg|thumbnail|Wyoming State Flag]]

	The way in which Wyoming is represented in the modern era and throughout history is depicted through the Wyoming state flag which was adopted in 1917. The flag illustrates a tremendous amount of detail. The flag depicts a bison which became a prominent animal throughout Wyoming. There are two males and a pillar which read, &quot;oil&quot;, &quot;mining&quot;, &quot;livestock&quot;, and &quot;grain&quot;. These four words are the pinnacle of Wyoming's history as each aspect contributed to the success and downfall of the state. Finally, there is a woman holding a scroll that reads &quot;equal rights&quot;. In 1860, women had comprised of only one sixth of the population, however women's suffrage was a very significant topic within the state. In 1869, Wyoming passed their women's suffrage bill and proved to be a pioneer and innovator for women's rights across the United States.

Wyoming has served to be an exemplary state for The United States. The progression of women's rights, contribution to the economy, and it's proud American history, are all attributes that comprise the Cowboy State. The patriotic heritage continues into modern era, and the state's citizens act accordingly.


	Overall, the state of Wyoming has a very fascinating and significant past. Wyoming has the reputation of being associated as the &quot;Cowboy States&quot; and with this label it will forever have an impact on the United States of America.

==The Old West==
 
The notion of the &quot;The Old West&quot; derives itself from the Western portion of the United States. In particular, the state of Wyoming carries many of the cultural attributes associated with the cliché of &quot;The Old West&quot;. The state of Wyoming became known throughout American pioneer history as a place of trade. Europeans, in search of fur pelts, took an active interest in the development of the land. The fur trade provided a foundation upon which other trade would soon develop throughout the region. Wyoming was also utilized as a trade route, primarily for the transportation of gold from Oregon to California. But the commercial activity that truly created the association of The Old West and Wyoming was cattle ranch productions. 


Another contributing factor to the association with The Old West was the clash between the native cultures and the settler culture. These culture clashes often characterized towns of The Old West, and Wyoming was no exception. Due to the fact that Wyoming was such a vital trade route, natives, as well as bandits, were continuously creating ambushes on different various paths in an effort to try and obtain cargo that was being transported across the region. The constant robberies indirectly helped the expansion and development of the region because an increase of military presence was required which led in part to the further construction of villages and posts. 


The increase in development was timely to match an increase in migrating workers and gold seekers to the area. The most important post was Fort Laramie as it not only played a role in accommodating a growing population in the area, but it also became a leading centre for the cattle industry. With the expansion of commerce and development in Wyoming the concept of the Wild West began to fade. However, the cultural icons which had influenced the image of &quot;The Old West&quot; was still alive. The idea of the cowboy has always been centered around the West and primarily this image has been seen and idolized in many movies. In reality, the cowboy profession is a labour intensive and lonely lifestyle. However, the cattle industry had become very profitable for Wyoming. The idea of The Old West in relation to Wyoming is one that can be seen throughout the state's history. Furthermore, these cultural attributes can still be seen in modern day Wyoming. This is evident in a number of cases such as the states national sport consisting of the &quot;rodeo&quot; as well as the state's animal being the bison. These images and representations of Wyoming have encouraged people to link Wyoming with The Old West. This traditional Old West heritage has been and continues to be a prominent part of Wyoming's identity and is an association that will never fade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Territorial Days: Railways, Suffrage and Cattle, 1868-1890==

===Intro===
In the early 1860s the western half of the United States was open territory, which was sparsely populated. Most of these inhabitants were Native American from the many different tribes that resided in Wyoming. In an effort to get more American settlers to settle in the west President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act on July 1 1862. This law made the Union Pacific a legal corporation, and it gave the necessary land to build railway in the western territories. On July 25, 1868, President Andrew Johnson signed the Organic Act, an act of the United States Congress, creating Wyoming Territory.  This new area would take land from the Dakota, Idaho, and Utah Territories. The First Governor to be appointed was John A. Campbell, on April 3, 1869. The first territorial legislature of Wyoming convened on October 12, 1869. In Governor Campbell’s inaugural address to this first legislature he said, &quot;For the first time in the history of our country, the organization of a territorial government was rendered necessary by the building of a railroad”. While the Union Pacific Railroad entered into Wyoming in 1867, the creation of the territory two years later occurred partly due to the necessity of raising funds for the construction of the railroad. It was not until after Wyoming officially became a territory that the railway was extended to the western border. The railroads proved vital in establishing industries including coal and timber production, as they could haul copious amounts of freight to the Eastern United States. Furthermore, the railway significantly improved the ability of settlers to gain access to the territory, and thus contributed to a significant increase in Wyoming's population. For all the benefits that the Union Pacific Railway gave economically to the Wyoming territory, there were a lot of controversies after the construction of the railroad.  After the railway was built, the Interstate Commerce Commission conducted an investigation into the Union Pacific not their selling excessive land to businesses, opting instead to keep the land and run a monopoly on the coal industry .The report was very critical on the Union Pacific, specifically one paragraph saying &quot;It seems that the conditions which attended have all been evaded, disregarded or vitiated by fraud or lapsed over time.&quot; Funding for the Union Pacific Railroad was raised by both public coffers and private investors. By 1880 the population was 20,789, of which one-half resided in the seven towns than lay along the Union Pacific. There was much tension between the American settlers who resided in this southern area of Wyoming near the railroad towns and the Natives who occupied much of the northern territory and uncharted non-Wyoming territory. Problems between aboriginals and settlers continued even after the territorial government was implemented.There was also tension between American settlers and new Chinese settlers. This tension eventually grew into conflict and lead to the Rock Springs Massacre. on September 2, 1885 striking coal miners working for Union Pacific mining killed 28 Chinese strike-breakers, along with wounding 15 others and destroying property valued at $147,000. These tensions ultimately led to violent conflicts, which inevitably resulted in loss of life and trust between all parties. Conclusively this prevented business from occurring, slowed settlement in northern Wyoming, and caused the territory much difficulty in the highly significant task of bringing in new settlers.

===The Wyoming Cattle Boom===

Stemming from the Wyoming Cattle Boom of 1868 to 1886, Wyoming to this day is referred to as the Cowboy State. Popular belief surrounding the origin of the Wyoming Cattle Boom can be attributed to Seth Wood, a government trader. It was believed that Seth Wood left his cattle out on the range over the winter season, when he returned to retrieve what was left of his cattle he was surprised to find the vast majority had survived the winter off of grazing alone. [[Image:General_custard_1.jpg|thumb| The battle of the Little Big Horn 1878]]The coupling of Wyoming's mild winters and nutrient-rich lands allowed for herds of cattle to roam the terrain year round. This was beneficial as there was little human intervention required while also absorbing additional costs including feed and shelter. While some still credit this to be the origin of Wyoming’s Cattle Boom, others suggest a mass cattle migration from Texas along with increased economic opportunities as another plausible credited source. 

Due to the vast amount of open space and government land available for purchase, Wyoming was an ideal location for the raising of stock. Although the expansion of the cattle industry from Texas was initially limited by danger from savage Indians and the necessity to remain near urbanized markets. However, the cattle industry was able to expand when the railroad companies began building westward giving rise to new markets for beef. Also, ranchers were able to use capital investments from New York, Boston and London. Furthermore, with the defeat of the Indians at the battle of Little Big Horn in 1876, and the subsequent forced migrations to reserves, vast lands that were previously occupied were now free for the taking. Coupled with the extermination of the bison from previous decades, Wyoming provided the cattle industry with large areas of land suitable for grazing. These factors, along with the increased demand for beef in the East, contributed to the Great Cattle Drives in the 1860s. Businessmen bought cattle in Texas and drove them north to Wyoming along the Texas Trail. During this time the ranchers took over most of the land and bred profitable cattle to keep up with the high demand for beef.  Within twelve to fifteen years the movement was largely completed and the cattle kingdom was at its height of big business characterized by large herds and control over capital and territory. However, by 1890 their big businesses were threatened by a more profitable sheep industry that would eventually spark hostilities between the two. In the early 20th century the sheepherders won the right to range on all parts of public domain but at a cost of thirty-five thousand dead sheep and the deaths of fifty sheepherders by cowboys.

Other origins of the cattle boom can be traced back to 1849 when 350 soldiers were encamped in Wyoming due to clashes with the Plains Indian Tribe. This presence of the soldiers increased the demand for beef in Wyoming but it wasn't until the Civil War that the demand spiked. During the Civil War demand for first barrelled and then tinned beef sky rocketed. As the South continued to call for more men to step up and bear arms to fight for the Confederate cause, countless herds were left unattended which adversely flooded the market for Longhorn cattle, dropping the price to $9.46 per critter.[[Image:Wyoming_Cowboys.jpg|thumb| Wyoming Cattle Bunk House circa 1870-1890]] In Wyoming, however, the price per unit stayed high at $86.00 per critter. Furthermore, the innovation of refrigeration cars on the railroads and refrigerated compartments on ships allowed for more beef to be transported throughout the US and overseas. In fact in 1876, Britain imported 1,732 tonnes of beef, 80% of which was from the United States, and a substantial amount of that from Wyoming. Within two years, the amount inflated to 30,000 tonnes. 

The increased demand for Wyoming beef led to the formation of the Wyoming stock raising business. Prominent names such as “F.E. Warren, Joseph Carey, Charlie Hutton and the four Swan brothers” invested in extensive resources of land and livestock. In 1872 “Cattle Growers founded one of the most powerful organizations in the West, The Wyoming Stock Growers Association”. 

The increased sale of cattle brought enormous wealth into Wyoming. In May 1870 the cattle price peaked at $6.47 per “hundred-weight” and over the next 10 years the price would fluctuate while never falling below “$4.00”. Large economic profits provided investors and cattle rustlers with extreme wealth. In the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming 8 millionaires were among the 3,000 inhabitants. “It became one of the first cities in the US to have street lighting”. Eventually the cattle boom slowed down and stopped as a result of the “The Homestead Act of 1862, The Timber Act of 1872, and the Dessert Land Act of 1877”, which handed out or sold government land, and  would eventually lead to most of Wyoming's land being owned by private investors. These Acts along with inclement weather in the “winter of 86-87” lead to the silencing of the Cattle Boom in Wyoming.

===Cattle Downfall===

Prosperity in Wyoming was beginning to fade when the winter of 1886-1887 hit the cattle farms.  This terrible winter decimated the cattle population and negatively impacted the growing economy of Wyoming. One third of all northern cattle were killed due to hurricane blizzards, heavy snowfall, and very cold rain.  Additionally, the surviving cattle were in horrible condition. The left over cattle were sold for very little and profits began to plummet due to the poor quality of the product. The harsh winter was the beginning of the end for the cattle boom. Although the cattle boom was in fact ending and new sources of economic wealth were surfacing, it still had a significant impact on the creation and maturation of Wyoming in the 1880s.

===The Rock Springs Massacre===
[[File:Rock sprigs|thumbnail]]
With the growing mining industry, the Union Pacific Railroad had been establishing its route through Cheyenne, Wyoming. The increase in demand for coal mining increased the importance of railroads through the distribution of raw materials. Immigrant workers mainly from China, were brought to Rock Springs, WY to mine coal, however tensions between the white and Chinese miners rose and lead to 23 Chinese miners being killed. This massacre was a crucial moment in the history of Wyoming, as many of the 600 Chinese miners wished to return to the west coast because they feared for their lives. Governor Francis Warren tricked the Chinese into returning to Rock Springs and arranged with the mine company to ensure work be resumed. This reestablished the flow of coal and ensured Wyoming’s future as an important part of the railroad system. Though devastated and homeless the Chinese miners continued work and were a huge part in allowing the territory to grow into the state it is now. Governor Warren viewed Chinese workers as a need for the Wyoming economy to avoid devastation despite the issues between races.

===The Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad===
[[Image:Wyoming_railroad.jpg|150px|thumb| Railroad Station in Green River Wyoming circa 1871]]
During the Wyoming Territorial days, the area attempted to draw people in by temptation of what was at the time thought to be the greatest and most triumphant industry in the world; the railway.  Hundreds of settlers came to Wyoming in hopes of finding a place that was located moderately close to a rich water source, coal deposits, and most importantly to a thriving business scene that offered an abundance of labour opportunities.  

After Wyoming's statehood in 1890, the Chicago, Burlington, &amp; Quincy (CB&amp;Q) Railroad Company emerged as the new railroad line within Wyoming. Throughout the state, this railroad underwent several name changes including Grand Island Railroad Northern Wyoming Railroad Company, and the Big Horn Railroad Company due to separate construction financing around the state. Eventually the company would resume their original namesake, the CB&amp;Q. As the west continued to expand, many investors and business elites saw the need for increased railroad transportation. The railroad allowed for migrants to travel westward, as the West was the land of opportunities for land ownership and jobs.

Investments for this railroad were made by John Forbes of Boston, and the line was administered by Charles E. Perkins. Perkins, being a major contributor to this railroad in Wyoming and the greater Midwest, was elected as the railroad's President in 1881. Perkins thoroughly planned the railroad, from how much operators would be paid, to which engines would be the most efficient for operation.  Perkins encouraged investors and settlers to buy the land the railroad owned, in which it was sold to the highest bidder.  By the time he retired from the railroad, Perkins doubled the track mileage from 2838 miles, to 4874 miles.

The CB&amp;Q railroad line ran from East to West, and as investment and demand in the East continued to grow, materials such as timber and coal were required. By 1892 the line eventually would make it to Sheridan, Wyoming where it was instrumental in the exporting the towns coal. Lumber production also exploded in Sheridan as lumber was essential for its use in railroad construction, acting as the ties under the tracks.[[File:1897 Poor's Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.jpg|left|150px|thumb|1897 Poor's Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] The railroad expanded due to the growing number of coal mines in the state. By 1901, Perkins connected the lines between Toluca, Montana and Cody, Wyoming to carry more coal and other commodities. This railroad line was demonstrating it's importance to this state almost immediately.  

As this railroad became busier the state grew accordingly. The CB&amp;Q railroad alone reportedly brought eight-thousand families to Wyoming between the years 1906-1913, families hoping to take advantage of the resources Wyoming offered. In fact, in the year 1880 the population was recorded at 20,789 citizens, more than double the 9,118 population of ten years previous, and only a third of the population that would exist by 1890. The railroad was able to settle most of Wyoming. The expanding settlement allowed for the development of industries, and converted land for agriculture use which allowed the state of Wyoming to prosper financially alongside the East Coast of the United States where most of the raw materials would be sold. 

As diesel operated engines became available, the CB&amp;Q Railway was at the forefront of pioneering them and begin phasing out coal-operated steam engines. This new investment in diesel engines would harm the coal production in Wyoming towns as it was slowly becoming irrelevent in the diesel era. Unfortunately, for the CB&amp;Q and many other railroads they experienced a large decrease in passengers that were no longer interested in locomotive transportation. This would decline until the United States would enter World War II.

===Saloons and Liquor on the Western Frontier===

Drunken cowboys in a bar, brawling, yelling, gambling, and being altogether wild and rambunctious is an image often associated with the nineteenth century western frontier.  This image is partly true, as alcohol was a major part of life and business in the Wyoming Territory.  Once finished the day’s work on ranches, mines, or railroads the men of Wyoming, who outnumbered the female population six to one, filled the saloons night after night. After the refreshments, night time dances were known to last into the morning.  The drinks of choice were bourbon whiskey and beer, and on special occasions the wealthy entrepreneurs from the east would enjoy champagne and red wine. The largest service industry in Wyoming was selling drinks. In 1870, Cheyenne, with a population of just 1,450 had twenty-seven saloon- keepers, four brewers, seven wholesale liquor merchants, nine bar keepers, and five liquor store merchants.  Saloons were carefully run business establishments, each designed for a particular clientele. Some were for the ranchers, others the miners or soldiers from nearby areas after a hard long work day on their jobs, and some for the upper middle class communities. Owning a bar or saloon was a lucrative business, and many of them became well respected leaders in the territory.  Luke Murrin, who ran a gambling saloon, became Mayor of Cheyenne, J.W. Connor was elected mayor of Laramie, and Harry Hynds opened saloons all over the west and was involved in real estate, hotels, and oil.  Hynds was so well respected that in attendance at his funeral were US senators, congressmen, and federal judges.   A final example, Judge George Ashdown began in Sundance, Wyoming by opening a saloon; he later became a respected sheriff and justice of the peace.   

Cheyenne was a unique case in Wyoming.  Its Cattlemen and settlers were becoming very wealthy in the 1880’s. During the decade, Carey Avenue a main street, became known as ‘Millionaires Row’ which had over forty mansions constructed on site. The mansions were built in the Romanesque style, which was popular in the eastern part of the country. Other Wyoming cities did not have this kind of extravagant architecture.   

In 1879, a lavish clubhouse was erected in Cheyenne by a group of new residents to the territory from distinguished society in the East. This group, was looking to profit off of the cattle business, but were unaccustomed to ranch life.  Their club, ‘The Cheyenne Club,’ had all of the amenities and comfort they were used to.  A code of ethics had to be obeyed to ensure only gentleman entered.  Gambling, fighting, and excessive drunkenness were means for suspension or expulsion from the club.   The influence of the territory crept in however, as documents show that the club finished immense amounts of rum, gin, and whiskey.   John Clay, one of Cheyenne’s prominent socialites and President of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association  wrote, “Looking back it seems worse than wicked to think of the bad whiskey and very poor beer we managed to drink and digest in those days.” 

Liquor sale and consumption in the Wyoming territory were an important part of economics and lifestyle.  Cowboys, soldiers, and miners alike were enjoying life, intoxicated on the western frontier.

===Women's Suffrage in Wyoming===

Prior to, as well as after, the enfranchisement of women in the Territory of Wyoming there was very little organized suffrage activity unlike a large portion of states and territories within the United States. For the most part Wyoming was a sparsely populated territory where cattle-raising was the main occupation for its inhabitants and men outnumbered women six to one.  Encouraged by his wife and several other women (such as Esther Morris) William H. Bright, President of the Council of the Wyoming Territorial Legislature, introduced his bill “An Act to Grant the Women of Wyoming Territory the Right of Suffrage and to Hold Office” on November 12th, 1869 bringing women’s suffrage to the forefront of Wyoming’s political agenda.  As a Democrat, Bright believed that the Republican Governor, John Campbell, would veto the suffrage bill and politically attack him in order to obtain more popular support in the state.[[Image:Women_sufferage.jpg|150px|thumb| Women Seen at the Polls in Cheyenne Wyoming circa 1888]]Bright argued that such a bill would generate positive publicity and entice women to migrate to Wyoming in hopes of balancing the gender ratios, as well as aid the growth of families and population.  Wyoming also needed a population influx if it ever hoped to qualify for statehood, and Bright believed this was a good way to attract more residents. The Bill for Women’s Suffrage in Wyoming was signed into law on December 10, 1869.  In 1870, Grandma Swain became the first female in the United States to cast her ballot in an American election. From this point onward, Women’s Suffrage became an adopted Republican principle and over time the party benefited from it.

Not only did this new law allow women the right to vote and hold office, but it also meant women were now on the list of prospective jurors, had state control over their own property and protected them against discrimination as teachers.  Two months after the bill was passed, three women were commissioned justices of the peace; the only one to have served was Esther Morris &quot;the mother of suffrage in Wyoming” and the first woman justice on record who held office for eight months in South Pass City, Wyoming. By April 1870 women began to serve on grand and petit juries in Laramie; by 1871 women were sitting alongside men on juries in Cheyenne.  Legislature passed in 1882 allowed women to not only acquire land and hold real estate (as granted by Bright’s original bill), but also convey their property without their husband’s concurrence.  There was very little suffragist activity in Wyoming until 1889 when Wyoming applied for statehood.  Many opposed granting the territory statehood believing that it went against being an Anglo-Saxon and that politics was a masculine space, reserved for Anglo-Saxon men only.  Despite this, Wyoming was granted statehood on March 28th, 1890 with a vote of 139 to 127 making it the only full women suffrage state in the Union and earning it the nickname “the Equality State.”

This suffrage movement led to female employment opportunities, most of which being teaching in one of the territories rural schoolhouses. As a result women played an important role in, what was known as, &quot;country teaching.&quot; From the foundation of the Wyoming territory in 1868 until the Second World War and after, &quot;country teaching&quot; became a widespread form of employment for women. Despite Wyoming’s long history of male abundance and female scarcity, more than eight women have been employed for every man hired to teach in the territory and then eventual states’ public schools. 

However women in Wyoming were not expected to make teaching a long-term career. Indeed, teaching was assumed to be a temporary pursuit that was more so seen as preparation for marriage. This reality unfortunately led to inadequate salaries, low status, no room for career expansion and discrimination against married women, which in turn prompted high rates of teacher turnover and general inexperience.

===Conclusion===

While the years between 1868 and 1890 did not see Wyoming acquire statehood, they were formative to the primary economic and political institutions of the area.  The expansion of the Union Pacific Railway to Wyoming's western border caused an influx of settlers and the resulting economic boom in the territory. Wyoming was also instrumental in the movement for women's suffrage, becoming the first territory or state to grant women political and legal rights. Finally, the cattle business was essential to the establishment of a successful economy in Wyoming. The territorial period was important in the development of Wyoming as a unique political, economic and territorial entity, and was instrumental in the continued growth of Wyoming into the period of statehood.</text>

[[File:Wyoming-StateSeal.svg|thumb|Wyoming-StateSeal|right|The State Seal of Wyoming]]
Until neighbouring South Dakota and Montana entered the Union in 1889, Wyoming received little recognition due to its relatively small population. Wyoming had not considered entering the United States as a state due to some prominent citizens not believing the territory was ready to become a state. However when the issue came to a territory wide vote, the majority of Wyoming’s citizens voted in favour of statehood. In Governor Frances E. Warren's inauguration speech, a plea was made for statehood. Warren argued that the increased expense of statehood would be offset by greater revenues, and promised rapid growth and development once admission to the Union had been accomplished. In September of 1889, under the leadership of Governor Francis E. Warren, Wyoming elected forty-nine men to the Constitutional Convention, where the soon to be state's constitution was drafted. On July 10th, 1890, the United States admitted Wyoming into the Union as the forty-fourth state.

==The Johnson County War==

The Johnson County War was a two-day range war fought between large cattle ranchers and small homesteaders in northern Wyoming in the spring of 1892. Like most range wars of the Old West, the Johnson County War - sometimes referred to as the War on Powder River - was the climax of longstanding property disputes over land and especially cattle ownership on the open range. Today, the story of the Johnson County War is one of the most retold and well known of the range war tales. The conflict has been referred to as “'''the most notorious event in the history of Wyoming''',” for its influence in reshaping the cattle industry and political landscape of Wyoming.

===Background===

====Crowding and Competition on the Open Range====

In the late 19th century, the range cattle industry was the undisputed king of Wyoming business. Encouraged by the booming industry and supported by federal land acts of the time (especially the Homestead Act of 1862) homesteaders migrated to Wyoming to share in the public domain and raise small herds of their own. By the early 1880's, this migration had created a major crowding problem on the range. The land-intensive nature of cattle ranching and informal land rights (based mostly in common law) brewed conflict and competition between established ranchers and new-coming homesteaders. Exacerbating this issue, the price of cattle reached a record high in 1882 and cattlemen responded by bringing in more cattle and overstocking their ranges.  This led to a sharp rise in cattle population and a rapid decline in available land. '''Rustling''' - illegal branding/theft of cattle - became more of a concern (especially among big cattlemen), as cattle from different herds mixed. Theft, however, was not the only source of conflict on the increasingly crowded range. [[File:Homestead Act Stamp.jpg|thumbnail|right|1962 Stamp commemorating the Homestead Act of 1862]] 

====Wyoming Stock Growers' Association====

Frustrated by growing competition from homesteaders, big cattlemen – all members of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) – attempted to limit settlers’ access to the public domain by influencing territorial legislation (Maverick Law of 1884) and by controlling participation in the annual roundup. Unfortunately for the cattlemen, the WSGA’s efforts did not effectively curb rustling and in 1892, Johnson County homesteaders formed the rival '''Northern Wyoming Stock Farmers and Stock Growers Association''', promising to host an alternate roundup. This direct competition with the WSGA and the persistent issue of rustling led a group of big cattlemen to seek an end to their competition through vigilante justice in the spring of 1892.

===The Invasion and the War on Powder River===

[[File:TA Ranch Stable.jpg|thumb|left|A stable of the TA Ranch, Northern Wyoming]] Nate Champion was a small cattleman who ran his small herd on public lands, which, under the Homestead Act, were legally open to him. The big cattlemen attempted to assassinate Nate Champion in 1891, but that attempt failed miserably. Champion would later testify against the cattlemen, further aggravating the existing rivalry between cattle barons and homesteaders. On April 5, 1892, a small militia of prominent Wyoming cattlemen, their employees, and 23 hired Texas gunmen traveled north from Cheyenne to Johnson County with a “death list” of roughly 70 accused rustlers and troublemakers. The “invasion”, as it has come to be known, was bound for Buffalo, the seat of Johnson County, but was permanently delayed at the T.A. Ranch on Powder River on April 8, 1892. With intelligence provided by local spies, the militia discovered that Champion was hiding out at the K.C. Ranch. At the ranch, the invaders and Champion engaged in a shoot-out that lasted many hours before the militia managed to set fire to the cabin, forcing Champion outside where he was fatally shot. The invaders fled to the nearby T.A. Ranch.  

News of the invasion spread, soon reaching Johnson County Sheriff, Red Angus, who quickly raised his own vigilante army of around 200 men to combat the invaders. This group of men planned to deploy a strategy called an &quot;ark of safety&quot; (a moveable fort to which dynamite was attached) to force out the invaders from the T.A. Ranch. Unfortunately, the group never was able to use this tactic. The standoff between the invaders and Sheriff Angus’ army lasted only two days before the intervention of the 6th U.S. Cavalry on April 13th, 1892, brought the fighting to an end. President Benjamin Harrison ordered the dispatch of troops from Fort McKinney, under Article IV, Section 4, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which allows for the use of U.S. military force under the President's orders for protection from invasion and domestic violence. The invaders were taken into custody in Cheyenne to await judicial action, and the conflict known as the Johnson County War was ended. However, the impact of this War in Wyoming had only just begun.

===Aftermath: Justice, Politics and the New West===

[[File:Amos W. Barber.jpg|thumb|Amos W. Barber, Second Governor of Wyoming 1890-1893]]
Later testimonials of the invaders and their supporters have stated that then-governor of Wyoming, Amos Barber knew of the planned invasion through many of his cattle baron friends. Hearing of his friends’ predicament in Johnson County, Barber called upon President Harrison for military intervention. Barber assumed control of the invaders’ questioning once they were taken into custody. Though charges were brought against the invaders, none were ever convicted. 

The invasion had a major political impact in Wyoming, where voters were disturbed by the lack of legal consequences brought against the invaders. In the 1892 election the Republican Party, long associated with big cattlemen and the WSGA, was ousted by a landslide victory for Wyoming Democrats in the seats of governor, Congress and Senate.

The Johnson County War also marks a significant shift in the Wyoming cattle industry, from the days of the Old West and the kings of range cattle, to the New West of the pioneering homesteader.

==Wyoming and Oil==

===Oil Boom and Demographic Shift===

After the Johnson County War came to an end and Wyoming entered into the early twentieth century, the state began to shift away from its traditional cattle industry towards a new resource. Discoveries of oil reserves in the state sparked the growth of what would prove to be a much more lucrative industry. 	

The growth of the oil industry in Wyoming would come to have very important economic and political ramifications for the state. In the early 20th century, promoters of Wyoming recognized its richness in natural resources, and promised it as a rapidly advancing state developing new industrial opportunities. This was followed with the point that outside capital would be needed in large amounts, but they remained confident that the rich natural resources would draw this capital in. Oil was one of these resources, and the industry that formed around its extraction helped to create a relatively urban area in a notoriously underdeveloped state.

The high point of Wyoming’s oil production and refining took place in the early 1920’s. Casper was one of the main oil producing cities in Wyoming. It saw a huge boom between 1910 and 1925. Since there were so many jobs available, men from around the country brought their families and settled in Wyoming. The Midwest Oil Exchange, a penny stock exchange, existed on one side of Casper’s downtown. Its purpose was to intrigue investors so that money could be raised to buy equipment and lease land. In this same area there was an area known as the Sand Bar which also stimulated the economy in Casper. This area was less than reputable as compared to the oil industry but it did bring a lot of revenue to the town as a result of the increase of male workers. Sheepherders, oil refinery workers and Cowboys alike all flooded to the saloons, pool halls and prostitution houses that were found in the Sand Bar. Even after Wyoming became affected by Prohibition, they still generated profit, they simply became speakeasies and business went on as usual. Although Casper was known as Wyoming’s oil city, it was actually the Salt Creek oil patch to the North of Casper that was producing the largest amount of oil; not only in Wyoming but in the world at this time. This would greatly benefit veterans of the First World War as many men were looking for jobs and they found them in Wyoming.
	
The Salt Creek Oil Field of Natrona County was one of the major extraction centers in the state, producing roughly 3.5 million barrels of oil in 1923. This massive production fueled industry in nearby Casper, which held five refineries to process the massive amounts of oil coming out of Natrona County. Given Casper's relative proximity to the oil fields, Casper became a major hub for oil production, and this is well reflected in the census. Having a meager population of 883 in the year 1900, this population would more than triple to 2,639 by 1910, and then more than triple again to 11,447 by 1920 - making it the second largest city in the state. The sudden prosperity due to the oil fields, and the sheer reliance on them would result in Casper eventually being given the nickname &quot;Oil City&quot;. 

	Though Casper was the largest example of urbanization due to the oil industry, many other places benefited greatly due to increasing petroleum demand and the state's natural ability to supply this demand. For example, the town of Lusk increased its population more than tenfold in the same 1900-1920 period. The University of Wyoming also found oil on its lands, allowing it to expand facilities despite an overall poor economic climate. 

	Demand for oil products, especially petroleum, came about as cars began to be introduced into Wyoming culture in years after the turn of the century. By the middle of the next decade, cars had become so widely used that the state began requiring licensing for the vehicles. Following this, Wyoming was motivated to focus on improving roads, eventually leading to the formation of associations to further these projects and accomplishing the creation of the Lincoln Highway. This would become the nation's &quot;first designated transcontinental automobile route.&quot;

Perhaps the most important event that permanently changed Wyoming’s economic future was the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.  Since Wyoming was so rich in oil, the state began to do extremely well economically after this law had been passed. 
In the late 1920’s as the Depression was approaching, Wyoming oil companies saw a decrease in demand and the oil prices subsequently dropped. Many people at this time left in search of work elsewhere. It was not until the Second World War that the oil companies and the rest of America would be brought out of the depression. The high demand for oil from the Allied forces jump started the production of oil in Wyoming once more. American Aircraft Carriers, Ships, War Planes and Tanks were all in need of massive amounts of high octane fuel and Wyoming was able to produce it.

	One of Wyoming's most notable events, the Teapot Dome scandal, comes out of this context of a state driven in its pursuit of expanding oil industry. The Teaport Dome Scandal also requires knowledge of another major factory that shaped Wyoming's economy, the Mineral Leasing Act. With the understanding provided of the impacts of the oil industry in Wyoming, we can look more closely at the changes brought by the implementation of the Mineral Leasing Act.

===Mineral Leasing Act===
[http://www.wyohistory.org/essays/mineral-leasing-act-1920 The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920] altered the economic destiny of Wyoming. From the 1900s to World War I Wyoming’s economy was based on agriculture, especially cattle and crop production. However, as World War I came to a conclusion and the 1920’s rolled in, Wyoming transitioned into a time of unrest and economic uncertainty because of the depression. As persistent droughts and deflation of post war prices occurred, livestock and agricultural production fell. The value of meat and crop products dropped sharply. In 1919 cattle production was worth $42.00 but by 1925 cattle and sheep combined were worth only $26 million. In Fremon County, total crop value fell from $2.4 million in 1919 to less than $900 000 in 1924. Because of this decline, oil and gas became the new hot commodity. Wyoming State Geologist, Albert Barlett, stated that the “mineral industry was more important to the state economy than either livestock or agriculture”. 

[[File:Drake Well petroleum.jpg|thumb|left|Petroleum being pumped from a well]] With the post war boom of automobile sales in the 1920’s and the need to supply the US Navy warship engines, petroleum was fast becoming an important new resource, rising from 13,000,000 barrels produced in 1918 to 44,000,000 in 1923. Wyoming, which sits on the most important oil fields in the Rocky Mountains, including the Teapot Dome, quickly became a large producer of the nation’s petroleum. However, this did not cushion the impact of the depression on Wyoming. The 1872 Mining Law allowed companies and corporations to own public lands in the west and to extract any minerals from them and retain all profits gained, by paying a very small fee.  Initial discoveries of oil were generally kept as secretive as possible to prevent claim jumping, which was a chronic problem. Because of capitalistic desires, once word got out, each discovery prompted a scramble to claim and drill as much nearby land as possible and to produce as much oil as fast as possible. This often led to the draining of oil from neighboring tracts. This created a closed trading economy as the same few companies sold to each other, preventing any independent or smaller companies from entering the growing business. The New York Times wrote of the Standard Oil Company’s overwhelming monopoly of 99% of all oil production and transportation, and noted the impossibility of independent  oil companies to compete in such a private system.

On February 25, 1920, the Mineral Leasing Law was passed by President Woodrow Wilson to combat the problems with the previous law. The law regulated the extraction of minerals to prevent resource monopolies and help stimulate the Wyoming's economy. It divided the legal status of oil, natural gas, coal and phosphates from minerals like gold, silver, copper and lead. It also restricted the areas of land and the length of time a company could mine resources from the area. It stated that a company could have no more than three leases in any state, never more than one in any given oil field, and the length of the leases were ten years. Most importantly, it placed the government in direct control of the land; now in charge of selling the leases and receiving one eighth of the profits made from the land. The act converted the federal government into a very large proprietor of petroleum lands. These restrictions helped the government control the formation of monopolies. Several Wyoming members of Congress were able to ensure that the federal government was required to pay back 37.5% royalties to state governments, thus helping Wyoming's economy greatly. Wyoming used this new capital gain to improve public schools, roads, and the University. The petroleum corporations praised the states new revenues, no doubt in an attempt to boost their falling status and popularity with the people of Wyoming who now had a chance to get out from under their boot.

Not everyone was in favor of this new leasing policy. Democratic and Republican citizens of Wyoming felt that it could take jobs away from Wyoming. And while in theory the plan initially prevented monopolization, price gouging and monopolization still occurred and depressed the oil and gas industry yet again. Production declined from the 1923 high to a low of 11,500,000 barrels in 1933. As the Great Depression deepened, so did the plummeting future of the oil industry in Wyoming.

Today these regulations have been increased so that the maximum federal oil and gas land that one can lease at one time is 246 080 acres. Wyoming royalties have also increased to today's 48%.
Overall this law made exploring for and extracting oil and gas on federal and public land a privilege and not a right. The Mineral Leasing Act was essential in pushing the values of oil, gas, and coal in Wyoming beyond the values of agriculture and thus shaping modern Wyoming’s economy.

===[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teapot_Dome_scandal The Teapot Dome Scandal]===
[[File:Teapot Rock postcard.jpg|left|thumb|Teapot Rock. The formation that gave Teapot Dome it's name]]
The Teapot Dome was a 9,481 acre oil reserve located 30 miles north of Casper and just south of Salt Creek in Wyoming. It was designated for the exclusive use of the United States Navy. Navy officials were concerned about the possibility of running out of petroleum, which their ships required to operate, so they created three oil reserves that were solely for the use of the United States Navy in the event of an emergency such as an oil shortage.  

[[File:Albert Fall.jpg|thumb|right|Albert Fall.]] In the early 1920’s President Harding transferred control of the Teapot Dome oil reserve from the department of the Navy to the Department of the Interior, which was run by Albert Fall. Fall proceeded to lease the reserve for the purpose of extracting oil to wealthy oil baron Henry Sinclair of the Mammoth oil company. Rumours of the leasing of the Teapot Dome oil reserves began circulating, which led Senator Kendrick, of Wyoming, to begin receiving letters and telegrams asking him to inquire about the rumored leasing of the reserves to private interests. Senator Kendrick proceeded to ask the Department of the Interior for information and was told that no contract for the lease had been made. Fall committed a lie of omission as he failed to announce that he leased the entire area of the Teapot Dome to Sinclair. Eight days after Fall replied to Kendrick, the Department of the Interior formally announced the leasing of the Teapot Dome. Fall had given the lease to Sinclair, owner of the Mammoth Oil Company. The government would receive royalties of 12.5-50% on the production of the oil wells in the Teapot Dome. There was an unusual provision on the lease that stated the government would not receive its royalty in oil or cash payments but in oil certificates. The certificates could be exchanged for fuel, oil, petroleum products or oil storage tanks.

Under pressure from various government members, the Senate voted to investigate the lease. Under the leadership of Senator Walsh of Montana, hearings began to determine first, why the land had been leased, and second, why there had not been competitive bidding for the reserve. Fall was called in for questioning but he continued to defend his leasing policy. Senator Walsh critically analyzed the lease, as well as past legislation relevant to the lease and questioned witnesses to determine whether the contract made with Sinclair was acceptable. Witnesses brought to light Fall's sudden increase in wealth, mentioning that he had substantially increased his fortune at the time he leased the Teapot Dome. Fall's alibi to the courts was that he had big business in mind and that he wanted to increase the wealth of the United States. Unbeknowst to the rest of the senate however was that he was profitting alone off of this endeavour. As he was going to lease this off it would go towards other gas or oil barons in order to lighten his trails. There was speculation that Sinclair had given Fall gifts and money in return for the Teapot Dome lease, but Sinclair vehemently denied this. 

People argued for and against the lease. Those in support argued that the contract would allow Wyoming to expand their market for oil and in turn increase the price of the state’s crude. People opposed to the lease argued that the leasing process should have included competitive bidding and public knowledge. Governor Robert Carey and former Governor B.B. Brooks felt that the reserve should be left untapped while there was a national surplus of petroleum, as there was. In January of 1924, the Senate voted that the oil leases were illegal. Senator Kendrick declared that the government lost millions of dollars leasing the naval reserves in the manner they did. Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company was sued by the Federal District Court and Sinclair was indicted by a grand jury in Washington for contempt of the Senate as he refused to cooperate with investigators. Although Federal district Judge T. Blake Kennedy upheld the lease, the Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court overturned the decision and in May 1929, Sinclair went to jail. Fall appeared before the Supreme Court in October of 1929 and was tried for defrauding the government, conspiracy for the purpose of fraudulently disposing of the Teapot Dome and accepting a bribe. Fall's acceptance of gifts and bribes was his undoing. He was found guilty of accepting a bribe and was sentenced to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

Prior to the Watergate Scandal in the 1970s under the presidency of Richard Nixon, this was one of the largest political scandals the United States was had gone through.


==Women in Wyoming State Politics==
[[File:Gov. George H. Dern of Utah, Gov. Nellie Ross of Wyoming.jpg|thumb|Gov. George H. Dern of Utah, Gov. Nellie Ross of Wyoming|left|Governor Nellie T. Ross of Wyoming with Governor George H. Dern of Utah, October 20, 1925]]

Wyoming has been nicknamed the &quot;Equality State&quot; because of the very progressive attitude of State policies towards women. Gaining the right to vote was a constant battle for women in the United States. At the turn of the twentieth century almost every state saw women’s rights movements mobilize to try to secure the vote for women and by 1869, the government of Wyoming had given women that right. This momentous occasion allowed for neighbouring states to follow Wyoming's example. 
The right to vote was not the only public policy that Wyoming pioneered for women's suffrage. Wyoming’s territorial legislature was the first government in the United States to grant a woman a position within the government. In 1894, Estelle Reel became the first woman to hold state office as Superintendent of Public Instruction. 

Wyoming also broke the gender barrier which prevented women from becoming leaders in politics. In 1924, the state elected [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Tayloe_Ross Nellie Tayloe Ross] as the first female Governor in the United States. 

Nellie Ross, wife of Governor William B. Ross, played an avid role in her husband’s political works as governor of the state of Wyoming. When her husband passed away in 1924 while still in office, there was call for a new election. The Democratic Party nominated Nellie to run and continue her husband’s term. On January 5th, 1925, Nellie Ross won the election and became the first female governor in the United States. She had defeated her opponent by over eight thousand votes and went on to direct the United States Mint in Washington and acted as a spokesperson for Women’s Rights. Nellie Ross has become a prominent figure in women’s movements across the United States for her ability to gain the respect of men and become the first female governor, not only for the state of Wyoming, but for the entire nation of America. The diverse politics of Wyoming has helped establish a state that has the ability to place gender roles aside and is accepting of females in politics. Since its establishment as an official state in America in 1890, Wyoming has diminished the barriers surrounding other states by allowing females to hold political office, and has officially become the Equality State.

==Contributions to World War II==
[[File:A36 Invader.jpg|thumb|right|WWII Bomber]] Wyoming did not have a large presence in World War II, but nearly 10 percent of its population became soldiers. By the end of the war, 1,095 men from Wyoming had lost their lives. Prisoner of War (POW) camps were crucial installations throughout the United States and were created throughout the United States, although for the most part they were established in the southern states. Like many other States, Wyoming established these Camps, as well as Military Airfields. Wyoming's largest and most famous POW Camp was located in Douglas, Wyoming. At the height of the war, Camp Douglas held nearly 1,900 Italian prisoners and later, around 3,000 German prisoners. Along with the main camp in Douglas, there was another base camp in the city of Cheyenne, as well as smaller Branch camps all throughout Wyoming. Wyoming was also home to several Military Airfields that were established in order to train United States forces how to operate the fighters and bombers. Many of these Airfields have now been converted for public and commercial use. The most notable of these bases was the Francis E. Warren Air Base, which has remained one of Wyoming’s most historical sites. Unlike almost all other states, Wyoming did not attract war industries; however, the state’s resource industry, particularly coal, iron and oil thrived. Agriculture also assumed new importance based on a theory that “food will win the war!”

==Japanese Internment==
[[File:Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Heart Mountain, Wyoming. At the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, . . . - NARA - 539149.jpg|left|thumb|Democracy education at the Heart Mountain Relocation Center]]
In early 1941, the House Committee of un-American Activities had begun investigating the possibilities of Japanese espionage, but could not have predicted the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor that occurred on December 7 1941. On December 8th 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt declared war on Germany, Japan, and Italy thus entering the United States of America into World War II. Upon the country’s declaration of war, Wyoming began rounding up Japanese-Americans and immigrants and placing them into what was originally considered concentration camps until being renamed “internment” camps. Under the authority of the War Relocation Authority, the state of Wyoming arrested and interned these Japanese citizens. The &quot;Nisei&quot; individuals were Japanese Americans who were born in America. The &quot;Issei&quot; were Japanese immigrants who had clung on to their original customs and traditions. Finally the &quot;Kibei&quot; were Japanese-Americans who were born in America but who also went back and forth to Japan. To the American government none of these different subcultures had mattered as the country was under fear that anybody could be a spy for the Japanese government. These “interned” individuals were taken away from their homes and their possessions, placed in a secluded setting, which was set up similar to that of a small &quot;community&quot;. Each &quot;community&quot; had its own hospital, education centre, and other necessities. Heart Mountain Relocation Center was located in Wyoming and was one of the main internment camps in the United states, holding 10,767 people at the peak of its population in 1943. The prominent difference between the interment camps and towns was that they were surrounded by barbed wire fences and did not allow anyone to leave. Following Executive Order 9066, American-Japanese citizens were to be jailed for no more than 4 years. The reasoning behind the arrest of these individuals was based solely on the fear caused by the attack on Pearl Harbor by their native country. Those Japanese-Americans who were studying in universities in other states, and those who managed to move to East-coast states, were able to dodge the internment because the fear was primarily on the West-coast. It should be noted that although they were not interned, they were not trusted by the American public, and thus were closely watched. In 1942 Japanese-Americans were designated as “undraftable because of ancestry”. However following January 20 1944 it was declared that for select service the Nisei were re-eligible to join the American war effort. As a whole this meant more freedom for the Japanese-Americans, and proper reintegration into civilization.

===Introduction===

Since 1945, there have been a multitude of developments in Wyoming that have had both positive and negative impacts on the economy. During wartime there was a large demand for Wyoming’s oil, coal, lumber, and meat. After the war, the economy remained stable due to increased tourism and the discovery of two valuable minerals; Trona and Uranium. Trona was discovered in 1947 during routine oil drilling in southwestern Wyoming, and Uranium was discovered in 1951 during a geological survey in the Powder River basin. During the 1960's a new steel plant was constructed near Sunrise, which in turn acted as a catalyst in the development of Atlantic City. Two new power plants were opened to capitalize on Wyoming’s abundance of coal. This promised to be a steady market for coal, which had suffered slow-downs in the 1950’s. Wyoming a strong history of involvement with Natives from all over the state, dating back to the time of the Lewis and Clark expedition. These strong cultural ties influence an immense amount of controversy within the state. In accordance to the reservation system and native population Wyoming's most important economic contributions have always come in the form of minerals, cattle, and tourism which is why Wyoming has been labelled as a “cowboy” state.

===From War to Peace===

After 1945, Wyoming began its transition into a peacetime state. This transition was largely symbolized by the shutting down of the Heart Mountain relocation camp, which was closed in November of 1945. Originally constructed in 1941 and opened in 1942, the Heart Mountain relocation center housed roughly 14,000 Japanese Americans throughout its duration, with as much as 11,000 people living there at a single time, making it the third highest populated area in Wyoming. Many Japanese Americans were reluctant to leave and begin their lives anew. Outside of the camp, local resentment of the Japanese made it particularly difficult to blend in with society again. However, the nearby towns of Cody and Powell allowed for former members of the internment camp to work in their towns.

Throughout the 40's and 50's, Jackson Hole became a topic of dispute. John D. Rockefeller owned the land and had given it up to the park service to be turned into a national monument. The difficulties facing conservationists was partly due to increasing commercial exploitation of the area. Many fought the idea of a national recreation area in Jackson because it meant that 221,610 acres of land would be unavailable for taxation and settlement. However, by the 1950’s, conservationists had their way, and Jackson Hole became part of the Grand Teton National Park. The establishment of Grand Teton national park in 1950 ended a 30-year controversy over attempts to extend federal government control in Northwestern Wyoming and many inhabitants saw federal control, as a means of preservation. After World War II, when gas and tires became more readily available to civilians, tourism to the national park increased significantly. Since 1963, Grand Teton has attracted more people year round than its Northern neighbor, Yellowstone National Park, attracting 500,000 more tourists per year. The Grand Teton National Park has also attracted Hollywood productions on occasion, with movies being shot in Jackson Hole in the shadow of the Tetons. Movies such as &quot;The Mountain Men&quot; starring Charlton Heston in 1980, as well as the iconic training montage in the Hollywood classic &quot;Rocky IV&quot; staring Sylvester Stallone in 1985 have both been shot in Jackson Hole. The National park service along with John Rockefeller JR. preserved some of the most spectacular scenery in North America.

[[File:Wind River Reservation|thumbnail|right]]
===Wind River Reservation===

       The Wind River Indian reservation is a native reserve located in central Wyoming with a population of approximately 11,000 and is the seventh largest Indian reservation in the country. The reserve spans 2.2 million acres, 70 miles east to west and 55 miles north to south.  The Wind River Reservation is located along a water corridor and it provides a spiritual connection for the native dwellers. It was established on July 2nd, 1863 in the Fort Bridger Treaty, but was later revised to its current location in 1868. This treaty gave them a total of 44 million acres of land in Wyoming; it has now been reduced to its present size of 1.9 million acres. The Reservation is primarily home to two groups of native tribes, the Arapaho (4,500) and the Shoshone (2,500). They both retained the buffalo hunting tradition but they kept their separate cultural beliefs. The land had been traditionally held by the Shoshones for many centuries and the tribe had no intention of leaving it. Originally, the Arapaho were intended to have their own land and were put on the Shoshone land temporarily. When the U.S. government made it clear that Native Americans would be required to live on designated reservations, the Eastern Shoshone were allowed to choose the location of their permanent home. They chose to settle in the “Warm Valley of the Wind River,” which was their wintering area.  However, when a new administration came to power in Washington, the relocation effort was abandoned, so in 1937 the reserve was recognized as being jointly owned by the two tribes. This caused conflict initially, as the tribes were forced to compete for food sources and good land, but they now manage to coexist with virtually no issues. Historically, this area has had a tremendous significance on American culture, as it was the home of the tribes that helped guide explorers Lewis and Clarke on their expedition of the Western United States. It is said that they were able to get along with the foreigner explorers based on the fact that they were always at war with every plains tribe. In fact, the cemetery located on the reserve is the final resting place of the famed Sacajawea, their guide and interpreter.[[File:WindriverIRmap.png|thumb|right| Wind River Reserve in Perspective]]
       
     The Wind River Indian Reservation is also important in Wyoming's history due to the fact that it was the first time that the Native Chief was able to negotiate for land that the tribe wanted. Chief Washakie is known as the legendary chief who was able to choose the land for his people; it was the only reservation chosen by any native group.  As most Native Chiefs were, Chief Washakie was a warrior first, then later took on the position of peacemaker for the tribe. He was able to see that in order to preserve his tribe's legacy he had a better chance of negotiating for land than defending the land against the new power of the settlers. The Chief was able to negotiate with the federal government during the formation of the Fort Bridge Treaty to have the land that would most benefit the tribes. Chief Washakie believed that it was the most beneficial to be on peaceful terms with the settlers rather than feuding with them. The white community had a strong relationship with the Chief, eventually naming a fort after him; this fort is now the oldest fort on the reservation. This also assisted in keeping the peace between the native and settler populations. As well as peace there is often war when there is government involvement in moving tribes around. In 1866, the displaced Crow tribe was forced to move into the Shoshone Wind River Reservation tribe's hunting territory. Chief Washakie sent a warrior messenger to the Crow Chief Big Robber explaining the predicament. Washakie told him that the Shoshone would allow the Crow tribe to hunt the Owl Creek Range as long as they left the Wind River Mountains to the Shoshone. Chief Big Robber believed that his tribe was better if not equal to the Shoshone and killed the warrior messenger. He sent a message back to Washakie stating he would hunt wherever he pleased. Washakie responded by gathering his allies and launched a surprise attack on the Crow tribe that lasted five days. Washakie was superior however out of the utter respect he had for Chief Big Robber, for his bravery, instead of scalping him he took out his heart and placed it at the end of his lance. This event gave Crowheart Butte it's modern name. Among the local tribes the battle between Washakie and Big Robber distinguished who had control of the reservation. 

Despite its cultural significance, the Wind River reservation today stands as an appalling example of native poverty.  Before 1945, the reservation flourished economically as it owned much of the land that the Wind River Basin is located on.  This basin contains traces of an assortment of valuable natural resources, such as gold, coal, uranium, natural gas and oil. Due to the high value of these resources, it was an area of mining through the late 19th century and into the 20th.  However, due to these extreme mining efforts, the resources of the basin have been all but extracted.  In 1920, there was approximately 290,495 tons of coal extracted. Compare this with the 18,511 tons in 1942 and the mere 1,534 tons in 1960 and it is clear that the resources of the area are nearly depleted. The main development still functioning today is the energy industry that developed following World War II. A large oil boom created most of the revenue for the Wind River Reserve following World War I. The development on the reservation led to certain industries being produced throughout the community; first ranching, and then farming. Today that foundation is still in place, but to a lesser extent. Farming, for instance, has become more institutionalized. With the lack of economic opportunity in the area comes a lack of interest in maintain it.  The governments gave the overseeing power to religious groups. The church was in charge of setting up schools, hospitals and other government buildings on the reserves that would assist their development. This also assisted in keeping the peace between the native and settler populations. In 1945 the Shoshone Episcopal Mission School (nicknamed “Robert’s Mission” for its founder Reverend John Roberts) was shut down.  This school was located on land personally donated by Chief Washakie and was said to be sacred land.  With a lack of decent education, living conditions on the reserve began to gradually decline. 

Developing after 1945 was the success of the Arapaho ranch located on the Wind River Reservation. Prior to the construction of the Arapaho ranch in 1940, the Arapaho people were impoverished and struggling to meet the success of the Shoshone peoples. The ranch was developed to help instill a sense of business in the Arapaho, and to teach them to be self-sufficient. Initially the ranch ran into problems when the white male manager of the ranch only hired other white male ranch hands. This problem was solved in 1948, when it was decided that the hiring of workers would be left entirely to the native peoples. Soon into the 1950’s the ranch was declared a success after it paid back the $ 476, 217 that it owed to the Shoshone and having acquired around an additional half a million dollars in assets. It is noted that the Arapaho language distinguishes the differences between themselves and other Wyoming tribes, it originates from the Algonquin tribe language. 
[[File:&quot;Cattle at Wind River Agency&quot; - NARA - 293377.jpg|thumb|left|Ranch on the Wind River Reservation]]
Between the years 1945 to 1952 the number of livestock owned by the Arapaho more than doubled from roughly 600 to over 1,400. The ranches included cattle and sheep, other livestock was not as important (for example; dairy stock, hogs and chickens). The success continued into the 70’s where the ranch was viewed as a permanent, individually owned business enterprise that did business with many people outside of the reservation.

Today, the reservation is closer to a third world environment than an American territory. Life expectancy on the reserve is just 49 years, which incidentally is 20 years less than in Iraq. Furthermore, the high school dropout rate is at 40% and the unemployment rate is an astounding 80%, a terrifying figure considering the state average of Wyoming is 6%.  It is noted that a large amount of delinquent juveniles are from the Wind River Reservation with charges consisting of minor in possession, public intoxication, or driving under the influence of alcohol. Through multiple studies it is estimated that every 3 out of 5 families are well below the poverty line. It is suggested that this is at the fault of the Bureau of Indian Affairs due to the economic shifts and changes in policies that the tribes have zero control of.With statistics such as these in mind, it is abundantly clear that the Wind River reserve is in drastic need of government assistance as well as general awareness from the public on the poverty associated with many reserves all across the country.

===The Black 14===

The civil rights movement of the 1960's and the racial tensions it created were not exclusive to the most populous states of the country but to every state and city in the United States, including Wyoming. At the time Wyoming was the least racially diverse state in the country. Recent statistics show Whites represent 85.5% of the population followed by Hispanics, American Indians, Blacks and other minorities. Yet despite this racial hegemony, discrimination persisted even with the Public Accommodations Act of 1957 in Wyoming, and civil rights laws passed by congress.

There was however a large representation of African-Americans involved in athletics at the University of Wyoming. This was primarily due to the strong commitment to athletics by the University president George Humphrey. He hired a team of prominent directors, coaches, and scouts led by head coach Lloyd Eaton to bring prospective athletes from across the country to play for the school's football team. In 1969, the Wyoming Cowboys were set to play the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars, a university located in Utah, a state where 62% of the population is Mormon. Before the game on Friday, October 17th, 14 of the African-American players requested a meeting with coach Eaton to discuss the policies of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (known more colloquially as the LSD Church or the Mormon Church) and how they planned to protest these policies by wearing black arm bands in the next game, commonly used as a symbol of mourning in the athletic world, in this case it was intended to symbolize the suppression of their inalienable religious rights. The Coach's response was to suspend all 14 players from the team. The policies of the church claimed that men of colour could not become priests, and were denied the right to worship in other areas of the church. The suspension brought athletics into the issue of civil rights. The University of Wyoming received considerable coverage for denying the students their first amendment rights and its reputation was severely damaged, though they claimed the suspension was disciplinary and in no way reflected the suppression of their rights or indifference to their situation.

It was due to this incident that all but one of the fourteen men left the university.  Yet despite the discrimination and animosity, ten of the fourteen would go on to graduate from college and of those ten, four went on to have careers in the National Football League, most notably Tony McGee who played eleven seasons for three different teams, and Tony Gibson, who played for the New England Patriots. Despite these impressive careers, the issue was not truly settled until June 1st 1978 when the President of the Church changed Mormon doctrine to enable men of all colours to be priests.

===Resource Economy of the 21st Century===

Wyoming contributed to sustaining a substantial part of the agricultural sector in the United States for most of the 20th century. Specifically, this is evident within the cattle industry. After WWII, there were rapid migrations towards Western states and consequently, the market for cattle had expanded greatly. In 1947 the vast state of California acquired more cattle from Wyoming then from the prominent cattle states, such as Illinois and Iowa. Wyoming's dominance in the beef industry is apparent in land use statistics following the war. Mid-20th century Wyoming, saw approximately 40 percent of the state's 97,914 square miles being used for farm and ranch land. By the 50's however, there seemed to be a shift in focus on new and undiscovered sources of energy. Economic development for the state of Wyoming was hindered during this time period as it maintained great focus on rural agriculture. Clinging to the image of the cowboy, the state lacked the strong business image necessary to survive in the contemporary economic realm. In reality, only 4 percent of the population worked on ranches or farms. Post-war era witnessed a migration from rural farm land to the urban areas. This was due in large part to the lack of job opportunity and long periods of drought which swept Wyoming during the 50's. These population shifts were successful in creating new markets and expanding those previously established. The oil industry continued to flourish undeterred, men returning from WWII took positions in many of the new and existing oil refineries throughout the state. Cheyenne's Frontier Refinery and Sinclair facilities were the sources of job creation for hundreds of returning veterans. During this period came the discovery of large deposits of uranium in Southern Campbell county and deposits of Trona near Green river. By this time ambitious entrepreneurs and businessman flooded the state and began drilling for undiscovered minerals. The deepest well in the country was drilled in West poison Spider Field at 14,309 feet. The discovery of uranium led to a modern day gold rush, uranium exceeded coal in production for the first time during the early 50's. . Uranium is the main ingredient in nuclear weapons, and the Cold War was an era in which the United States was in a nuclear arms race with Soviet Russia. This entailed that any state who had large deposits of Uranium would prosper. Wyoming fell in this category as multiple mining expenditures were launched to find this ingredient. Wyoming experienced economic productivity from these ventures but the pursuit of uranium proved to be a double edged sword. These mining areas were not safe or suitable communities for citizens and as more ventures took place; the population in the immediate area decreased.  When the uranium ventures ended, a period of decline took place as the communities then became empty and unproductive. For example; Jeffrey City, Wyoming had a population of four thousand prior to becoming a hotbed for uranium mining. After the venture, only 25 percent of the population remained.   

Wyoming's dependency on natural resources for economic growth continued during the 70's. Refineries in Casper, Thermopolis, Sinclair, Cheyenne, Newcastle, Greybull provided revenue for the expansion of urban areas throughout the state. Refineries under the command of Texaco, and Standard Oil produced million of barrels of oil, these large companies established offices in nearby counties. The oil embargo in 1973 by Arab countries saw the sharp increase in price for gasoline. Oil exploration increased in the state, multi-national corporations saw the attraction of Wyoming and the opportunities it provided. Coal became crucial during this time due to the increasing demand by electric power plants. Wyoming was the 3rd fastest growing state in the United States from 1970 to 1980, the population increased 41 % from 332,416 to 469,557. This drastic increase in population also presented many social issues for the state. Lack of available housing, schools unable to adapt to the influx of new students, demand for social services, increase in crimes, lack of law enforcement officers. The State government was brought in to help with the mass social disorganization. Even in the midst of relative economic prosperity in the mineral production industry and a great boom specifically in the 1970s, greater industrial growth did not occur and the boom did not last. Between 1981 and 1996 over half of the jobs in the mining sector were lost, due largely to the lack a major urban centre that was necessary to sustain the business economy.


Wyoming's economy in the 21st century is driven primarily by tourism, natural resources, and agriculture. Starting out as a predominantly agricultural society during the 19th century the state has become increasingly dependent on the extraction of non-renewable resources to fuel it's economy, including coal, natural gas and a variety of ores such as copper and gold. Agriculture however still plays an important role in the state, more than a means of production, it represents a way of life for the citizens of Wyoming. 

Approximately 90% of land in Wyoming is described as rural, 37% of the states population live in rural communities of 2500 people or less, their primary source of income is through farming of crops and livestock. The State consists of 11,000 farms with the average farm size at 2,726 acres.The population of livestock far exceeds the amount of people in the state, recent estimates suggest over one million cattle, and more then 800,000 sheep. It is also one of the top producers of beef in the country. Although the beef industry suffered a set-back during the 80's due to increased public demand for healthier food, and lean meat,the industry has since revamped its efforts in providing a variety of products which  take into account the concerns of the customer. The value of Wyoming's agriculture industry is around 943 million dollars making it the third largest industry in the state. 

Almost half (48%) of the land in Wyoming is owned by the Federal government. Federal agencies exercise heavy control over the state's grazing, logging, and mining, which often leads to conflicts between the different levels of government. Conflicts can also arise in other areas such as issues of wildlife conservation. In 2012, the Federal government dispensed with policies intended to ensure the protection of wolves in Wyoming, citing the increase in population. Wildlife agencies at the state level had worked for years to save the at-risk animal from extinction in the state. This recent lift of protection would allow the hunting and killing of wolves, which would undermine the efforts made during years spent to save the species.

The tourism industry in Wyoming had its early beginnings during the boom of the 70's, however it seemed largely unorganized and reactionary, with hotels and small organizations making some effort to take advantage of the influx of new people arriving in the state. Since then, tourism has become the second largest industry in Wyoming grossing over 2.8 billion dollars annually. In 2010, the total number of tourists increased by 4% bringing in 8.34 million people. The tourism industry also provides employment for over 28,000 people. The main attractions of Wyoming are its national parks, especially Yellowstone Park and Grand Teton National Park. It is estimated that 30% of visitors to the national parks are from overseas. The visitors are attracted to the small towns, friendly people, and the lush green scenery of Wyoming.
[[File:Grand Teton National Park.jpg|thumb|left|Grand Teton National Park]]
Not surprisingly, Wyoming's largest industry is the natural resources industry. While the 40s and 50s experienced a decline due to alternative fuels available; the 70s saw a boom as new technologies such as strip mining were created.  Developments such as the Clean Air Act of 1970 also bolstered this increase. Coal remains as one of Wyoming’s most important staples to this day as Wyoming remains the number one producer of coal in the country; it has 45,055 square miles underlain by coal, producing over 438.5 million tons of coal in 2011, and it represents 40% of total coal production in the country. The mining industry alone provided 16 billion dollars in revenue for the state in 2011. Wyoming is also the leading producer of soda ash, betonite clays, and uranium. 33% of the uranium industry workforce in the U.S is represented by Wyoming. The state also has the largest deposits of trona in the world near Green River, making it one of Wyoming's most valuable minerals.

Wyoming also leads in the production of natural gas and crude oil. Out of the 23 counties in the state, 20 of them are responsible for the production of either crude oil or natural gas. Figures in 2010 show the sale of 53.1 million barrels of crude oil and 2,517 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Wyoming is the 2nd best producer of natural gas and the 7th best producer of crude oil in the country. Wyoming's strong energy industry is the reason for the states continued stability in face of the 2008 financial crisis. Since 2010 the job growth rate of Wyoming has been faster than the U.S average. The unemployment rate continues to decrease from 5.3% compared to the U.S rate of 8.3%. Wyoming has shown it's dependency on natural resources to build a stronger economy throughout history, and in order to maintain this growth the state must continue to build and create new industries if its aim is to become a driving force for the 21st century.

===Criticism===

Wyoming benefits off sectors such as mining, cattle breeding, and tourism but its lack of diversification has given it scrutiny. Scholars such as Frieda Knobloch have criticized the government for depending too highly on these specific sectors. Moreover, they argue that the federal government owns almost half of the state, which impedes economic productivity. The Federal government's control in Wyoming limits the free market and prevents any competitive gains. This is a huge problem for Wyoming which makes this state fundamentally different than many others. Wyoming was certainly in a better position economically after the Second World War but a diversification of their economy remains to be seen. 

===The Wagon Wheel Project===
[[File:US Atomic Energy Commission logo.jpg|thumb|US Atomic Energy Commission logo]]
Wyoming was not home to the typical post-war military nuclear testing; however, the state has its own unique nuclear history regarding Project Wagon Wheel. Through the US Atomic Energy Commission and the El Paso Natural Gas Company, plans were created to use underground nuclear explosions to help extract Wyoming’s natural gas reserves. In the late 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission took interest in obtaining natural gas from the large reservoir in Wyoming. At the time, natural gas was highly valued, thus many corporations saw this obtainment as a smart investment. The Atomic Energy Commission had strong backing for natural gas extraction from oil and gas corporations, and most importantly, the federal government. Wyoming’s nuclear history begins with the El Paso Natural Gas Company buying the vast natural gas fields that lay under Wyoming and specifically under Sublette County. Despite initially being unable to reach gas, El Paso proposed to the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1958 that nuclear energy could be used to help acquire the natural gas. The Atomic Energy Commission quickly sanctioned four nuclear tests throughout the American mid-west under its plowshare program to spread peaceful nuclear energy. 
	
Throughout the 1960s, nuclear blasting practices were conducted to see if these procedures could in fact extract marketable natural gas. Testing sites were situated in both Colorado and New Mexico, and in their trials, the Atomic Energy Commission managed to gather a substantial amount of natural gas. Thus, nuclear blasting procedures were contracted to Sublette County, Wyoming, and this contract was heavily influenced by the El Paso Gas Company. The fourth and largest experimental nuclear test, dubbed project Wagon Wheel by national media, would be located 19 miles south-southeast of Pinedale, Wyoming. El Paso estimated some 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas might be in the region and began designing their largest experimental explosion. El Paso and the AEC planned to explode five 100-kiloton nuclear warheads in a single well from 9 000 – 18 000 feet below the surface. Furthermore, the explosions had to be detonated individually in sequence to conform to nuclear treaties limiting the size of detonations.  
[[File:WYMap-doton-Pinedale.PNG|thumb|left|Location of Pinedale, Wyoming in Sublette County]]	
Little research had been conducted to examine the consequences of nuclear blasting. Research developed in the late 1960s, and people began to worry about their personal safety, and the safety of their drinking water. As plans for the project began to develop further, people became more skeptical and had a greater concern for the effect of nuclear blasting on their crops, wildlife, and livestock. 
	
The Wagon Wheel Information Committee (WWIC) was formed by a group of concerned citizens who began to educate themselves on the effects of nuclear blasting. The WWIC began to worry tremendously about their beef industry, which contributed heavily to the Wyoming economy. The WWIC discovered that the aftermath of blasting could result in the grass becoming contaminated with tritium, a poisonous substance. In turn, the cattle would consume this grass, and thus contaminate their beef and milk.

Public outcry emerged in March of 1972, as the local government and citizens of Sublette County strongly opposed the federal government’s Wagon Wheel Project. The committee raised questions about the inevitable contamination of wildlife and why El Paso decided to cut costs and burn-off radioactive material instead of safely storing it. The AEC maintained there was a low risk to humans but local opposition continued to mount in Sublette. The WWIC was limited by Wyoming statutes prohibiting votes on public policy so they held an unofficial “straw vote” in November 1972 instead. The results of the pool were overwhelmingly against project Wagon Wheel with 78% of citizens voting against the test. Meanwhile, the WWIC wrote Senator Cliff Hanson formally requesting him to set up a meeting in Washington for February 5th. Ten community citizens of Sublette met with AEC and the Environmental Protection Agency where they demanded Wagon Wheels cancellation and even appeared on the Today Show. The coming winter also brought opposition from Congress where Wyoming’s lone congressman, Teno Roncalio, showed that the previous nuclear tests had been more costly than their possible gas revenue. President Nixon's budget plan did not even provide the project with funds until 1977. The fact that the Wagon Wheel Project was never funded, the combined pressure from the WWIC and Roncalio’s economic arguments helped de-fund the Wagon Wheel project, which never received the government grants it required.  

The Wagon Wheel Project further demonstrated the importance of beef for the Wyoming economy. This project could have potentially jeopardized that industry with nuclear fallout and contamination. Project Wagon Wheel also reflects the continuous conflict between local and federal governments in Wyoming after World War II and how local power had some influence in public policy. In 1974 El Paso used the Wagon Wheel shaft to test a form of hydraulic fracturing to acquire gas which ultimately failed sealing off the hole and was never reopened.

===Wyoming Tourism===
	Wyoming tourism began to develop as an industry in the late 1880s, offering a wide range of places to go, things to see, and activities for tourists. Tourism in Wyoming revolves around its natural beauty, wildlife, and its history of ‘Cowboys and Indians,’ with some places called the &quot;last of the Old West&quot;.
	Wyoming tourism was initiated around 1887 when Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show was at its height of popularity, and residents began opening dude ranches. [[File:Yellowstone Natl Park poster 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Yellowstone National Park poster, circa 1938]]Dude ranches drew in many Eastern European tourists who wished to experience the mountains; this particular branch of tourism peaked in the early 1900s, and experienced dramatic decline in the 1930s. After World War II, the Wyoming’s tourism industry exploded, allowing it to expand its resources and the variety of activities for visitors. Teddy Roosevelt’s conservationist efforts also helped endorse Wyoming tourism. Teddy Roosevelt named the state the home of the first National Monument (Devils Tower) in 1906. In more recent years, the tourist industry has slowed down. Wyoming residents still continue to enhance tourism within the state by increasing both the number and variety of attractions. 
	Tourists are most often drawn to Wyoming for the natural physical attractions of the state. In 1872, Wyoming became home to Yellowstone National Park, the first national park in the world. Shoshone Forest and Devils Tower were also appointed the first National Forest (in 1891), and the first National Monument, respectively. The state is home to the town of Jackson Hole, a popular resort valley surrounded by Rocky Mountains, popularized as a tourist destination due to the work of conservationists like Horace Albright. Jackson is home to numerous attractions such as the Jackson Hole Fall Arts Festival, a Lake Lodge, a Mountain Resort, and the National Elk Refuge, where thousands of elk reside each winder. Sleigh rides among the elk take place from mid-December through April. Wyoming is also home to Grand Teton National Park, which attracted more than 2,500,000 people in 1965 alone, as well as many other historical sites, parks, and monuments. [[File:Grabill - Devils Tower-4.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of Devils Tower, 1890 by John C. H. Grabill]]Devils Tower is of particular importance to tourism as it attracts over 400,000 people each year.  Established on September 24th 1906, in Crook County,the formation rises 1,267 above the surrounding terrain for an overall elevation of 5,112 feet above sea level.
	As technology developed, the variety of tourist activities grew. At dude ranches, tourists can horseback ride, canoe or raft, fish, and participate in guided hiking or wilderness pack trips. If visitors are interested in arts and culture, there are many places where they can explore Native American culture and art, cowboy singers, and local craftspeople. There are several fairs and festivals in Wyoming, such as the Annual Celtic Festival, Wyoming Brewers Festival, and Gold Rush Days for cultural explorers, as well as weekly small-town rodeos. 
For tourists who are more interested in nature, there are several national parks to visit and scenic by-ways for road trips; travelers can also pan for gold, bird-watch, hunt, mountain bike, visit hot springs, and rock hound to experience the outdoors. If visitors are more active and adventurous, ATV riding, canoeing, kayaking, rock climbing, and cavern tours are available. In the winter, tourists can participate in cross-country and downhill skiing, ice climbing, dogsledding, snowboarding, and snowshoeing. Despite the success of many conservationists, who have worked hard to ensure that Wyoming tourist destinations remain places of natural beauty and recreation, there remains an ongoing conflict between conservationism and commercialism.

	More recent studies in Wyoming have found that historic sites produce more profit and have a greater positive economic impact than other activities in the state’s tourism industry; however, the state may be slow to develop more sites due to the high cost of doing so. Wyoming residents are still seeking ways to improve tourism and appeal to wider ranges of people. For example, Jackson Hole has introduced new ways of drawing in tourists, through the installment of relaxing spa retreats to typical tourist attractions.

===Taxation===

Wyoming utilizes a sales tax while avoiding a state income tax and also implemented a mineral severance tax in 1969, which effectively cuts a percentage of the industries profits.  Severance taxes provide nearly one third of the states budget. The constitution of Wyoming unlike others states confers state ownership of water resources, which has resulted in litigation with downstream states over water rights. 

Almost 50 percent of the states land is under federal control. Problems between state and federal industries are usually because of corporations desiring further control over federal lands.

===Nuclear Weapons===

The history of nuclear weapons in Wyoming stems from the creation of the F.E. Warren Air Force base, which has no airplanes. It is however, one of the largest missile command bases in the nation. The first deployment of Atlas missiles were established in 1960. The missiles were scattered in ranching country across southeast Wyoming. The deployment of the first 24 Atlas missiles in Cheyenne did not create much controversy. The base had always been considered a good neighbor, and the federal spending that came along with the base provided a good economic boost for the community.  Safety concerns have plagued the base since the early 1980s, with a series of accidents surrounding the MX missiles.

===Richard Cheney===


In 1978, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Cheney was elected to Wyoming’s sole seat in the House of Representatives and was re-elected five times. Cheney grew up in Casper, and attended the University of Wyoming. In 1995 Cheney became the president and CEO of the Halliburton Company. Cheney later became Vice President under George W. Bush on the Republican ticket in 2000.</text>

==National Parks Development and Organization==

To understand Yellowstone National Park's importance in Wyoming history, one must look at how national parks began to expand into educational, organized resources for the public in the United States of America.	
[[File:Yellowstone Natl Park poster 1938.jpg|thumbnail|left|A 1938 poster done by the Ranger Naturalist Service in the hopes of bringing more people to experience the natural history of Yellowstone.]] In the late 19th century, it became apparent there was need for a sense of organization and management within national parks, which both were sorely lacking. This was an issue which began to draw attention early into the 20th century. At this time, Washington was dominated by men of science, and these individuals were vocal in promoting protection of parks because of the lessons they felt the public could learn from the natural history within national parks. When those also voicing opinions on a need for an organization asked for help in promoting educational and scientific use of national parks, many of the prominent Washington scientists responded. This lead to the creation of the National Parks Association (NPA).
[[File:NPS DirectorandStaff.jpg|thumbnail|Stephen Tyng Mather (first director of the United States National Park Service) and his staff in Washington, D.C., 1927 or 1928. From left to right: Arno B. Cammerer, Arthur E. Demaray, Stephen T. Mather, George A. Moskey and Horace M. Albright.]]
&lt;br /&gt;The creation was made official on May 19th, 1919 in Washington, D.C. A small group of notable male figures such as J. Walter Fewkes, a prominent anthropologist, H.K Bush-Brown, a sculptor famous in the United States and many more got together and signed articles of incorporation to form the NPA. The NPA was not the only service advocating for the conservation and protection of parks. 

&lt;br /&gt; There was also the National Park Service (NPS). An important part of the NPS was educating the public about national parks. Two prominent figures at this time were Stephen Mather and Horace Albright. During the early efforts of Mather and Albright, it grew clear that there was a need for an organized national park system. For congress to recognize such a need and pass the proper legislation, Mather and Albright worked to generate public support for national parks, increasing accessibility and publicity.  The NPS sought to establish firm educational standards for the national parks. It was on August 25, 1916 that Congress passed legislation giving birth to the NPS.  The “Organic Act” as it was called, laid out the basic mission the NPS wished to achieve: “to conserve the scenery and natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future nations.” The significance of the NPS was extremely important for national park's growth and development. NPS Bureau Historian, Barry Mackintosh, believes that the NPS, as well as systematic park administration, paved the way for comparable agencies. As time passed, parks grew significantly more organized, manageable, and educational, thanks to organizations like the NPA and the NPS.

==Early Years and Animal Protection==
Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872 by Ulysses S. Grant, covers more than 3300 square miles in area. While mostly located in the upper northwest corner of Wyoming, parts of Yellowstone also extend into Idaho and Montana. For generations, people from all over the world have come to Yellowstone to experience everything that it has to offer, including the geysers, animals, and scenery. Among the people attracted to Yellowstone were poachers, drawn by the large variety and number of animals in the park. In 1886, the Secretary of the Interior took more action to protect the park and Yellowstone came [[File:Grizzly Bear Yellowstone.jpg|thumbnail|left|Grizzly Bear at Yellowstone]] under military jurisdiction. In 1894, greater action was taken and the Lacey Act was passed by Congress which gave full protection to wildlife in Yellowstone Park, with the exception of wolves and coyotes. This paved the way for future wildlife and environmental movements. The Lacey Act also imposed a $1000 fine on anyone who was convicted of shooting bison. Regardless, by 1902 there were less than 25 bison in some herds.
[[File:Moose-00473.jpg|thumb|Moose in Yellowstone]]


Eventually bison from private ranches in Texas and Montana were brought into Yellowstone and managed intensively like cattle until 1936. Other animals that roam the park include bears, moose, coyotes, elk, and the Pronghorn antelope. In addition to bison, bears were also a main attraction of Yellowstone. For hundreds of years they wandered the park, eating berries, shrubs, and carcasses of winter killed bison and elk, but once humans arrived they disrupted the bears natural habitat. By the 1930s the bears search for food became troublesome, and with campgrounds popping up the bears were beginning to eat from the garbage. By the 1960s, it had gotten so far out of hand that the bears were approaching cars and begging for food. Yellowstone had to initiate an intensive bear management program to restore the grizzly and black bears' subsistence on natural foods. As part of the program, regulations that prohibited the feeding of bears was strictly enforced. The park is also home to elk, which is has the most abundant large animal population within Yellowstone. With the forest fires destroying their most heavily relied on source of food, the Douglas-fir, the moose population is also consistently decreasing. In this way, Yellowstone has a fragile ecosystem which has to be carefully managed.

==Yellowstone and the Civilian Conservation Corps==

	The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was vital force in the development of national parks across the United States. Developed after World War I and during the Depression, this organization aimed to help decrease the number of unemployed youths in America. As a result of  devastation from the war, the jobs provided by the CCC often involved forms of environmental restoration and disaster-prevention. There was a very strong sense of the need to re-create beauty among nationally and publicly recognized sites. To achieve this, many members of the CCC were put to work creating camp grounds and buildings within the national parks, many of which still exist today. The CCC are known to have helped to generate Acadia National Park (Maine), Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona), and Theodore Roosevelt National Park (North Dakota), among others. 


	The CCC was also vital to the restoration of Yellowstone National Park in the 1930s. In the height of the depression, funding for maintenance and improvements for national parks was scarce. As a result, public attendance at Yellowstone decreased by 12% in 1931, 3% during 1932, and 29% in 1933, and threatened to continue declining if action was not taken. To stop this trend, the Franklin Roosevelt government provided Yellowstone with a group of CCC workers who were mainly responsible for the construction of lodgings and camping areas, as well as garages for the Yellowstone employees. Some of these projects included the Lamar Buffalo Ranch and the residential area just below Mammoth headquarters. They were also responsible for basic maintenance of trails, basic security, and environmental protection against forest fires, invasive pests, and overpopulation.


	Another main contributing factor to the decline of Yellowstone in this period were the forest fires that raged during 1931. These fires devastated the forests in the park, removing a significant amount of the natural beauty. With the goal of beautification in mind, the CCC workers developed a nursery where they grew trees to replace those that had perished in the fires. This nursery provided all the greenery for the park’s reforestation and beautification projects. The CCC were also in charge of developing fire-prevention methods to avoid another similar tragedy. They organized a flying squad to monitor designated areas for signs of fire outbreaks, as well as specialized crews on the ground.


	Without the construction and beautification efforts of the CCC, the revival of Yellowstone would not have been possible.

==Bison and Wolves in Yellowstone National Park==
[[File:Bison near a hot spring in Yellowstone.JPG|thumb|Bison near a hot spring in Yellowstone]]
It is estimated that bison arrived in the Yellowstone area before the most recent period of intermountain glaciation.  By synthesizing several historical accounts from the time, it is believed that the bison population in Yellowstone in the mid-1800s exceeded one thousand.  At this time, the area that become Yellowstone National Park was recognized through treaties as Indian territory.  The Shoshone, Bannock, Crow, and Blackfeet bands had lived in the Yellowstone region for over 8,000 years and many other groups often visited the area.  However, when Yellowstone National Park was created in 1872, the land was seized from these tribes.

This appropriation was the beginning of the demise of the bison.  Not only were the bison hunted for sport, both within and outside the park boundaries, but there was also a market for bison meat and hides for tanning.  This demand inspired a surge in poachers who killed the bison indiscriminately.  Others were captured for private herds.  Despite the dramatic effect of poachers on the bison population, the most damage to the herds was done by the federal government.  While the original mission of Yellowstone National Park was to protect the wildlife, it was quickly realized that by controlling the bison, one could control the Indians.  Fueled by racial discrimination, the government dispatched soldiers with the express purpose of slaughtering the bison in order to control the ‘Indian problem’.  By the late 1880s, nearly every Indian tribe was forced out of Yellowstone and confined to reservations and by 1902, only 23 bison remained in Yellowstone, the only native free-roaming herd in the country.  With the passage of the Lacey Act in 1894, the bison were finally protected.

The bison were not the only animal threatened in Yellowstone National Park during this time period. Predator control was enforced in the park after its inception and the Northern Rocky Mountain wolves, native to the Yellowstone area, were specifically targeted. It is reported that at least 136 wolves were killed in the park between 1914 and 1926 and thousands more were killed outside the park boundaries. Many settlers in Wyoming feared the wolves and when the wolves occasionally targeted ranchers’ livestock, the overarching public attitude at the time equated wolves with vermin and sought their extinction.  The preferred method of extermination used by wolf hunters was poisoned animal carcasses.  By the 1940s, wolves were rarely reported within the park, and by the 1970s, there were no signs of a wolf population at all.
[[File:Reintroduced wolves being carried to acclimation pens, Yellowstone National Park, January, 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Wolf Reintroduction in Yellowstone]]

The regrowth of both the bison and wolf populations has been relatively successful.  By 1954, the bison population had already increased to 1,477 and today it averages over 3,000 in a typical year.  Wolves were first reintroduced in 1995, but not without controversy, with the Wyoming government still listing wolves as predators and many in the farming communities actively opposed to the idea.  Despite the debate, the reintroduction went ahead and the wolf population in 2011 was recorded as at least 98 wolves in 10 packs, showing a real success.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''''Wyoming in Popular Culture, 1868-present'''''==

=='''''Introduction'''''==
	The state of Wyoming has had its impact on American culture as strongly as any other state. Known for its sprawling mountain ranges, grass plains and low population density, Wyoming has been a romanticized part of American culture for over a hundred years. In the days of the Wild West, Wyoming was full of buffalo herds and cowboys. Wyoming was originally inhabited by the Crow, Snoshone, Cheyenne, Arapaho and Ute indians, and the &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; theme of Wyoming was popularized across America by Buffalo Bill and his Wild West troupe. His circus-like attraction included stories from cowboys and Native Americans, feats of skill, staged races and other attractions. [[File:Jackalope 101.jpg|thumb|right|Stuffed Jackalope in restaurant near Death Valley]]

	The state has also inspired the myth of the Jackalope, which has become almost legendary in American mythology.  A &quot;killer rabbit&quot;, the Jackalope gets it's name for having the body of a rabbit and antlers like an Antelope. The Jackalope was supposedly discovered by Douglas Herrick in 1982, and stuffed &quot;Jackalopes&quot; have since become a popular addition to many American households, hotels and bars. 

	Wyoming is also notable for the many landmarks it has. Jackson Hole, Yellowstone National park and the Devils Tower are some important ones. Jackson Hole is a large valley located near the western border of Idaho, containing grasslands surrounded by picturesque mountain ranges. Yellowstone National Park is perhaps more widely known than Jackson Hole. It was the first national park in the world to be established. It possesses very unique, almost undisturbed ecosystems, a still active volcano and multitude of geysers, the most well known being &quot;Old Faithful&quot;.[[File:Old Faithful Geyser Yellowstone National Park.jpg|thumb|left|Old Faithful Geyser]] Devil's Tower, located in Crook County was the first United States National Monument. Theodore Roosevelt established it as a national monument on September 24, 1906. It is a large igneous intrusion that rises over a thousand feet above the surrounding plains. Devil's tower was an important part of Native American folklore and is held scared by many. Today, it is a popular spot for climbers and sightseers. 

[[File:Mountain meadow at Yellowstone National Park Picture 1196.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mountain meadow at Yellowstone]] 

	Wyoming's unique landscape, national parks and mountain ranges make it perfect for outdoor activities. Skiing and snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing, canoeing and kayaking are all popular and attract people from around the world.

=='''Cowboys and the Wild West Ideal'''==

One of the most iconic images brought to mind when asked about Wyoming is the cowboy and the &quot;Old West&quot; ideal. The Western cowboy image is one of a young man on horseback, wearing a Stetson, and taming the wild land. The cowboy is a character that has been a part of the Western image for a long time. Wyoming has long been known as a picturesque, beautiful, wild and untamed scene by the Eastern states that was ripe for plunder and discovery. This image of Wyoming lead to the creation of Yellowstone National Park and the dude ranches of the 19th century.  The cowboy grew in popularity out of this idea because of his perceived intense connection with the wild nature which was lacking in urban states.  During the 19th century, when many Eastern states were industrializing, the cowboy became the image that represented the idea of returning to nature, and the wild, untamed, and unconquered ideal of the west. [[File:The Cow Boy 1888.jpg|thumb|The Cowboy 1887]]

In the 1880s there was a great increase in the establishment of dude ranches, or guest ranches, which provided closer lodgings to Yellowstone National Park. Until that time, the park was comparatively unattainable to those who were not wealthy because it would have consisted of a very long journey. This created an increased stream of tourists into the state and helped solidify the idea of the rough, untamed land of Wyoming.  The surge of tourism in the early twentieth century coincides with, and partially caused, the increasing popularity of the Wild West shows which maintained the idea that Wyoming was an exciting place filled with adventure where iconic western figures ruled the land.  These Wild West themed performances, for example the Buffalo Bill shows, changed the idea of the cowboy, from someone who held a monotonous, lonely job to an American hero of the west. This hero embodied the strength, determination and rugged appeal of the Western frontier.

The popular image of the cowboy today refers to the idealized image of the past frontier life. In reality, this life was not as romantic or heroic as it has been made out to be. The real cowboys of the Wild West were often single men moving along with their herd, leading a nomadic life. Nature did not make it easy for them, taking a toll on both the men and their animals. The cowboy image created a romantic depiction of the west, it was a place where each man could succeed and could make something of himself. Cowboys in Wyoming represented the idealized past, a nostalgia for the untamed land and simple living.

Dude ranches are still popular throughout the States, and especially in Wyoming. They have come a long way since the early days of western expansion and offer 5 star longings, shopping areas and other tourist attractions.  These ranches have transformed into a resort style business with outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts.  They still posses the classic Wyoming ideals of rodeos, trail rides, hiking and hunting but with a twenty-first century twist.

=='''Frontier Days and the Rodeo'''==

The rodeo is an iconic image of Western American culture, such as in the state of Wyoming, has remained an American tradition for over a century. The rodeo combines multiple elements of the Western culture into an event that consists of competitions, displays of skill, and performances that involve animals, Native Americans, horse back riding, as well as rope, knife and gun tricks. Rodeos started travelling to the Atlantic US in the 1880s lead by “Buffalo Bill”,[[File:Buffalo bill.jpg|thumb|Buffalo bill]] also known as William Cody. For many Eastern Americans the actions and culture depicted in the rodeos shaped their view of the Wyoming &quot;Wild West.&quot;  

Popular culture saw the rodeo as an arena of courage, strength, and tenacity but the injuries caused by such dangerous actions were a serious and hidden reality. Common injuries such as concussions and broken bones were and still are damaging to an individual’s body, but a less obvious danger was infection and disease. The rodeo arena was covered with animal waste and pathogens that created an unhygienic threat for anybody who came in contact with the space. When a performer was thrown from an animal, the impact with the toxic ground could create fresh wounds and expose them to infection. With poor living conditions and constant travel from one venue to another, infections were likely to become a serious and possibly life-threatening health concern. These problems were kept out of the public eye to maintain the popular culture perception of the invincible Western cowboy.

For much if its history, the rodeo has been a strong advertiser of cigarettes. This has lead to the coupling of cigarettes and cowboys in the rodeo which has been later seen in western movies. Mainly after the mid-twentieth century, cigarette companies, specifically smokeless cigarettes, have created their own image of the western cowboy through advertising and product placement. Most stereotypical cowboy imagery stems from cigarette advertisements. 

Although rough riding and roping shows appear to have existed in the mid 19th century, the first official rodeo show is attributed to Lander, Wyoming in 1893. From here on, many rodeo shows continued to bring forth entertainment to the public. Closely following the first show, Laramie, Wyoming introduced a rodeo show along with the new addition of 'bronco bucking' in 1895. A reward of twenty five dollars was even offered to anyone who brought a horse which no one could ride. A similar show was held the following year, pulling in at least 1,000 people who came to watch the wild shows. Despite the popularity of these yearly rodeo competitions, the city of Cheyenne stole the spotlight from Laramie by hosting a &quot;Wild West&quot; themed show, called Frontier Days. The first of which was held September, 1897.

The 1901 Frontier Days was held on August 28th and 29th. Two months leading up to this show, there was a contest for providing ideas for the upcoming show and whoever submitted the best idea for the event received a ten dollar prize. The contest was a rather ingenious idea from the Frontier Days Committee as many ideas were submitted. The committee benefited immensely by obtaining a huge list of ideas in which they didn't have to think up and also did not have to pay for any of the new ideas. They only had to pay the winner of the contest with the best idea. This contest allowed them to spend very little and in return get a list of events people wanted to see in order for the shows to benefit them in the long run. Some of the events included masquerade balls that were added to the shows in 1900 and vaudeville performances also incorporated into the shows in 1901.

On the front page of the Cheyenne Daily Leader on June 24th, 1901, they had the headline &quot;Greatest Wild West in the World&quot;. The article was referring to the eighth annual Frontier Days on August 30th and 31st. Some of the new events added were car races, as people were bringing vehicles from as far away as Denver, Colorado. The article claimed that &quot;more than 1000 cowboys, cowgirls, Indians, United States troops, etc.&quot; would be &quot;riding in the area at one time in a wild and indescribable rout of horseflesh and humanity.&quot; Special rates were offered by Union Pacific to promote more tourism in the area by bringing customers in from farther away. Highlights of the two-day show included a gymkhana race, and re-enactments of key events in Wyoming history including mock weddings and elections.

{{wide image|[[File:Annual Frontier Celebration, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 1910.jpg|Annual Frontier Celebration, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 1910]]|1800px|Annual Frontier Celebration}}

By 1922, the Frontier Days Committee was focusing on giving visitors a true western experience as they encouraged natives to wear &quot;Western garb&quot; to the events. Even World War Two could not stop the Frontier Days from going on. However, the rest of the state did not enjoy the tourism rates as much as Cheyenne managed to garner. They were continually out-shined by the state's national parks. The shows and rodeos outside of Cheyenne were mostly attended by natives of Wyoming.

The Frontier is still an annual event in Cheyenne, and runs for 10 days at the end of July.  Many events have been added to the rodeo in recent years, including a Wild West Museum and Indian Village where the history of Wyoming is proudly documented.  Over time, out of state tourism has declined which has caused the Frontier to modernize the rodeo, trying to appeal to a younger demographic.  Lady Antebellum, the popular American country music band, will be preforming at the 2013 Frontier as a pull for younger attendants and increased revenue.

=='''Bucking Horse and Rider'''==
[[File:Steamboat.svg|thumb|left|Steamboat]]The two symbols most associated with the state of Wyoming may very well be the cowboy and his horse. Though the date is much debated, the symbol called “The Bucking Horse and Rider” was first used in 1918 where it was worn by members of Wyoming’s National Guard whilst fighting in France and Germany in the First World War. The logo was originally designed by First Sergeant George N. Ostrom and was soon after adopted by the United States Army as a means of identifying gun trails, trucks, helmets and other equipment. Units were ordered to come up with a symbol that could be stenciled to their equipment on the battlefield and the bucking horse and rider was born. “At this time we were in intensive combat and my battery commander asked me how we could possibly comply with this request,” Wyoming cattle rancher Ostrom commented.[[File:2007 WY Proof Rev.jpg|thumb|The 2007 US Mint for Wyoming]] The commander of the 66th Artillery Brigade was so taken by the design he cancelled all other designs and began putting the insignia on all the equipment. Ostrom later returned to the 148th which became known as the “Bucking Bronco” regiment from Wyoming.

Since the First World War, the Bucking Horse and Rider has been used as a symbol of pride and a reminder of home in both the Korean and Vietnam wars. It is believed that the horse is meant to represent the legendary rodeo horse “Steamboat”. Steamboat was considered to be the best bucking horse of all-time and carried the title of the “horse that couldn't be ridden”. 

The evolution of the symbol goes beyond military uses. In 1935, to combat license plate counterfeiting, Secretary of State Lester Hunt commissioned Littleton, Colorado native Allen T. True to draft his own model for a state plate; this, to no surprise, included the Bucking Horse and Rider. The license plate still carries that symbol on it today. The Bucking Horse and Rider further branded the state when the United States Mint came out with Wyoming’s state quarter in 2007. It was the forty fourth coin released by the Mint in symbolism of Wyoming being the forty fourth state to join the republic on July 10, 1890.

The University of Wyoming also uses the legendary logo on their helmet with the silhouette filled in brown and outlined in gold. The UoW tradition with the logo is almost as old and storied as the United States National Guard’s is. The logo, which the university simply calls “Steamboat”, has been the athletic department’s logo since 1920. The logo and the meaning behind it have become so important to the state and school history that in 1991, to commemorate Steamboat’s 90th birthday, a statue replicating the logo was erected at the entrance of the athletic center; it is titled “Fanning a Twister”.

=='''&quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; William Cody'''==
[[File:Buffalo Bill Cody ca1875.jpg|thumbnail|left|Buffalo Bill in 1875]]Buffalo Bill was the nickname of the famous American Old West figure, William Frederick Cody. Cody was best known for his autobiographies which depict the adventures he had in his life. Many of the stories told are hard to distinguish between reality and fantasy due to the bewilderment of them.  

[[File:Viewing Hostile Indian Camp crop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bill Cody scouting a hostile Native American camp]]Bill Cody was born February 26, 1846 near Le Claire, Iowa. He was of Spanish-Irish descent. In 1853, his parents, Isaac Cody and Mary Anne Lealock moved their family of eight children to the Kansas frontier where they operated a small store. The family was against slavery, which was a prominent issue in Kansas and the United States at the time. This caused many problems for them as the pro-slavery group was very outspoken. These men tried to kill Isaac Cody, and ended up wounding him on one attempt. While his father was away on business, William heard of a plot to kill his father and rode out to warn him. This was his first of many adventures that inspired the famous stories of Buffalo Bill. In 1857, Isaac Cody died from a cold. This left William Cody as the oldest male of family at age 11. He left home to seek work. His first employment was as a cattle drover on the westbound wagon trains.

In 1863, after a drunken evening, Cody ended up signing up and became a soldier in the Seventh Kansas Regiment. He performed many services including spying on confederate soldiers as well as scouting for Native Americans.

After his time in the army, Cody worked as a buffalo hunter to provide food for the Kansas Railroad. During his employment Cody earned the nickname Buffalo Bill when over the span of an 18 month period, Cody claimed to have killed 4,280 buffaloes. Cody was known for his hunting skills, and recognized for consistently out-killing all of his fellow buffalo hunters.

Though Cody remained a scout for the American Army for most of his years, he only spent the summers participating in military causes. The rest of the year he would perform shows depicting his military accomplishments.In 1872 he began his performing career by playing himself in a melodrama of frontier life called Scouts of the Prairie. From here his entertaining career exploded as he became a National sensation. In 1872-1873 he formed the Buffalo Bill Combination. The trio consisted of Cody, Wild Bill Hickok, and Texas Jack Omohundro, who travelled across America performing their renditions on the American conflicts against Indian Nations. The performances also included displays of skill such as trick shooting, knife throwing and rope tricks. In 1878 Cody began incorporating Show Indians into his performances. The most notable Indian performer was Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull, like most of the participating performers, saw the Wild West Show as an opportunity to make money, to see parts of the world they were otherwise not allowed to visit, and to have a chance to meet high ranking federal officials. 

[[File:Buffalo Bills Wild West Show, 1890.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buffalo Bills Wild West Show - 1890]]In 1884 he conceived the concept for a show that would exemplify the days of the Wild West. It demonstrated the lives of the Native Americans and the first settlers, re-imagining the adventures of Cody and his past including buffalo hunting, his journeys over the plains,  and other aspects of settling the west. The show grew international popularity, as Cody and The Wild Wild West show traveled across North America and Europe as the exhibitions brought Cody great fame and wealth.

It was in 1894 when Buffalo Bill Cody left his mark on the state of Wyoming. While visiting, Cody found interest in a region close to Yellowstone Park. Cody and a team of business men founded a town, which they named for Buffalo Bill called Cody, Wyoming. The town was perfect for hunting, it had land available for ranches and farming, and possessed a natural beauty. The town was used for irrigation and helped bring a railroad to the county. Cody owned a lot of land in the county and he used this land to create the TE dude ranch.

William ''Buffalo Bill'' Cody died on January 10, 1917. A memorial statue and museum was built in Cody, Wyoming to honour his life.

=='''The Sundance Kid'''==
[[File:Sundance Kid.jpg|thumbnail|right|Harry Longabaugh circa 1901]]
One of the most iconic outlaws of the “Old West” is Harry Alonzo Longabaugh. Also known as the &quot;Sundance Kid”, Longabaugh was born in  Mont Clare, Pennsylvania in 1867. He was the fifth child in a family of devout Baptists. At the age of thirteen Longabaugh was thrust into the working world, as a hired hand at a local farm. Here he developed his skills as wrangler and grew desire to leave for the West. In 1882, at the age of fifteen, Longabaugh accompanied his cousin out west. Where they would work together to settle a ranch in Durango, Colorado. In 1884, Longabaugh moved to Cortez, Colorado where he found a job wrangling cattle. The drought of 1886  made work scarce, less water equaled fewer cattle, fewer cattle required less labour thus Longabaugh was laid off. Longabaugh crossed the border into Wyoming looking for employment from a local cattle company. Unfortunately the winter of 1886-1887 was particularly harsh causing the cattle population of Wyoming to decrease by fifty percent. Longabaugh was subsequently laid off again. This marked a transition period which would see Longabaugh transform from ordinary citizen to wanted outlaw. 
[[File:Wildbunchlarge.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Hole in the Wall Gang with Harry Longabaugh pictured bottom left, circa 1901]]
In February of 1887 Longabaugh found himself in Crooks County, Wyoming broke and without a penny to his name, after he traded all his possessions for food. Longabaugh desperate for money, stole a horse, saddle, and revolver from a local cowboy who worked for a powerful cattle company. He was captured on April 12, 1887 in Miles City, Montana where he subsequently escaped while in transit on his way back to Wyoming. Longabaugh was eventually recaptured and by June 22 he found himself back in Crooks County where he would await trial in the Sundance Jail. After several failed attempts at escaping Longabaugh pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eighteen months to be served in the Sundance Jail. Longabaugh’s moniker was born, he was known as the ''Sundance Kid''. Upon his release on February 5th, 1889 Longabaugh increasingly found himself in more trouble with the law. After allegedly threatening a deputy sheriff, the Crook County Sheriff’s department issued a warrant for his arrest, and a short stint living in Alberta, Canada, saw Longabaugh charged with cruelty to animals. By the early 1890’s he was back in Wyoming holding up trains and banks, and in the year 1896 or 1897 the Sundance Kid joined Butch Cassidy's the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. By 1908 the Sundance Kid made his way to Bolivia to escape persecution from the growing arm of the law and as the legend goes the Sundance Kid was killed in a firefight by the Bolivian army and police after committing a robbery of a local silver mine.

In popular memory Longabaugh has been characterized as somewhat of a Robin Hood type character, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. There is however no evidence to support these claims for in reality Longabaugh’s holdups frequently turned violent. In 1969 the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released forever preserving the Sundance Kid’s legacy. In the film the relationship between Cassidy and Longabaugh is highly fictionalized as they are depicted working as partners throughout their careers while in reality Longabaugh joined Cassidy’s gang quite late. Regardless the film helped preserve one of Wyoming’s most prominent outlaws for future generations.

=='''Owen Wister: Father of Western Fiction'''==
[[File:Owen_Wister_from_American_Heritage_Center.jpg|thumbnail|left|Owen Wister the father of Western fiction]][[File:The_Virginian_1902.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Virginian novel published in 1902]]
The Western genre has long centered around the conflict between cowboys and Indians, which has impacted entertainment for many years through novels, television, and movies. Cowboys in Western fictions are commonly depicted as a lone-rider on horseback riding across the vast deserts seeking vengeance or justice. These ideas which have revolutionized literature and movies all started with one man, Owen Wister, who was heavily influenced by the time he spent in Wyoming. He is credited for the creation of this classic Western hero and bringing forth this new genre of Western fiction.   

Born in Philadelphia in 1860, Wister grew up in a wealthy household which allowed him to study at Harvard and abroad in Europe during his youth.  Struggling with poor health, he came close to a nervous breakdown in 1891. Taking advice from his doctor, Wister traveled to Johnson County, Wyoming in hopes of rejuvenating his health. In Johnson County, Wister was exposed to a different kind of life and a new America. He marveled at the open land stretching for miles with so much character. This new lifestyle, culture, and society intrigued him and inspired him as he began to record observations of his travels. These notes contributed to his creation of Western fiction.  For 15 years Wister returned to Wyoming and continued to write about his experiences and encounters.  His writing career began with his first published work in 1892 called “Hank’s Woman.”  Wister got his big break in 1902 with the publication of his most famous piece of work. The Virginian was a historical romance centering around a cowboy on a cattle ranch.  It inspired later authors in the Western genre, such as Zane Grey.

Wister wrote about what he witnessed while in Wyoming. He believed the men who inhabited the area, around whom he based the character of cowboys, lived the best life anyone could live under the severe conditions of the West.  Wister truly believed in the ideal of the West, because of how it had impacted him in his life.  He thought it was a place where individuals could find restoration and self-discovery, and escape the limitations of the East.  Wyoming made a lasting impact on Wister which he shared with the rest of the world through his novels.

=='''Wyoming and Hollywood'''== 

Wyoming has been a central location in many famous Hollywood films.  Through its notable history of cattle ranching, Wyoming has set the stage for many popular movies.  The age of Hollywood Westerns flocked to Wyoming for its idealized landscape and notorious image of cowboys and ranching.  Cowboy boots and Stetson hats became the stereotype for Wyoming citizens in the eyes of society due to the many movies that were written and filmed around Wyoming.  Through Hollywood hits by John Wayne, Charlton Heston and Kenny Rogers, Wyoming was portrayed as a Western state burdened with outlaws, cowboys and vigilantes.
[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|Kenny Rogers preforming in later life.]]
The 1985 TV movie ''Wild Horses'' starring Western singer and icon Kenny Rogers was filmed and set in the Wyoming countryside.  The movie recounts the struggle of a man who moves to Wyoming to find work, ultimately resulting in him settling in the countryside and working with wild horses.  The movie depicts Wyoming in all its glory, showing the panoramic images of the mountains and grasslands.  Wild Horses, and many other Westerns filmed within the state focus solely on the iconic landscapes and ignore the industrialization occurring in Wyoming during the 20th century.  Hollywood’s focus on maintaining the image of Wyoming as a newly colonized Western state, lacking in industry and consumerism is no accident and allows the cowboy stereotype of the state to remain prominent in the eyes of society. 

However, not all movies based in Wyoming are connected back to their roots of cattle farming.  Director Steven Spielberg used Wyoming as a central location is his 1977 sci-fi film, ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''.  In this movie they used Wyoming’s large expanse of open fields as a theoretical landing spot for extra-terrestrial activity. The movie was received very well by the public and box office and for once portrayed Wyoming in a different light.  

The legacy of Wyoming in association with Western film culture is still present in their current society.  On November 12, 2012 Wyoming PBS ran a John Wayne film from 1956 entitled ''The Searchers''.  The movie received great reviews and was recently ranked as the seventh best movie of all time by British Film Institute’s Sight and Sound magazine.

Perhaps the most popular Hollywood movie to reference Wyoming in recent years, is Ang Lee's production of ''Brokeback Mountain''. The film is an adaptation of a short story also titled ''Brokeback Mountain'' written by Wyoming native Annie Proulx, staring Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. [[File:The searchers Ford Trailer screenshot (22).jpg|left|thumb|Scene from the 1956 hit The Searchers with John Wayne shown in red.]] This 2005 Oscar-nominated movie was a breakthrough and a shock throughout Hollywood, as it conveys the budding romantic relationship between two male sheepherders during a summer traveling through the Wyoming countryside.  This movie had a shockingly large impact in Wyoming pop culture where homosexuality was unacceptable and virtually unheard of at the time. In the last few years, homosexual scrutiny and issues have plagued Wyoming media and newspapers, where pro-gay advocates are trying to decrease hostility for the gay population. ''Brokeback Mountain’s'' popularity helped advance the movement of equality throughout Wyoming.   
[[File:The Laramie Project-Mercer Island High School-2005.jpg|thumb|Scene from the 2005 production based on actual events from 1998]]
In 1998, a homosexual student at the University of Wyoming, Mathew Sheppard, was murdered.  This violent and upsetting murder dominated the media throughout Wyoming and the rest of the world.  The murder was deemed as a hate crime, with Mathew being beaten by his assailants in the Wyoming town of Laramie.  The issue remained a constant area of discussion in the media due to the controversial issue of homosexuality in the west.   This event fueled the play “The Laramie Project”, which became a hit throughout the United States.  Starting in New York, the play made its way across the States and finally played in Laramie, Wyoming two years after production started.  Since then, The Laramie Project has been preformed in schools around Wyoming to help address the issue of homosexuality and prevent further discrimination and hate crimes.

=='''Wyoming Art'''== 
'''Origin of Art in Wyoming; A Native Perspective''' 

Art in Wyoming dates back to the early native population of the United States. The artwork of early Wyoming is thought to be part of traditional Dinwoody rock art. The first discoveries of these rock formation art works date back to 1870&lt;ref name=&quot;bleakblob&quot;/&gt;, from records kept by shoulders posted on the Wind River Indian Reservation.

Rock artwork is composed of a collection of painted imagery and engravings on the surface rock. Using radiocarbon dated soil deposits, archaeologists have estimated that these traditional Dinwoody petroglyph forms date back as far as three thousand years ago&lt;ref name=&quot;caveart&quot;&gt;[http://www.windriverhistory.org/exhibits/petroglyphs/petroglyphs1.html   Chief Washakie Foundation online forum, June 24, 2005 Echoes from the Valley Floor:

The Dinwoody traditional carvings are only found in the foothills of Wind River Mountains, Wyoming and Bighorn Basin in Central Wyoming. &lt;ref name=&quot;bleakblob&quot;&gt;[http://www-lib.uwyo.edu/theses/EP22998.pdf E.C.Burghard, &quot;Rock Art and the Perception of Landscapes: Dinwoody Tradition Rock Art Site 48FR311&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest collection of rock art is found in the Legend Rock Petroglyph site located in Hot Springs County, Wyoming.

The traditional rock art is a range of pictorial images reflecting life for native inhabitants including hunting and different gatherings, such as religious and social rituals.&lt;ref name=&quot;orignalart&quot;&gt;[http://www.windriverhistory.org/exhibits/ARARA/arara4.htm Chief Washakie Foundation online forum, June 24, 2005, Petroglyphs and Pictographs: Wyoming's Original Artwork, ARARA Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part these figures resemble human forms and animals,some of which were powerful spirits encountered during the natives Northern journey. About 75% of the mark making of the native tradition for petroglyphs composed of pecking, stripping and abrading techniques, using dark red and red-brown patina. This type of application of patina created a ghost like resemblance of the figures.

One of the images that have been identified is “Split boy,” which was found in Hot Springs County. The art depicts an ancient mythical figure that is split from the root of one set of feet. The image on the left is an image of “little boy”; however the meaning is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;legendrock&quot;&gt;[http://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/legend-rock Wyoming Heritage, The Wyoming State Historical Society, &quot;Legend Rock.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces of art do not only provide a glimpse into the past, they are also a useful primary source detailing the Indians interactions with the land from their perspective. Carving and paintings on rocks were produced by both male and female inhabitants because the native population believed very strongly in the power of the spirit over the power division of the sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;bleakblob&quot;/&gt;  These forms of art were the early beginnings of a cultural identity in Wyoming.


'''Wyoming Scene Painting'''

Wyoming’s reputation in the late nineteenth century as the “Cowboy State” reflected in the artistic representation of the state.  In particular, the American painter Frederic Remington (1861-1909) aggressively documented ''his version'' of the American West&quot;, in a collection of works capturing the picturesque landscapes and thriving cattle-boom in Wyoming during a period that spanned from 1868 to 1886.
 
[[File:Frederic Remington &quot;The Roundup&quot; 1888.jpeg|thumb|right|Frederic Remington &quot;The Roundup&quot; 1888]]

With his paintings of the American West, Frederic Remington constructed a romantic and nostalgic visual world that privileged a  masculine, white narrative while omitting minority groups’ histories. Remington’s images allude to his identity as a man “hopelessly dislocated from an idealized, sentimentalized pre-industrial time.”  His artwork “played a major role in creating the popular image of the West that persists today.”  Most of Remington’s paintings do not explicitly refer to the state of Wyoming in their content or title.  Arguably, his omission of locations and dates in the titling of his work was intentional; by refusing to reveal the locations depicted in his work, Remington allowed the paintings to be “transmuted ideologically into the American West itself.”  Consequently, Remington’s paintings do not reveal their locations and cannot be definitively linked to specific geographic locations in Wyoming. However, his idyllic, generalized portrayal of the American West constructed and preserved archetypes of the state that persist to this day in the public’s visual lexicon of Wyoming’s history. Remington’s studio has been reconstructed at Wyoming’s Buffalo Bill Historical Center, a testament to his lasting influence on visual culture in Wyoming and the importance of his vision in shaping a visual narrative of Wyoming during the cattle-boom.

[[File:Frederic Remington painting in Wyoming.png|thumb|left|The artist painting in Wyoming]]

Remington’s scenes of the west were defined the promoters of “masculinity, struggle, and depictions of men and horses,” as a theme and within this limited framework he omitted and manipulated his representations of native people and women to suit his perception of the past. In his paintings, native subjects adhered to common white misconceptions of natives; his images skewed reality and portrayed native subjects as savage characters, uncivilized and violent enemies who threatened white prosperity in the west. In his examination of Remington’s paintings, Peter Hassrick has argued that with his the stereotypical portrayals of natives, the artist romanticized their identity within American history, memorializing them as “mythic and thus less real.”  Critics of Remington have labeled his work as exhibiting a “maudlin, uncritical sentiment for days gone by,”  a conservative and traditional man longing to recreate his rose-coloured, white-centric view of the past. Hassrick summarizes his criticism of the world view promulgated by Remington in his paintings as a “metaphorical statement for the intrusion of an industrialized East of a basically defenseless and doomed West.”  By choosing to dramatize Wyoming’s past through the lens of manifest destiny, Remington denies us an opportunity to construct an art historical narrative of the state’s past through any other lens but his own.


'''Modern Painting Origins in Wyoming'''

Wyoming is not only the home to traditional art and the discovery of Dinwoody rock art,  but it is the birthplace of a prominent modern artist.  On January 28th, 1912, Paul Jackson Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming to Roy and Stella Pollock. To the family Paul was known as Jack. The Pollock family remained in Cody for ten months after Jackson was born, they then moved to San Diego, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1&quot;&gt;S Naifeh, and G White-Smith, Jackson Pollock An American Saga, (New York City: HarperPerennial, 1989), 10-72,506-621.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jackson Pollock Signature.svg|thumb|left|Jackson Pollock Signature]] When Jackson was older, he moved to New York City to study at the Art Students League of New York. Jackson emerged in New York as an elite avant-guard artist in the Abstract Expressionism movement, introducing drip painting technique. Instead of painting in an upright position, Jackson laid his canvas on the floor of his studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson2&quot;/&gt; He stood over the canvas moving his arm across the canvas; Jackson’s movement was captured on the canvas as a series of drips. Along with a new technique Jackson also used unconventional material. His paint was resin based enamels and he often used sticks to transfer paint to the canvas. Some of his pieces even had remains of cigarettes often mixed into his paintings. In 1945, Jackson married Lee Krasner, but the pair never had children. Throughout his life Jackson struggled with alcoholism.  The couple moved to the East Hampton area of Long Island, New York in hopes that the new location would help with Jackson’s struggle. On August 11, 1956, Jackson died in an alcohol related car crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson2&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Jg2AlZojlq8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jackson%20pollock's%20life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7jSTUOXBA-aW2QWznIG4BA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jackson%20pollock's%20life&amp;f=false D Solomon, Jackson Pollock: A Biography, (New York City, New York: Cooper Square Press, 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pollock-tomb.jpg|thumb|Pollock-tomb]] Jackson my have only lived temporally in Wyoming but his roots remained with him, he was of course the &quot;cowboy&quot; painter in New York, many colleagues noted he would walk the streets of New York in his beloved cowboy boots.

Another well-known Abstract artist and sculptor from Wyoming is Peter Forakis.  Forakis was born in Hanna, Wyoming in September, 1927 to a family of Greek immigrants.  At the age of 10 the family moved to California. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the California School of Fine Arts and moved to New York City to practice art. While in New York, he founded the Park Place, a cooperative art space in 1960 unfortunately the park had to closed in 1967. During his time in New York City, Forakis became a well known influential abstract sculptor, as his works were crafted using large sections of metals, arranged in geometric patterns. Abstraction for Forakis weighed heavily on mathematical principles superimposed on the natural world. Some of his most well known pieces include Hyper Cube in 1967, Tower of the Cheyenne in 1972 and Archimedes Cube which was a series from 1968. He moved back to California in 1979 and remained there until his death on November 26, 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Quantitative Analysis =
The data of the annual ridership from 1971 to 2011 within the Beijing subway system was obtained from the official website of Beijing subway&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;and is shown in Table 1. The life cycle phases are shown in Figure 1, from which we can see, the fast growing ridership indicates that the Beijing subway system is still in its growth phase now. But the existing data is plotted along with first half of the S-curve very well. Even though, the future development may not exactly follow the S-curve’s second half, it can provide a reference for the government when planning for the future, such as designing the network, station capacity and related policies. 

[[File:S curve of the Beijing Subway annual ridershipS curve.png|thumb|center|550px|Figure 1   S-curve of the Beijing Subway Ridership.]]
&lt;br /&gt;

===Equations:===

The data was then used to estimate a three-parameter logistic function of the form:

S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-to)]    (1)

Where:

S(t) is the predicted annual ridership; to is the inflection point at which ½ K is achieved.


The S(t) formula can be transformed to get a the following linear relationship:

Y = LN(Ridership/(K - Ridership))=c+b×t     (2)

Where:

b from the S-curve
	
c = -b * to   (3)

===Determine the Value of K:===

Here, K, is the saturation level of ridership, which has not been achieved for Beijing subway, so different K values were tested.

The '''“Golden Section Search”''' is used to coordinate with the “Least Squares method” to find the best K in the fastest way.

Before using the ''“Golden Section Search”'', four initial K values of 2,200, 2,500, 2,700 and 2,900 are tested. The results show that values of 2,500 and 2,700 are better than of 2,200 and 2,900, based on the strength of the R-square and t-stat numbers. So, the best value of K must lie in the interval [2,500, 2,700]. 

Then we use the ''“Golden Section Search”'', and the R(x) is used to represent the R-square number when the value of K is x.

* Set xl=2,500 and xr=2,700;
* 
* Set xl’= xl+ (xr-xl)×0.382 and xr’= xl+ (xr-xl)×0.618;
* 
* If R(xl)＞R(xl’) or both R(xl)＜R(xl’) and R(xr’)＜R(xl), then the best K must lie in the interval [xl, xl’], so set xr= xl’;
* 
* If R(xr)＞R(xr’) or both R(xr)＜R(xr’) and R(xl’)＜R(xr), then the best K must lie in the interval [xr’, xr], so set xl= xr’;
* 
* Otherwise, the best K must lie in the interval [xl’, xr’], so set xr= xl’, so set xl= xl’ and xr= xr’;
* 
* If xr- xl＜5, we are done; otherwise, go to step 1.

The result of the test of different K values are shown in Table2. After the test of K, a value of 2558.367 was used for it has the biggest  R-square and t-stat numbers. The results of its analysis is shown in Tables 3.

[[File:K value.png|thumb|left|1000px| Table 2   Determine the value of K]]










===Summary output:===

[[File:Regression result.png|thumb|left|600px| Table 3   Regression results when K=2558.367]]






























 
It can be seen that the R square is 0.925593 which is close to 1 and t-statistics is higher than 2, which means the results were statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval. Overall, this model seems to reflect the actual data.

This analysis gives the intercept of the predicted model.

In this case, the intercept was -275.882. 

b, was estimated to be 0.137371.

to = Intercept / -b=2008.299881.

With all the variables were found to solve for S (t), predicted ridership could be determined for each year. The resulting data is plotted in red in Figure 1. It forms an S-curve that fits the actual data as accurately as possible. 

In this case, there are some outliers in the data that affect the R-square value. It can be seen that the actual data itself does not perfectly follow an S-curve shape.

===Some Factors Affect the Trend of the Ridership:===

Some data did not follow the curve very well, but it does not mean the curve is incorrect. Some extension of the two existing lines were done in 1989 which attracted some ridership, and the ridership continued to grow rapidly to reach an all-time high level in 1995&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;. However, the ridership fell from 558 million in 1995 to 444 million in 1996, when fares rose from ¥0.50 to ¥2.00&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;. After fares rose again to ¥3.00 in 2000, annual ridership fell to 434 million from 481 million in 1999. In the summer of 2001, the city won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and accelerated plans to expand the subway. 7 new lines were opened from 2002 to 2008, including the Olympic Branch Line and the Airport Express. What is more, subway fares were reduced from between ¥3 and ¥7 per trip, depending on the line and number of transfers, to a single flat fare of ¥2 with unlimited transfers in 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;. The annual ridership reached 1.2 billion in 2008. After the 2008 Olympic, rapid extensions to suburban districts which attracted large number of commuters who live in the suburban but work in the central city&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;.

== Birth of the  Beijing Subway ==

[[File:History_of_Beijing_Subway_en.gif|thumb||right|400px|Figure 2   Development of Beijing Subway.]]

The first line began to construct in July, 1965 and trial operated in October, 1969.The system was opened to the general public in 1977 and to foreign visitors in 1980. It ran 21 km from the army barracks at Fushouling to the Beijing Railway Station and had 16 stations. This line forms parts of present day Lines 1 and 2.

===Technological===

* '''Learn technology from the Soviet and Moscow Metro :''' The Beijing Metro was the country’s first subway. For the lack of expertise in building subways, the Beijing subway was originally planned with the help of Soviet experts and the concept originally unveiled in 1953. Chinese planners took particular interest in the use of the Moscow Metro during the Battle of Moscow during World War II, and so the Beijing Metro was designed from the very beginning to serve both civilian and military ends. The deterioration of relations between China and Soviet Union disrupted subway planning. Soviet experts began to leave in 1960, and were completely withdrawn by 1963. The government of China decided to press ahead.

* '''Cut and Cover Tunneling :'''  At that time, it was sure the subway would be built deep underground for its military use. There was a debate on the method of constructing tunnels. Considering the geographical factors, such as soft stratum, cut and cover tunneling was used. But this method result in pavement destruction and traffic interference on the road surface in Beijing. So higher risk shield-tunneling was used when the line was extended after several years&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;.
*   
* '''Rail and Rolling Stocks :'''  The subway trains run on 1,435mm standard gauge rail and draw power from the 750V DC third rail. The original metro stock was built by Changchun Railway Vehicle Company. It was classified with the Latin-alphabet letters DK (Diandong keche ), which stand for Electric multiple-unit (EMU). In 1967, two DK1-class cars were built, but there was no record whether they did in fact operate in Beijing. From 1967 to 1970, 80 DK2-class metro cars were built by Changchun Railway Vehicle Company and 76 went to Beijing&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;. The Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp. Ltd., provides local assemblage, maintenance and repair services&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;.

===Early Market===
* 
* '''Limitation of Auto:''' In the 1970s, there are only 100,000 automobiles in Beijing, and nearly all of these cars are owned by the local administrative departments, enterprise and institution&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;. At that time, cars were too expensive for people to buy and it wasn’t until 1990s when the economic developed rapidly and the quality of people’s life improved in Beijing, cars were popular as private use than they had been previously. In the 1970s, the price of transit is reasonable and can be accepted. So, transit was the only traffic tool for people, especially when long distance tips were needed. 
* 
* '''Limitation of Bus:''' The bus network was rapid growth at that time. There were 96 routes in 1975 but the number of buses for long distance trips is not very big&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;. Long distance trips may require several transfers. The low frequency and poor reliability cost a lot of waiting time. Some other limits include the slow speed and small capacity of the bus.
* 
* '''Market and Advantages of Subway:''' After the emphasis of subway changes from the military to civilian, the initial 21 km line from the army barracks at Fushouling to the Beijing Railway Station stimulate the development of the west part of the city. It became the most important traffic tool for the west residents to go to work at that time, for example there were nearly 80,000 commuters in the Shijingshan district rely on the subway for commute. It was seen as a bridge which is built between the west and the central city. Even in the rapid growth period, the subway is so attractive for many reasons. The designing speed of subway 60km/ hour was much faster than the highest speed of the bus 40 km/hour. The 21kilometers line satisfied many people who want to have long trip and do not want to transfer. It is more reliable, which was one of the most important factor commuter cared about.
*

===Policies in the Beginning===

When the subway was started open in 1971, it was ruled that only members of the public with credential letters from their work units were permitted entry into the subway. In 1973, the policy changed that any passenger can take the subway buying a ¥0.10 ticket. The flat fare was not a burden in the early years for the Beijing people at that time. In 1978, joint commutation ticket for subway and electric car was launched to push the transit system in Beijing&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;. 

On November 11, 1969, an electrical fire which killed three people, injured over 100 reminded the government to attach more importance to the safety of the subway. Premier Zhou Enlai placed the subway under the control of the People’s Liberation Army in 1970. “Safe, accurate, efficient and service” was the operation tenet at that time&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;.

==Growth of the Beijing Subway==

===Technical Improvement===

All but two of the subway's 15 lines were built in the past decade as the system has undergone rapid expansion. The Olympic is a catalyst to expand the subway. The subway set a daily ridership record of 4.92 million on August 22, 2008, the day of the Games' closing ceremony. In 2008, total ridership rose by 75% to 1.2 billion. However, the Olympic is not the only contributor to the rapid development; technical improvement and policy support which would be discussed in the following part are also important factors of the success of the Beijing subway. 
* 
* '''Rolling Stocks:''' Considering some earlier batches having been subject to severe reliability and build quality problems, different classes of rolling stocks are introduced, including DK (“diandongkeche”-electrically operated passenger car), BD (“beijing ditie”-Beijing subway), DKZ(“diandongkeche zu”-a group of electrically-operated passenger car), SFX (updated DKZ5, train sets with full articulation and a radically redesigned front bulkhead)&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;. At the same time, train capacities have increased to more than 1,400, up 340 over previous formations. To cope with the increased demands, Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems were introduced. With the Automatic Train Control (ATC), stopping is accurate and journey times, headways and energy consumption are optimized. A signaling headway of 100 seconds was achieved. This has reduced service headway from 3 to 2 minutes and increased capacity by almost 50% per hour per direction&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;. 
* 
* '''Control System:'''In 2005, in order to better schedule trains and accurately calculate operating costs Beijing subway started to introduce Electro Industries GaugeTech (EIG). Its integrated power quality and energy management system allows the Beijing subway to monitor the operating conditions of all subway lines simultaneously, in the subway’s control center&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;. 
*  
* '''Operation:'''In the early days, the subway has only one operator, the wholly state-owned Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp., but now the Beijing MTR Corp., a public-private joint-venture with the Hong Kong MTR, manages two lines. MTR owns a 49% stake in the project, was required to provide 30% of the capital, and will receive a concession to run the line for 30 years&lt;ref name=&quot;R9&quot; /&gt;. 
* 
* '''Passenger Friendly:''' The subway became more passenger friendly with several infrastructure improvements. Early interchange stations in the Beijing subway are notorious for their long transfers. The average transfer distance in an early interchange station is 128 meters&lt;ref name=&quot;R10&quot; /&gt;. To solve this problem, some old stations were rebuilt to reduce the transfer time. The newer stations were built with more efficient transfers in mind. The stations capable of cross-platform interchanges are the first choice for the planners. Even if the alignment of the lines prevents cross-platform interchange, new interchanges will have a transfer distance no more than 100 meters&lt;ref name=&quot;R11&quot; /&gt;. The average transfer distance of new interchange stations is 63 meters, which compared with the older transfers is halved. By August 2008 it was claimed that all 123 stations had at least one access point available to wheelchair users. By the summer of 2008, the use of paper tickets, hand checked by clerks for 38 years, was discontinued and replaced by “Yikatong” (electronic tickets) that are scanned by automatic fare collection machines upon entry and exit of the subway. Stations are outfitted with touch screen vending machines that sell single-ride tickets and multiple-ride Yikatong fare cards. By 2011, Mobile phones can be used throughout the system, except for in the tunnels between stations on Lines 1 and 2.

===Policy Support===

A policy not to the subway but helped it by attracting more passengers is the traffic restriction policy in Beijing in 2008. This traffic regulations designed to limit the number of cars in use on weekdays based on car number plates. The drivers may shift to use the subway when they are restricted to use their cars. After a period of time, they may used to taking the subway and keep taking it even when their car are not restricted.

==Future of the Beijing Subway==

===Near Future (2012-2015)===



Beijing subway is planning to have 19 lines totaling 660km of track in operation by 2015, with an expected nine million passenger journeys a day. A “3,4,5,7” network, which means 3 circle lines, 4 horizontal lines, 5 vertical lines and 7 radial lines are planned to be built before the end of 2015. It is estimated the average walk distance will be less than 1 km within the Third Ring Road in Beijing. With the significant construction of urban rail systems, the government hopes that the public transit can have a mode capture of 50% in the central city in 2015&lt;ref name=&quot;R12&quot; /&gt;. 

To help improve the system, some new technologies are planned to be introduced into the system: advanced SCADA software systems will be used in the second phase of the Beijing subway Line 8 extension which can interlink various automation subsystems at station level; Train guard MT automatic train control system will be used in the Olympic Line 8 and Ring Line 10 of the network; Operations control center which can interlock components will be installed for 82 trains；Communication based train control (CBTC) system will be built on the Yizhuang and Changping lines of the Beijing subway network&lt;ref name=&quot;R13&quot; /&gt;.

===Far Future===



According to the 2011-2020 plan, there will be 30 lines, totaling 450 stations and 1050km of track in operation by 2020. It will form a “Chessboard network” for the center region and “Radial network” for the suburban region. There is not a detail official plan for the subway after 2020&lt;ref name=&quot;R14&quot; /&gt;, but some experts speculate that the construction of the whole subway system will be finished before 2040, and we find that this the trend seems meets our S curve very well. The curve indicates that the subway will be mature around 2040. However, it dose not mean the ridership will not increase after then. As we have seen, from the beginning of the life cycle till now, the technology continue to improve, which make the system more passenger friendly, more reliable and safer. A better service level will definitely attract large numbers of passengers from other modes. Policy is another tool to increase the mode capture. Flat price policy and Motor vehicle limit policy worked well and other policies should be taken adapt to and even orient the urban development. Population growth will also contribute to the increase of ridership, which requires the planners to take it into consideration and make sure the system can meet the demand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The cable car is a mass transit vehicle that uses a grip, manipulated by an operator, to reach under the street and clamp onto a cable moving at a constant speed. The cable itself is guided by pulleys powered through stationary motors located in powerhouses. In order to move, the operator gradually pulls a lever that moves the grip down towards the conduit and clamps it onto the moving cable. When the operator wants to stop the cable car, he or she releases pressure on the cable by opening the grip and applying the brakes. Today much of this process is automated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The cable car started out in San Francisco as a solution for traversing its steep hills. However, others realized that it could replace animal power as well. The cable car was cheaper, faster, cleaner, and stronger than animal power. By the turn of the nineteenth century, every large United States' city had a cable car line except Boston, Detroit, and New Orleans. Although the cable car rose quickly in popularity, it fell almost as fast. Today, San Francisco has the only operating cable cars in the United States.

==Pre-Cable Car Transportation and Its Limitations==
Before the cable car, there was animal and steam-powered mass transit. Nineteenth century animal powered mass transit consisted of horse-pulled omnibuses and its larger descendant, horse-pulled streetcars. Essentially, these were large wagons with benches inside that were pulled by horses, or sometimes mules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There were significant drawbacks to these modes. First, horse power was very constrained. Horses had limited energy and could only work so many hours in a day, often averaging four to five hours &lt;ref&gt;Post,R. (2007).Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology. West Port, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;. Their carrying capacity and speed were limited. Horse-powered vehicles were very slow; barely faster than the average walking pace. Horses were even slower if the street condition was poor. Travel was smoothest on macadam or planked roads, but not all cities could afford paved roads. In addition, horse cars were limited by terrain. Often one horse could not pull a streetcar up a hill. Second, horses posed a public health risk with their manure and urine on streets. Diseases like tetanus threatened the public. Third, horses were expensive. The average horse was $200 in the nineteenth century &lt;ref&gt;Post,R. (2007).''Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology''. West Port, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;, and this did not include the horse's maintenance. Cheaper mules could be used, but they depreciated faster than horses. However, a horse was only expected to work three or four years. Fourth, these modes took up a lot of road space, often leading to congestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the first solutions to animal-powered mass transit was steam-powered elevated rail (or “El” trains). Steam-power was already harnessed by steamboats in the country’s then vast canal network and by railroads connecting the coasts. In the late 1860's, congested inner city roadways were a serious concern. The idea of the elevated rail connected steam and rail technology already used on the ground and moved it above the street. Manhattan and Brooklyn were the first areas in the United States to build the infrastructure. The “El” alleviated congestion and decreased travel time. However, many residents considered coal derived steam-power as dirty. This was solved with the innovation of electric-power, but then residents considered the infrastructure as blight on the city skyline. Again, engineers and planners looked back down to the streets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==The Birth of the Cable Car==
===Andrew Hallidie===
The innovation of the cable car is often credited to Andrew Hallidie. Hallidie’s first experiences with cable and wires were with his father, who tinkered with the two and had a few patented inventions. As a young man, he moved to California to prospect. It was there in the Sierra Nevada mountains that he had his first idea of using cables to pull carts. He even obtained a patent in traveling rope-way used to transport buckets over mountainous areas&lt;ref&gt;Post,R. (2007).''Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology''. West Port, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1869 while in San Francisco, Hallidie also witnessed a horrible horse car accident, in which one of four horses slipped while pulling a car up a hill, bringing the entire party down&lt;ref&gt;Cudahy, Brian J. (1990). ''Cash, Tokens, and Transfers: A History of Urban Mass Transit in North America''. New York: Fordham University Press&lt;/ref&gt; . Having his cable and wire knowledge, he innovated his patent to solve San Francisco’s dangerous hill transportation issue. Hallidie figured out that his cable system could work there as it had in the Sierra Nevadas, but he innovated it by making the cables underground instead of over steep terrain.
===The Grip===
The next step was figuring out a mechanism to attach the cart to the moving cable. Hallidie and engineer William Eppelsheimer developed the first lever system that raised and lowered the grip, along with the opening and closing jaw mechanism &lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Cable Car Museum. (2011). &quot;The Grip&quot;. ''Cable Car Museum'', retrieved from [http://www.cablecarmuseum.org/the-grip.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this early grip proved unreliable. Henry Casebolt, Asa Hovey, and T. Day improved the grip technology by having the grip come down and clamp from the side as opposed to the bottom. This removed the need for turntables because the operator could now shift position on the lever to change directions. However, the side grip let go of the cable frequently, so Eppelsheimer returned to the bottom grip and made improvements. Eppelsheimer’s improved grip is currently used on all San Francisco cable cars.  In addition to the grip, Eppelsheimer discovered how to ease the grip onto the cable to reduce the cart’s jerkiness, which had been an issue on elevated trains.
===The Roebling Cable===
As for cables, early Roebling cables were approximately an inch thick, consisting of 96 steel wires wound into six strands of sixteen wires each that were wrapped around tar covered hemp rope&lt;ref&gt;Post,R. (2007).''Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology''. West Port, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;. The average cable was about four miles long (6.44 km), weighed 60,000 pounds (27,215.5 kg), and cost $7,000 in the 1880s’&lt;ref&gt;Post,R. (2007).''Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology''. West Port, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was able to stretch up to two percent as it broke in&lt;ref&gt;Post,R. (2007).''Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology''. West Port, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;. This meant the cable needed consistent readjustment in order to work at the correct level. On average, cables lasted around one year in ideal conditions. The cable was originally powered through coal-fed steam engines in a powerhouse. Today, they are electric. 
This combination of Hallidie’s expertise in cables and Eppelsheimer’s grips with previous streetcar knowledge created the first cable car, which was launched on San Francisco’s Clay Street on September 1, 1873. Through the years, cable cars that remained became automated and electrified; however, San Francisco’s cable cars are still manually operated.

==The Cable Car's Early Days==
===Early Markets===
After the Clay Street cable car, Hallidie, with the financial help of three friends, worked hard to add cable car lines in San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, P. &amp; Palmer, M. (1963). ''The Cable Cars of San Francisco''. Berkeley, CA:Howell-North&lt;/ref&gt;. Many investors throughout the country saw the cable car’s advantages over horse cars and invested. After San Francisco expanded its Clay Street line, other cities adopted cable cars. Chicago was the second city to use cable cars. With a rapidly growing population, animal power was not serving its residents well. The city saw the cable car, in addition to elevated rail, as the answer. Chicago experiences winter though, so engineers had to figure out how to keep ice from building up in the conduits. Ultimately, they used expensive extra-sturdy ironwork to get around the problem. Together, the two modes removed the horse element of mass transit, which relieved congestion, lowered public health concerns, and saved travel time and money. Many residents were proud of their city’s cable car system, with one resident even writing “the cable car system constitutes the finest method of locomotion ever introduced here or elsewhere”&lt;ref&gt;(1885, August 16).The Cable Roads of Chicago.''Chicago Inter Ocean''. Retrieved from [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D05E5DD153FE533A25755C1A96E9C94649FD7CF].&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While most cities invested in cable cars in order to replace horse power, other hilly cities, like Los Angeles and Seattle, invested to combat the hill issue. Cable cars allowed residents to expand to new parts of the city that were previously unreachable. An example is the Temple Street Cable Railway in Los Angeles that led to the development of Angeleno Heights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On a last note, it should be acknowledged that initial cable car investment was expensive. A city needed to dig deep trenches, install a succession of hundreds of iron yokes to support track, build the conduit and pulley system, and install the cable. Only cities that could afford this investment could have cable cars. In the end, most large American cities did choose to invest. Only Boston, Detroit, and New Orleans opted not to have cable cars.
===Early Policies===
In the cable car’s infancy, policies used from previous modes, such as the horse car, elevated rail, and railroad, were applied. Many of these policies concerned safety, service, and fares. One safety measure was the addition of a bell to let passersby know that the cable car was approaching. New signs had to be added to let passengers know where the cable car stopped to let riders on and off. A five cent fare policy, currently used on other modes, was adopted&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, W.L. &amp; Levinson,D.M. (2005)''Transportation Policy, Planning, and Deployment''. Oxford English Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Since cable cars shared public roads with other modes, right of way was not an issue. Overall, the transition from horse car to cable car was not difficult for riders. It was a similar mode with a new energy source. However, safety concerns would continue to grow.

==The Growth of Cable Cars==
By 1890, cable cars carried 373 million passengers in the United States &lt;ref&gt;McKay, J.P. (1988). &quot;Comparative Perspectives on Transit in Europe and the United States, 1850-1914&quot;. ''Technology and the Rise of the Networked City in Europe and America''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Like the majority of transit modes before World War I, the cable car was privately-owned. Overall, it was difficult to start up a cable car agency because cable cars were expensive to operate. Powerhouses had to constantly run at full capacity to power the line. Cables had to been replaced annually, if not sooner due to their likelihood of breakage. Grips and brakes, too, wore down quickly. However, once more cable cars were running, economies of scale lowered costs. The most profitable lines were those that went out towards the outer rings of the city. These lines allowed for new housing developments, which provided riders to the cable cars. Los Angeles’ Temple Street line is an example of this. The government's involvement included approving and financing the initial start up. After that occurred, laissez faire attitudes prohibited local governments from interfering in what was considered private business decisions. There was one exception: public safety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Although cable cars were much more efficient than horse cars, they were more dangerous. Cable cars’ cables or grip levers could snap, preventing the operator from braking. Other times, people would fall out of cars or walk in front of them to be crushed. Many municipalities crafted legislation to improve cable car’s safety records. Chicago is an example. As aforementioned, cable car agencies maximized profits if it ran more cable cars. Chicago, a growing city with congestion issues, was a cable car city that needed more cars to achieve higher capacity. Instead of pulling one or two trains at a time, Chicago tried pulling three to four cars a train. This proved to be very dangerous, and policy was put in place to limit the number of cars.

==The Decline of the Cable Car==
Cable cars peaked in 1893 with 305 miles of track. With the addition of electric power, streetcars became the cable car’s main competition in 1892. The electrified streetcar was faster, cheaper to assemble and operate, and less burdensome. Streetcars did not require as much expensive upkeep as cable cars did. This new mode became more attractive to city officials than cable cars. Attempts were made to electrify cable cars, but this proved ineffective. In San Francisco's case, the 1906 earthquake destroyed much of the cable cars' network, and city officials deemed it more practical to build the &quot;modern&quot; electric streetcar than return to the &quot;archaic&quot; cable car. The only remaining cars were those not severely affected or those that went up the steepest hills. As time went on, other modes took the cable car's place. Today, San Francisco's three remaining lines are the only cable car lines left in the United States.

==The Birth, Growth, and Decline of Cable Cars Through An S-Curve==
As has been discussed, transportation modes proceed through four phases: birth, growth, maturity, and decline. The cable car is no exception. Looking at its track mileage over time, we can see these stages. From 1873 until 1882, the cable car was in its birth stage. People were slowly becoming familiarized with this new mode, and cities were starting to build the necessary infrastructure. From 1883 until 1893, the cable car grew to replace horse cars in most major U.S. cities. It is interesting to note that the cable car did not have a maturity stage. Right after its peak year in 1893, the cable car started on a steep decline due to the increased competition of the electric streetcar. Below is a table of the cable car's track mileage in the United States from 1873 to 1913 as obtained from George Hilton's ''The Cable Car in America'' (1982).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Due to the fact that it can show status over time, an S-curve was used to show the cable car's history graphically. The S-curve was created through the formula: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S(t) = K/[1+e^{(-b(t-t_0)}]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where:&lt;br&gt;
S(t) = total mileage in a given year&lt;br&gt;
K = saturation status level (in this case the maximum miles of track - 305.1)&lt;br&gt;
b = coefficient&lt;br&gt;
t = year&lt;br&gt;
t0 = inflection point (year in which 1/2 k is achieved)&lt;br&gt;
A linear regression was needed to determine the coefficient (b) and inflection point (t0) in order to use the S-curve equation. This was done through the equation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;Y = \ln\left(\cfrac{S(t)}{(K-S(t))}\right)= bt-bt_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This was done twice - first for the birth/growth stage and second for the decline. In the birth/growth stage, b was found to be 0.47 and t0 was 1887. In the decline stage, b was found to be -0.78 and t0 was 1904. After running this regression, the newly calculated variables were plugged into the S-curve equation to determine the predicted track mileage. All together, these points were then graphed with the actual track mileage in order to see a comparison. This can be see in the graph below. For the birth/growth stage, the s-curve had an R-squared of 0.97, meaning it is a very close prediction. However, for the decline stage, the R-squared was 0.31, reflecting a poor prediction. This may be due to the fact that the S-curve predicted a maturity phase when in actuality the cable car never had a maturity phase.

==The Cable Car's Lasting Impact==
The cable car may have had a brief life, but it made a lasting impact on transportation history. It was the cable car that finally took the horse and all its negative externalities out of the equation. It served as a bridge from the old mode, horse cars, to the new mode, electric streetcars. While it tried to compete with the latter mode by turning to electric power itself, it was not enough. However, the electric streetcar did not completely kill off the cable car. Due to the fighting efforts of a grassroots group, the Citizens' Committee to Save the Cable Cars, San Francisco still has three operating lines today for people to enjoy.

                                       November 2012
=== Summary ===

This document provides a workflow and description for using Paint.Net to reskin locomotives in Trainz.  The description applies to undecorated locomotives, but it can be adapted to any asset.  It is particularly suitable for undecorated locomotives because, once the project is set up, changes to colors or textures or logos are particularly easy, if this procedure is followed.

The description is targeted at TS12, but it should be applicable to versions back to 2009.
 
Paint .Net is a public-domain graphics manipulation program that is available here:
http://www.getpaint.net/download.html

The main page is here:
http://www.getpaint.net/index.html

Plugins are available that extend the functionality of Paint .Net.  The procedure that is described here uses a plugin for the last example only – this example could be done in other ways that do not require plugins. 

Paint .Net runs under Windows, but apparently can be made to run in an emulator on other platforms. This description refers to the Windows version.

=== Introduction ===

The feature of Paint .Net that makes it particularly suitable for this procedure (apart from the fact that it is free!) is the use of layers.  By using layers the original artwork in unchanged, as all changes are applied in their own  layers.  By keeping groups of changes together on one layer, further adjustments can be implemented by changing the painting on that layer, or by changing the layer properties. But, most importantly, by following the procedure described here (or something similar, if you want to experiment) the detail that is already part of these undecorated locomotives is preserved in the new skin – there is no need to re-add the detail of weathering or panels or rivets and joins.   Of course, the facilities still exist to add additional detail or to alter any existing detail if you want.

There is a description of Paint .Net layers here:
http://www.getpaint.net/doc/latest/WorkingWithLayers.html
(all the Paint.Net documentation is online – you should be connected to the ‘net when using Paint.Net.)  It’s worth reading if you haven’t previously used a graphics program that works with layers.

This description refers to version 3.5 of Paint .Net, but the functions used are fairly basic and have not changed much over the different versions.

This process also uses PEV’s mesh viewer available here:
http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/villaump/pevsoft.htm

Other mesh viewers could be used, but I would not recommend RailYard as it takes too long to load.  As demonstrated below, PEV’s Mesh Viewer makes it really easy to see the changes, almost as you make them.

=== The workflow. A simple recoloring example. ===

1. Start by selecting your undecorated loco and creating a project folder.  This example will use the GP38 (kuid:439337:100728) from msgsapper.   I created a folder 'Working' in the TS12 main folder, and then a subfolder under the Working folder named ‘GP38 Project’. If you run into Windows security issues you may prefer to put the working folder into a different location that is not subject to Windows’ security restrictions.

2. In Content Creator, clone the original and then open the clone in Explorer (right-click, Edit, Edit In Explorer).  The Explorer window will open.

3. Right click in the address bar of the Explorer window and select Copy Address As Text

4. Start PEV's Mesh Viewer utility. If necessary, select a file type of Trainz Mesh (*.im, *.pm).  Select File / Open, paste the address just copied into the filename box and press Enter.  The asset folder will open.   Navigate to the location of the .im file (...\gp38 undecorated\gp38undec_body\gp38undec_body.im in this example) and select it.  The loco will appear in the viewer.

5. Start Paint.Net.  Click File / Open, paste the name just copied into the File name text box and press enter.  The asset folder will appear. Find the main body TGA image and double click it (...\gp38 undecorated\gp38undec_body\gp38.tga in this example). It’s invariably the biggest file – sorting by size puts it at the top. It is also often called Main, or perhaps it has the same name as the loco. The image will open in the window.

[[File:Tutorial01.png|none|thumb|600px|Figure 1 Mesh Viewer, Paint.Net with the main image, and three of the Paint.Net panels.]]
 
6. Choose File / Save As.  The Paint.Net Save format is PDN – this will be used for saving your reskinning project so you can come back to it at any time.  Make sure PDN is selected as the Save as type.  Navigate to the working directory and the project folder that was created in step 1, and save the PDN file in the project folder (..\Working\GP38 Project in this example).

7. Choose Layers / Add New Layer.  If the Layers panel in Paint.Net is not open choose Window / Layers.  Note that two layers are listed - Background and Layer 1.  One of them will be highlighted.  Click in the other layer to highlight that other layer.  The highlighted layer is the one on which all selecting or drawing will occur.  Note that the layers also have a check box.  This controls whether or not the layers are visible.  Layer 1 is currently all transparent, so when you create and show this new layer, it doesn't seem like anything has changed. 

8. Click in Layer 1 (in the Layers window) to make it the active layer. Make sure it is also visible (the tick box is ticked).  Then choose Layers / Layer Properties, and adjust the Blending Mode setting to Multiply.   This setting ensures that detail (such as weathering) from the background layer is applied to the final image when the layers are merged for display.   Adjust the Opacity to about two-thirds or 170 – the actual amount isn’t critical, as this will be adjusted again later to achieve the desired effect.

9. With layer 1 active and both layers visible you should see the original image.  Layer 1 is entirely transparent by default. Use the Mesh Viewer image to relate the portions of the skin image to the full model.  Note that most of the mapping is obvious, but some parts are quite mysterious.  (Some assets will have the different portions of the image labelled with what they are, which helps a lot. If the labels do not exist then you could consider adding labelling to your project.   The labelling does not have to be on the image - it can be in a separate layer which you turn on and off as needed). 

10. This is the step where you see the benefits of working with layers. Make sure the toolbox is visible (Window / Tools) and check that layer 1 is the active layer.  Select the rectangular selection tool (top left in the toolbar).  Starting from a corner of a section of the loco that you want to change (e.g., a corner of the roof section) create a selection rectangle that covers that particular region. 
 
[[File:Tutorial02.png|none|thumb|500px|Figure 2 The GP38 skin image, with a selection rectangle drawn over the hood and cab roof.]]

11. Make sure the color selector window is visible (Window / Colors) and select a color.

12. Select the Fill tool from the toolbox (the pouring bucket).  Left-click inside the selected rectangle.  It will fill with the selected color. Note that the selection rectangle (and the color) might extend beyond the actual hood area – this doesn’t matter if this area is not used in the skinning, as in the example below.  Also notice how the coloring has retained the shading of detail from the background image.  
 
[[File:Tutorial03.png|none|thumb|300px||Figure 3 A portion of the image has been colored. Note how shading detail is retained.]]

13. Select Layers / Properties.  Adjust the opacity setting to see the effect. This could be referred to as saturation.  But note that the detail in the background image is retained even when opacity is 255

14. Select a new color.  With the Fill tool still selected, click anywhere within that colored patch.  The color changes to the new color.  By default, the fill tool fills only regions of the one color.  This means that if you keep your colored regions separate then you can recolor any region simply by filling that region using the fill tool.  Or, just select a region and hit Delete to remove all painting in that region.  The skin image is laid out in separate rectangular regions, so this is easy to do.   But if it’s not possible using one layer, just add another layer and work in that other layer.

15. Continue selecting and filling rectangular areas in layer 1 until you have colored the loco like you want.  Remember that you can set up additional layers as required - this would be very useful where areas overlap, but you want to continue to handle them separately (probably not relevant for locos, but could apply to other asset types).  

16.  Choose File / Save As.  With the default PDN file type, save your work in the project folder.  This saves your project, so you can get back to where you were at any time in the future. 

17.  Choose File / Save As, change the type to TGA, navigate to the Edit folder (it should be part of the expanded list) and double click the existing TGA file to save over the top of it.  Click OK to overwrite.  This will save the image, which is what is used for the reskinning.

18. IMPORTANT: A message about merging or “flattening” the layers will appear.  You must flatten the layers to save as TGA, so select Flatten.  The file will be saved.  Immediately the file has been saved, select Edit / Undo and the layers will be un-flattened. You must unflatten the layers immediately after saving as TGA in order to be able to continue to work on the layers separately.  Also, click in the layer 1 item in the layers window, as the default working layer will have changed from Layer 1 to Background, and you will probably continue your work in Layer 1 (or any other layer you added) rather than the background.   If you forget to unflatten the layers you will need to go back to the project folder and re-load the PDN, possibly losing some work.

NOTE:  You will save as PDN (in the project folder) whenever you want to save your work to date.   You will save as TGA (in the Edit folder) when you want to see your results.  In practice, you will save as TGA (and review your work) much more often than you save the project as PDN.

19. Switch to Mesh Viewer.  Select File and click the asset name.  The image will be refreshed with the new skin.  Review your work, and switch back to Paint.Net to make more changes or undo what you just did.
 
[[File:Tutorial04.png|none|thumb|600px|Figure 4 Changes made to portions of the roof, and displayed in Mesh Viewer.]]

20. When finished, close Mesh Viewer, return to Content Manager and Commit the asset. You can recreate the thumbnail later on to make it match your new skin.

=== Adding a logo ===

This process follows a similar procedure: Create a layer, place, size and color the logo, then adjust the layer properties so that it merges correctly with the other layers.

1.	Find or create the logo.  If it’s an image, copy it and then choose Edit / Paste in new layer.  If it’s a file drag it onto the Image and select Add Layer when prompted  

2.	Enable the new layer and the background layer. With the new layer active, select the logo and resize it and move it until it appears correctly over the skin image.  Note that in this case the layer Blending property is Normal, because I want the logo to appear as a solid color without the underlying detail showing through.
Then follow the well-worn path – 
    File / Save as
    Save as type TGA
    Save
    Replace Yes
    Save Configuration OK
    Flatten
    Edit /Undo 
    Mesh Viewer File / &lt;filename&gt;
 
[[File:Tutorial05.png|none|thumb|500px|Figure 5 A logo has been added in a new layer.]]

=== Adding Lettering ===

This is essentially the same procedure as adding a logo, but in this example the lettering will retain the underlying detail, unlike the logo.

1.	Create a new layer. Set the layer Blending property to Multiply (as for the original coloring layer).

2.	Select font, color and size. Choose between anti-aliasing and non anti-aliasing to get the effect you want.

3.	Type the text, select it and reposition it.

4.	If you are applying the text to the side of the loco, you need to account for the image layout.  Select the text and Copy it.  Select Layer / Paste to new layer. The copied text will be pasted into a new layer and that layer becomes the active layer.

5.	Select Layer / Flip vertical and Layer / Flip Horizontal.  The text is now upside down.  Move the text into position against the other side of the loco in the image.  This procedure highlights the difference between Paint.Net and some other graphics programs.  There is no option to invert or flip or rotate a selection.  You must copy your object to a separate layer and work in that layer. At first this seems like extra effort, but it soon becomes a very natural way to work.

6.	In the layers window, choose merge down. The layer created for the inverted lettering is now merged down into the layer ‘below’ it (the next one down in the layers window). If you watch carefully you will see that that lettering in the topmost window was overlaying the image with Normal blending, but when it was merged down into the layer below it took on that layer’s Multiply blending.  For a layer that is created simply for the purpose of flipping or moving or coloring or whatever and is going to be merged down, you only need to have properties set that are relevant to that merge.  In this case we wanted to paint a solid image into the merged layer, so Normal blending was suitable for the merge.
 
[[File:Tutorial06.png|none|thumb|600px|Figure 6 Lettering added to the sides, in its own layer, with blending set to Multiply.]]

=== Adding a texture. ===

Again, the process is essentially the same.  Create a layer for the texture, add the image into that layer, position and size it, and set the layer properties for the effect you want.  In this example I will apply a bump pattern effect to a portion of the roof.

1.	Find your texture and copy it into a new layer, using either Paste in to New Layer (copied image) or Create New Layer (Drag and Drop a file).

2.	With the new layer active, and the background layer visible, move, size and/or crop your texture to fit. Note that cropping to the background image is easy if you need a rectangular shape – just select an area and press Delete to remove it.  In this case I wanted to retain the square shape of the pattern, so I kept it square as I resized and positioned on three edges, then cropped up to the fourth edge.
 
[[File:Tutorial07.png|none|thumb|500px|Figure 7 Texture applied to s section of roof.]]

=== Adding an effect ===

This example relies on a Paint.Net plugin. It is an example of how these effects can be used to create additions such as weathering.  This effect can be easily added to the original image, but in this example I have taken the extra step of using a separate layer.  This preserves the original image and makes it very easy to remove the effect, or to experiment with different effects because they can be discarded easily if they don’t work. But it does require one additional step that might not be obvious.

1.	With the background image active, select the area where you want to apply weathering.  This example will take a portion of the roof near the exhausts and the adjacent side panels. Note: this is not in the ‘top and sides’ portion in the upper part of the original image – it is a separate panel in the middle immediately below the ‘top and sides’. Use the Mesh Viewer to identify it.

2.	Select Edit / Copy then Edit / Paste in to New Layer.  A new layer will be created and the selected portion will be pasted.   It will paste to the same location by default.  If necessary, trim away any parts where you do not want the effect applied by using the selection rectangle and Delete.

3.	Make sure the new layer is the active layer. Select Effect / Noise / Add noise (or whatever effect you want). Adjust the parameters as required – for this example I chose Intensity = 35, Color saturation = 0 and coverage = 100.
 
[[File:Tutorial08.png|none|thumb|400px|Figure 8 A portion of roof with noise added.]]

4.	That’s all that’s required, but the point of this example is to show how the effects interact with each other.  So, for the next bit to work, you need to add a color to the portion where the effect is.

5.	Make sure the layer where the color was applied to the hood and cabin roof is visible (the tick mark) and active (highlighted), and that the effects layer is not visible. 

6.	Apply color to the whole roof region and to the extra region around the exhausts using the filled rectangle.

7.	Make all the layers visible.  Note how the roof section is not colored.  The effects layer is overwriting the coloring.

8.	In the layers window, click on the effects layer (the topmost one) to select it.  Click the down arrow to move it down.  Move it down until it is immediately above the original image.  Notice how the color is now applied to this portion of the roof. The color layer has Blending set to Multiply, so it picks up the noise that we applied.  But to do that it must be sequenced above the effects layer, otherwise the effects layer overwites the coloring.  A similar result could have been achieved by setting properties in the effects layer (there are often several ways to do any particular task).
 
[[File:Tutorial09.png|none|thumb|500px|Figure 9 The final effect. Both detail levels now show through the color.]]

The order in which the layers are listed is important. The order is changed using the up arrow or down arrow in the layers window.

=== Additional notes. ===

If the underlying image needs fixing, work in the background layer instead of layer 1.  I have found that these images are often incorrect in tiny details, and that improving them using this process (save, and switch to mesh viewer to see your results) makes this sort of detail patching quite practical, even though the overall effect is slight. However, it is quite OK to copy any part of the original image to a new layer and work on that layer.  That makes it much easier to und any particular change.  As far as the final image is concerned, the number of layers used to make it up is quite irrelevant. 

Identifying the area of the image that applies to a particular part of the loco body is difficult in some cases.  At corners of the body it can be difficult to tell which image gets painted over which.  It is possible to use a special layer which can be marked up with bright colours to help identify exactly what's what - remember that the layer can be simply deleted to remove all the markups, or you can exclude it from the final image just be ensuring it is not ticked when you save as TGA.  The Render / Multi Color Gradient plugin is particularly useful for creating a pattern that helps to identify where a particular portion of the image paints to.  Do one layer vertically and another horizontally and create separate renderings.  The exact point can be identified from where the colours match. 

Do not assume that a break in a surface appears as a break in the image – the break between cabin roof and hood in the image used here is an example.  It is possible, with a lot of experimenting, to identify this point in the image. Drawing a ‘ruler’ – a line of crosshatching – can be a useful way to identify points within the image.  Do it in a new layer, then just delete the layer when the point has been identified.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Driver Module Keyboard Shortcuts ==

This table was generated for TS12 and so contains a few keys applicable only in newer Trainz releases. Most of the table has been common across all Trainz Versions ''after Trainz UTC'' (V-1.5), and as with keys added in TS10 and TS12, keys added after that date such as the Camera Free Roaming External mode (''''[4]'''') just did nothing. 

Historically, the Keypad keys were the controls used in Trainz 1.x, but that was unpopular given the need for the right hand on the mouse, which is perhaps busy even more often. With UTC a file ''&quot;\Settings\keyboard.txt&quot;'' was introduced allowing user customization of the keys which have remained stable until the introduction of new functional needs. The file keyboard.txt also allows the user to customize his {{TL|Surveyor}} {{wp|hotkeys}} as well as those useful in Driver. 

Note except for Steam Loco Driving, the so called keyboard leftside cross (W, S, X, A and D) comprise the most often used Driver keys, those used for throttle control and the brakes. The Steam locomotive also heavily use F and R just to the right of the cross, as are less often used D, C, E, V and B keys.

There are 32 steps of acceleration in an electric locomotive, eight in a diesel locomotive, and hundreds of usable combinations of S+W (throttle) and R+F (cutoff angle) for Steam Loco driving modes. The Steam controls are effectively continuous functions using the mouse, while the keys increment or decrement values from those settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Overview'''==
The impirical formula of simvastatin is C25H38O5 with the molecular weight of 418.57. Simvastatin also is a white, crystalline powder that is insoluble in water. In taking simvastatin, make sure we are not allergic to it. Patients who taking simvastatin have to limit their alcohol beverages. 


Simvastatin, also known as Zocor, is a drug used to control cholesterol levels.  It is a hypolipidemic agent, used to lower the levels of lipids.  It is derived from the fermentation of Aspergillus terreus, a fungus which can be used to make important organic compounds.  Cholesterol biosynthesis was researched at Merck by Jesse Huff, a biochemist, and his colleagues in the early 1950s.  Carl Hoffman, Karl Folkers, and some colleagues at Merck isolated mevalonic acid from a yeast extract in 1956.  They confirmed that this acid can be used in cholesterol biosynthesis.  In Sankyo, Japan, Akira Endo was able to isolate Compactin from Penicillum citrinium, a fungus, in 1976.  Carl Hoffman was able to isolate lovastatin from Asperigillus terreus in 1979.  From lovastatin, the scientists at Merck were able to synthetically derive Simvastatin.

==Usage==
Take simvastatin exactly as prescribed. Never take simvastatin in larger amounts, or for longer than recommended by your doctor. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully. Taking too much of this medication may cause serious or life-threatening side effects.

Simvastatin is usually taken at bedtime or with an evening meal. If you take simvastatin more than once daily, take it with meals. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. To be sure simvastatin is helping your condition and is not causing harmful effects, your blood will need to be tested often. Your liver function should be tested every 3 to 6 months. Visit your doctor regularly. You may need to take simvastatin on a long-term basis for the treatment of high cholesterol. You may need to stop using this medicine for a short time if you have surgery or a medical emergency. Do not stop taking simvastatin unless your doctor tells you to.

Simvastatin is only part of a complete program of treatment that also includes diet, exercise, and weight control. 



=='''Side Effects'''==
Daily use of alcohol may increase your risk for liver problems. Other side effects include unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness; fever, unsual tiredness, and dark colored urine; pain or burning when you urinate; nausea, upper stomach pain, itching, loss of appetite, or dark urine. [The Internal Drug Index].

Simvastatin contains some inactive ingredients, and if allergic, can cause allergies to surface.  Cautions should be taken if the patient has a history of alcohol use, kidney disease, or liver disease.  If a surgery needs to be performed, let the doctor know about the herbal products, nonprescription drugs, and prescription drugs that have been used.  When taking Simvastatin, be aware of your alcohol intake.  When combined with alcohol, this drug can increase the risk of liver problems.  Adults, who are older, should take more precaution.  They may become more sensitive to this drug, which may produce muscle problems.  When pregnant, do not use this drug because it can harm your unborn baby.  Also, preventing pregnancy is important because simvastatin may pass into breast milk.  Although this is still unclear, try not to breast feed while taking this drug.

Few people who have been taking this drug had reported problems of mild memory or confusion.  These are rare effects that may occur.  Infrequently, muscle problems may occur and a very serious condition may occur, rhabdomyolysis (muscle fiber breakdown leading to muscle fiber in the bloodstream.  Be cautious of symptoms that include weakness, tenderness, or muscle pain.  There are rare instances of liver problems.  Be cautions of nausea or vomiting, severe abdominal or stomach pain, dark urine, or yellowing of skin or eyes.  This drug may also cause serious allergic reactions.  Be cautious of breathing troubles, severe dizziness, itching or swelling of the face, throat, or tongue, rashes, or any symptoms of allergic reactions.

='''= '''বাচাও মানুষ''' =='''

 
আমি একজন বাঙ্গালী । আমার বাবা একজন মুক্তি যুদ্ধা । আমি গর্বিত আমার এই পরিচয়ে । আমি একাধারে অনেক কাজ করেছি । আবার এমন হয়েছে যে কখনো চাকুরী কখনো বা ব্যাবসা আবার রাজনীতি । না ভয় পাওয়ার মতো কোন রাজনীতি করিনি । আসলে ঠিক রাজনীতি বলবনা আজ কাল আমাদের দেশে এটা একটা ঘৃণিত কাজ ।সবাই এটাকে পেশা হিসেবে নেয় । আমি সংগঠন করেছি । হত দরিদ্র মানুষের পাশে দাড়াতে চেষ্টা করেছি । বাংলাদেশের ১০ কোটির ও বেশি জন গন দরিদ্র সীমার অন্তভুক্ত । মৌলিক চাহিদা বঞ্চিত শিশু সহ অধিকাংশ জনগন। আমি এসকল মানুষকে নিয়ে কাজ করেছি । বাংলাদেশের গ্রাম্য নারিদের কর্ম সংস্থান হিসেবে করেছি নকশী বাজার । এর মাধ্যমে স্বাবলম্বী হয়ে উঠবে গ্রাম্য নারি সমাজ । এতে করে শোষণ শৃঙ্খল থেকে বেরিয়ে আসবে নারি সমাজ। এবং এতে করে দারিদ্রতা কে কঠিন হস্তে রোখায় নারির ভূমিকাও থাকবে । আর শিক্ষিত যুবক ছাত্র সমাজের জন্য করেছি কর্মসংস্থান । বিশ্ব যেখানে গা ভাষীয়ে দিয়েছে প্রযুক্তির হাওয়ায় । আমরা কেন পিছিয়ে পরবো । সেই লক্ষ্যে করেছি Global Technical Link । আমাদের উদ্দেস্য এদেশের মানুষকে স্বাবলম্বী করা ।
 ধন্যবাদ সবাই কে ।</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Impact evaluation assesses the changes that can be attributed to a particular intervention, such as a project, program or policy, both the intended ones, as well as ideally the unintended ones.[1] In contrast to outcome monitoring, which examines whether targets have been achieved, impact evaluation is structured to answer the question: how would outcomes such as participants’ well-being have changed if the intervention had not been undertaken? This involves counterfactual analysis, that is, “a comparison between what actually happened and what would have happened in the absence of the intervention.”[2] Impact evaluations seek to answer cause-and-effect questions. In other words, they look for the changes in outcome that are directly attributable to a program.[3] Impact Evaluation helps us to answer key questions for evidence-based policy making: what works, what doesn’t, where, why and for how much? It has received increasing attention in policy making in recent years in both Western and developing country contexts.[4] It is an important component of the armory of evaluation tools and approaches and integral to global efforts to improve the effectiveness of aid delivery and public spending more generally in improving living standards. Originally more oriented towards evaluation of social sector programs in developing countries, notably conditional cash transfers, impact evaluation is now being increasingly applied in other areas such as the agriculture, energy and transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General==
Microwave cooking includes a number of methods which at first sight are similar to those used in a conventional oven.  The methods all make use of a microwave oven, and that might be either a simple microwave heating device, or one that includes the additional techniques of steaming, crisping, or grilling.

Although microwave cooking is in general use, it is usually acknowledged as having more limited scope than conventional ovens.   That said, for those tasks for which it is particularly useful, it is both efficient in energy terms and in the time it takes to complete its tasks.

The basic microwave oven heats by the movement of water in the foods.   This movement generates the heat that is used for cooking.   This technique cannot in itself cause browning, so the above-mentioned combination ovens have been designed with additional heating elements (grilling).   Like conventional ovens, some foods are dried out at their surface during cooking, so both the addition of water and steaming are commonly used.   Additional crisping plates are used to make foods like pizza and roast potatoes crisp on their surface.

==Containers for Microwaving==
*'''Metal Containers must never be used conjunction with microwaves.'''   Microwaves are reflected by any kind of metal, and it can be quite a violent event if the power levels are high.   Clearly, food in a metal container would not receive any energy and so apart from the dangers mentioned, the food would just not heat well.   This comment also applies to materials that ''contain traces'' of metal, such as some glasses and porcelains, and in particular items that have an obvious metallic trim or decoration.   
*'''In general, containers made for microwave use are marked as ''Microwave Safe''.'''   Other items without marking can of course be used but a test is needed to check whether or not they are safe.   The test is to fill a cup with water and place the container and it in the microwave to heat on high for a couple of minutes;   if by the time the water is hot, the empty container remains cool, then it is probably transparent to microwaves and might well be safe to use;   the other thing to consider is whether or not the container can sustain the conducted heat from hot food, and whether or not the additional grilling functions of a combi microwave will cause it damage.   That said, most table plates and Pyrex, stoneware, and earthenware containers without elaborate decoration will be found suitable.
*'''Cling Film improvised lids'''.   Steam vents must be made in any lid or covering used in the microwave, to avoid the build up of pressure.   Choose a food wrap material that is sold as being suitable for the microwave.   Some materials are made only for cold wrapping, and in general these days, non-pvc materials are preferred for microwave lids.   Disposable microwave cooking bags with a seal are to be had.   These effectively substitute for containers and can help to keep the microwave clean. 
*'''Accessory packs for the microwave''' are often supplied with a new item.   These are made of a ''microwave-safe'' material and commonly contain a two-part steamer and lid, a crisper plate, and a plate cover with a vent already in it.
*'''Exceptions'''.   Sometimes small pieces of aluminum foil can be used to protect parts of the food from  overcooking.

==Heat Circulation==
Because microwaves cannot effectively penetrate food beyond about one or two inches, food in excess of these dimensions depends on conduction of heat from the absorption regions to cook them.   For this reason microwave cooking has adopted a number of necessary conventions.
*'''Stop and Stir often during the cooking'''   Stirring is essential to make sure both that relatively cool parts of the food reach the energy and that the existing heat is evenly distributed.   It is usual to stir foods at least once, and preferably more, during their cooking.
*'''Thin layers of food heat best.'''   When there is a choice food is arranged for cooking in thin layers rather than thick ones.    Additionally, since the food at the center of a plate is found to receive less heat than that at the edges, the thickest food items are best placed on the outside.
*'''Water helps heat transit'''.   To assist in the circulation of heat some recipes add a tablespoon or two of water, for example, in the softening of vegetables.
*'''Thick items are cooked slowly'''.   Thin food penetration is consistent but conduction through thick sections of food takes time, so thick sections of food and food that cannot be easily stirred tend to be given  longer times at correspondingly lower power levels, where the best results are obtained when the outside of the food is prevented from drying out at the same time; for example, by enclosing in a microwave bag.

==Adjusting Cooking Times for Power Level==
If the microwave oven used for the recipe did not have a 750W or 350W setting, but had a 600W and a 300W setting instead, then all of the cooking times could be adjusted for the new power levels.   The new cooking times would just become (750/600) times 6, and 350/300 times 10.   For example:   
&lt;pre&gt;
The old cooking times were 6 minutes at 750W and 10 minutes at 350W.
The ratio is always:  &quot;Recipe quoted power divided by machine power being used&quot; 
These times are therefore just:  
(750/600)*6   =  7.5 minutes at 600W and
(350/300)*10   = 11.91 or about 12 minutes at 300W 
So the old cooking times are increased slightly in proportion to the change in power.
&lt;/pre&gt;
The change could be calculated for a more powerful oven too, using the same proportionate method.   That is to say, power changes can always be calculated on the assumption of proportionality.   In fact it is likely that cooking times will be adjusted for both changed power settings and for changed weights of ingredients.  In this event the table in the next section may prove useful.

==Adjusting Cooking Times for Changed Weights==
If the weights of the food to be cooked much differ from those of the recipe then the cooking times will be wrong.   It is possible to adjust the cooking times to take account of these changes, but the changed cooking times do not work in proportion to the change in the way of power level changes.   Specifically, if you double a recipe quantity, you should not necessarily double the time; it is more likely to be closer to a multiple of 1.5 times the original recipe time; not twice.

&lt;table  style=&quot;background:lightyellow;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px align=center width=100% &gt;

  &lt;caption&gt; Approximate Adjustments for Recipe Weight Changes&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:brown; color: white;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Recipe Weight 0.5&lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Recipe Weight X 0.75&lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Weight as per Recipe&lt;/th&gt;
  
  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Recipe Weight x 1.5&lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;th style=&quot; border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Recipe Weight x 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Decrease to 0.66 of Cooking Time&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Decrease to 0.89 of Cooking Time&lt;/td&gt;
  
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;No Change-Weight Same&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Increase To 1.33 of Cooking Time&lt;/td&gt;
  
  &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;&gt;Increase To 1.5 of Cooking Time&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
The figures given in the table are approximations for small changes, and should not be used beyond a single doubling or halving of the recipe time; that is, they cannot be used four times to increase by eight, since large errors will occur.   Make gradual changes minute by minute when near the approximate time, and check the cooking each time to get it right.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Irisbus Cristalis ETB18 C1 Lyon TCL PDVM Ibou.JPG|thumb|Trolleybus in Lyon, France]]

Trolleybuses are electrically powered buses. Unlike other electric vehicles, however, trolleybuses draw their power from overhead lines running along the trolleybus’ route instead of batteries. The bus is connected to the line by two poles and wires, whereas a conventional trolley draws its electricity from a single connection point overhead.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt; While there are limitations in route choice due to the vehicle requiring a tie-in to the line at all times during operation, this method of drawing power does provide advantages over traditional electric vehicles (as well as non-electric).
 
==History==
[[File:Elektromote1882.jpg|thumb|The Elektromote, circa 1882]]

The trolleybus dates back to 1882 in Berlin, in its origins as “Elektromode”. The Elektromote was run on a 591 yard track between train stations. It consisted of a four-wheel carriage equipped with motors run off electricity from an overhead cable. The track was dismantled after a few months of demonstration.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;

The first “true” passenger-carrying trolleybus was developed and implemented nearly 20 years later, in Biela Valley, near Dresden, Germany in 1901. This trolleybus, like its modern counterpart, used two overhead wires with spring-loaded connection poles to draw power. This system ran until 1904, inspiring other systems around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; In 1903, trolleybuses were introduced to the United States in a demonstration in New Haven, Connecticut, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. By the 1920s many systems around the country were up and running, and the number only increased over the next 30 years. In the mode’s peak years, near and just after 1950, over 900 trolleybus systems were operating worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;

However, due to the advent of the private vehicle and diesel bus, as well as the Federal Aid Highway act of 1956, the trolleybus fell into rapid decline along with other form of mass transit, like the streetcar.&lt;ref name=&quot;R9&quot; /&gt; The trolleybus reached maturity and did not stay there long. By 1951 and 1952, there were over 7000 trolleybus vehicles in operation. By 1956, that number had decreased to just under 6000. By 1973, the number was down to just over 700, a tenth of what it had been twenty years prior.&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;

By 2010, only around 570 trolleybus vehicles were operational in 5 states: California (San Francisco), Massachusettes (Boston), Ohio (Dayton), Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), and Washington (Seattle).&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt; Just as the traditional streetcar has seen a revival by city planners, it is possible that trolleybuses will regain popularity.  In some countries, like Russia, the trolleybus never experienced a decline. The system in Moscow has around 1500 vehicles and 100 lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;  However, as more US cities are exploring the possibility of implementing trolleybuses again, cities with existing systems like Seattle are looking at reducing or eliminating the service completely. By 2013, all of Seattle’s electric bus fleet will need replacing; in 2011 a comprehensive trolleybus system evaluation was held to determine whether or not the trolleybuses would be replaced by diesel.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
Trolleybuses are able to accelerate faster, more smoothly, and more effectively up hills than their non-electric counterparts. Electric motors are more effective than diesel when providing torque upon startup. In addition, their rubber tires have better traction than steel wheels on steel rails. This may be why San Francisco and Seattle, both hilly cities, still use trolleybuses today when most American cities have switched away from the mode. Trolleybuses are lighter than their counterparts as well, due to not having a standalone battery carrying the charge required for operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

Another advantage is that while the trolleybus runs on a fixed route, disabled vehicles can easily be detached from the overhead line and moved out of the way, rather than impeding other vehicles upon the same route. In addition, this allows trolleybuses to pull up to the curb as other buses do instead of requiring boarding islands in the middle of the street. This also promotes level-boarding, making accessibility to the mode easier to pedestrians with mobility impairments than those modes which cannot provide level boarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;

Something that may be both an advantage and disadvantage to the technology is its quietness in operation. Pedestrians may not notice a vehicle coming when it does not make noise. To combat injuries and accidents due to this, speakers may be attached to the front of the vehicles which may direct sound toward pedestrians and other motorists in danger areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

A disadvantage is that while a trolleybus is more maneuverable than a fixed-track method of transit (LRT, streetcar) it is less so than a bus. If a road is undergoing construction in an area the trolleybus line runs, the line has to be discontinued temporarily, rather than re-routed. Also, trolleybuses cannot overtake one another like modes of non-fixed track transit can.[[File:Trolley3WireSwitch.jpg|thumb|An overhead, three way trolleybus switch]]

Another major disadvantage to the trolleybus system is the need for overhead cables. The cables are considered by most to be visually unattractive, and installation of new lines may be cause for protest. Where lines come together, the effect can be especially hard to ignore. In addition to being unsightly, the cable connectors can come undone or be actively disconnected. This will cause delays in transit while the driver must reconnect the cable. Also to be considered is the effect of weather on the cables and the cable-poles; if installed in a wet and cold climate, the wires may ice up, causing the line to be unusable.

Like with non-cable buses, another point to consider is the wear and tear to the roadway by sustained heavy vehicle impact. Rail transit has an advantage here, as once the rail tracks are put in place, excessive loading is removed from the pavement. Another comparison to non-cable buses is that travel by bus is deemed less pleasant than other modes of transit. Cleanliness, demographics, and schedule reliability are potential  reasons why people choose not to take a form of bus when other modes are available.

Environmental impacts of the trolleybus are also an advantage to using this mode. Any sort of mass transit has an advantage over the personal vehicle, using less energy and space. Installing a trolleybus service is more initially expensive than establishing diesel-powered bus routes due to the cost of installing overhead lines, but that extra cost may be recoverable due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. In addition, cities that draw large amounts of power from sustainable sources and use that power to operate a trolleybus system are much more sustainable than not; Seattle, Washington, USA uses hydroelectric power from the Columbia and other rivers to operate the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;

==Future policies==
Streetcars and other forms of rail transit are seeing rebirth in many cities (such as the LRT lines in Minnesota). It is possible that trolleybuses will see rebirth, as well; a more likely renaissance will come from hybrid technologies.  Hybrid trolleybuses allow for a majority of the line to be placed under cable, but with an option for a battery or diesel-powered engine to cover distances where putting cable in is unfeasible, or in the event of the need for rerouting. This still may result in issues; adding batteries or engines to the vehicle will increase the cost of production as well as increasing the vehicle's weight, and giving up space for passengers. 

Although trolleybuses may not see a rebirth, a related technology—trolleytrucks—are being proposed as a supplement to cargo trains. Trolleytrucks operate under the same principle as trolleybuses, and are powered by connecting to overhead wires. In the 2008 book, ''Transport Revolutions'', authors Richard Gilbert and Anthony Perl propose a plan that would move a majority of cargo shipments from trucks onto trolleytrucks.&lt;ref name=&quot;R11&quot; /&gt;
Currently, Los Angeles is looking at implementing hybrid-diesel-trolleytrucks in an effort to combat air pollution due to the shipping industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;R10&quot; /&gt;

==Qualitative Analysis==
[[File:Trolleybus innovation model.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Graph 1: Trolleybus life cycle data]]
Data were taken from the APTA 2012 Public Transportation Fact Book, found online. The oldest data presented by APTA comes from 1928, approximately 25 years after the first trolleybus systems were established in the United States. Data is continuous until 2010. This dataset is unique in that the entirety of the innovation period of the trolleybus in the United States was completed roughly 30 years after its initiation, around 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;

The innovation of a new technology (transportation or not) can be described as an S-curve with four major parts: birth, growth, maturity and decline. Initially after a technology is developed, its growth is slow as people are hesitant to adapt to it. Once it reaches a certain level (perhaps of understanding and/or acceptance), the growth exponentially increases. At another certain level, this growth slows and remains steady (possibly due to physical constraints, e.g. miles of land available for building interstate, number of cell phones the population can reasonably own). As the technology ages and newer technology develops, the old will decline, sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly.

In the trolleybus life cycle graph, the entirety of the life cycle is shown; one can see the clear S-curve innovation period of birth, growth and maturity followed by a drastic decline. 

[[File:Trolleybus innovation model v real.png|thumb|left|upright=1.8|Graph 2: Trolleybus real data v. statistical model]]

In order to perform statistical modeling, only the innovation period (1928–1952) was analyzed.  An Ordinary Least Squares (logistic) regression model was applied to estimate the following logistic function:

&lt;big&gt;S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]
&lt;/big&gt;

Where: 

*S(t) is the status measure (number of vehicles)
*t is time (annual, 1928–1952)
*(t0 is the inflection time (half of the peak)
*K is saturation status level (the peak)
And b is a coefficient, measuring an amount of impact on the independent variable. 

As the life-cycle of the trolleybus has already run through a complete iteration, K could be set to the peak value (7180 vehicles, in 1952) and t0 could be estimated as the year in which half that number of vehicles was reached (roughly 3590, in 1944). Using Solver, multiple iterations of analysis were run and final values of K=7951 and b= 0.225 were achieved. The resulting equation is then:

&lt;big&gt; S(t) = 7951/[1+exp(-0.225(t-1944)]&lt;/big&gt;

Which gives a model of the data as shown in Graph 2.

The Interstate Highway System is an interregional network of high-speed roads authorized under Dwight D. Eisenhower on June 29, 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;&gt;Cox, Wendell &amp; Love, Jean. (June 1996). The Best Investment A Nation Ever Made. Retrieved from http://www.publicpurpose.com/freewaypdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The network connected metropolitan areas, landmarks, and industrial areas, as well as provided mobility for the national defense system.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA&quot;&gt;Federal Highway Adminstration. (Updated 2012). Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Retrieved from http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/interstate.cfm on November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Interstate Highway Network has provided efficient routes for shipping, travel, and defense.  It has lead to decreases in travel time and freight costs.  With this connectedness, the United States has become a leader in super-highways with over 47,000 miles of road.
==S-Curve Modeling the Birth, Growth, and Maturity of the Interstate Highway System==
The S-Curve is used to model the life cycle of transportation modes.  It depicts the birth, growth, and maturity of the mode.
===The Life Cycle of the Interstate Highway System===
The S-Curve model depicted below shows the mileage of the Interstate Highway System.  It begins at a point greater than zero, because paved interregional roads existed before 1956.  With the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, the Interstate designation was implemented.  This designation was given to many existing roads.  The existing interregional road mileage cannot be extracted from the road data in a meaningful way. &lt;br&gt;
[[File:S-Curve Modeling of the Interstate Highway System.jpg|center]]

===Methodology===
The S-Curve model follows the formula S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)] where
* K= point of saturation
*b= a constant
*t= year
*t0= inflection point representing 1/2 K
Using this method, the S-Curve was shown to be a good fit, with an R^2 of 0.91.  The R^2 is an indicator of the goodness of fit for the regression used to estimate this curve.  K was estimated to be only slightly higher than the existing network, 48,500 miles, due to the slowing growth of roads and a shifted focus to maintenance by the Federal government.  T0, the point where mileage was 24,250, was determined to be 1922, following the growth patterns backward. Because the data begins after t0, only the top of the S curve is shown.&lt;br&gt;
Data was collected from the Highway Statistics publication provided by the Federal Highway Administration &lt;ref name=&quot;OHP&quot;&gt;Office of Highway Policy Information. (n.d.). Highway Statistics Series. Retrieved from http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics.cfm on November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Before The Interstate Highway System==
===World War I Era===
Long distance freight in the early 20th century was relegated shipped via railroads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freight&quot;&gt;Federal Highway Administration. (n.d.). Moving the Goods: As the Interstate Era Beings. Retrieved from (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/freight.htm) on November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  World War I increased demand of American goods in Europe.  As railroads reached maximum capacity, merchandisers turned to semi freight to get their goods to port.  As heavy loads were brought across America’s roads, they quickly deteriorated.  With this deterioration, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1916.  This increased federal funding for highways, provided money for rural post roads, and dedicated monies for roads through public lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;&gt;John Williamson. (2012). Federal Aid to Roads and Highways Since the 18th Century: A Legislative History.  Retrieved from http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42140.pdf on November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 


===The Great Depression and World War II===
Franklin D. Roosevelt established a National Interregional Highway committee to explore a system of interregional highways. With the stock market collapse of 1929 and the unemployment that accompanied the Great Depression, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1916 was amended.  From 1931 to 1933, $125 million was spent per year for road construction and improvements.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt; 

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States entered World War II and the Federal Government's focus shifted to war strategy.  In 1944, after the war, Roosevelt signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 that authorized the designation of 40,000 miles of a connected interregional network, but no funding for construction of additional road mileage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freight&quot;/&gt; 
===The Growth of the Automobile Throughout These Periods===
With the moving assembly line and interchangeable parts, the personal auto became affordable for Americans and thus demand grew in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot; /&gt; Suburbanization happened rapidly after World War II, and with poor public transit in the suburbs the demand for cars, and then roads, skyrocketed. 
==The Birth and Growth of the Interstate Highway System==
===Eisenhower's Inspirations===
In 1919, Dwight D. Eisenhower traveled in a convoy from Washington D.C. to San Francisco to demonstrate America’s “defense mobility.” &lt;ref name=&quot;OTR&quot;&gt;Petrsoki, Henry. (2006). Engineering: On the Road. American Scientist, 94(5), 396-399.&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy traveled, on average, 58 miles per day (approximately 5 miles per hour), slowed by rough and muddy roads, accidents, and socializing.&lt;ref name=&quot;OTR&quot;/&gt;  Eisenhower then experienced the superior roads of the German Autobahn during World War II; and witnessed the smooth flow of military soldiers and supplies.  These two events impacted future policy Eisenhower would enact.
===Policy's Role for Network Expansion===
Without Federal Government policy, it is difficult to imagine what the extent of the Interstate Highway System would be.  A series of federal research studies and legislative acts through the early 20th century lead to a massive overhaul of the road system, but arguably none more important than the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.  On June 29, 1956 Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law. &lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;/).   This bill authorized 41,000 miles of interstate highway to be completed by 1975. &lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;/).  Eisenhower was opposed to borrowing money to pay for projects and implemented a pay as you go system.  With this bill, the Highway Trust Fund was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;Garrison, William L. &amp; Levinson, David M. (2006).  The Transportation Experience. New York: Oxford University Express.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fund would be financed through an increase in the federal gas tax and other motor vehicle taxes. &lt;br&gt;
This legislation provided for 90% of costs associated with the construction of the new highways.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;/&gt; It established nationwide standards for construction, regulating speeds and minimum travel lanes and width.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA&quot;/&gt;  Other design aspects include fully controlled accesses, no traffic signals or intersections, and grade separated crossings.&lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;/&gt;
===The Interstate Highway's Impacts on Select Aspects in the United States===
====Quality of Life====
With increased travel speeds, it's logical to expect that travel time between locations would decrease.  Travel times decreased by up to 40% between cities.  Trips from Atlanta to Birmingham were 40% shorter after the interstate, while the travel time between Chicago and Minneapolis declined by 25%.&lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;/&gt; More difficult to quantify are the benefits added with the increase in choice.  American's now could choose larger spatial areas for housing, employment, health care, and retail.  The timesavings afforded from the interstate highway system allowed people to spend more time doing what they want, and less traveling to and fro.
====Safety====
The construction of the Interstate Highway was highly regulated.  It required engineering to that would allow speeds to be maintained and use of high quality materials
As of 1996, the fatality rate for the interstate highways is nearly 60% lower than the rest of the system. The injury rate is estimated to be 70% lower.  From 1957 to 1996, the safety related losses that were avoided by the use of the highway system were estimated to be $368 billion dollars (1996).&lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;/&gt;
====Economy====
From 1950 to 1989, 25% of the nation's productivity increase is attributable to highways (the Interstate System plus all other urban and rural highways).&lt;ref name=&quot;40Years&quot;/&gt;  The larger network provided more mobility of people and goods, expanding the market and competition.  With the improved road network semi freight became competitive with railroads.  Prior to the interstate system, the market for semi freight was primarily local deliveries.  Freight costs decreased with the increase in road quality.  With the decreased freight costs, semi freight was now competitive with rails.  This lead to lower cost freight and increased reliability with deliveries.
==Maturation of the Interstate System==
The physical and economic landscape of America has permanently changed with the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  The federal and state governments have shifted their focus from expansion to maintenance and from road expenditures to mass transit programs.  Even further, some local governments, with the support of the federal government have begun to tear down certain elements to &quot;correct&quot; the social maladies that occurred during construction. 
===Problems with the System===
The Highway Trust Fund is no longer funding highways exclusively.  After 1973, these funds have been used to support light rail, mass transit, bus and bike lanes, among other alternative transportation modes.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;Mohl, R. A., &amp; Rose, M. H. (2012). The Post-Interstate Era: Planning, Politics, and Policy since the 1970s. Journal Of Planning History, 11(1), 3-7&lt;/ref&gt; This may reflect the increased advocacy for a public transit system that more closely resembles international ones.&lt;br&gt;
In 1998 the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century added reconstruction to the authorized activities in the Interstate Maintenance Program.  Previously the only federally funded activities were resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA&quot;/&gt; The interstate system solved many problems in the 20th century, but since falling into disrepair, has many problems it now needs solved. Most of the infrastructure has surpassed its life expectancy.  In 1997, over five percent of bridges on the Interstate Highway System have been deemed structurally deficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;rc&quot;&gt;Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. (2007). Highway Bridge Conditions in the United States. Retrieved from https://apps.asce.org/reportcard/pdf/NHS%20Bridge%20Reconstruction%20Initiative.pdf on November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Congestion in major urban areas is a serious concern.  It has been estimated that Americans spend 4.2 billion hours stuck in traffic, to the toll of $78.2billion.  And it's only getting worse; the average daily vehicle miles traveled during congestion has grown from 25.9% in 1995 to 31.6% in 2004 with some regions exceeding that.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Civil Engineers. (2009). Infrastructure Fact Sheet. Retrieved from http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/sites/default/files/RC2009_roads.pdf on November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The construction of the Interstate Highway System was highly contested. For many reasons, including environmental and racial and social inequality in the construction process, the highway was rarely popular in the neighborhoods it dissected. Many years later, cities have proposed the destruction of these interstates. The Park East Freeway in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was removed after Mayor John Norquist campaigned heavily for the removal and a return to the street grid.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;/&gt; But Milwaukee is not alone in the desire to remove urban highways.  New York, Boston, and others have already replaced their highway systems with tunnels or boulevards and cities like Nashville, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and St. Louis have discussed and planned the removal of their urban highways, with the support of the Federal Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Adela Rusu is currently working as the Coordinator of the FOND platform, the Romanian NDGO platform which supports NGO's working or willing to implement projects in the fields of development and cooperation. Her academic background is in Political Science and European Studies and before working in the sector of development and cooperation she has worked in diplomacy and coordinated part-time projects and different actions in the same area.
*Relevant Expertise: Coordinator of the FOND platform, the Romanian NDGO platform which supports NGO's working or willing to implement projects in the fields of development and cooperation, experience in diplomacy

= Key points of the interview  =

*Project initiatives targeting the education for development and transnational cooperation are not met very often in our country. And I believe that this type of project could be very useful for activists and a very good way of promoting successful projects implemented by Romanian NGOs.
*There is one successful way to implement this type of projects: cooperation. I believe that educators, media and Local Authorities should find ways to collaborate and work together and address the same target group with different and useful tools. Media is therefore responsible with setting a coherent message. Local authorities have the necessary resources and can secure a more powerful impact.
*Anyone can be a world citizen if there is enough information to educate him in this direction and anybody can assist in achieving the objectives. For example, if all of us would recycle our own garbage, it would be easier to reach together the ecological goal. Those responsible for creating the right attitude are both the governmental and non-governmental actors that need to create a collaborative and complete effort, in order to have e better impact.

= Synopsis of the interview  =

==== How target stakeholders can contribute to the achievement of the MDGs?  ====

*The Romanian NDGO platform supports NGO's working or willing to implement projects in the fields of development and cooperation.
*The Romanian NGDO Platform (FOND) has as main objective the responsible and effective involvement of Romanian civil society and Government in international development cooperation and humanitarian aid. To this concern, FOND is a partner of the Romanian Government and the MFA in their process to implement the policy for international development cooperation.
*With a view to achieving the goals, the Federation aims: to represent the common goals of its members in the field of international development cooperation and humanitarian aid and development education at national and international level; to provide information regarding the development cooperation and humanitarian aid and the opportunities for cooperation between the FOND members and the international partners; to cooperate with the local and central public authorities and with other institutions in this field; to cooperate with the international partners on issues related to international development cooperation;
*Romania sustains the development of states from the geographic areas labeled as priorities for the Romanian foreign relations, namely the Eastern European states, the West Balkans and South Caucasian countries. However, Romania will, in principle, also support the least developed and low income countries. The list of beneficiary states is expanding towards Central Asia, Africa and Latin America, as Romanian capacities in the assistance for development field are being consolidated.
*Romania is, in principal, prepared to offer assistance in the following areas: Good governance, The strengthening of democracy and of the rule of law, Economic development, development education, Health, Development of infrastructure and environment protection.
*In the first phase, Romania will focus on a limited number of areas, where it has a strong advantage in comparison to the other donor countries: promoting human rights, strengthening of democracy, development education.
*All of us should be more active in different organizations, of all types and become volunteers in national campaigns to promote the MDGs. Thus, we can create a lobby group, a structure and influence the governmental actors. Organizations should also be part of wider, global platforms at the international level, such as FOND (The Romanian NGDO platform).
*We already have an working group very active in this direction, we are coordinating awareness campaigns and publish on our website material, documents and information regarding the MDGs. Creating awareness about the cooperation for development policies is one of our organization objectives and we are interested to further these efforts in different other programs and cooperation actions.
*We are interested in future partnerships both as a general platform and as individual organizations. Our fields of interest are similar and have similar objectives that can be achieved through partnerships in different projects.

&lt;br&gt; 

==== Identifies the capacity and knowledge gaps among target stakeholders in enabling informed choices among public with regard to support for global partnerships aimed at reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs?  ====

*While EC’s communication channels are well established, the message transmitted is not really focused on the idea of the assistance that needs to be created in order to help the others, it is not specifically related to the idea of cooperation for development.
*All the information that is available on the CE website is professional and very detailed but sometimes inaccessible. There the Info points such as Europe Direct but they do not provide materials and information on cooperation for development programs, they are related more to the general communication policy of the EU.
*I am aware that consistent efforts are being done regarding this policy but the informational tools available do not really reflect those efforts. The message is not accessible, is not “in your face” and sometimes a more proactive approach is necessary especially with regard to this type of actions.

==== What are the gaps and problems to be addressed through the manuals, web site and the documentaries?  ====

*There should be more materials and available information on the subject and a message focused on the cooperation for development policy.
*Global education is sometimes overlapping the education for development and this is not the right approach because global education has a general, wider audience.

&lt;br&gt;

The Romanian NGDO Platform (FOND) has as main objective the responsible and effective involvement of Romanian civil society and Government in international development cooperation and humanitarian aid.&lt;br&gt;To this concern, FOND is a partner of the Romanian Government and the MFA in their process to implement the policy for international development cooperation.&lt;br&gt;With a view to achieving the goals, the Federation aims:&lt;br&gt;a) to represent the common goals of its members in the field of international development cooperation and humanitarian aid and development education at national and international level;&lt;br&gt;b) to provide information regarding the development cooperation and humanitarian aid and the opportunities for cooperation between the FOND members and the international partners;&lt;br&gt;c) to facilitate the information exchange and mutual learning process between the FOND members;&lt;br&gt;d) to cooperate with the local and central public authorities and with other institutions in this field&lt;br&gt;e) to cooperate with the international partners on issues related to international development cooperation;&lt;br&gt;Romania sustains the development of states from the geographic areas labeled as priorities for the Romanian foreign relations, namely the Eastern European states, the West Balkans and South Caucasian countries. However, Romania will, in principle, also support the least developed and low income countries. The list of beneficiary states can be expanded towards Central Asia, Africa and Latin America, once Romanian capacities in the assistance for development field are being consolidated.&lt;br&gt;Romania is, in principal, prepared to offer assistance in the following areas: Good governance, The strengthening of democracy and of the rule of law, Economic development, development education, Health, Development of infrastructure and environment protection.&lt;br&gt;In the first phase, Romania will focus on a limited number of areas, where it has a strong advantage in comparison to the other donor countries: promoting human rights, strengthening of democracy, development education. 

*What made you interested you in our project? How are Eugad issues related to what you (and your Organization) do?

The project caught my attention because it considers an issue that it is not very popular in Romania. Project initiatives targeting the education for development and transnational cooperation are not met very often in our country. And I believe that this type of project could be very useful for activists and a very good way of promoting successful projects implemented by Romanian NGOs.



==== Issues (1) - How can we contribute to the achievement of the MDGs?  ====

*The United Nations member countries have committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and they are supposed to be setting out concrete plans and practical steps for action. Global objectives will be achieved through many coordinated locally based actions. Non State Actors and Local Governments are also supposed to do their part in this collective effort.&amp;nbsp; see http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/.&amp;nbsp;Please answer one (or more) of the three:

What do you think educators can do in order to support the activities aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals?|1.What do you think educators can do in order to support the activities aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goal? 

I believe that there is one successful way to implement this type of projects: cooperation. I believe that educators, media and Local Authorities should find ways to collaborate and work together and address the same target group with different and useful tools. Media is therefore responsible with setting a coherent message. Local authorities have the necessary resources and can secure a more powerful impact. 

==== Question about good/bad practices (1)  ====

*[[Can you tell us about a good practice of an action/ project/ initiative aimed at generating awareness for global development?|Can you tell us about a good/bad practice of an action/ project/ initiative aimed at generating awareness for global development? What was the purpose of this Action?&amp;nbsp;What did the Action achieve? What did you learn from this experience?]]&amp;nbsp;Did you collect, compile or create knowledge resources or tools that you would like to share with other development actors?&lt;br&gt;(answers to be uploaded in ⇒ [[Case Studies|Case studies]])

Research and analysis - There is a research paper on cooperation for development in Romania that analyses the situation before the revolutionary moment of '89 in Romania trying to discover the moment when the political/social/mental changes started and what has occurred after the transition period, insisting on the commitments we need to respect as member of the EU. &lt;br&gt;External support and cooperation - Activities of the NGOs, the projects they develop in the development direction and the evolution of their projects can be accessed through the TRIALOG platform aimed at raising awareness about development issues in the enlarged EU and strengthen development cooperation through the full integration of development NGOs from new EU member states and accession countries into CONCORD and other European Networks. &lt;br&gt;Agreements - The Cotonou Agreement, Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Groups of States and the European Community and its Member States – based on three complementary pillars – development cooperation, economic and trade cooperation, the political dimension.&lt;br&gt;Study visits for the member organizations in the targeted countries&lt;br&gt;Effective communication and information tools – website, specific section for resources and documents about the cooperation policies, clear information about the MDGs addressed to the general public. 

Africa Day, May 25, 2009, organized by the Romanian NGDO Platform and the Civil Society Development Fundation, in partnership with the Refugee Women's Organization in Romania and Save the Children Romania with the support of the Department for European Affairs. &lt;br&gt;Organization of a Seminar with the participation of Sophie LeRue-DG Development, European Commission, H.E. Ambassador Abdelhamid Senouci Bereksi-Algerian Embassy in Bucharest, Mihail Dobre-Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Middle East and Africa Directorate, Ana Vasilache-Partners Foundation for Local Development (FPDL). Among the objectives of the event:&lt;br&gt;analyze the relation between Romania and the African continent and find ways to improve them&lt;br&gt;discuss possible strategies in establishing nationhood, promote accelerated growth and sustainable development, eradicate severe poverty (NEPAD programme)&lt;br&gt;Organization of the event “Africa is everywhere” at the Romanian Peasant Museum to enhance the importance of the development cooperation policy and the needed contributions. &lt;br&gt;launching of a photo competition on MDGs, photo exhibition and documentary screening &lt;br&gt;open fair with traditional African costumes and artifacts.&lt;br&gt;As for bad practice, the few campaigns that have been implemented in Romania cannot really be compared, it is a relatively new domain, with a rather low level of experience that could not be efficiently evaluated at this point. And it would be difficult and quite irrelevant to compare the local actions with the international ones because Romania is only in the initial phase regarding this type of projects. Nevertheless, there is a rather inefficient approach that is met maybe too often in our country:&lt;br&gt; low budgets, inefficient promotion and communication campaigns. There is a need for investment in PR&amp;amp;Communication in the NGO field in order to create the tools that would sell a campaign or a product, even though it is the Non-for-profit sector &lt;br&gt;lack of resources and experience.&lt;br&gt; 

==== Issues (2) - How is the European Union contributing to the achievement of the MDGs?&amp;nbsp;  ====

*According to you how much money did the European Commission allocate in the year 2008 for achieving the MDGs?

Amounts are taken from the EU communitary budget. 

*Do you believe that the European Commission is doing enough to inform its citizens about the objectives and the scope of EU external aid programmes?

Yes EC informs well its citizens – communication channels are well established but the message transmitted is not really focused on the idea of the assistance that needs to be created in order to help the others, it is not specifically related to the idea of cooperation for development.&lt;br&gt;All the information that is available on the CE website is professional and very detailed but sometimes inaccessible. There the Info points such as Europe Direct but they do not provide materials and information on cooperation for development programs, they are related more to the general communication policy of the EU. &lt;br&gt;I am aware that consistent efforts are being done regarding this policy but the informational tools available do not really reflect those efforts. The message is not accessible, is not “in your face” and sometimes a more proactive approach is necessary especially with regard to this type of actions. 

*What can be done to improve the communication between EC and its citizens about the objectives and the scope of EU external aid programmes?

There should be more materials and available information on the subject and a message focused on the cooperation for development policy. &lt;br&gt; 

==== Issues&amp;nbsp; (3) How can people participate in the Global Development Agenda?  ====

*Do you think that common people can support and influence policies (at local, National and global level) targeting the implementation of commitments taken in favour of building the “global partnership for development”? How?

You can consider my previous example with the necessary individual involvement in recycling. Also, all of us should be more active in different organizations, of all types and become volunteers in national campaigns to promote the MDGs. Thus, we can create a lobby group, a structure and influence the governmental actors. Organizations should also be part of wider, global platforms at the international level, such as FOND (The Romanian NGDO platform) 

*Do you think that the “world citizenship” is a modality of self-awareness that can be achieved by all? Whose responsibility is it to build such an awareness? &amp;nbsp;

Global education is sometimes overlapping the education for development and this is not the right approach because global education has a general, wider audience. &lt;br&gt;Anyone can be a “world citizen” if there is enough information to educate him in this direction and anybody can assist in achieving the objectives. For example, if all of us would recycle our own garbage, it would be easier to reach together the ecological goal. Those responsible for creating the right attitude are both the governmental and non-governmental actors that need to create a collaborative and complete effort, in order to have e better impact. 

&lt;br&gt; 

==== Questions regarding the partner profile (2)  ====

*Do you think that your Organization/Company/Institution would be interested in having a bigger role in implementing the “global partnership for development” and in informing people on what Governments and Civil Society do/do not for achieving the Millennium Development Goals?&amp;nbsp;Among the activities of your Organization/Company/Institution, would you like to implement a program/action of Information/Education for Development? Why? (Or you already have one?)

We already have an working group very active in this direction, we are coordinating awareness campaigns and publish on our website material, documents and information regarding the MDGs. Creating awareness about the cooperation for development policies is one of our organization objectives and we are interested to further these efforts in different other programs and cooperation actions. 

&lt;br&gt; 

==== Questions of collecting feedbacks from stakeholders about project results (1)  ====

*Please read the draft index of the Manual that we are preparing.&amp;nbsp;What are the sections that are more relevant for you?&amp;nbsp;What are the sections that you think are not relevant for you?&amp;nbsp;Which other sections would you like to add?&lt;br&gt;What is the approach/methodology/style that you would like the manual to have in order to be really interesting and useful for you?

All mentioned sections are relevant and personalized for each of the targeted audience. It is important to create the best tools for the educators as they should be the best informed in this direction. When it comes to media, the language should be more accessible and needs to be personalized as the media professionals are the less informed about the issue and if a certain subject is not clear right from the start it is unlikely to be further approached. A general index for the manuals is suitable as a starting point but the manuals need to be personalized. As a remark about the general content, I confess that is has risen my curiosity and seems appealing enough for any type of reader. 

*In such a manual what kind of resources and tools would you like to find that that will help you in your professional activities? Can you share with us the knowledge, resources and tools developed by you/your organization that will help us in writing the manual and that can be shared with others through the project web resource library?

Resources and information that are available on the websites of the organizations that have already run programs and actions in this specific direction; those can be used for benchmarking, as examples of best practices and useful experience regarding different results achieved in the implemented campaigns, their impact and reaction among the public.&lt;br&gt;Also, research papers, organizational models, different efforts and actions. 

*Are there other knowledge resources you would like to suggest?&amp;nbsp;Web sites - Books - Journals - Audiovisuals

www.fondromania.org, for cooperation and development programs &lt;br&gt;www.mae.ro&lt;br&gt;www.concordeurope.org&lt;br&gt;www.trialog.or.at 

Put the resources suggested in the relevant sections of the resources collected in the manual: please go to http://www.eugad.eu/wiki/index.php?title=Other_resources 

==== Questions regarding the partner profile (3)  ====

*Would your organization/Company(Institution be interested in studying a possible area of cooperation with us to implement this Action?&lt;br&gt;What kinds of synergies and partnership do you envisage?

Yes, we are interested in future partnerships both as a general platform and as individual organizations. Our fields of interest are similar and have similar objectives that can be achieved through partnerships in different projects. 

==== Feedback on this interview  ====

*Are you satisfied with the questions and the approach of this interview?&amp;nbsp;Why?&amp;nbsp;Do you have any suggestion how we can improve?

The questionnaire is quite clear, the questions are targeted and have a precise objective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">History of Islam in Africa and accounts of how the religion spread, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa has always been contentious. Head of Awqaf Africa London, Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu has written in his Movements of Islam in face of the Empires and Kingdoms in Yorubaland claims about early arrival of Islam in the southwestern Nigeria. He seconded the Arab anthropologist Abduhu Badawi in the argument that the early Muslim missionaries had benefited their works from the fall of Kush in southern Sudan and the prosperity of the politically multicultural Abbasid period in the continent which, according to him, had created several streams of migration, moving west in the mid-9th Sub-Sahara. Adelabu pointed at the popularity and influences of the Abbasid Dynasty (750-1258), the second great dynasty with the rulers carrying the title of 'Caliph' as fostering peaceful and prosperous migration of the inter-cultured Muslims from Nile to Niger as well as of the Arab traders from Desert to Benue. Adelabu's claim seems to be in line with the conventional historical view that the conquest of North Africa by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate between AD 647–709 effectively ended Catholicism in Africa for several centuries.

In the sixteenth century, the Ouaddai Empire and the Kingdom of Kano embraced Islam, and later toward the eighteenth century, the Nigeria based Sokoto Caliphate led by Usman dan Fodio exerted considerable effort in spreading Islam. Today, Islam is the predominant religion of Northern Africa, mainly concentrated in North, Northeast Africa and the Sahel, as well as West Africa.


==Indigenous Religion==
The work of both Karade and Doumbia support the stance that the concept of 'force' or 'spirit' is a shared underlying theme among the spiritual traditions of the &quot;Sudanic&quot; cultures (i.e. those west of Cameroon and south of the Sahara). Karade asserts that in the Yoruba tradition of Nigeria, 'force' is called 'ashe'. He further posits that the task of a Yoruba practitioner is to contemplate and/or ceremonially embody the various deities and/or ancestral energies/profundities in ways analogous to how chakras are contemplated in kundalini yoga. In other words, the deities represent energies, attitudes, or potential ways to approach life. The goal is to elevate awareness while either in or contemplating any of these states of mind such that one can transmute negative or wasteful aspects of their energy into conduct and mindsets that serve as virtuous examples for oneself and the greater community. Doumbia and Doumbia echo this sentiment for the Mande tradition of Senegal, Mali, and many other regions of westernmost Africa. Here however, the 'force' concept is represented by the term 'nyama' rather than 'ashe'.

Divination also tends to play a major role in the process of transmuting negative or confused feelings/thoughts into more ordered and productive ones. Specifically, this process serves as a way to provide frames of reference such that those who are uncertain as to how to begin an undertaking and/or solve a problem can get their bearings and open a dialectic with their highest selves concerning their options on their paths.

'''Akan religion'''

The Akan people of Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire believe in a supreme god who takes on various names depending on the region of worship. Akan mythology claims that at one time the god interacted with man, but that after being continually struck by the pestle of an old woman pounding fufu, a traditional food, he moved into the sky.[11] No priests that serve him directly, and people believe that they may make direct contact with him. There are also numerous spirits (abosom), who receive their power from the supreme god and are most often connected to the world as it appears in its natural state. These include ocean and riverine spirits and various local deities. Priests serve individual spirits and act as mediators between the gods and mankind. Nearly everyone participates in daily prayer, which includes the pouring of libations as an offering to both the ancestors who are buried in the land and to the spirits who are everywhere. The earth is seen as a female deity and is directly connected to fertility and fecundity.

'''Odinani'''

Odinani encompasses the traditional religious and spiritual concepts and practices of the Igbo. It is a panentheistic faith. In Odinani, there is one supreme God called Chukwu (Igbo: Great spirit) who was before all things and heads over smaller deities called Alusi. There are different Alusi for different purposes, the most important of them is Ala the earth goddess. A traditional herbalist/priest among the Igbo is called Dibia.

'''Serer religion'''

The Sereer people of Senegal and the Gambia believe in a universal Supreme Deity called Roog also termed &quot;Roog Sene&quot; (Roog The Immensity). Their elaborate religious traditions deals with various dimensions of life and death, cosmology, astronomy, symbolism, poems, ancient chants etc. Lesser deities include Thiorak or Tulrakh (God of wealth) and Taahkarr or Takhar (God of justice or vengeance).

'''Ceremonies'''

West African religious practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies and/or divinatory rites in which members of the community, overcome by 'force' (or 'ashe', 'nyama', etc.), are excited to the point of going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic/mantric drumming and/or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the types of drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity/ancestor), participants embody a deity/ancestor, energy and/or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements/dances that further enhance their elevated consciousness, or, in Eastern terms, excite the kundalini to a specific level of awareness and/or circulate chi in a specific way within the body. When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, culturally educated observers are privy to a way of contemplating the pure/symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy/feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech. Further, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words that, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate/diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions that the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.

'''Deities'''

Followers of traditional African religions pray to various secondary deities (Ogoun, Da, Agwu, Esu, Mbari, Thiorak, etc.) as well as to their ancestors. These secondary gods serve as intermediaries between humans and the creator god. Most indigenous African societies believe in a single creator god (Chukwu, Nyame, Olodumare, Ngai, Roog, etc.) Some recognize a dual or complementary twin god such as Mawu-Lisa. For example, in one of the Yoruba creation myth, Olodumare, the supreme god, is said to have created Obatala, a secondary deity, who then created humans on earth. Olodumare then infused those human creations with life. &quot;Some societies also deify entities like the earth, the sun, the sea, lightning, or Nature. Each deity has its own priest or priestess.&quot;

'''Practices and rituals'''

There are more similarities than differences in all African traditional religions. Often, God is worshiped through consultation or communion with lesser deities and ancestral spirits. The deities and spirits are honored through libation, sacrifice (of animals, vegetables, or precious metals). The will of God is sought by the believer also through consultation of oracular deities, or divination. In many African traditional religions, there is a belief in a cyclical nature of reality. The living stand between their ancestors and the unborn. African traditional religions embrace natural phenomena - ebb and tide, waxing and waning moon, rain and drought - and the rhythmic pattern of agriculture. According to Gottlieb and Mbiti:

The environment and nature are infused in every aspect of African traditional religions and culture. This is largely because cosmology and beliefs are intricately intertwined with the natural phenomena and environment. All aspects of weather, thunder, lightening, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and so on may become emenable to control through the cosmology of African people. Natural phenomena are responsible for providing people with their daily needs.

For example in the Serer religion, one of the most sacred star in the cosmos is called Yoonir the (Star of Sirius). With a long farming tradition, the Serer high priests and priestesses (Saltigue) deliver yearly sermons at the Xoy Ceremony (divination ceremony) in Fatick before Yoonir's phase in order to predict winter months and enable farmers to start planting.

[[File:Early 20th century Yoruba divination board.jpg|thumbnail|left|Traditional divination board]]'''Divination'''

One of the most traditional methods of telling fortunes in Africa is called casting (or throwing) the bones. Because Africa is a large continent with many tribes and cultures, there is not one single technique. Not all of the &quot;bones&quot; are actually bones, small objects may include cowrie shells, stones, strips of leather, or flat pieces of wood. Some castings are done using sacred divination plates made of wood or performed on the ground (often within a circle) and they fall into one of two categories:

Casting marked bones, flat pieces of wood, shells, or leather strips and numerically counting up how they fall—either according to their markings or whether they do or do not touch one another—with mathematically based readings delivered as memorized results based on the chosen criteria.

Casting a special set of symbolic bones or an array of selected symbolic articles—as, for instance, using a bird's wing bone to symbolize travel, a round stone to symbolize a pregnant womb, and a bird foot to symbolize feeling.

In African society, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are no prohibitions against the practice. Those who tell fortunes for a living are also sought out for their wisdom as counselors and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.

==Consensual Fight==
A consensual fight is not an assault as the parties are consenting to the physical contact. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jobidon, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1991/1991canlii77/1991canlii77.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Consent can be negated or vitiated where the force causes bodily harm ''and'' was intended to be caused.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Paice, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2005/2005scc22/2005scc22.html 2005 SCC 22]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. W.G. 1994 90 CCC 3d 139 Ont.C.A.&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jobidon, 1991 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714 at p. 22, 23&lt;br&gt;
See R. v. Crosby 2005 PESCAD 1, (2005), 27 C.R. (6th) 39, 192 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (PEI Ct. of App.) during a fist fight, consent is not vitiated unless accused intended to inflict bodily harm
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, where serious bodily harm was intended and caused, there can be no consent.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sullivan, 2011 NLCA 6 at 13&lt;/ref&gt;
The necessary mens rea requires that the force be applied recklessly and the risk of bodily harm was objectively foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan at 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent in Sports==
While normally a person cannot consent to an assault that intends to cause bodily harm, there is an exception to this for  sports where the conduct is part of the norms of the particular sport.&lt;Ref&gt;Jobidon, [1991] 2 SCR 714&lt;/ref&gt; Thus sports players may consent to some bodily harm necessarily incidental to the sport. However, conduct that is deliberately for the purpose of inflicting injury will not be protected.&lt;REf&gt;

== Consent in domestic assaults==
There is a degree of implied consent in certain social interactions such as domestic partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Menkarios  2010 ONSC 5478 at para. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent can be used in a limited fashion for a defence to a domestic assault. There must be virtual no injury to the victim. Any injury that occurs can only be justified as an accident and not an intentional assault. 

Intentional force intended to cause bodily harm automatically negate any consent.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Shand (1998), 166 N.S.R. (2d) 74 (N.S.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Courts have highly resistant to recognizing consent to an assault between partners.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Downey, [2002] N.S.J. No. 442

==Fraud==
The failure of the accused to disclose that they are HIV positive before sex can vitiate any consent for sex that the victim gave.&lt;ref&gt;

==General Consent for Sexual Offences==
Section 273.1 states:
{{quotation|
'''Meaning of “consent”'''&lt;Br&gt;
273.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Where no consent obtained'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
:(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
:(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
:(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
:(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
:(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.&lt;br&gt;

'''Subsection (2) not limiting'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.
&lt;br&gt;
1992, c. 38, s. 1.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Where belief in consent not a defence'''&lt;br&gt;
273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
:(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s
::(i) self-induced intoxication, or
::(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
:(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.&lt;br&gt;

1992, c. 38, s. 1.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec273.1 CCC]}}

If the trial judge believes the complainant subjectively did not consent, the Crown has proved the absence of consent. The accused’s view of the complainant’s conduct is not relevant to whether the actus reus has been established. &lt;ref&gt;R v Ewanchuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqpm#par42 1999 CanLII 711] at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

If a victim is unconscious then the crown may prove lack of consent by circumstantial evidence. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. J.R., [2006] O.J. No. 2698 (S.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

While not required, for such evidence to be probative, some expert evidence is often necessary.
&lt;ref&gt;J.R., supra; R. v. B.S.B., [http://canlii.ca/t/1zh2w 2008 BCSC 917], affirmed 2009 BCCA 520&lt;/ref&gt;

As for capacity to consent, courts can infer a lack of capacity where there is direct evidence that:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. C.A., [http://www.canlii.org/en/yk/yksc/doc/2010/2010yksc32/2010yksc32.html 2010 YKSC 32]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the complainant was extremely intoxicated;
# the complainant was asleep or unconscious when the sexual touching commenced; or
# the complainant was asleep or unconscious during all of the sexual touching (B.S.B., supra at para. 45).

{{reflist|2}}
===Intoxication===
The capacity to consent requires more than simply the “baseline physical functions”.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Haraldson, [http://canlii.ca/t/frdg4 2012 ABCA 147] at 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Drunkeness is not the same as incapacity.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Jensen 1996 CanLII 1237 (ON CA), (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 430 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; Poor decision making, memory loss, or loss of inhibition or self-control due to alcohol does not negate consent.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Merritt, [2004] O.J. No. 1295 (Ont. S.C.J.)&lt;/ref&gt;
An intoxicated complainant may still have the ability to consent.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. R.(J) 2006 CanLII 22658 (ON SC), (2006), 40 C.R. (6th) 97 (Ont. S.C.J.) at paras. 17‑19, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Where alcohol may have vitiated consent, it may be best established by way of expert evidence.But it is not necessary as a matter of law.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Faulkner 1997 CanLII 1193 (ON CA), (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Ont. C.A.))&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Merritt, [2004] O.J. No. 1295 (Ont. S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hernandez, [1997] A.J. No. 955 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Cedeno, 2005 ONCJ 91 (CanLII), 2005 ONCJ 91, 195 C.C.C. (3d) 468 at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent may be vitiated by abusing a position of trust, power or authority. &lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Asfour, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mc1x 2006 CanLII 577] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, any threats or abuse that occurs after the event cannot go towards vitiation of consent.&lt;ref&gt;Asfour&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Honest but mistaken belief in Consent==
The defence of honest but mistaken belief of consent creates a third alternative to the choice between whether the alleged victim consented to the sexual contact. 

The defence is available where there is evidence of a &quot;denial of consent, lack of consent or incapacity to consent&quot; which is interpreted as consent, as well as &quot;evidence of ambiguity or equivocality&quot; showing the possibility of mistaken belief without being wilfully blind or reckless.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Esau, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 777 at para. 79, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the defence requires:
# evidence that the accused believed the complainant was consenting; 
#evidence that the complainant in fact refused consent did not consent, or was incapable of consenting; and 
# evidence of a state of ambiguity which explains how lack of consent could have been honestly understood by the defendant as consent, assuming he was not wilfully blind or reckless to whether the complainant was consenting, that is, assuming that he paid appropriate attention to the need for consent and to  whether she was consenting or not.

{{reflist|2}}
==Vitiating Consent by Fraud==
Where &quot;deception causes a misunderstanding as to the nature of the act itself there is no legally recognized consent because what happened is not that for which consent was given&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Cuerrier, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqr9 1998 CanLII 796 (SCC)], [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371 Cory J., at para 99
&lt;/ref&gt;Consent that is not based on a knowledge of the significant relevant factors in not valid.&lt;ref&gt;R v Cuerrier [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqr9 1998 CanLII 796] at para. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent for under 16 years of age== 
There are however sex acts involving persons under 18 years of age that are not criminal. Typically, they can be permitted where there is consent. The key rules are essentially as follows: 

* Persons who are 12 or 13 can consent to sex with persons no more than two years their elder and not in a position of trust (s150.1(2))
* Persons who are 14 or 15 can consent to sex with persons no more than five years their elder and not in a position of trust. Or they can consent if married. (s150.1(2.1))
* Persons aged 16 and above can consent as an adult.

'''Consent no defence'''&lt;br&gt;
150.1 (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (2.2), when an accused is charged with an offence under section 151 or 152 or subsection 153(1), 160(3) or 173(2) or is charged with an offence under section 271, 272 or 273 in respect of a complainant under the age of 16 years, it is not a defence that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Exception — complainant aged 12 or 13'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) When an accused is charged with an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 173(2) or section 271 in respect of a complainant who is 12 years of age or more but under the age of 14 years, it is a defence that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge if the accused
:(a) is less than two years older than the complainant; and
:(b) is not in a position of trust or authority towards the complainant, is not a person with whom the complainant is in a relationship of dependency and is not in a relationship with the complainant that is exploitative of the complainant.&lt;br&gt;

'''Exception — complainant aged 14 or 15'''&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) When an accused is charged with an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 173(2) or section 271 in respect of a complainant who is 14 years of age or more but under the age of 16 years, it is a defence that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge if
:(a) the accused
::(i) is less than five years older than the complainant; and
::(ii) is not in a position of trust or authority towards the complainant, is not a person with whom the complainant is in a relationship of dependency and is not in a relationship with the complainant that is exploitative of the complainant; or
:(b) the accused is married to the complainant.&lt;br&gt;

'''Exception for transitional purposes'''&lt;br&gt;
(2.2) When the accused referred to in subsection (2.1) is five or more years older than the complainant, it is a defence that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge if, on the day on which this subsection comes into force,
:(a) the accused is the common-law partner of the complainant, or has been cohabiting with the complainant in a conjugal relationship for a period of less than one year and they have had or are expecting to have a child as a result of the relationship; and
:(b) the accused is not in a position of trust or authority towards the complainant, is not a person with whom the complainant is in a relationship of dependency and is not in a relationship with the complainant that is exploitative of the complainant.&lt;br&gt;

'''Exemption for accused aged twelve or thirteen'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) No person aged twelve or thirteen years shall be tried for an offence under section 151 or 152 or subsection 173(2) unless the person is in a position of trust or authority towards the complainant, is a person with whom the complainant is in a relationship of dependency or is in a relationship with the complainant that is exploitative of the complainant.

'''Consent Under the Age of 16'''&lt;br&gt;
Consent cannot be used where the complainant is under the age of 16 except in very limited circumstances. (s.150.1) The accused can justify consent by establishing that they believed the complainant was at least 16 years old where all reasonable steps to ascertain age was taken.(s. 150.1(4)) However, the onus rests on the Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the steps were not taken.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. P. (L.T.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1wnvh 1997 CanLII 12464] (BC CA), (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 42 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mistaken Belief of Age==
An accused can only be found guilty of a sex offence under s. 151, 152, 160, 172.1, 173, 271, 272 or 273 which involves a minor where the accused had an honest belief the complainant was of an age of consent.
The crown as part of its case should prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused failed to take sufficient steps in all the circumstances to ascertain the complainant's age.

The standard to determine the sufficiency of the steps varies depending on the offence. Offences relying on s. 150.1  require the accused take &quot;all reasonable steps&quot;, while offences under s. 172.1(4) require &quot;reasonable steps&quot;.

{{quotation|
s. 172.1...&lt;br&gt;
'''Presumption re age'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) was represented to the accused as being under the age of eighteen years, sixteen years or fourteen years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the accused believed that the person was under that age.
&lt;br&gt;
'''No defence'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph was at least eighteen years of age, sixteen years or fourteen years of age, as the case may be, unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.

&lt;/ref&gt; 
#knowledge of the complainant
#physical appearance
#age and appearance of the complainant's associates
#age differential between the accused and the complainant
#demeanour of the complainant
#the time and location of the alleged sexual assault
#any other relevant times or places

It is generally understood that less familiar the parties are the more steps that are required to confirm there is consent to sexual activity.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Dippel, 2011 ABCA 129&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Crangle, 2010 ONCA 451, 77 C.R. (6th) 98, 256 C.C.C. (3d) 234leave to appeal refused 416 N.R. 390 (note) (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The bigger the age difference between the parties the greater the expectation that the accused would make more inquiries.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. K. (R. A.) 1996 CanLII 7277 (NB CA), (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 93 (N.B.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Getting an Image on the Screen (Depreciated)==

To get an image on the screen (using an older depreciated method), you have to include the image file in your project directory, and include the Core Graphics toolbox headers in your project. there is also a function the create a CG imageRef from a jpg or png file. 

include resources &quot;pBoard.png&quot;
include &quot;Tlbx CoreGraphics.incl&quot;

// Create a CGImageRef from a jpg or png image [KenS]
local fn createCGImageRef( fileName as CFStringRef ) as CGImageRef
  dim as CFURLRef url
  dim as CGImageRef imageRef : imageRef = 0
  dim as CGDataProviderRef dataProvider

url = fn CFBundleCopyResourceURL( fn CFBundleGetMainBundle(), filename, 0, 0 )
long if ( url )
  dataProvider = fn CGDataProviderCreateWithURL( url )
  long if ( dataProvider )
select
  case fn CFStringHasSuffix( fileName, fn CFSTR( &quot;.jpg&quot; ) )
  imageRef = fn CGImageCreateWithJPEGDataProvider( dataProvider, NULL, _false, _kCGRenderingIntentDefault )

  case fn CFStringHasSuffix( fileName, fn CFSTR( &quot;.png&quot; ) )
  imageRef = fn CGImageCreateWithPNGDataProvider( dataProvider, NULL, _false, _kCGRenderingIntentDefault )
end select
fn CGDataProviderRelease( dataProvider )
end if
CFRelease( url )
end if

end fn = imageRef

Once you have the above function and includes in your project, you can add an image to a window — and it takes the form of a button, whose contents we set with the image pointed to by the CG imageRef, like so: 

// DISPLAY BACKGROUND IMAGE
dim as rect r
dim as ControlButtonContentInfo content
SetRect( @r, 20, 20, 532, 532 )

      <text xml:space="preserve">===How about a Rhetorical Analysis section?===

I was thinking that either someone could add a separate section on the rhetorical analysis. Or, someone could add on to the commentary. The rhetorical analysis and commentary seem to go hand in hand and, because of that, I think that the rhetorical analysis is an important genre on which we should write. What are your opinions on this?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Online dating scams&lt;/b&gt; (also referred to as &lt;b&gt;internet romance scams&lt;/b&gt;) are attempts to defraud users of [[w:Online_dating_service|online dating websites]] through fictitious personal profiles. Perpetrators of these scams often misrepresent themselves as single individuals looking for a romantic or sexual relationship to develop an emotional bond with the victim, which is then used to extort money or goods from the victim. These scams frequently originate overseas, particularly [[w:West Africa|West Africa]] or [[w:Eastern Europe|Eastern Europe]], although scammers have been known to operate inside the United States as well&lt;ref&gt;ABC news report.

Internet romance scams are a growing and under-reported problem. Over 9,000 Americans reported internet romance scams in 2011, at a cost of over $50 million. Some researchers estimate as many as 230,000 UK citizens have fallen victim to these crimes, losing a total of $60 billion &lt;ref&gt; Whitty, M.

Retrieved from: http://www.ic3.gov/media/annualreport/2011_IC3Report.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Online relationships initiated by scammers frequently exhibit similar characteristics, such as rapidly intensifying romantic language, unrealistically attractive photographs, and extremely bad luck when travelling (such as plane crashes, crooked hotel operators, and detention at customs)&lt;ref&gt;State Department briefing on internet romance scams: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/financial_scams/financial_scams_4554.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Implementation=

===Method===
Internet romance scams often take place through online dating services, such as [http://www.match.com match.com] and [http://www.okcupid.com OKCupid]. Sites catering to international dating have also been singled out as popular scam venues. Scammers, hiding behind fictitious profiles, initiate a relationship with an individual seeking companionship, marriage, or a sexual relationship. These relationships develop quickly and intensely. One character commonly described by victims is an attractive, wealthy American citizen living abroad, frequently in [[w:Nigeria|Nigeria]] or another west African country. Once a potential victim has built a strong emotional bond with his or her would-be lover, the scammer will begin to solicit funds in order to deal with a series of increasingly unfortunate situation. These complications may be family-related (a close family member is very sick and needs financial assistance) or travel-related (a hotel manager has seized my passport, or immigration officials require bribes). Payments are often made through wire transfer, although victims have been asked to send physical goods, like electronics, as well&lt;ref&gt;20/20 segment, June 2011: http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/We_Find_Them/online-dating-nightmare-ny-woman-scammed-thousands-soldier/story?id=13898664&lt;/ref&gt;. Once a payment has been made, the scammer will stumble into more and more tragic situations, requiring more and more money from the victim, until the victim terminates the relationship or the scammer ceases contact.

This model is but one common scam with endless variations. These operations may be individual, amateur efforts, or executed by larger crime syndicates based overseas &lt;ref&gt;Brenoff, A. &quot;Online Dating Scams: Buyers Beware.&quot; Retrieved from: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/14/online-dating-scams_n_1263837.html#slide=679870 &lt;/ref&gt;. Entrenched criminal organizations have greater resources to set up more believable scams, like those featuring the invented &quot;John Scofield,&quot; a well-connected, handsome character living in Florida; Scofield's profile was used simultaneously in multiple scams around the country&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Debbie Best: Online Dating Scammer Made Off With Her Money And Heart.&quot; Retrieved from: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/25/debbie-best-online-dating-scam_n_1959219.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Targets===

[[File:OnlineRomanceScamTarget.PNG|thumbnail|Age and gender demographics of American scam targets, 2011. Older women are disproportionately affected.]]

All demographics are at risk for online dating scams. However, scams disproportionately target older women: 68% of complaints submitted in 2011 were targeted at women, and 82% of those affected women over 40 years of age. Women who have been divorced, disabled, or widowed are also prime targets. This data is likely under-reported due to victims' embarrassment and the psychological impact of the crimes&lt;ref&gt;The British Psychological Society. &quot;Victims of online dating scams feel doubly traumatised.&quot; Retrieved from: http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=119442&amp;CultureCode=en&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also believed that these scams are designed such that victims self-select; the nature of the scams decreases victim density and selects only the most vulnerable victims&lt;ref&gt;Herley, C. &quot;Why Do Nigerian Scammers Say They are From Nigeria?&quot; Retrieved from: http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/167713/WhyFromNigeria.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Examples===

[[File:DatingScamPassport.jpg|thumbnail|Falsified passport used in an actual internet romance scam. The deception is obvious to observers, but often ignored by willing victims&lt;ref&gt; State Department warning regarding online dating scams: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/financial_scams/financial_scams_4554.html &lt;/ref&gt;.]]

In one case published by the [[w:United_States_Department_of_State | U.S. State Department]], a male dating-service user has courted a potential companion for several months before being asked for money to cover her bizarre expenses&lt;ref&gt; State Department warning regarding online dating scams: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/financial_scams/financial_scams_4554.html &lt;/ref&gt;:

{{quote|&quot;My dad he's from us and my mum is from Spain.  So I’m a honest and trustworthy lady.  And I don’t like people cheating.  Right now I’m in West Africa.  There was a guy that I met when I’m still at home in Florida (two month ago) so the guy told me that he love me. And I told him that I love him too.  So he traveled to West Africa...But I don’t really know that the guy doesn’t love me.  We have fun and know much more about each other together in the same room.  And the next day I can't find this guy any more he ran away with all my money and my goods. All I need now…$500 US dollars.&quot;}}

In this case, the male suitor began to ask probing questions about his online companion's access to [[w:Credit_(finance)|credit]], her exact location, and her family resources. After several unconvincing answers (the scammer claims her country is [[w:West Africa|West Africa]] and that her entire family perished recently in a [[w:Plane_crash|plane crash]]), the suitor terminates the relationship, avoiding fraud. This situation illustrates several common characteristics of scams. The individual:

* experiences very bad luck (robbery, tragic accident)
* has no other access to money
* is an American stranded abroad
* promises to live with the victim once in America
* expresses impatience when challenged

Other notable examples include those with actual photographs used to deceive potential victims. These images often appear to be modified or copied out of glamour magazines; unrealistically attractive or flawless people are often indicators of some degree of fraud&lt;ref&gt; ScamWatch, an Australian government resource: http://www.scamwatch.gov.au/content/index.phtml/tag/datingromancescams&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Psychological Influences=
As an outsider, many online romance scams seem obvious. Fifty-two percent of online-using adults have heard of these deceptions&lt;ref name=&quot;dori&quot;&gt; Hartley, D (2011, Sept. 26). &quot;Perfect stranger: how I fell victim to online 'romance fraud'.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt;. Retrieved from: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dori-hartley/internet-romance-the-mons_b_981068.html&lt;/ref&gt;. One out of fifty adults online personally know a victim&lt;ref name=&quot;dori&quot; /&gt;. In popular culture, like the television show ''[[w:Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', people who fall for online scams are portrayed as naive, oblivious, or out-of-date&lt;ref name=&quot;fotc&quot;&gt;Flight of the Conchords television show. Season 2, Episode 2. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAH43TZYGt4&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this, people continue to be duped by these scams. Many psychological effects, including [[w:Self-deception|self-deception]], [[w:optimism bias|optimism bias]], and the [[w:valence effect|valence effect]], cause people to fall for these scams.

===Self-Deception===
Self-deception is when a person rationalizes away or denies opposing evidence or logic. In online romance scams, victims overlook noticeable red flags for personal reasons. One victim who exhibited this effect is [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dori-hartley/ Dori Hartley]. After surviving cancer, Dori Hartley was in a five year online relationship with a scammer pretending to be a cancer patient named &quot;Dimitri.&quot; Throughout the relationship, &quot;Dimitri&quot; refused to show Dori a picture of his face, claiming he felt embarrassed by how he looked with cancer&lt;ref name=&quot;dori&quot; /&gt;. To an outside observer, this action seems suspicious and characteristic of an online dating scam. However, Dori overlooked her lover's suspect claim:

{{quote|&quot;I was a cancer survivor myself, so I knew how important it was to be loved and supported during this impossibly heart-breaking time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dori&quot; /&gt;}}

Dori's recent psychological trauma caused her to rationalize this suspicious activity for a shot at love with someone who also experienced the same pain and suffering she did. Victims project their own perceptions on suspicious behavior because they desperately want their online relationship to succeed. People who recently experienced hardship, such as divorcees and widowers, tend to fall in this category.

===Optimism Bias===
Optimism bias is when someone feels less at risk for a negative outcome than the average person. Many victims believe that because so many people use online dating sites, their chances of coming across a romance scammer are fairly slim. Currently, [http://www.match.com Match.com] has over 1.8 million paying subscribers&lt;ref name=&quot;match&quot;&gt; Gelles, D (2011, Sept. 26). &quot;Inside match.com.&quot; &lt;i&gt;FT Magazine&lt;/i&gt;. Retrieved from: http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f31cae04-b8ca-11e0-8206-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2EyW0ugyV&lt;/ref&gt;. [http://www.eHarmony.com eHarmony] has over 20 million registered users&lt;ref name=&quot;eharmony&quot;&gt; &quot;About eHarmony.&quot; &lt;i&gt;eHarmony&lt;/i&gt;. Retrieved from: http://www.eharmony.com/about/eharmony/&lt;/ref&gt;. One out of five single Americans have gone on a date with someone they met online&lt;ref name=&quot;match-cmb&quot;&gt; Match.com and Chadwick Martin Bailey (2010). &lt;i&gt;Match.com and Chadwick Martin Bailey 2009 - 2010 Studies: Recent Trends: Online Dating&lt;/i&gt; [Press Release]. Retrieved from cp.match.com/cppp/media/CMB_Study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The optimism bias causes legitimate users of online dating websites to underestimate their own risk of encountering an online romance scam. However, all demographics are still at risk for online dating scams, and more people on dating websites can lead to more scammers looking to exploit them.

===Valence Effect===
The valence effect is when people tend to overestimate the probability of a positive event. Victims of online romance scams are often influenced by the perceived success of online dating websites. In the United States, seventeen percent of couples married between 2008 and 2010 met through an online dating service&lt;ref name=&quot;match-cmb&quot; /&gt;. On average, 542 Americans matched on [http://www.eHarmony.com eHarmony] are married every day&lt;ref name=&quot;eharmony&quot; /&gt;. Victims of online romance scams believe that if all these people are finding the love of their lives online, they will be able to, too. Online dating has been featured in popular culture. Popular films, such as ''[[w:You've Got Mail|You've Got Mail]]'' and ''[[w:Must Love Dogs|Must Love Dogs]]'', feature protagonists who meet online, fall in love, and live happily ever after. These movies perpetuate unrealistic, pristine expectations for online relationships and may shape victims' assumptions and cause them to overlook suspicious online behavior in exchange for chance at love.

=Related Scams=
===Confidence Scams===
Online Dating Scams use internet technology to augment scamming practices that have existed for hundreds of years. The evolution of technology in scams can be analyzed through three case-studies: those committed by [[w:William Thompson (confidence man)|William Thompson]], [[w:H.H. Holmes|H.H. Holmes]], and [[w:Oral Roberts|Oral Roberts]]. William Thompson lived in New York City in the 1840s. Thompson built personal relationships with strangers on the street and asked to borrow their valuable pocket-watches before disappearing. Through this practice, Thompson was dubbed by the media as the first &quot;Confidence Man&lt;ref&gt;New-York Herald, July 8, 1849. Retrieved from: http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/328/&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; His success was based on his attractiveness, personal relations skills, and his ability to identify potential victims. H.H. Holmes took advantage of the technology showcased at the [[w:World's_Columbian_Exposition|1893 Chicago World's Fair]] to become one of the first documented American serial killers. Holmes preyed on visitors to the fair, offering them a place to stay or companionship before taking their lives. Although he exploited contemporary technology to reach a high concentration of victims, Holmes relied on his own ability to attract people in person to deceive his victims. Oral Roberts was a [[w:televangelist|televangelist]] who took advantage of television technology to find a large and varied group of donors for his controversial fundraising tactics&lt;ref&gt;Biema, D.V. &quot;Oral Roberts to the Rescue?&quot; Retrieved from: http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1677098,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Like Holmes, Roberts' use of contemporary technology helped him find a wide set of victims. However, television does not provide anonymity; Roberts' success still rested on his attractiveness and personal relations skills. The internet dating scam can be viewed as the next step in this evolution - online scammers attract their victims through similar tactics, but they are able to take advantage of the internet's wide audience and anonymity.

===Advance Fee Frauds===
Another prominent type of scam is the Advance Fee Fraud. In this class of scam, the scammer tells the victim that they need help moving or securing a large sum of money, and in exchange for assistance the victim can keep a percentage of the money. The victim, in order to accept the deal, gives the scammer their bank account information&lt;ref&gt;US Securities and Exchange Comission Definition of &quot;Advanced Fee Fraud Schemes.&quot; Retrieved from: http://www.sec.gov/answers/nigeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Famous examples of Advance Fee Frauds include [[w:Nigerian Scam|Nigerian Prince Scams]] and [[w:Spanish Prisoner|Spanish Prisoner Scams]]. Much like dating scams and Confidence Scams, Advance Fee Frauds started as early as 1827&lt;ref&gt;Description of a Spanish Prisoner Scam from &quot;Memoirs of Vidocq: principal agent of the French police until 1827&quot; Retrieved from: http://books.google.com/books?id=uGQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=vidocq+jerusalem+letter#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and have grown in prevalance and complexity along with relevant technologies. 

=Conclusion=
Internet romance scams are a serious social problem. Thousands of victims are affected every year. Money, material possessions, and emotional security can all be lost as a result of these scams. While the internet has provided anonymity and widespread access to potential victims, similar practices of scamming have been around for centuries. These internet scams are more effective because the internet increases anonymity and allows attackers to pursue multiple victims simultaneously.
Other than these, there are various work-at-home scams as well which are meant to dupe the &quot;investors&quot; looking for quick profits of their hard earned cash.
One must take care to avoid the work at home online scams as well. Other than these there are numerous applications that can help, for example, by listing who has visited your Facebook profile.

Take care and keep your eyes and ears open to avoid being taken for a ride.

=Introduction=
[[File:Bart-map.png|thumb|alt=alt text|A Map of the Current Bay Area Rapid Transit System]]
[[File:Bart-logo.svg|thumb|alt=alt text|The BART Logo]]
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) System is a public transportation system that serves the Bay Area in northern California.  It is comprised of 5 train lines complete with 44 stations over 104 miles of track.&lt;ref name = &quot;barthistory&quot; /&gt;  It's average weekday ridership is 379,300.&lt;ref name = &quot;bartreports&quot; /&gt;  It has been a part of the transportation system in the Bay Area since 1972,&lt;ref name = &quot;barthistory&quot; /&gt; and has slight additions planned for the near future.  &lt;br /&gt;
It has not always been a total of 5 lines over 104 miles; the system has been implemented over many decades and is the result of extensive planning and work over many decades.  Obviously its main market are inhabitants of the Bay Area, primarily San Francisco and Oakland as residents of these areas have direct links to many other destinations, not needing to make transfers as often as a resident of Fremont, for example.  This is perhaps a general reflection of the higher populations (and population densities) of Oakland and San Francisco.  Other beneficiaries are of course anyone who would like to use the system, such as people from out-of-town arriving to San Francisco International Airport.  Plans are in place to expand the BART system to provide service to Oakland International Airport, currently served by an &quot;airBART&quot; bus.  These plans are currently under construction by a private firm Doppelmayr, and are scheduled for completion in 2014.&lt;ref name = &quot;OAKconnect&quot; /&gt;
==History==
[[File:BART TrackGeometryCar.jpg|thumbnail|right|An older car used in the BART System, now decommissioned.]]
The Bay Area in northern California is host to a number of cities including San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland.  In total the area had over 7 million inhabitants.&lt;ref name = &quot;bacensus&quot; /&gt;  As a large area with many inhabitants, a comprehensive transportation network is demanded.  Of course the area grew to its current population level, and has not always been a populous area.  In 1946, the idea for BART was first devised.&lt;ref name = &quot;barthistory&quot; /&gt;  It came from the many people living on both sides of the bay (in and around San Francisco and Oakland) demanding a quicker means of traveling across the bay.  The current primary option was crossing the bay by automobile, while other options included traveling south around the bend (near San Jose) or traveling across the bay by water.  By connecting the two areas, travel times could be greatly decreased.  While the demand initially came from the public and business owners, the project ultimately required government implementation.  With the area facing a post-war population boom, in addition to a boom in the demand of automobiles, it became clear that the Bay Bridge would not be able to handle inclement demand.&lt;br /&gt;
The project required cooperation from a number of municipalities, and required revenue from a number of locations.  Unfortunately, throughout the construction process many litigation suits formed, causing increased and unforeseen costs both financial and in time delays.  This obviously hurt development of the technology, and decreased the public benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
Initially, the BART System was composed of only 75 miles of rail, with 33 stations.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  The payment system has always been an automatic one, only recently in 2002 switching over to a &quot;Clipper Card&quot;, discussed further in the Payment Section.  This original 75-mile composure was approximately over 25 miles of aerial structures, 25 miles of subway, and only 25 miles of surface track.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  The varying types undoubtedly increased cost.

==Technology==
[[File:DalyCitysta.jpg|thumbnail|right|A BART Train Car at the Daly City Station.]]
[[File:BART third rails croppedandrotated.jpg|thumbnail|left|A view of the wide gauge used in the Bay Area Rapid Transit System]]
[[File:LegoBrick BART.jpg|thumbnail|right|A BART Train stopped at a station.]]
The tracks are split 5'6&quot; in the BART System.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  This is unconventional, and creates difficulty if another train system wanted to connect to the BART System.  In other words, it would be nearly impossible.  The purpose behind this wide gauge was to reduce train sway when traveling at high speeds.  A 1,000 Volt Direct Current line that runs about the entire system is what powers the trains as they move, provided by a trackside &quot;third rail&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  Each car has seating for 72 passengers.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  The train can peak around 80 miles per hour with an average operating speed around 50 miles per hour.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  The cars will be complete with carpeted floors, automatic air conditioning, reading lights, and wide windows.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;  These features are rather lavish for a commuter's public transportation system.  The carpeted floors also raise concerns for high maintenance costs, especially in cleaning.  This is not as difficult and time-consuming with a hard floor, where one can simply mop to clean the floors.&lt;br /&gt;
According to reports, the carrying capacity of the BART System is &quot;30,000 seated passengers per hour on a single line in one direction&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;stokes1970bay&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Vibration control has been a focus of recent research, as there are currently proposals to expand the BART System to San Jose, a city on the south of the Bay.  While the vibration controls initially implemented are largely performing as expected, there have been some unanticipated results causing damage to the system, which would like to be solved before another link is implemented.&lt;ref name = &quot;saurenman2006service&quot; /&gt;
===Bus Connections===
The BART System is well connected throughout its 44 stations to provide bus service to many other areas not served by the trains.  Unfortunately, connecting do a bus does not always mean that one can use their &quot;Clipper Card&quot; for payment.  WestCAT and Dumbarton Express are examples of bus connection services that to not make use of the same payment system.  This system makes it difficult for users thus discouraging them, and is in stark contrast with a metro system like that of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.

===Earthquake Preparation===
A study completed in 2002 concluded that the BART system is largely unprepared for a serious earthquake in the Bay Area.  The link of primary concern is the Transbay Tube, a link between San Francisco and Oakland.  Not only is this link a high-usage link of the system but damage to the link could be severe should an earthquake occur, making it a primary concern.  Other main concerns include aerial structures and train stations.&lt;ref name = &quot;earthquake&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike previous developments of the BART System, Doppelmayr will provide the deep foundations, columns, and bent caps necessary to withstand an earthquake in their development of the Oakland International Airport Connector, scheduled for completion in 2014.  Their production will also provide an increase in capacity to the Oakland International Airport, further enhancing the BART System.&lt;ref name = &quot;jones2011oakland&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many concepts have been discussed regarding improvement of the technology behind the BART System in preparation for an earthquake, though little has resulted.

===Payment===
[[File:Clipper card tagging use.jpg|thumb|left|A Clipper Card being swiped at a pay terminal.]]
The primary and encouraged method of payment for the BART system is to use a reloadable card, that can simply be passed over a payment terminal to pay for a charge.  The technology, called a &quot;Clipper Card&quot;, was first implemented in 2002 and has since been rebranded to its current name, the Clipper Card.  It is functional across eight transit agencies&lt;ref name = &quot;useclipper&quot; /&gt;: AC Transit, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Caltrain, Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, SamTrans, San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and the San Francisco Bay Ferry (for use on the South San Francisco - Oakland/Alameda route only).

===Riders' Noise Exposure===
A recent study by Dinno et al. noticed that there is a significant amount of noise exposure for riders on the BART System.  By observing and analyzing three dosimetry measures, they concluded that 1% of the line segment rides on the BART System posed acute hazardous exposures to adults and 2% of the line segment rides were hazardous to children.  They identified specific rail segments that could be improved, and noted that the noise problems were a function of high velocity, flooring of the train cars, as well as enclosed tunnels the trains pass through.&lt;ref name = &quot;dinno2011study&quot; /&gt;

=Role of Policy=
Policy played a crucial role in the development (or in some cases lack thereof) of the BART System in the Bay Area.  Their policies towards specific events have also played an interesting role.  Unfortunately according to recent research by Renne, policy may have not played as important a role as it should have during the development of the BART System over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name = &quot;renne2009transit&quot; /&gt; Renne looks at transit-adjacent and transit-oriented development of transit stations of the BART System.&lt;br /&gt;
Initial studies conducted in the 1970s indicated that the BART System didn't play a tremendous role in land-use patterns.&lt;ref name = &quot;cervero1997twenty&quot; /&gt;  While there were some consequences, it apparently caused minimal changes.  However, the BART System has not achieved what it was intended to do in terms of encouraging growth according to a study in the 1990s.&lt;ref name = &quot;cervero1997twenty&quot; /&gt;  In order to do this, stronger public policy initiatives are needed in many other sectors, not just from BART, so that growth is encouraged around the BART corridors and stations.&lt;br /&gt;
The methodology behind the initial planning phase of the BART System may hold answers to a lot of the questions that surround the system.  For example, the planning was divided up into many segments that seemed to favor municipalities, and had little overarching policy or views.&lt;ref name = &quot;connolly2004bay&quot; /&gt;

==Cell Phone Shutdown Incident==
In late 2011, protests were planned in the Bay Area, that were the result of the killing of Charles Hill.  In response to the protest, BART had cell phone communications disabled at four of their train stations, to act against the public's ability to organize.&lt;ref name = &quot;fcc&quot; /&gt;  This attracted much controversy.&lt;ref name = &quot;lackert2011forum&quot; /&gt;

==Ticket Pricing==
The fares for a trip within the BART system can vary, starting from $1.75 and is based on distance.  The most expensive trip possible on the system can be $10.90, a rather steep price for public transportation.  This methodology differs from a metro area like Minneapolis-St.Paul, where their metro system offers a flat rate for system-wide transit (within 2.5 hours) with a rate based on peak or non-peak hours.&lt;ref name = &quot;quickplan&quot; /&gt;  Like many other systems, there are multiple types of tickets a customer can purchase, though it is largely based on age and status.&lt;ref name = &quot;quickplan&quot; /&gt;

=Life Cycle=
As is the case with any mode in transportation, there are multiple stages that the mode will endure.  One of these stages is the magic bullet, which arguably never happened to the Bay Area Rapid Transit System technology.  Because the gauge for the rail in the transit system is proprietary, albeit beneficial, it is difficult for others to adopt and is seldom used elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, because the municipal governments in the Bay Area have not abandoned the technology, the system has seen multiple improvements throughout its history and continues to receive enhancement projects as well as future planning.  It could be argued that given the cost of already installing the system, it would make no sense to abandon the asset, despite the BART System having never met initial ridership projections.

==Ridership==
While the BART System has been fully developed and serves many municipalities within the Bay Area, it has largely failed to meet expectations and initial and preliminary estimates for ridership.&lt;ref name = &quot;connolly2004bay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;west2004bay&quot; /&gt;  Furthermore, expansions to meet those ridership estimates have also failed.&lt;ref name = &quot;bonsiewich2005newsbriefs&quot; /&gt;  The initial policies towards the BART System implementation from 40–50 years ago may be to blame for these continually failed projections.&lt;ref name = &quot;connolly2004bay&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Bartchart.jpg|frameless|right|A graph showing the model and the annual alightings about the Bay Area Rapid Transit System]]
Ridership last year was 105,800,594 alightings.  For the past few years, ridership has increased.  This has not always been the case and the system has seen a few down years, such as 1980 and a continual decrease from 2001–2004, among others.  More notably, the BART System has never seen the rate of ridership increase over any two year span.  While it has stretches in which ridership increases for many years, the rate at which that is variable, and we rarely see any sort of sustained exponential growth.

==Analysis==
After conducting an analysis to fit the data from the BART System annual alightings to that of a typical S-Curve used to model the life cycles of modes of transportation, it was concluded that the BART System is very near its peak ridership, which is projected to be 116,121,000.  With last years ridership at 105,800,594, and this years ridership expected to be a little higher than that, it can be expected that the system will peak in the next few years.&lt;br /&gt;
To put a specific year on this analysis is naive, however, because it would not take into account multiple things including some aforementioned.  First of all, the system is seeing current expansion, such as the work being done to connect the BART System to the Oakland International Airport.  Also, population is not constant in the Bay Area, but is growing.  As public transportation is also a function of the economy, it is simply too soon to state exactly what the peak ridership will be or when the peak will occur.  Given that the system remains constant as well as population and economic conditions, it is probable that the system will reach peak ridership within the next 10 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">By: Mark Powers

==Introduction to Wired Telephones==
The telephone was the first electrical instrument to transmit speech via wire.  The early technology of the telephone is derived from the telegraph.  Both devices use electrical pulses to transmit a signal across a wire.  While Alexander Graham Bell is credited with the invention of the telephone in 1876, the matter is still debated.  The telephone is superior to the telegraph in multiple ways.  Firstly, the telegraph could only send the sounds of a dot and a dash while the telephone was capable of transmitting speech.  Second, a telegraph was only capable of transmitting one signal at a time across a single wire, while the telephone can utilize the same wire to send multiple signals.  Use of the telephone quickly became widespread across the US and the world.

==The 1870's and the Race to Invent the Telephone==
Use of the telegraph had become widespread and was the only communication mode of the time that could send a message across long distances in a short time.  The capabilities of the telegraph was limited by its technologies, and multiple inventors sought to improve upon it.  One such idea was to develop a method of transmitting speech with the use of electricity.  While many are men are credited with trying to invent the telephone, the final race came down to Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Grey.  It is said that both men went to the patent office on the same day, but that Bell had beaten Grey there by an hour, and was awarded the patent.&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;  Grey attempted to sue Bell for the patent, but ultimately lost.

==The Birth and Growth of the Telephone==
Bell had teamed up with a young electrician named Thomas Watson.  Initially they were working on an improved telegraph that would be capable of sending multiple signals across the same wire.  Working with Watson, they were able to determine how different tones would result in varying electrical pulses.  The first telephone message was then made on March 10, 1876 by Bell to Watson in the other room when he famously said, &quot;Come here Mr. Watson, I want to see you.&quot;  The Bell Telephone Company was founded in July 1877 and by the end of that year there were 3000 telephones in service, and 10,000 by the middle of the next year.  The first telephone lines were constructed in Boston and were made of iron and steel.  Not long after iron and steel was replaced by copper wiring.  Phone services continued to expand, and the first switchboard was constructed in 1878 and located in New Haven Connecticut.  Up to this point, all phones operated on one-wire circuits, and the sound quality was poor.  To improve upon this, Bell invented a new two-wire circuit in 1881, which was also encased in lead to further cut down on noise.  Also in that year, the first long distance service was opened up for calls between Boston and Salem.

The Next giant leap forward for the telephone came in 1891 in Kansas City, Missouri.  An Undertaker named Almon Strowger grew irritated by constantly waiting on operators, and also feared that some operators were purposely routing his customers calls to his competitors.  To get around this situation, Strowger invented the first automatic switching telephone.  This was the first model that modern phones were based on in that it was capable of dialing its party directly without the need of an operator.  

==Expansion==
In 1894 the Bell patents finally expired.  This allowed other companies to jump into the fray.  Independent phone companies began to appear all over the country.  A lot of the areas where the independent companies came about were smaller and rural areas that didn't appeal to Bell.  Bell continued to expand rapidly over the early 1900s and by 1915 completed its first coast to coast call from New York to San Francisco.  Expansion continued to grow exponentially until the Great Depression hit in the 1930s.  For the first time ever, phone companies saw a decline in customer base.  Production picked up right where it left off after the depression had passed, and the telephone was on the verge of a major boon.  The end of the 1930s also so the formation of the Federal Commerce Commission.  To this day the FCC is still the regulatory agency that oversees telephone companies.

==The War and the Explosion of the Telephone==
While telephone service was already expanding rapidly all over the country under its own device, World War II proved to be the catalyst.  During the war the demand for service was greater than the companies, who were putting the majority of their efforts in to the war, could keep up with.  One innovation that came about during the war was the coaxial cable which could accommodate 600 phone calls at once.  By the end of the 1940s the dismantling of Bell Telephone had begun under the new antitrust laws.  The suit was finally settled in 1956, and Bell was left intact.  The 1950s and 60's was a time of innovation and style for the telephone.  In 1963 the touch tone phone was invented.  The same combination of overtones and undertones used on these phones is still used on all modern phones.  The 60's also brought unrest, as union strikes brought a halt to service for a time in New York.

==The Demise of Bell and Expansion Begins to Slow==
By the 1970s there were over 100 million phones in service.  In 1970 the FCC ruled that independent companies, called common carriers, could begin to service businesses.  Then in 1974 the US government once again attempted to dismantle Bell Systems.  The trial was delayed until 1979 and finally ended in 1983, but this time it succeeded and Bell Systems was torn apart.
The late 80's and 90's saw landline telephones giving way to newer technologies like cell phones, cable, and the internet.  There was less and less demand for landlines.

==Growth Model of the Telephone System in US==
For this model data was extracted on the miles of telephone wire in the US from the United States Census Bureau records.
[[File:Miles of telephone wire in the US.jpg|600px|center|Figure 1 - Telephone Wire in the US and developed S-curve]]

[[File:Coef.jpg|200px|center|Coefficients used in developing the S-curve]]

==Analysis and Conclusion==
As one might expect, it would seem that landlines are peaked in the US.  The developed S-curve model has an upper asymptote of 1,650,000,000 miles.  The inflection came about in 1971.  As discussed earlier, the cell phone, cable television, and internet industries have replaced the landline telephone as mode of communication.  It seems conceivable that at some point in the near future telephone landlines begin being removed to make way for newer infrastructure. However, this mode will likely not ever be completely erased.  The reliability of the service is too good to not have around in some capacity in case of emergency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Democratic Quality in Stable Democracies=

by Arend Lijphart and Springer.com

==Abstract.==

The major predecessor to Ringen’s and my own efforts to measure democratic quality in terms of the purpose of democracy is Robert Dahl’s seminal book Polyarchy (1971). Measuring the quality of democracy requires two prior judgments: (1) making sure that, in terms of institutional characteristics, a country is sufficiently democratic, and that, as a minimum, it has universal suffrage, and (2) that its democracy has been uninterrupted for a minimum number of years. To an important extent, higher democratic quality can be attributed to institutional characteristics of consensus democracy, especially proportional representation.

Stein Ringen’s article is a most welcome contribution to the comparative analysis of democracy. Great strides have been made in the measurement of democracy as a decision-making system. In addition to the Polity project (now Polity IV), the annual ratings by Freedom House deserve to be mentioned. But, as Ringen correctly points out, the measurement of democratic quality in terms of the purpose of democracy has been neglected.

This neglect is surprising because the most basic definition of democracy is not only government by the people but also, as stated famously by President Abraham Lincoln, for the people—that is, in accordance with the people’s preferences and serving their interests. It is also implied in Robert A. Dahl’s eight criteria for defining and measuring democracy in his seminal book Polyarchy (1971). His first seven criteria have to do with institutional features of democracy like universal suffrage, universal eligibility for public office, free elections, and freedom of expression and association—similar to the criteria used by Polity and Freedom House. But his eighth criterion goes beyond institutional rules to the purpose of decision-making: public policies that are responsive to the voters’ preferences.

Dahl also differs from Polity and Freedom House in making more distinctions among the stable and consolidated democracies. Both Polity and Freedom House place almost all of these democracies in the same category with the highest ranking. In one respect, Dahl’s approach is similar in that he ranks a large number of countries from the highest type of democracy to the lowest type of non-democracy. But there are three contrasts. First, Dahl explicitly uses his crucial eighth criterion to rank his countries. Second, he uses a more differentiated scale with thirty-one categories. Third, and most important, at the democratic end of the scale he sees clear differences of quality among thirty-two stable democracies, ranging from high of 1 to a low of 9. In effect, this is a separate nine-point scale indicating different degrees of quality among established democratic systems. To give a few examples, as of 1969, the highest ranking is given to Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden; Canada, Japan, and New Zealand are in the middle; and Colombia and Venezuela are at the bottom.

Ringen credits me with doing the “pioneering work”—praise that I appreciate, but I think that Dahl must be regarded as the major predecessor to both of us. I should also mention that, although I did show qualitative differences among the thirty-six stable democracies in my Patterns of Democracy (1999), I did not attempt to construct an index similar to Dahl’s or Ringen’s nine-point scales. Instead, I used Dahl’s index, in addition to several other indicators of democratic quality (like women’s rights, socio-economic equality, and satisfaction with democracy) to demonstrate significant differences between majoritarian and consensus democracies. If I prepare an updated edition of Patterns of Democracy, I cannot use Dahl’s index any longer because by now it is more than 40 years old. Fortunately, Ringen’s index will be an excellent up-to-date replacement.

I would like to add two points to Ringen’s argument. First, it is significant that all of the countries ranked by Ringen according to their degree of democratic quality are stable democracies. This choice, I believe, is not an arbitrary one. Measuring the quality of democracy is the third step in a three-step judgment. We have to begin by establishing (1) that the countries we are interested in are sufficiently democratic in terms of regime and institutional characteristics to justify being called democracies, and (2) that their democracy is firmly established. For the latter requirement, I used a nineteen-year criterion in Patterns of Democracy, that is, uninterrupted democracy for at least 19 years. (My initial rule was based on 20 years—a preferable round number—but I did not want to exclude India, the world’s largest democracy.) Shorter or longer periods can also be defended, although, in my opinion, anything shorter than 15 years is questionable. As of 2010, all of the countries ranked by Ringen, except Mexico, satisfy the twenty-year criterion.

For the first step of judging the degree of institutional democracy, I am at least partly sympathetic to the view of Polity that democracy is a matter of degree and that there is a continuous scale from the worst autocracy at one end to the best democracy at the other. I also strongly believe, however, that we need to establish a threshold below which a country cannot be regarded as democratic. For instance, an essential condition for democracy—a necessary, although obviously not sufficient condition—is universal suffrage. This basic fact is often disregarded, for instance, when in his 1993 inaugural address, President Bill Clinton called the United States “the world’s oldest democracy,” although universal suffrage was not firmly established until the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Scholars often commit the same error. I must confess to have been rather lenient, and perhaps too lenient, in this respect when I treated Switzerland, Australia, and the United States as stable democracies from 1945 on, although women in pre-1971 Switzerland, Aboriginees in pre-1962 Australia, and many blacks in pre-1965 America did not have the right to vote.

I am not sure where exactly the minimum threshold for institutional democracy should be drawn. My main argument is that there must be such a minimum, below which a country does not qualify as a democracy, and that it does not make sense to discuss the quality of democracy in countries whose institutions and rules are not sufficiently democratic.

My second point, much more briefly, is that institutional democracy is not only a prerequisite for judging democratic quality, but that institutions and quality are related to each other. Majoritarian and consensus democracy, both defined in institutional terms, exhibit different degrees of democratic quality. The most important institution of consensus democracy responsible for delivering this higher democratic quality for the people—in particular, better women’s representation in government and higher voter turnout in elections—is proportional representation (PR). Significantly, the five countries in the top three of Ringen’s nine categories of relative democratic quality—the Netherlands, New Zealand, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden—all have PR elections. PR is therefore both a strong influence for democratic quality and can itself be regarded as qualitatively superior to majoritarian elections.

=Democracy: universality and diversity=

by David Beetham*

Ethics &amp; Global Politics, Vol. 2, No. 4, 2009, pp. 281�296. DOI: 10.3402/egp.v2i4.2111

==Abstract==

The argument of this paper is that the justification of democracy’s core principles of popular
control over government in conditions of political equality, and the defense of them against
paternalist alternatives, requires appeal to basic features of political decision-making and of human
nature, respectively*its capacities and limitations*which are universal in their scope, and do not
stop at borders. It follows that if a democratic form of government is appropriate anywhere, it must
be so everywhere, though differences of social structure and historical tradition may make it more
difficult to establish and sustain in practice in some countries than in others. However, these
common features do not entail uniformity. The fundamental freedoms necessary to popular selfgovernment
in any form encourage diversity, and allow it to find full expression in the public
sphere. Yet, there is a limit to the movements and beliefs that are compatible with democracy, and
that comes when they reject one or other of its core principles. At the same time, some of
democracy’s characteristic elements*freedoms of expression and association, electoral competition
for office, majoritarian procedures*can serve to exacerbate societal conflict, especially though
not only in newly democratizing countries. In such circumstances only the establishment of
a process of inclusive dialogue, involving respect for difference and an understanding of
the requirements of political equality, can serve to resolve such conflicts. In other words, a
commitment to democracy’s core principles is needed to moderate the effects of some of its own
typical procedures.

In an article entitled ‘Democracy as a Universal Value,’ Amartya Sen put forward two
different arguments as to why democracy might be regarded as a universal value.1
First, because, as a matter of fact, it is becoming accepted across the world as the
most legitimate form of government. Secondly, because there are good reasons for
people anywhere to see democracy as valuable, on intrinsic, instrumental, and
constructive grounds. In the first part of this paper I make a claim for the universality
of democracy on different, and in my view even stronger, grounds: namely, the
justification for its core principles and defense of them against alternatives cannot
stop at the borders of a country or group of countries, since the considerations from
epistemology and a shared human nature underpinning that justification carry
universal applicability. In the second part of the paper I show how this universality
can be consistent with diversity*of beliefs, values, and ways of living*and within
what limits. In the third part I will argue that democracy as a form of practice is best
equipped to managing the difficulties inherent in diversity, but only when it is true to
its core principles.

I take the core principles of democracy to be twofold. First is the popular control of
government, either directly, in self-governing communes, or indirectly, through the
right to choose the government and subject it to continuing influence, accountability
and oversight, both individually and in association with other citizens. Second is
the principle of political equality*that all adult members of the political community
should have an equal right to have their voices heard, and be given equal
consideration in the formulation of public policy. These two principles, of popular
control and political equality, are not self-evident; and they have to be continually
struggled for and defended, even in countries which may claim to be formally
‘democratic.’

The chief alternative to these principles that has historically claimed legitimacy,
and in many places continues to do so implicitly or explicitly, is some variety of
paternalism: the doctrine that a special group is entitled to decide matters of the
public interest on behalf of others by virtue of some superior knowledge, wisdom or
capacity that they possess, which qualifies them uniquely for public office, and gives
them a privileged insight into what is good for everyone else. It is in contesting this
doctrine in its various manifestations that principled democrats are forced to appeal
to universal considerations which cannot stop at borders, and necessarily go beyond
‘the way we do things here.’

Paternalism comes in two main forms. One is a monolithic, closed and anti-liberal
form, which holds that what constitutes the public good, or the good for society, is a
matter of knowledge, and that this knowledge is only available to those who have been
inducted into its doctrines. The paradigmatic form of this theory is to be found in
Plato’s justification for the rule of ‘philosopher kings’ in The Republic. According to
his argument, knowledge of ‘the good’ was a province of special expertise, which
required an extensive program of philosophical training. Just as you would look to the
profession of medicine to tell you what were the conditions for a healthy body, so you
would look to the profession of philosophy to tell you what were the conditions for a
healthy society, which only those inducted into the profession were qualified to
understand. It followed that philosophers were the only people who could be
entrusted with government, since their special knowledge equipped them to make
the right decisions for the good of society, and the rest should defer to them
accordingly.2

Since Plato’s time there have been many forms in which this claim to exclusive
knowledge has been couched, and some of them persist to this day: knowledge of
sacred texts or divine revelation, as in a theocracy; knowledge of society’s place in the
grand sweep of history, as in a Marxist partocracy; knowledge of some branch of
science, as in a technocracy. Common to them all is the claim that there is a right
answer to questions about the public good, known only to an exclusive circle of the
initiated, by virtue of which they can rightly claim obedience from everyone else.

If these examples seem far-fetched, it is worth remembering the proposals of
St. Simon early in the nineteenth century. Heralding the advent of the ‘industrial
age,’ he concluded that the maximization of production (or GDP as we would now
call it) was the self-evidently overriding goal for society; so all political questions
could be reduced to administrative ones, and safely entrusted to committees of
business people and technocrats to decide.3 Elements of that idea can be found even
in otherwise democratic polities today.

This contention that decisions about the public good are a matter of knowledge,
and amenable to a ‘correct’ answer, can readily be shown to be false, on basic
epistemological grounds. There is simply no single ‘good’ which can be shown to be
the supreme end of public policy, unless this is couched in such vague and general
terms (such as ‘the welfare of the people’) as to be either meaningless or open to
multiple interpretations. Political decision-making is about hard choices between
competing goods, or values or priorities, about which there can in principle be no
clearly right and wrong answers.4 Even supposing we were to agree on some goal
such as St. Simon’s ‘maximisation of production’ (unlikely with climate change in
process), there would still be difficult choices to be made about the means (market
vs. state, or some combination of the two), the priorities (basic vs. discretionary
goods and services), the relative distribution of costs and benefits, and so forth,
which could never be decided by reference to any settled body of knowledge.

Or we could take something which most people would agree on*the supreme
value of human life. What does this value entail when it comes to practical issues of
policy and legislation?

. That we should impose capital punishment for murder, or nor?

. That we should allow abortion or euthanasia, or not?

. That we should prioritize prevention over care when it comes to health budgets, or
not?

. That we should make physical security the overriding consideration in transport
policy, or not?

. That we should ban the sale of firearms or not?

. That we should double our overseas aid budgets, or not?

These are all matters of judgment, about which there can be no right and wrong
answers deducible from some body of expert knowledge. Of course, knowledge and
expertise have a vital contribution to make to the debates about such issues, but they
can never be sufficient to resolve them conclusively. It is an irreducible feature of the
political condition that legislators and policy makers confront choices between
competing values and priorities, without any way of showing that one solution is
incontestably ‘correct’ or ‘in the public interest.’ Even in the area of public policy
where modern governments typically claim exclusive knowledge*the security and
intelligence fields*this does not lead to any self-evident single outcome in terms of
policy, though it often produces the typical paternalist refrain of ‘trust us, because we
know best.’

If this argument against what I have called a monolithic or anti-liberal version of
paternalism*which must reject all views other than its own as simply wrong and
stemming from ignorance*seems self-evident, then we should turn to consider a
more liberal version of paternalism, which has been much more common in recent
centuries. This accepts that issues of public policy are matters of judgment, not of
knowledge alone, and that therefore divergent views about what constitutes the public
interest are legitimate. However, it holds that only some people are qualified to make
these judgments, whether through superiority of birth (aristocracy, patriarchy, and
ethnarchy), of age (gerontocracy), of education (rule of the certificated), or some
other such quality. In the modern period, arguments of this kind have led to all
manner of exclusions from the suffrage, on grounds of age, race, gender, education, or
whatever. They have also, as Bernard Manin has shown, become embedded in the
theory of representation itself, and continued even when the suffrage became widely
extended.

Manin argues that the theory of representative government has from the outset
contained a strong aristocratic component, in the principle that the representative is
not bound prospectively by his (or later her) constituents, though the right of
constituents to pass judgment on their representative retrospectively constitutes its
democratic component. Moreover, this decisional autonomy has repeatedly been
justified on the grounds of the superior qualities of the representatives, to whom
electors rightly defer*a view which Manin himself endorses when he calls it an
‘aristocratic’ component, and the system ‘representative government’ rather than
‘representative democracy.’5

So, for example, in the eighteenth century, James Madison wrote that, by
delegating government to a small number of citizens ‘whose wisdom may best
discern the true interest of their country. . .the public voice, pronounced by the
representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if
pronounced by the people themselves.’6 In the nineteenth century, John Stuart Mill,
rejecting the idea of electors binding their representative in advance, wrote that
‘individuals and peoples who are acutely sensible of the value of superior wisdom. . .
will be far too desirous to secure it than to impose their own opinion as a law upon
persons whom they look up to as wiser than themselves.’7 And in the twentieth
century, Joseph Schumpeter contended that ‘the typical citizen drops down to a
lower level of performance as soon as he enters the political field,’ and that voters
‘must therefore understand that, once they have elected an individual, political action
is his business and not theirs.’8 For all such writers, the idea of referendums and
other forms of direct democracy would be anathema, not on grounds of practicality
or continuity of policy, but because ordinary citizens are not competent enough and
should defer to those who are.

Whatever form these different varieties of what I call ‘liberal paternalism’ may take
(though I acknowledge that not all of them have been liberal in practice), there are
two basic objections that principled democrats have to make against them, both
grounded in general characteristics of human nature, its capacities and limitations.

==Human capacities==

If a basic principle of democracy is that of political equality, then this can only be
defended on the grounds that the capacity to determine what is good for one’s life,
and to make reflective choices between goods where they conflict, is a generalized
capacity which everyone is capable of exercising. Certainly this capacity of ‘reflective
judgment’ as we might call it, is one that requires developing, and that is the reason
why we do not allow children to enter into binding contracts, to sit on juries, to vote
or stand for public office, until they have reached a certain age*by which time they
have gained sufficient experience of making such judgments in lesser matters that
they can be entrusted with larger ones, and enough experience of the world to
appreciate what the typical consequences of different choices or different courses of
action might be.

Now it may be objected that public decisions are different from private or personal
ones, in that they require giving attention to the interests of a range of others, rather
than simply one’s own. However, this can be shown to be characteristic of all
judgments made in a collective context, whether that be the family, the school group,
the workplace or any other associational context, and is not unique to political
decision-making. Indeed, one of the answers that Plato allowed his democratic
opponents to make against his own version of paternalism was that the capacity of
moral judgment*to distinguish what was good and bad for people generally, not just
for oneself*formed an essential part of civic virtue, and that the good society
required this capacity of all its members, not just a special few.9 It was by virtue of
such a capacity that the voice of the ploughman or carpenter was as entitled to be
heard in the deliberations of the assembly as that of the wealthy or more educated.
The same argument could of course have been made against the well-known
exclusions that Athenian democracy made in practice from the enjoyment of full
citizenship. Yet it follows that the burden of proof is on the defenders of paternalism
in any form to show what is the special or exclusive capacity which they possess,
which justifies their decisional prerogative in what are essentially matters of
normative judgment.

Now, to be sure, making such judgments in potentially complex political matters
requires two conditions: access to relevant information, and time to consider it and
assess the different arguments through discussion and debate. In the contemporary
world most of the information relevant to political issues is freely available, if there
is no censorship, though not everyone has the same incentive to devote time to
accessing it. It is the time constraint that is the crucial one. And this is the only
reason consistent with democratic principle why some people should be allowed to
concentrate on public decision-making and decide on behalf of the rest; but they do
so only as representative citizens, not by virtue of some special (and unspecifiable)
capacities which others do not possess. All the evidence shows that where the same
conditions of information and time are available to ordinary citizens*as in jury
service, citizens’ juries, deliberative polls, co-governance arrangements, and such
like*they are just as capable as elected politicians of arriving at considered
judgments about the public interest.10 No doubt this capability could be enhanced
by imaginative social and political education, but the potential exists in everyone.

Now the point to make here (and I will return to it) is that this argument against
paternalism and in defense of political equality does not stop at borders, or apply
only to a section of humanity, but is universal in its reach. If it is valid for my country
(wherever ‘my’ is), then it must be so everywhere. This much is also clearly
recognized in Articles 19�21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
specify for everyone the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, to peaceful
assembly and association, and to take part in the government of their country.11 The
claim that these rights are universal presupposes that all adults, at least, wherever
they may live, possess the capacity to make use of them, and in a manner that is
socially as well as individually advantageous, even if this may not actually be
recognized in the political arrangements of a given country.

==Human limitations==

If one feature of human nature that underpins the democratic case against
paternalism lies in the capacities we all share, another lies in the limitations that
are exposed when people come to exercise governmental power over others. The
most significant of these is what we might call limited benevolence or altruism. An
extreme version of this is to be found in the classical utilitarians’ assumption of
universal self-interest*that we all tend to prefer our own interest over others when
they diverge*which formed the basis of the utilitarian justification for representative
democracy.

Even supposing per impossibile, the argument went, that some all wise or all
knowing ruler or ruling group could know what was in the people’s interest better
than they themselves, what possible incentive would they have to promote it? None at
all, they argued. ‘What is the proper end of government?’ asked Jeremy Bentham.
‘The greatest happiness of the greatest number.’ ‘What is the actual end of
government?’ ‘The greatest happiness of those in whom the powers of government
are invested.’12 James Mill put it even stronger. Why do we need government in the
first place, he asked. Because of that principle of human nature by which each of us
requires protection against the self-interest of others. Does this principle stop short at
members of a government? By no means. ‘We have seen that the very principle of
human nature upon which the necessity of government is founded leads on, by
infallible sequence, where power over a community is attained, and nothing checks,
not only to that degree of plunder which leaves its members the bare means of
subsistence, but to that degree of cruelty which is necessary to keep in existence the
most intense terror.’13

To this problem the utilitarians offered their standard solution of carrots and
sticks, which would artificially align the interest of the governing in staying in power
with the interests of the community at large. Only the realistic sanction of public
exposure and removal from office and its benefits would bring those in government
to serve a public interest; and this sanction had to be placed in the hands of the
community itself through the suffrage, since it was only its members themselves who
had any settled will to protect their own interests. Here, Bentham took the argument
a step further than Mill, and argued that women had to be given the vote, since they
had interests distinct from men, and could not rely on their husbands, fathers or
brothers to protect these.14

In its extreme utilitarian version this assumption of universal self-interest seems
unduly narrow, and demonstrably false, unless we define ‘self-interest’ in a quite
circular way. It is certainly at odds with the more expansive view of human capacities
already discussed, which allows the possibility of people acknowledging the need to
recognize and compromise with the views and interests of others when collective
decisions have to be made. However, if we recast the utilitarian assumption as a
counsel of prudence in the face of the powerful, it has greater validity. Just as the fact
that we lock our bicycles up when we leave them in public does not mean, pace
Hobbes, that we are accusing everyone of being a cycle thief, so the fact that we need
strong public checks against the abuse of power does not mean that we suspect all
heads of government of being a potential Amin or Bocassa. The Benthamite
injunction to ‘minimise confidence’ should be read as a counsel of prudence in the
face of a known human limitation. But I should prefer to term this ‘limited altruism
or benevolence’ rather than ‘universal self-interest.’ Regrettably there are enough
examples of kleptocracy in the contemporary world, not to mention lesser
corruptions, to show how valid this assumption is.

A further human limitation which societies need protection against in their rulers
is that of human fallibility. Even where those come to power who genuinely seek the
public interest, rather than a narrow personal one, they are perfectly capable of
making serious errors of judgment. These can become magnified or made chronic by
the tendency to ‘group think’ among governing circles and advisors; by the need to
present policy in the best possible light and cover up inconvenient facts; by the
collective cocooning of the powerful from the daily lives and experiences of ordinary
people; above all, by the natural human resistance to admitting one’s mistakes. It is as
much against these characteristics as that of self-interest that polities need maximum
openness to alternative points of view, independent sources of public information,
including from those most affected by questionable policies, above all mechanisms
for exposing and sanctioning those responsible for serious errors of judgment. In
effect this forms the core of Amartya Sen’s argument that it is impossible to have
large-scale famines in the open political system of a democracy, where problems
become known at an early stage, and policies which might lead to disaster are subject
to public inspection and criticism before they can become chronic.15

Now if we put all the considerations mentioned above together, it is evident that
we have a conclusive argument against paternalist government in any of its forms, to
defend which all of the following have to be shown to be true: that there is some
special knowledge or wisdom about the public good available only to a chosen few, by
virtue of some distinguishing and relevant quality they possess; that these few can be
trusted to act in the public interest once they have discerned it; that they either do
not suffer from normal human fallibility, or are capable of self-correction once this
occurs. Well, these are very strenuous, not to say heroic, assumptions, and will not
stand up to serious examination.

By the same token, these considerations also make a conclusive set of arguments
for democratic principles and practices: on protective grounds, to protect societies
against the common human failings which can prove so damaging in those who
exercise political power over others; on participatory grounds, given the common
capacities for reflective judgment about their own and the wider social good which all
share. Often the protective and participatory arguments are counterposed as the
basis for two quite separate ‘models’ of democracy16; but they should be seen as
complementary, since both are necessary to the defense of the twin democratic
principles of popular control and political equality.

The crucial point to make, in conclusion, is that all these arguments*from the
nature of political judgment and decision-making, from common human capacities
and limitations*do not stop at borders, but are universal in their reach. The terms in
which we are required to defend democracy against paternalist encroachments at
home necessarily require that we also support it as appropriate abroad, though the
precise form of that support must be a matter of context and circumstance. Here it
should be insisted at once that a universalist justification for democracy does not give
license to unilateral state interventions in other societies in the name of ‘bringing
democracy’ or ‘regime change,’ least of all by force.17

There have been well-known attempts to avoid the universalist conclusion I have
been arguing for. John Stuart Mill, for example, roundly condemned his utilitarian
predecessors for lacking a sense of history, and for ‘claiming representative
democracy for England and France by arguments which would equally have proved
it the only fit form of government for Bedouins or Malays.’ He argued instead that
forms of government had to be adapted to the stage of civilization reached by a
people; and that a society not yet ready for self-rule should be entrusted to a
paternalist ‘government of leading strings,’ as he called it, until such time as they
were ready.18

This is not an argument that carries conviction in an anti-imperialist age. No more
convincing is its current counterpart, to the effect that democracy is a Western idea
that is inappropriate for some cultures in the contemporary world, whether these be
Asian, Islamic, Confucian, or whatever. Defenders of this position need to show what
it is about these cultures that renders their populations incapable of exercising
reflective judgment on matters of personal and public interest, and their leaders
immune from the common failings outlined above. If the answer is simply that a
paternalist form of government is what ‘the people’ have themselves chosen, then we
can reasonably ask for evidence about how, when and by whom this choice has been
made. In practice, of course, democracy has proved to be perfectly viable in countries
with each of the cultures that has been claimed as fundamentally antithetical to it.
And their populations have shown as much determination as those in the West in
their struggle to achieve it.

==DEMOCRACY AND DIVERSITY==

If the characteristics which justify treating the basic democratic principles as
universally applicable are common to human beings everywhere, what room does
this allow for diversity*of cultures, values, identities, beliefs or ways of living? Does
it entail uniformity? By no means. This is because the freedoms necessary to a selforganizing
society, and without which no popular control of government is possible,
themselves encourage diversity, as well as reflecting in the public sphere the diversity
that already exists within a society. Societies today are everywhere characterized by
pluralisms of language, religion, culture, ethnicity, and so on, which will find
distinctive expression in a freely organized public sphere.

Such diversities also find expression in the differences between countries in the
way in which their democracies come to be organized and institutionalized. The
longer established democracies show wide variations between them*as to presidential
or parliamentary systems, federal or unitary structures, electoral systems,
use of referendums, and so forth*all reflecting the different traditions and societal
dynamics out of which their democracies evolved. Some recently established
democracies have also shown the way in innovations appropriate to the conditions
of less economically developed societies. As the Indian academic Peter de Souza has
expressed it, ‘the caravan of democracy changes shape as it travels.’19 However, there
is a limit to the differences that can count as ‘democratic,’ and that is their
consistency with the basic democratic principles already outlined. Just as not
everything a recognized democracy does counts as democratic, so the possession of
one or two institutional features, such as elections or a parliament, does not of itself
qualify a country as a ‘democracy.’ The point is how far these institutions help to
realize the principles of popular control and political equality. If they do not, then
labels such as ‘fac¸ade democracy’ or ‘elections without democracy’ may be justified.

These principles also provide the touchstone for determining what types of belief
are incompatible with democracy, and at what point they become so. Labelling
Confucianism or Islam tout court as incompatible with democracy is now as
discredited as Catholicism was earlier pronounced hostile to, if not incompatible
with, democracy in comparison with Protestantism.20 Yet contemporary politicized
versions of Islam which seek to establish a new caliphate following sharia law embody
two forms of paternalism which are clearly antithetical to democracy. In the first
place the theocratic claim that all valid law is of divine or prophetic origin, and that
its articulation and interpretation should be in the hands of religious authorities
rather than elected representatives of the people, or only endorsed after the event by
the latter, directly contradicts the principle of popular control of government. And
the patriarchal demand for the subordination of women and their disempowerment
in the public sphere directly contradicts the principle of political equality.

What democrats outside a country can and should do in a situation where Islamist
movements with these agendas gain influence or become institutionalized in power,
as in Iran, is limited. Certainly their ideational basis should be challenged, rather
than deferred to out of some post-modern relativism or ‘respect for other cultures.’
Yet the fate of democracy in any country has ultimately to rest in the hands of its own
people and their own struggles, however oppressive the conditions under which these
take place. These struggles can certainly be supported from outside, though
preferably only at the level of civil society to civil society support, not through state
agencies, which are invariably compromised by state power interests.
More complex to determine are challenges arising within democratic polities to the
principles of democracy on which they are based. How should they be responded to?

Two examples can be taken to illustrate this complexity. First is from Turkey, where
the currently ruling Welfare Party has several times been challenged in Turkey’s
constitutional court for advocating Islamic policies which purportedly run counter to
Turkey’s secular constitution. The most recent attempt to have the party banned by
the court, in 2008, failed by only a single vote. However, an earlier indictment, in
1998, to the effect that some of the party’s leading members were on record as having
advocated the introduction of sharia law for Turkey’s Muslim majority, led to the
party being dissolved by the court, and the members responsible excluded from
parliament.

What is interesting about this case, and gives it a wider significance, is that the
party appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the ground that the
decision violated its members’ rights to free expression and association. Since these
rights under the European Convention may only be limited by such restrictions as are
‘prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society,’ the judges who heard the
case were required to determine what a ‘democratic society’ required in such a
situation. Some of them argued that a party which advocated the subordination of
human rights and freedoms to the ‘static rules imposed by a religion’ could not claim
the protection of these same freedoms under the European Convention. Moreover,
‘there can be no democracy,’ they concluded, ‘where the people of a state, even by a
majority decision, waive their legislative and judicial powers in favor of an entity
which is not responsible to the people it governs.’ In other words, the principle of
popular control had to be curtailed in the present in order to protect it for the future.

The judges on the other side held that democracy required that diverse programs
for government should be proposed and debated, even if they called into question
certain aspects of the way the state was currently organized. Democracy was
meaningless, they concluded, without the ‘free expression of electoral opinion,’ and
this was ‘inconceivable without the participation of a plurality of political parties
representing different shades of opinion.’ When it came to a vote, the court decided
by four to three in favor of the judicial ban on the party, which was upheld. As with
any legal case, issues of fact as well as of legal interpretation were at issue. Yet it
revealed a level of principled debate about democracy which is unusual in a court of
law, and one which sharply focused the issue of how far it is appropriate for a
democracy to resort to legal exclusions on a movement or party which challenges one
of its core principles.21

A second example is one that has regrettably become common in established
democracies in Europe, where racist movements and parties openly challenge racial
equality principles and policies, and campaign to reverse anti-discrimination laws in
favor of an ‘indigenous’ white majority. Should the freedoms of expression and
association be legally denied to these movements, which reject the principle of
political equality, or should they be countered at the level of civil society opposition
and mobilization?

The issue has recently come to a head in the UK, where the British National Party
for the first time won two seats in the June elections to the European Parliament,
giving it access to public funds and facilities. Not only have its leading members
repeatedly engaged in ‘hate speech’ (for example, denying the holocaust, and
claiming that black people can never be ‘British’), but the party’s criteria for
membership and employment confine them to ‘indigenous Caucasians’ and ‘defined
ethnic groups emanating from that race.’ At the same time its stated mission is to
represent the interests ‘of the indigenous Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Norse folk
communities of Britain and those we regard as closely related and ethnically
assimilated.’ The UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission is now threatening
to take the party to court for breach of the Race Relations Act, with the possibility
that the party might lose its registration status if it does not change its policies and
practices.

Some commentators argue that it is high time the BNP’s policies and practices
were subject to a legal challenge, which should have been made long ago before the
party achieved its electoral successes. Others argue instead that a court case will only
give more free publicity to the party, and reinforce its ‘victim’ status as representative
of a white population which feels itself victimized by immigration policies endorsed
by ‘out of touch’ politicians. The mainstream parties, on this view, should tackle the
economic and social deprivations of the communities which vote for the BNP, rather
than use the law to stifle democratic dissent and remove a successful competitor from
the electoral scene.22

There is no generally ‘correct’ solution to these dilemmas; much will depend on
the particular context of each case. What is important to recognize is that, while
democracy encourages diversity of all kinds, there is a clear limit to the diversity that
is consistent with it; and that comes at the point where social or political beliefs and
practices contradict its core principles of popular control and political equality, and
the universalist assumptions on which these are based.

==DEMOCRACY AND THE MANAGEMENT OF DIVERSITY==

If one issue that democracy’s encouragement of diversity poses is how to respond to
social beliefs and political movements which reject its core principles, a second is how
to deal with the tensions and conflicts that can arise when different social groups
come into conflict with one another, or engage in competition for limited
opportunities and resources. In theory, the democratic method of dialogue,
discussion and compromise should be well suited to resolving such conflicts, and
in many contexts has proved the only way of doing so. However, there are also a
number of features of democracy which can militate against this process, and serve to
exacerbate conflict, especially in newly democratizing countries where the potential
bases of conflict have been suppressed under a previous authoritarian regime.23

First, the democratic principle of popular control or rule of the people necessarily
problematizes who precisely constitute ‘the people’ who are to be the subjects of that
rule. It is no accident that democracy and nationalism developed together in the
aftermath of the French Revolution, since they share a common ideational root; the
idea of popular self-government readily translates into hostility to rule by those who
are not recognizably ‘of the people.’ And since the established state boundaries rarely
coincide neatly with a single identifiable people, sharing features that make for a
sense of common identity, the process of democratization is vulnerable to exclusivist
pressure on the part of those who see themselves as a ‘core’ national group, and
corresponding movements to secede or to join a neighboring state on the part of
those who fear exclusion.24

Increasing the potential for such a development are other characteristic features of
democracy. There are the freedoms of association and expression, which allow
grievances to be aired and conflicts to emerge which may have been suppressed
under an authoritarian regime. Above all there is the competition for power through
the electoral process, in which elites may seek a ready basis of voter support in ethnic
identities, when other sources of political mobilization barely exist in weakly
developed civil societies. So nascent political parties become organized along the
fault lines of major ethnic divisions, and the electoral contest becomes less a
disagreement about policy or program than an affirmation of collective identity.

Such developments become particularly damaging because of the tendency to
fetishize the idea of majoritarianism, and to equate popular rule with rule of the
majority. Majority rule is not a basic democratic principle, as many people assume; it
is a procedural device for settling disagreement when other methods have been
exhausted. Of course, majority decision must be more democratic than allowing
minorities to decide; but insofar as it leaves a minority impotent, without any
influence on a decisional outcome or any share in power, it should be regarded more
as a rough and ready device for resolving disagreement than as the acme of
democratic perfection. The basic principle from which the majoritarian procedure of
counting heads derives its legitimacy is that of political equality (‘everyone to count
for one and none for more than one’); but it becomes undemocratic as soon as it
threatens that same principle of political equality.

There are two familiar ways in which this may happen. One is when a majority
colludes in the denial of a basic right to a section of the population in a way that
prevents them exercising their citizenship on equality with others. These are the all
too familiar discriminations and oppressions on grounds of race, religion, language,
ethnicity, and so on. Since the principle of political equality entails the enjoyment of
fundamental rights and freedoms by all, it cannot be undemocratic to give these
rights special legal or constitutional protection, enforceable by the courts, in a way
that sets them beyond the reach of any particular majority decision. In this context to
complain about the power of unelected judges is to misunderstand what democratic
principle requires. As Ronald Dworkin put it, in advocating a bill of rights for the
UK:

True democracy is not just statistical democracy, in which anything a majority or
plurality wants is legitimate for that reason, but communal democracy, in which
majority decision is legitimate only if it is a majority within a community of equals.
That means not only that everyone must be allowed to participate in politics as an
equal, through the vote and through freedom of speech and protest, but that
political decisions must treat everyone with equal concern and respect, that each
individual person must be guaranteed fundamental civil and political rights no
combination of other citizens can take away, no matter how numerous they are or
how much they despise his or her race or morals or way of life. That view of what
democracy means is at the heart of all the charters of human rights.25

In a robust defense of majority decision-making against judicially enforced rights,
Jeremy Waldron has argued that in a Rousseauian democracy, where voters attend to
a wider public interest than simply their own (as in the alternative Benthamite
conception), there should be no reason to prefer any judicial decision over a popular
majority one.26 While I agree with Waldron that people are capable of taking a
Rousseauian standpoint*indeed it forms part of my defense of democracy against
paternalism*this does not mean that they always will. It is one thing to expect
people in principle to support a bill of fundamental rights in a constitutional
referendum; another to assume that they would always support a given right in
practice, for example in the context of some media-orchestrated demonization of a
vulnerable minority group. The same holds equally true for an elected legislature. It
is for such situations that a justiciable bill of rights acts as an essential restraint on
majority debate and decision-making, whether or not the issue actually gets to a
court to adjudicate.

Any denial of basic rights to members of a minority is intensified when, as already
suggested, the electoral contest and party system becomes aligned along the social
divisions of language, religion or ethnicity, in such a way that a minority becomes
permanently excluded from any share in government. A moment’s reflection will
show that the only ground on which a minority could reasonably agree to be bound
by a majority would be according to the principle of reciprocity: we agree to abide by
your decisions, policies, period in office or whatever, provided that you will do the
same for us when we have won a majority. But what if they can never win a majority?

The principle of reciprocity can only apply where the issues at stake in the political
contest are matters of opinion, policy or political competence, which are changeable
according to changing circumstances, rather than issues of identity, which are not, or
not to the same extent. When these latter issues are involved, the principle of
reciprocity cannot work, and the majoritarian procedure loses its legitimacy. In these
circumstances what we have is not rule of the whole people, turn and turn about, but
the rule of one section of the people over another. In conclusion, the basic principle is
that of political equality, and the majoritarian procedure is only valid in so far as it
embodies and does not infringe this principle.

If, then, democratic procedures can serve to exacerbate major social divisions,
especially in newly democratizing countries, what resources do democracies have to
resolve such conflicts? If democracy can be part of the problem, can it also provide a
solution? The only sure method is through an evolving and inclusive dialogue around
constitutional rules which will guarantee disempowered minorities a share in power,
if not through time, then in time. This may be through the autonomy of self-governing
regions where the minorities are territorially concentrated, as in many federal systems
(India, Nigeria, Spain, for example); through electoral rules which prevent singleparty
majorities, and facilitate changing governing coalitions, as under most systems
of proportional representation, or with special representation for minorities (the
Maoris in New Zealand, for example); through formal power-sharing executives
(Northern Ireland); and other such devices according to the circumstances. None of
the solutions may be perfect, but all are preferable to the threat of secession, civil war
or armed suppression.

In sum, democracies are only capable of resolving deep and chronic social
divisions when they remain true to their core principle of political equality, and
acknowledge that majoritarianism has to be limited where it infringes that principle;
and also where they allow room for inclusive dialogue between all conflicting parties
toward a constitutional settlement that can achieve a sufficient consensus to become
popularly accepted.

==CONCLUSION==

The argument of this paper is that the justification of democracy’s core principles of
popular control over government in conditions of political equality, and the defense
of them against paternalist alternatives, requires appeal to basic features of political
decision making and of human nature, respectively*its capacities and limitations*
which are universal in their scope, and do not stop at borders. It follows that if a
democratic form of government is appropriate anywhere, it must be so everywhere,
though differences of social structure and historical tradition may make it more
difficult to establish and sustain in practice in some countries than in others.

However, these common features do not entail uniformity, whether of constitutional
forms that democracy may take or of societal beliefs and ways of living. Indeed
the fundamental freedoms necessary to popular self-government in any form
encourage diversity, and allow it to find full expression in the public sphere. Yet
there is a limit to the movements and beliefs that are compatible with democracy, and
that comes when they reject one or other of its core principles. How democracies
should deal with such challenges, whether through civil-society mobilization, legal
prohibition or a combination of the two, must be a matter of context and
circumstance.

At the same time, some of democracy’s characteristic elements*freedoms
of expression and association, electoral competition for office, majoritarian
procedures*can serve to exacerbate societal conflict, especially though not only in
newly democratizing countries. In such circumstances only the establishment of a
process of inclusive dialogue, involving respect for difference and an understanding
of the requirements of political equality, can serve to resolve such conflicts. In other
words, a commitment to democracy’s core principles is needed to moderate the
effects of some of its own typical procedures.

Although the automobile has been in production since the early 1900s, and even early forms of hybrid vehicles around the same time, it was until recently that the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) has (re)evolved and emerged in society in a major way.  Although only comprising of a small amount of the automobiles that are driven today it has still appeared in quite a significant way since the late 1990s, especially in the United States.  A hybrid electric vehicle, as the name implies, is a hybrid of an electric vehicle and the standard internal combustion engine seen in most cars today.  Hybrids use an internal combustion engine and an electric engine that uses energy stored in a battery.  The combination of both allows the vehicle to have same power and range as other vehicles while getting better fuel economy and lowering negative emissions because the combustion engine is able to be smaller in size and magnitude.

==Life Cycle of the Hybrid Electric==

The following data was retrieved from the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA).&lt;ref name=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;  It indicates the total number of sales of hybrid vehicles in the United States.  This variable is the number of individual vehicles sold which is displayed as the total for that year.

In order to analyze the data a three parameter logistic model was used:
S(t) = K[1+exp(-b(t-to)] 
Where:	t= time (yrs)
		To = the inflection time
		K =  saturation status level
		b = coefficient
The methodology used in this report was the method of least squares to fit a curve to the data.  In this the logistic model above was used and the values for K, b, and t0 were manipulated using the solver function in excel to minimize the sum of the square roots of the data vs. the resultant.  The following tables shows the results:

|-
|t0 || 2004.9853

The data was then plotted.  The blue line represents the total number of sales of hybrid electric vehicles in the US from 1999-2011.  The red line is the predicted sales based on the logistic function that was used.  Predicted sales come from the regression model used plotted as time progresses.

===Interpretation of Results===

The values that best fit the three-parameter logistic function that was provided are as follows; K = 351788.71, b =.9339668, and t0 = 2004.98.  The K value here signifies the maximum value which is expected or a saturation level.  This value is given as the exact value that was determined using the method of least squares but realistically it is representing a number of vehicles sold. There is no such thing as 0.71% of a vehicle so this doesn’t have a realistic meaning so this number should be rounded to 352789 vehicles.  The variable t0 is the inflection time.  This is the point where the exponentially increasing growth starts to dip and although it is still rising, that growth level is now on the downfall.  The results tell that this happened at the end of 2004.  The S- curve seems to suggest that the birthing, growth, and maturity phases were all about 1/3 of the time provided, meaning 4 years at each stage; birthing from 1999–2003, growth from 2003–2007, and maturity from 2007 to 2011.  

There is, of course, disagreement within the actual data and the predicted model.  The actual data seems to have spiked up until 2007 and then declined from 2007 to 2011 instead of just leveling off as would be expected.  Realistically the economy change, demand changes, and precise predictions of where a technology will be from year to year are quite hard to accomplish through a model.  These discrepancies will be discussed in a later section.

==Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (re)Introduced to the World==

===Before Hybrid-Electric there was the idea of the electric motor===

Electric vehicles take advantage of electrical power supplied by an on-board battery.  The main advantage of this is that it doesn't rely on fossil fuels as an energy source and is considered a much cleaner form of energy, only producing a fraction of the pollutants and emissions of an internal combustion engine.  It is also considered much quieter to the alternative.    

Electric vehicles are able to use a battery in series or parallel.  Parallel increases the current while keeping the voltage the same, and series increases voltage while the current remains the same.  This allows the batteries to switch to various connections depending on speeds.  Lower voltages are preferred for lower speeds and higher voltages for higher speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;  

The electric motor first came into play in 1835 when Thomas Davenport of Vermont built the first rotary electric motor and by 1851 Charles Page built an electric locomotive. Electricity first appeared in streetcars around 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;  Many early vehicles took advantage of electric technology.  It was quiet, clean, and did not have to be cranked as with gasoline powered cars because the starter was also electric.  As faults were recognized and not able to be overcome the electric vehicle slowly gave way to gasoline powered cars and by the time of the 1924 automobile show, no electric or hybrid cars were on display.  This announced the end of the Golden Age of electric powered cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;

===Gasoline Powered Cars and the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)===

Gasoline cars in the early days were noisy, smelly dirty, sometime unreliable, and as opposed to the electric vehicle required the user to manually start the car using a crank which was quite difficult.  They did have one main advantage though, the use of petroleum based gasoline allowed the vehicle to be more powerful and go much further distance between “refilling” its source of energy.  The main goal of any form of transportation is to get someone or something from one place to another. This becomes a big problem if that has to be halted one or multiple times throughout the trip, especially for extended periods of time as with charging a battery.  Burning gasoline as an energy source and quickly being able to fill back up was a major advantage to get vehicles much further. The world is still quite reliant on gasoline and oil because of this advantage.     

===Hybrid Electric Vehicles===

The concept of a hybrid-electric vehicle has been around as long as the automobile itself.  In 1901 Ferdinand Porsche developed the Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid which was the first hybrid vehicle in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt; Henri Pieper of Germany shortly after released a hybrid with an electric motor, batteries, as well as a petroleum based engine which was able to power the battery supply and in turn help the electric motor. 

Despite early attempts to enable vehicles to run off electric power, there just wasn’t the capability to run the vehicle any amount of distance on a single charge and this quickly became a downfall.  Although early attempts to run vehicles off electric or hybrid-electric were very apparent the internal combustion engine running off gasoline soon quieted this and by WWI “These early hybrid vehicles could no longer compete with the greatly improved gasoline engines that came into use”.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;  It wasn’t until recently; starting in 1997 in Japan and 1999 in the US that hybrid technology was looked into again and became widely popular although not without its own downfalls.	

===Classifications of Hybrid===

There are two main classifications of hybrid and one that is a combination of both;

Series Hybrid: Sole propulsion is by the battery-powered motor.  The purpose of the internal combustion engine is that the power coming to the battery is generated from another energy source such as an ICE.  The engine only operates with the purpose of keeping the battery charged, and thus acts as a portable battery charger.

Parallel Hybrid:  The battery and engine are both used for transmission which means multiple sources, or just one, can be used to power the vehicle.  This indicates that the vehicle can act as an internal combustion vehicle, an electric vehicle, or a combination of both.  In this case the engine can be smaller because internal combustion and electric can work together.

Series-Parallel:  This type of engine combines the series and parallel engines described above.

===Features===

Idle Stop: Engine turns off when stopped and reengages when the brake is released.  

Regenerative braking: The braking system is able to capture energy while the vehicle is braking and store it in the batteries.  The batteries then power the electric motor.

Power assist:  An electric motor draws power from the battery supply and assists the internal combustion engine.  This enables the ICE to be smaller and use less energy.

===Issues related to the Hybrid Electric Vehicle===

Although the recent rise of hybrid-electric vehicles has been apparent, sources saying as many as 5.2 million hybrid electric vehicles have been sold in the last 15 years, it is in no way a new market.  Automobiles have been around since the early 1900s and a network of roadways, highways, and bridges has been set in place to connect the entire country.  As the automobile gained popularity this network had to increase to meet demand.  By 1921 the Federal Aid Highway Act had been set up to start a federal highway system.  The Federal Highway Act of 1956 furthered this advance, allocating $25 billion for the construction of 41,000 miles (66,000&amp;nbsp;km) of Interstate Highway over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;R9&quot; /&gt;

The main market that has been set up is for those that are both trying to be more “green” and cut down on emissions and those trying to use less fuel and thus save money.  The catch 22 is that usually these vehicles are more expensive because they have components of an internal combustion engine vehicle and an electric vehicle as well as more technological features and components to make it all run smoothly together.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was signed by George W. Bush on August 8, 2005, attempted to subsidize this additional cost and promote use of these ecofriendly vehicles by providing buyers.  This act granted $3,400 as a tax credit for the most efficient hybrid cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;R10&quot; /&gt;  This act lasted until December 31, 2010.    

===Modern Phases of Growth===

Gasoline has served as the main source of energy for the past century, but it is a fossil fuel of limited supply at the current rate of consumption it will not be around for much longer.  Keeping this in mind many scientists and engineers have looked into alternatives to the standard internal combustion engine.  The oil embargo in 1973 made this need to stray from reliance of foreign oil very apparent.   On October 16, 1973, OPEC announced a decision to raise the posted price of oil by 70%, to $5.11 a barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;R11&quot; /&gt;  Due to this oil embargo congress enacted public law 94-413,  the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;  The goal they wished to look into was improving things such as the electric motor, batteries, and other components of a hybrid electric vehicle. 

====The Birthing Phase====

It wasn’t until the late 1990s that hybrid vehicles started to come into play again initially in Japan with the release of the Toyota Prius.  A couple years later in 1999 the U.S. was introduced to the Hybrid-Electric in the form of the Honda Insight and in 2000 the Toyota Prius also came to US in the US.  

It can be seen from the raw data as well as the graph that the hybrid-electric had a slow start for the first few years before its rapid growth.  The first year only 17 vehicles were sold and the following years until 2002 only saw a maximum sale of 22,335 vehicles.  At this point in time the interest, although still small, exceeded what they could produce.  It is possible that manufacturers weren’t originally sure how well hybrid-electric vehicles would go over with the public but during the growth phase the consumer would typically have to order the vehicle months ahead of time and wait for the vehicle to be produced as opposed to the other way around as sales typically are with personal vehicles.

====The Growth Phase====

The raw data and the regression model follow very closely through the rapid growth of the hybrid-electric.  By this time the vehicles had been seen by the public and manufacturers had a better sense of the market and demand.  Both of the factors contributed to the growth of sales during this period.



As the public was able to see the benefits in gas mileage that a hybrid electric is able to achieve, popularity grew but nothing seems to have contributed more to the number of sales than the price of gasoline at this time.  Comparing hybrid sales with gas prices in the figure to the right&lt;ref name=&quot;R12&quot; /&gt;  it can be seen that as gas prices rise the desire for higher mileage in a vehicle also rises and thus more hybrids are being sold during this time.  When gas prices suddenly dropped from the peak at around $4.12 as the national average, the sales also appear to drop in the raw data.

====The Maturity Phase====

The maturity stage of HEVs is hard to define from the data at hand.  The raw data would appear to say that around 2007 the sales of hybrids actually reached its peak and already went onto the next stage past maturity which is a decline.  The regression model tends to disagree with this, appearing to say that a predicted peak (based on original growth) should have peaked by now, but not until very recently.  The leveling off in the raw data in recent years can probably be accounted for by both the rise of gas prices again and a slow recovery of the economy.  If both of these trends continue it may be expected that hybrid sales once again will increase higher than the 269,178 vehicles sold in 2011 but whether it continues to rise past its projected peak or quickly levels off is unknown.    

The results of the “maturity” of this technology can be looked at in a couple ways:

•	The actual data could have peaked and could be on the decline.  In this case there is typically another technology that is taking its place, especially with such a short life cycle.  “Hybrids are looked upon by many as a short-term solution until the range limitation and infrastructure problems of purely electric vehicles is solved”.&lt;ref name=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;  If the hybrid was only a stage between the internal combustion engine and going fully electric (or even moving on to other alternative fuel energy sources), then this could in fact be the case.

•	The other way to look at it is that there is not enough data to properly analyze sales of the HEV.  Sales in the U.S. have only been around since 1999, and didn’t really spike until around 2003/2004.  The technology is relatively young and anything could still happen.  The recent decline in the economy has resulted in minimal spending for the past 4 or 5 years which is where the data shows a drop and as the economy picks up sales of HEVs could easily pick up too.  Looking at other forms of technology and transportation there are always rise and fall points throughout but the general trend in the end tends to follow closely with an S-curve.  The regression model performed would suggest that sales of the hybrid will pick up but may reach a peak very soon.  Time will only tell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction of Shanghai Metro==
Shanghai Metro refers to the urban rail transit system of Shanghai. Shanghai is the third city in Mainland China to have passenger subway lines, following Beijing and Tianjin.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Metro&lt;/ref&gt; The Shanghai Metro system started very recently, but it has become one of the fastest developing systems of the world. As of 2012, there are 11 metro lines in operation. The total mileage by the end of 2011 reached 454.1&amp;nbsp;km (282.2 miles),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats-sh.gov.cn/sjfb/201202/239488.html, 2011 Shanghai National Economy and Social Development Statistical Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; making it the world’s longest system. The daily ridership increases rapidly too, from around 240,000 in 1995 to 2.23 million in 2007, and 5.76 million in 2011. The record high daily ridership of 7.55 million was on October 22, 2010 during the 2010 Shanghai World Exposition period. The annual ridership of 2011 exceeded 2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://sh.xinmin.cn/shizheng/2010/10/24/7360621.html, &quot;754.8万!沪地铁客流创新高 加开临时列车246列次&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Birth of Shanghai Metro==
Prior to the Shanghai Metro system, the urban public transit modes included buses, airport shuttles, ferry, and taxi. Their limitations started to appear with the city’s fast urban development, population growth, and intra-city transit demand. The city of Shanghai covers and area of 6,340.5 square kilometers (2448.1 square miles).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node23919/node24059/node24061/userobject22ai36489.html&lt;/ref&gt; The total population is more than 23 million, equaling 9,589 people per square kilometer citywide. Half of the population lives in the central districts which constitute only 10% of the total land, making the downtown highly crowded, with a population density of 16,828 people per square kilometer, which is 2.4 times of Tokyo, 3.5 times of London and 4.8 times of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node27118/node27818/u22ai68540.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The large size of the city makes intra-city travel very difficult, even without congestion. For example, a trip from one district to another district can easily take one or two hours even without traffic congestion. In comparison, a trip by train to another city nearest to Shanghai may only take 30–40 minutes. The increasing population, ownership of automobiles, and high-density development of the central city have posed great challenges for urban transportation. The congestion was so bad that taking a bus to the nearest airport of the city (which is only 10&amp;nbsp;km from the central city) from downtown would easily take up 2–3 hours. The situation of crowding buses and low reliability of the public transit modes need to be solved. Besides regulations limiting the purchase of cars, an underground system of public transit was brought up as a potential solution. 

The preparation for subway construction started as early as 1958.&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/view/70368.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Shanghai is situated on saturated soft ground, which made tunnel construction very difficult. Some experiments were made to test the feasibility of tunnel construction. For example, the experiment in 1963 tried the structure method using steel reinforced concrete inner lining.&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/view/70368.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s an experimental tunnel was constructed using underground diaphragm wall with concrete structure (which was later used for metro line 1). After that shield method was used for the following lines. In May 1989, China and German formally signed the loan agreement for 460 million marks Subway special fund of. In March 1990, the State Department of China officially approved the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/view/70368.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The first line (Metro Line 1) opened in 1995.

==The Impact of Shanghai Metro==
There were discusses and arguments for and against the construction of subways. However, since the system has already been built and is still expanding, now that we look at it, we do see huge changes it brought about that greatly shaped the city development and people’s travel behaviors.

The Shanghai Metro lines promoted development. The plan and development process borrowed experiences from other places such as Tokyo to maximize the potential for development. The stations are planned to integrate with existing buildings or future building plans. The interchange hubs and many subway stations attract large amount of passengers and show great potentials for commercial activities. Real estate companies invest in projects along the lines and use languages such as “right next to Line 10 station” to promote their housing to the public. Many residents also depend on the Shanghai Metro plans to make their housing decision. 

The Shanghai Metro significantly improved the public transportation of the city. For the crowed central city, the current subway system provides high level of service. For at most 700 meters there will be a subway station. Once a passenger gets in a station, s/he can literally go anywhere and be confident about the time the trip is going to take. Besides the high reliability, the metro line is usually faster than ground transit. For example, a trip by bus from the central city to the railway station usually takes 40–60 minutes. The time is reduced to 20 minutes using the metro. 

The metro not only makes travel faster but easier. The subway station is the best place to go when you get lost. Once you find a subway station, you can easily find your way back. There are lots of Shanghai tourism guidebooks that centered on subway lines. 

The metro system is also easily connected to other transit modes. Each station usually has several or tens of connecting bus lines. Transfer is easy thanks to the transit card, which can be used for taxi, maglev train, ferry, light rail, subway, and buses.

The Shanghai Metro is having an increasing share of ridership among all public transportation modes. In 2006, the mileage of Shanghai Metro was 140.2&amp;nbsp;km (87.1 miles). There were 944 bus routes, 17,000 buses and 48,000 taxies in operation. The annual ridership for all public transit was 4.471 billion. Shanghai Metro accounted for 14.6% (0.656 billion). 

==Mode Share of Shanghai Metro==

There were 944 bus routes, 17,000 buses and 48,000 taxies in operation. The annual ridership for all public transit was 4.471 billion. Shanghai Metro accounted for 14.6% (0.656 billion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats-sh.gov.cn/sjfb/201103/92884.html, &quot;2006年上海式国民经济和社会发展统计公报&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the mileage of metro increased to 454.1&amp;nbsp;km (282.2 miles). The annual ridership for all public transit was 6.09 billion, and Shanghai Metro accounted for 34.5% (2.101 billion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats-sh.gov.cn/sjfb/201202/239488.html, &quot;2011年上海式国民经济和社会发展统计公报&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the number of buses decreased from 2006 to 2011, the absolute number of bus ridership increased only slightly, and bus share decreased from 61.3% to 46.2%.

==Finance and Policy==
The construction costs for the whole system is 300-500 million yuan/km. The total construction costs by 2010 was 238 billion yuan ( around 38 billion dollars). 210 billion more will be need for the expansion to reach the planned 880&amp;nbsp;km in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xinguozi.com.cn/magazine/show/99&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is two sources of funding. 40% of the capital is provided by the government, and the rest 60% is from bank loans, issuing bonds, liquidizing remnant assets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xinguozi.com.cn/magazine/show/99&lt;/ref&gt; The government’s role is changing in the process, from the major investor (investing 95% and 96% for line 1 and line 2 respectively) to a leading role in forming project company and promoting commercial financing. Shanghai Shentong Metro Co., Ltd. was formed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xinguozi.com.cn/magazine/show/99/0/2&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
As a comparatively new transit mode in the city, the development and operation of subway learned from existing modes. The construction and management learned from the railroads, such as trains, track, and capital investment. It more importantly learns from the operation of buses, which is another mode of intra-city transit mode. The Shanghai Metro Operation Management Center is in charge of the overall network operation, while the 11 lines are operated by four operating companies, each of which is responsible for their lines and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/上海轨道交通&lt;/ref&gt; The management mode is similar to that of the bus operation. Also the metro fare is based on the number of stations travelled, which is also similar to the bus fare in the past (now most of the bus routes charge a fixed price for a single trip). 

==Life Cycle of Shanghai Metro==
The daily ridership data for Shanghai Metro is retrieved from the Shanghai National Economy and Social Development Public Bulletin for each year from 1995-2011.  An S-Curve model is developed using the existing data to examine the birth, growth and estimate the maturity of the system. The data is shown in the table below 

[[File:Shanghai Metro Mileage.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Table 1: Shanghai Metro Mileage 1995-2011]]

The data is used to estimate a three-parameter logistic function:

'''S(t) = K/[1+exp(-b(t-t0)]''',
where:
S(t) is the estimated mileage, 
t is time (year),
t0 is the inflection time (year in which 1/2 K is achieved),
K is saturation status level,
b is a coefficient (the slope for regression)  

To do this, K and b needs to be estimated. K is set to be 500, 600, 700, etc. For each K value, calculation is conducted for each year using the equation:
Y=LN(Length/(K-length))

[[File:Estimating K Value.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Table 2: Estimating K Value]]

Then a regression between Y and year is performed to decide which K value fits the real data best. The largest R-square means that the model best explains the real data. From the table below, when K=1200&amp;nbsp;km the R-square is the largest. So the K value is estimated to be 1200.

[[File:R-square.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Table 3: Deciding K Value]]

The regression result for K=1200 is shown in the table below. The result shows that b=0.2537, intercept is -510.57. So the t0 (year in which 1/2 K is achieved) is 2012.49507, which means half of annual ridership of saturation is reached just months ago. 

[[File:Regression Results.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Table 4: Regression Results]]

Since K and b value are both known now, the daily ridership for each year can be estimated using the model. The graph below shows the relationship between the  estimated data and real data. 

[[File:S-Curve.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Table 5: S-Curve]]

The S-Curve fits the real data pretty well. Before 1995, there was no metro line in operation. During the year 1995-2011, the network mileage was growing at an increasing speed. According to the S-Curve model, the year 2012 is the year when 1/2 K is achieved, which means that the system will still grow, but the rate is probably slowing down. Around 2030 the mileage will start to level off at around 1200&amp;nbsp;km. However we need to pay attention to this S-curve too. The network growth of Shanghai Metro so far is following the metro plan pretty well. According to the plan for next phase, the mileage is going to increase to 880&amp;nbsp;km in 2020. But on the S-Curve the estimated mileage for 2020 is higher than 1000&amp;nbsp;km already.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''lemon battery''' is a simple type of electrical battery that is commonly made for school science projects because it illustrates a battery's main components. Typically, a  piece of zinc metal and a piece of copper metal are inserted into a lemon. Everyday objects such as galvanized nails and copper pennies can be used for the zinc and for the copper. A single lemon is usually studied using an electrical meter. Several lemons can be wired together to form a more powerful battery that will power a light-emitting diode, a buzzer, or a digital clock.

The lemon battery is similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta in Italy. Volta used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice. The lemon battery is described in some textbooks in order to illustrate the chemical reactions that occur in batteries. The zinc and copper are called the electrodes of the battery, and the juice inside the lemon is called the electrolyte. There are many variations of the lemon battery that use different fruits (or liquids) as electrolytes and metals other than zinc and copper as electrodes.

This article contains instructions for making a lemon battery and using it to power a light-emitting diode. If you want to know more about the science and history of the lemon battery, you can get started with the article in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lemon battery |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_battery |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and equipment==
Here's the list of pieces you need to assemble before you can start your experiment. Many pupils will need the help, and money, of an adult to obtain them.
*'''Light emitting diode'''. These look like plastic pieces with 2 wires stuck into them. They are usually just called LEDs, which comes from the first letters of the three words '''L'''ight '''E'''mitting '''D'''iode. When the right battery is hooked up, the LED will glow. A red one is good for the lemon battery experiment; there is another section of this article that discusses how to find an LED. While LEDs are a good choice for this experiment, some other ideas are given below in the section &quot;Alternative devices&quot;.
*'''Lemons'''. You'll need 3 or 4. Any citrus fruit, like limes, grapefruits, or oranges, or even a potato will work.
*'''Zinc electrodes'''. You'll need 3 or 4. Most likely you'll use a piece of metal that's been coated with zinc. This is what the word &quot;galvanized&quot; means. A galvanized metal washer that's about one inch (2 – 3&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter will work well. Galvanized roofing nails, galvanized screws and bolts, and even paper clips can also work. If you can find some zinc sheet, and some shears or tough scissors to cut it, that will work very well. Be careful if you do this; the edges of sheared metal sheets are ''sharp''. If you can, file the edges to make them less sharp.
*'''Copper electrodes'''. You'll need 3 or 4. Copper or copper-coated pennies work well. You may find some good copper fittings in the plumbing section of a hardware store. Again, if you can find some copper sheet, and some shears or scissors to cut it, that will work. Again, be careful about sharp edges.
*'''Leads'''. You'll need 5 or 6. The easiest thing is to get hold of a packet of insulated lead wires with &quot;alligator clips&quot; on each end.
*'''Multimeter''' (optional). If you know how to use an electrical multimeter, it can be helpful in getting your battery to work.

There are some little photos of these components below. If you click on the photo, you can see it larger.

File:Digital multimeter.jpg|'''Multimeter''' (optional). The multimeter in the photo is set to its 20 V scale, which means 20 volts. For this experiment, you'd set it to read 2000 m, which means 2000 millivolts or 2.000 volts. To measure the current, you rotate the center switch to the scale that reads 200 mA, which means 200 milliamperes (or 0.200 amperes).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Making a single lemon cell==
Make the first lemon cell. Your battery is going to have at least 3 lemon cells, but each cell is made the same way.
#Clean your electrodes carefully. Your goal is to get any dirt or grease off of them, and also to scrub away the thin &quot;oxide&quot; coatings on them. It should work fine if you clean them in the same way that you'd clean a pan in the kitchen to make it clean and shiny. Scrubbing with steel wool or with an abrasive sponge will work fine; if you are using a galvanized electrode, be careful not to rub off the zinc coating completely.
#Stick one zinc electrode into the lemon (or other fruit). You may need to use a small knife to cut a slit into the lemon. You want the electrode to go into the lemon as deeply as possible, but you'll need a little bit of the electrode to stick out of the fruit so you can attach a lead wire to it. Wiggle the electrode around a little to smash the membranes inside the fruit.
#Next, stick the copper electrode into the same lemon. You want this electrode to be close to the zinc electrode, but it ''must not touch'' the zinc inside the lemon. If they do touch, your cell will not work. As for the zinc electrode, you want to stick the copper electrode into the fruit as far as you can, and you want to wiggle it a bit to make sure the membranes near the electrode are broken.
(Optional) If you are using a multimeter, you can do the following tests to make sure your lemon cell is working.
#Hook up two alligator clips from your leads to the two electrodes. Connect the two clips to the leads of the multimeter.
#Measure the voltage from your lemon cell. It should read about 0.9 - 1.0 volts.
#Measure the current from your cell. You should read a few tenths of a milliampere. Some multimeters are not sensitive enough to measure currents less than one milliampere, in which case you'll just see 0.0 as the reading.

==Making the lemon battery==
[[File:Lemon Battery With LED.svg|thumb|right|Three lemon cells wired together so that they energize a light emitting diode (LED). Each individual lemon has a zinc electrode and a copper electrode inserted into it; the zinc is colored gray in the diagram. |alt=A drawing showing three lemons and a glowing red object (the LED). The LED has two lines coming out of its bottom to represent its electrical leads. Each lemon has two metal pieces stuck into it; the metals are colored differently. There are thin black lines, representing wires, connecting the metal pieces stuck into each lemon and the leads of the LED.]]
When several lemon cells are wired together, the collection is called a battery. We usually call a single lemon cell a battery also. Most batteries that you may purchase to use in toys and electronics have just one cell inside.
#You need to make 3 lemon cells. If you're using a multimeter, make sure that each cell generates the correct voltage and the correct current.
#Using two lead wires, connect the three cells together. Connect the zinc electrode on the first cell to the copper electrode on the second. Connect the zinc electrode on the second cell to the copper electrode on the third lemon. This is called a &quot;series&quot; connection; the three cells make up the lemon battery.

==Connecting the LED==
Connect a lead wire from the copper electrode of the first lemon cell to the longer lead wire from the LED. Connect a lead wire from the zinc electrode of the third cell to the shorter wire of the LED. You may need to gently pull the lead wires that come from the LED apart; the alligator clips on the ends of the two lead wires that connect your battery to the LED must not touch each other.

The LED should now light rather faintly if all the many details are correct. If you cannot see it glowing, turn down the room lights to make sure it isn't working. There's a guide to troubleshooting your setup below if it still doesn't work.

==After the LED lights==
If you've succeeded in getting your LED (or other device) to work, there are a few more experiments that you can try.
*What happens if you switch the two lead wires on the LED?
*What happens if you switch the two lead wires on the lemon in the middle?
*Stick a second zinc electrode into one of the lemons, but don't connect it to anything. Any effect on the LED?
**Now move the wire from the copper to the zinc. This lemon now has 2 zinc electrodes instead of one copper and one zinc. What happens?

If you are using a multimeter, you can record the voltage across the LED for each of these experiments to see if you understand it.

===About LEDs===
LEDs are made out of materials called semiconductors. The chips (integrated circuits) inside your electronic toys, television sets, and computers are made mostly out of silicon, which is one type of semiconductor. However, silicon doesn't work for LEDs. Instead they are made out of materials like &quot;gallium phosphide&quot; that glow much better than silicon. The three letters LED stand for '''L'''ight '''E'''mitting '''D'''iode. Diodes are sandwiches with two or more layers of similar semiconductors. Diodes have the property that electrical current can flow only when the battery is hooked up correctly. If you hook up the battery backwards, no electrical current is flowing in the circuit, and the LED won't glow. Once the electrical current from your lemon battery is flowing through the diode, the flowing electricity can make some light. It's related to something called the &quot;photoelectric effect&quot;. The color of the light is determined by the particular semiconductor in the diode. It might interest you that Albert Einstein, the great scientist who is best known for his theory of relativity, actually won the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the photoelectric effect.

==Troubleshooting==
*A typical problem is that the electrodes or the bare metal parts of the lead wires are touching each other accidentally. The zinc and the copper electrode must not touch each other inside the fruit. The alligator clips must not touch each other where you connect them to the LED.
*The LED must be connected correctly. Trying switching the connections to the two wires that come out from the LED case.
*The connection of the three cells must be right. Each lemon has one zinc and one copper electrode. The wires that run from one lemon to another must run from a zinc electrode to a copper electrode. The illustration shows how this is done.
*Citrus fruit should be juicy inside. To break up the internal membranes of an unripe fruit, roll it while pushing down.
*Three lemons is the minimum number needed to light an LED. If you can make a fourth lemon cell and add it to your battery, you may be able to get the LED to light this way.
*The LED may be broken, or may not be the correct type. There is an LED selection guide below, but selecting the right LED is difficult for younger people. Get some help from an adult if you think LED selection is your problem.

==LED selection guide==
The section is mainly for people who know something about electrical circuits.
*Many LEDs can work. A red LED is usually used because red LEDs typically need lower voltages to glow than do orange, yellow, green, or blue LEDs. Some red LEDs work with voltages as low as 1.6 - 1.8 V; a very dim glow may be observed with 2 cells, but 3 cells are generally used. There are different types of red LEDs that glow at different wavelengths, and that need somewhat higher voltages.
*Some LED packages contain series resistors, and are designed to work with a 12 V battery. These packages will not work with a lemon battery, which provides a much lower voltage.
*The best LEDs for lemon batteries are designed to glow with a current of about 1 mA (at a voltage of 1.6 V). One example is: Avago Technologies part HLMP-D155, which is a red LED (637&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength) with a 1.6 V forward bias voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HLMP-D150 |url=http://www.avagotech.com/docs/AV02-1562EN |publisher=Avago Technologies, Inc. |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An LED is included in some commercial kits for constructing lemon batteries.&lt;ref name=4M&gt;{{cite web |title=Enviro Battery |url=http://www.4m-ind.com/product_view.php?id=19&amp;page_no=1&amp;type=1 |publisher=4M Industrial Development Limited |accessdate=2012-11-07}} This kit furnishes electrodes that are coated with zinc&lt;!--December 2012--&gt;. The coating is thin, and will be dissolved within a few hours of use.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, science teachers often use parts from the Radio Shack company, which has many stores. A 1998 paper listed several products from this company, but most of them are no longer available.&lt;ref name=Swartling&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lemon Cells Revisited—The Lemon-Powered Calculator |first1=Daniel J. |last1=Swartling |first2=Charlotte |last2=Morgan |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=75 |year=1998 |pages=181–182 |issue=2 |doi=10.1021/ed075p181 |url=http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/gr8ps/zz_old-files/green/wheres_the_juice/lemon_battery.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative devices==
In these instructions, we assumed that you will be using your lemon battery to make a light-emitting diode (an LED) glow. 
There are alternatives to an LED. Some low-power buzzers work,&lt;ref name=Swartling /&gt; and one is included with a commercial kit.&lt;ref name=4M /&gt; You can also connect the lemon battery to some digital clocks and calculators. If the device requires a 9 volt battery, it will not work with your lemon battery. For other devices, first remove the battery or batteries that are normally inside. Then, use the alligator clips from the lemon battery to connect to the terminals inside device. The copper electrode from the lemon battery needs to be connected to the battery terminal in the device that is marked +. The zinc electrode from the lemon battery needs to be connected to the terminal in the device that is marked -. Commercial &quot;potato clock&quot; and other battery science kits provide an inexpensive digital clock for the experiment.&lt;ref name=Edmund&gt;{{cite web |title=The Amazing Two Potato Clock |url=http://www.scientificsonline.com/two-potato-clock.html |publisher=Edmund Scientifics |accessdate=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4M /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is meant to be a math problem solving textbook for Grade 4-7 students and teachers.
In the United States, it is meant to be useful in meeting National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)
standard on problem solving that is summarized below.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students to—
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
*build new mathematical knowledge through problem solving;
*solve problems that arise in mathematics and in other contexts;
*apply and adapt a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems;
* monitor and reflect on the process of mathematical problem solving.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626&quot;&gt;A critical challenge in improving the quality of mathematics education is in motivating students to take interest in studies in the presence of easy availability of alternate recreational activities that are perceived as enjoyable. Recreational mathematics identifies math activities including puzzles that can be enjoyed by adults and children. The Sudoku puzzle is a very good example of this. Another example is KenKen® puzzle that New York Times called 'the most addictive puzzle since Sudoku'. At present, such puzzles have a very limited role in classrooms because there are only a small number of math lessons that can be taught with these puzzles. The objective of this book to provide lessons for a wide variety of mathematics problem solving topics in the context of fun math puzzles. Puzzle problems are particularly suitable for teaching creative problem solving.  Puzzle problems are often hard enough and require application of a variety of problem solving strategy.  Reflecting on the process permit further learning about mathematics. &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

===The Joy of Creative Problem Solving===
&lt;p&gt;From time immortal, people have enjoyed activities 
such as games, magic shows, contests, and puzzles. Therefore, it is 
not surprising to find students enjoying similar activities based on 
mathematics. There are a wide variety of math-based games and math game 
software. Good examples of math games include Krypto and 24. Like games, 
contests have an appeal to many kids who enjoy the process of doing 
things to win something. Therefore, math contests can be an activity 
that kids enjoy and that can encourage kids to work on math problems. 
In the process of taking part in contests, some kids begin to love math. 
Math competitions in which students can participate in the United States 
include NOETIC Learning Math Contest, MOEMS, Math Bee by North South 
Foundation, Math Kangaroo, World Math Day, Ole Miss Math Challenge, 
Online Math League, MATHCOUNTS and AMC. Math magic tricks include tricks 
about guessing numbers and some card tricks based on math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another entertaining activity is doing math puzzles. 
This book will examine a variety of math techniques in the context of 
math puzzles. In particular, we will be studying creative problem solving 
in the context of a puzzle called KenKen. We enjoy working on puzzles 
because we have a natural tendency to be motivated by surprise, contradiction 
and a gap in knowledge. While a math puzzle can intrigue and engage 
students and get them going, a challenging, questioning and reflecting 
atmosphere can make the experience of mathematical problem solving even 
more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the right attitude and practice, students can 
enjoy the process of mathematical thinking. This process involves thinking 
about mathematical problems, observing beautiful mathematical patterns, 
coming up with elegant insights, facing difficult problems that one may 
or may not be able to solve, experiencing the thrill of progressing 
on such problems and solving them, reflecting on mathematical thinking, 
and learning from successes and failures. Once students begin to love 
creative math problem solving, they have an activity they can enjoy 
wherever they are. Then, the joy of creative thinking is all they need 
to motivate themselves to get going on any challenging math problem.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:13pt&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
==The Problem Solving Approach==
&lt;/p&gt;
=== Heuristic Problem Solving Approach ===
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;For some problems, students 
know the strategy to use as soon as they read the problem. However, 
for particularly difficult problems, they do not know right away how 
they can solve them. The progress on such problems often comes from 
heuristics or ‘rules of thumb’ that are likely to be useful, but 
are not guaranteed to solve problems. As a result, the progress on a 
problem takes the form of multiple explorations or searching different 
ideas. Work on the problem solving may go through different phases such 
as trying to understand the problem, working on a specific approach, 
being stuck and trying to get unstuck, critically examining solutions, 
or communicating. The work may involve going back and forth between 
these different phases of work. In this book, we would now be providing 
a variety of different rules of thumb for solving problems. These heuristics 
can be described in the form of a condition and an associated action, 
where conditions describe problem situations and actions describe what 
should be done in such situations. &lt;/p&gt;
'''Situation: Are you about to start working 
on a problem? Are you trying to understand a problem?'''
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to understand the problem by asking the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is given and what is to be found? Is it possible 
to draw a picture or a diagram of the context described in the problem? 
Can you reword the problem? Can you come up with specific examples corresponding 
to the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
'''Situation: Have you thought out an approach to attack the problem?'''
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the general approach to solving the problem is 
obvious to you, create a plan to solve the problem based on this approach 
and carry out this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know a related or similar problem, you can 
use the knowledge of the solution from the related problem to come up 
with a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t formulate an approach, you may be feeling 
stuck and you may want to try to understand the problem better.&lt;/p&gt;
'''Situation: Are you feeling stuck?'''
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many different approaches can be tried to get unstuck. 
One approach is to try working a simpler version of the problem, and 
use the solution to the problem to get insights that are useful in solving 
the original problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come up with a pattern or an ‘Aha’ moment, 
try studying the observations that triggered it in more detail and try 
observing how these could be used in progressing with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you may just try to understand the 
problem better and use relevant suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
'''Situation: Are you busy working out details?'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitor how you are progressing and backtrack if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to look for patterns, the unusual and 
surprises (Aha! insights).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for any surprise; understand it and its implication 
for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
'''Situation: Are you done solving a problem 
or a sub-problem or inferring a key conclusion?'''
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically examine your hypotheses and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done solving the problem? If it works, check each 
step. Can you see clearly that the step is correct? Can you prove that 
it is correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;Learn from reflection: 
Specialize/generalize heuristics. Learn new heuristics. If the plan 
does not produce a solution in a short time, then check from time to 
time: why are you doing what you are doing? Are you progressing? This 
is self-monitoring. If your plan fails, examine why it did not work. 
Writing with a rubric or a template can help in recalling and studying 
what you have done so far. Organize the information. Ask: What can you 
conclude about the approaches that won’t work? What else did you learn? 
Do you see any patterns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;'''Situation:  Are you about to communicate your conclusions to a teacher or to partners?'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part of your work on a problem is to communicate 
your conclusions. What is communicated may differ depending on the situation. 
Sometimes, you are expected to report only the answer to the problem. 
Sometimes, you are expected to show your work. Sometimes, you may be 
doing collaborative problem solving. In such situations, it is important 
to be a good communicator. Helping others with problems that you have 
solved can help you develop skills needed to become a good math communicator. 
The aspects of such communication include explaining your solution to 
someone else clearly, understanding someone else’s solution, and providing 
feedback on it at various levels of detail. After you create an explanation 
for your solution, examine carefully if you have justified each step 
in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specific Problem Solving Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
1. Change the representation
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a wrong representation may make a problem impossible 
to solve. Strategies of changing representation include drawing a picture 
and looking at the problem from a completely different perspective.  
By drawing a picture, and visualizing the information about the problem 
using it, you will have clearer understanding of the problem and it will 
help you to come up with an approach to solve the problem that you might 
not be able to see otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
2. Make an organized list or a table
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making an organized list allows you to examine data 
clearly. It can help you in ensuring that you are looking at all of 
the relevant information. It will also allow you to see patterns in 
the data easily and to come to correct conclusions.  Similarly, 
making a table allows you to examine data clearly. It can help you in 
ensuring that you are looking at all of the relevant information. It 
also will allow you to see patterns in the data easily and to come to 
correct conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
3. Create a simpler problem
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we are not able to solve the problem as 
it is stated, but we are able to solve a simpler problem that is similar 
in some way. For example, the similar problem may use simpler numbers. 
Once we solve one or more simpler problems, we may understand the approach 
that can be used to solve the problems of similar type and may be able 
to solve the problem that has been given to us.&lt;/p&gt;
4. Use logical reasoning
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logical reasoning is useful in mathematics problem 
in various ways. It can be used to eliminate possible choices. It can 
also sometimes be used to conclude the answer directly.&lt;/p&gt;
5. Guess and check
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘guess and check’ strategy can be used on 
many problems. If the number of possible answers is small, one can use 
this strategy to come up with the answer very quickly. In some other 
cases where the number of possible answers is not small, one may still 
be able to make intelligent guesses and come up with the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
6. Work backward
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is easier to start with information 
at the end of the problem and work backward to the beginning of the 
problem than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:13pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt;margin-bottom:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:13pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Right Attitude toward Working on Difficult Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, when one is not able to solve a problem, one 
feels frustrated. The natural tendency is to be disappointed, as ‘ego’ 
feels hurt. At an early stage of the problem solving process, one may 
be stuck while solving a problem. As you are stuck, you may not know 
of any action you can take to make progress on the problem. However, 
you may believe that the teacher is expecting you to do some work. Therefore, 
you feel unhappy about the situation. Furthermore, when you are stuck 
and not able to think of ways to progress, you anticipate that you are 
likely to fail in solving the problem. This adds to the frustration 
of the situation. This explains why it is common to see students with 
a negative attitude toward difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;Attitudes that help students 
enjoy work and persist in effort include some of the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Acceptance 
  of the process: Acceptance of the process of solving difficult problems 
  in which you work for a long time and you are not always sure if you 
  will be able to solve the problem and that ‘being stuck’ is a normal 
  state and that such a process includes mixed emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  thrill of taking on challenges: When one works on an easy task, not 
  solving it is viewed as something of concern whereas solving it is not 
  a big accomplishment. In contrast, when one works on a challenging problem, 
  not solving it is not a concern, as the problem is inherently difficult 
  for anyone. When one does solve a challenging problem, there is tremendous 
  satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. Despite this, it is natural 
  to feel frustrated when you are stuck. When this happens, you can start 
  by trying to identify what is difficult about the problem and writing 
  down information about the stuck state. Learn a few approaches (e.g., 
  try a simpler problem) that can always be used when you are stuck and 
  when you don’t know what approach you can try next. Initially, keep 
  the goal ‘to try to make progress on solving the problem’ instead 
  of setting the goal of completely solving what seems like a very difficult 
  problem. Thus, one would set many short-term objectives in the process 
  of solving a difficult problem and one would succeed in many of these 
  even if one does not succeed in the overall goal. In particular, when 
  you use the strategies of working on a simpler version of the problem 
  or working on specialized cases of the problem, realize that you are 
  actually solving some problems in the process and making progress. Making 
  progress involves gathering information, noticing patterns and gaining 
  insights about the problem. This way, you would have a sense of accomplishment 
  if you work on the problem and progress without completely solving the 
  problem. Sometimes, after initially feeling frustrated, one is able 
  to make progress on the problem and solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot; start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Attitude 
  toward failures: Do not be discouraged by failures. Read this quote 
  from the famous scientist, Edison. An assistant asked, “Why are you 
  wasting your time and money? We have had failure after failure, almost 
  a thousand of them. Why do you continue to pursue this impossible task?” 
  Edison said, “We haven’t had a thousand failures, we’ve just discovered 
  a thousand ways not to invent the electric light.” Failure often offers 
  a bigger opportunity for learning than successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirst for learning, furthermore, 
has a clear objective of trying to learn from successes and failures 
in problem solving process. To learn the most, you need to reflect on 
both successes and failures. In addition, you are going to learn the 
most if you are working on the kind of problem that you are not always 
capable of solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot; start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Appreciation 
  of beauty in mathematics: Appreciate particularly neat insights and 
  your ‘Aha’ moments as you progress on problem solving. These may 
  be interesting patterns and surprises you encountered in problem solving. 
  Ingredients of beauty in mathematics include surprise at the unexpected, 
  the perception of unsuspected relationships and alternation of perplexity 
  and illumination. Mathematical beauty is found in patterns. Famous mathematician 
  Hardy wrote, “A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker 
  of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs are, it 
  is because they are made with ideas. The mathematician’s patterns, 
  like the painter’s or the poet’s, must be beautiful; the idea, like 
  the colors or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot; start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Interest 
  in mathematical communication: It helps to write the insights you learn 
  as you work on the problem and those you learn when you reflect on your 
  successes and failures. Communicating about these two to others helps 
  as well. If you learn a mathematical trick or a puzzle in class, you 
  may want to share it with your friends or siblings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beliefs about Problem Solving&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students often hold beliefs about the nature of mathematics 
that hinder their ability to solve difficult problems creatively. Examples 
of such misleading beliefs include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;There 
  aren’t multiple ways to solve a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Average 
  students cannot expect to understand mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Mathematics 
  problems are invariably solved by individuals and not by a group of 
  people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Students 
  who excel at mathematics solve any problem in a very short time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  mathematics topics studied in school are not useful in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt;line-height:16pt&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning From Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you practice the better you will be. However, 
practice alone is not enough. Reflection over problem solving experience 
can help a student learn both about the problem situation and about 
problem solving process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recollect how you progressed toward the solution. 
Remember the important aspects of the progress. Remember the stages 
when you were stuck and how you recovered. Also, remember the ‘Aha’ 
moments if you encountered any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you learn from your experience? What made 
the problem difficult? What worked? What did not work? What was the 
lesson learnt? Does it tell you about effectiveness of different approaches 
to problems of this type? If you articulated particular rules of thumb 
or strategies, what is the reason these worked? In what circumstances 
would these work? Are these specific cases of more general strategies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of reflecting on your problem solving 
experience is to get a better understanding of strategies and rules of 
thumb that would be useful in future problem situations and, if possible, 
to come up with new rules of thumb. This includes getting a better understanding 
of circumstances under which a heuristic would be applicable as well 
as specializing or generalizing heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Influence  of Parents and Friends&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends and parents play a very important role in 
helping kids develop positive attitudes toward mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids would often be motivated to attend school math 
clubs because they get to spend time with their friends. If the club 
offers snacks, that may provide additional motivation. Math clubs do 
encourage positive attitudes toward math and contribute to a higher 
level of success in mathematics. If you have a child who has strong interest 
with mathematics and who does not have friends with similar interests 
in class, it would be helpful to encourage him/her to participate in 
the Math Club if your school has one. Other alternatives include enrolling 
him/her in GATE math classes where he or she gets to interact with kids 
with similar interests. Summer math camps can serve this purpose as 
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents can play an important role in encouraging 
students to take interest in math by doing and supporting math at home.

== Mathmatical Puzzles ==
&lt;h3&gt; Variety of Mathematical Puzzles &lt;/h3&gt;
''Mathematical puzzles''' make up an integral part of recreational mathematics. They have specific rules as do multiplayer games, but they do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, to solve such a puzzle, the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. Mathematical puzzles require mathematics to solve them. Logic puzzles are a common type of mathematical puzzle.

Conway's Game of Life and fractals, as two examples, may also be considered mathematical puzzles even though the solver interacts with them only at the beginning by providing a set of initial conditions. After these conditions are set, the rules of the puzzle determine all subsequent changes and moves. Many of the puzzles are well known because they were discussed by Martin Gardner in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in Scientific American. Mathematical puzzles are sometimes used to motivate students in teaching elementary school math problem solving techniques.

===Sudoku===

{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg|image2=Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714 solution.svg|width=250|caption1=A typical Sudoku puzzle|caption2=The same puzzle with solution numbers marked in red|alt1=A typical Sudoku puzzle grid, with nine rows and nine columns that intersect at square spaces. Some of the spaces are pre-filled with one number each; others are blank spaces for a solver to fill with a number.|alt2=The previous puzzle, solved with additional numbers that each fill a blank space.}}
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called &quot;boxes&quot;, &quot;blocks&quot;, &quot;regions&quot;, or &quot;sub-squares&quot;) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution.

Completed puzzles are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same 9×9 playing board row or column or in any of the nine 3×3 subregions of the 9×9 playing board.

The puzzle was popularized in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning ''single number''.

Although the 9×9 grid with 3×3 regions is by far the most common, many variations exist. Sample puzzles can be 4×4 grids with 2×2 regions; 5×5 grids with pentomino regions have been published under the name ''Logi-5''; the World Puzzle Championship has featured a 6×6 grid with 2×3 regions and a 7×7 grid with six heptomino regions and a disjoint region. Larger grids are also possible. The ''Times'' offers a 12×12-grid ''Dodeka sudoku'' with 12 regions of 4×3 squares. Dell regularly publishes 16×16 ''Number Place Challenger'' puzzles (the 16×16 variant often uses 1 through G rather than the 0 through F used in hexadecimal). Nikoli offers 25×25 ''Sudoku the Giant'' behemoths. ''Sudoku-zilla'', a 100×100-grid was published in print in 2010.

Another common variant is to add limits on the placement of numbers beyond the usual row, column, and box requirements. Often the limit takes the form of an extra &quot;dimension&quot;; the most common is to require the numbers in the main diagonals of the grid also to be unique. The aforementioned ''Number Place Challenger'' puzzles are all of this variant, as are the ''Sudoku X'' puzzles in the ''Daily Mail'', which use 6×6 grids. The ''Sudoku X4'' family of iPhone/iPad apps combine this &quot;X&quot; varation with the ''Sunday Telegraph''-style interlocking colored nonomino or Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw shapes of nine spaces each instead of the 3x3 regions, providing a total of four different kinds of puzzles.

Mini Sudoku
A variant named &quot;Mini Sudoku&quot; appears in the American newspaper ''USA Today'' and elsewhere, which is played on a 6×6 grid with 3×2 regions. The object is the same as standard Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6.  A similar form, for younger solvers of puzzles, called &quot;The Junior Sudoku&quot;, has appeared in some newspapers, such as some editions of The Daily Mail.

Cross Sums Sudoku
Another variant is the combination of Sudoku with Kakuro on a 9×9 grid, called Cross Sums Sudoku, in which clues are given in terms of cross sums. The clues can also be given by cryptic alphametics in which each letter represents a single digit from 0 to 9. An example is NUMBER+NUMBER=KAKURO which has a unique solution 186925+186925=373850. Another example is SUDOKU=IS×FUNNY whose solution is 426972=34×12558.

Killer Sudoku
{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Killersudoku color.svg|image2=Killersudoku color solution.svg|width=150|caption1=A Killer Sudoku puzzle|caption2=Solution for puzzle to the left}}
{{main|Killer Sudoku}}
The Killer Sudoku variant combines elements of Sudoku and Kakuro.

Alphabetical Sudoku
{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Wordoku puzzle.svg|image2=Wordoku puzzle solution.svg|width=150|caption1=A Wordoku puzzle|caption2=Solution in red for puzzle to the left}}
Alphabetical variations have emerged, sometimes called '''Wordoku'''; there is no functional difference in the puzzle unless the letters spell something. Some variants, such as in the ''TV Guide'', include a word reading along a main diagonal, row, or column once solved; determining the word in advance can be viewed as a solving aid. A Wordoku might contain other words, other than the main word.

Hypersudoku
{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Oceans Hypersudoku18 Puzzle.svg|image2=Oceans Hypersudoku18 Solution.svg|width=150|caption1=Hypersudoku puzzle&lt;!--(Oceans Hypersudoku is self made), as seen in ''The Age''--&gt;|caption2=Solution numbers for puzzle to the left|alt1=A Sudoku puzzle grid with four blue qudrants and nine rows and nine columns that intersect at square spaces. Some of the spaces are pre-filled with one number each; others are blank spaces for a solver to fill with a number.|alt2=The previous puzzle, solved with additional numbers that each fill a blank space.}}
Hypersudoku is one of the most popular variants. It is published by newspapers and magazines around the world and is also known as &quot;NRC Handelsblad|NRC Sudoku,&quot; &quot;Windoku,&quot; &quot;Hyper-Sudoku&quot; and &quot;4 Square Sudoku.&quot; The layout is identical to a normal Sudoku, but with additional interior areas defined in which the numbers 1 to 9 must appear. The solving algorithm is slightly different from the normal Sudoku puzzles because of the leverage on the overlapping squares. This overlap gives the player more information to logically reduce the possibilities in the remaining squares. The approach to playing is similar to Sudoku but with possibly more emphasis on scanning the squares and overlap rather than columns and rows.

Puzzles constructed from multiple Sudoku grids are common. Five 9×9 grids which overlap at the corner regions in the shape of a quincunx is known in Japan as Gattai 5 (five merged) Sudoku. In ''The Times'', ''The Age'' and ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' this form of puzzle is known as ''Samurai SuDoku''. The ''Baltimore Sun'' and the ''Toronto Star'' publish a puzzle of this variant (titled ''High Five'') in their Sunday edition. Often, no givens are to be found in overlapping regions. Sequential grids, as opposed to overlapping, are also published, with values in specific locations in grids needing to be transferred to others.

Str8ts shares the Sudoku requirement of uniqueness in the rows and columns but the third constraint is very different. Str8ts uses black cells (some with clue numbers) to divide the board into compartments. These must be filled with a set of numbers that form a &quot;straight,&quot; like the poker hand. A straight is a set of numbers with no gaps in them, such as &quot;4,3,6,5&quot;—and the order can be non-sequential. 9×9 is the traditional size but with suitable placement of black cells any size board is possible.

[[File:Comparison Sudoku.png|thumb|250px|An example of Greater Than Sudoku
A tabletop version of Sudoku can be played with a standard 81-card Set deck (see Set game). A three-dimensional Sudoku puzzle was invented by Dion Church and published in the ''Daily Telegraph'' in May 2005. ''The Times'' also publishes a three-dimensional version under the name Tredoku. There is a Sudoku version of the Rubik's Cube named Sudoku Cube.

There are many other variants. Some are different shapes in the arrangement of overlapping 9×9 grids, such as butterfly, windmill, or flower. Others vary the logic for solving the grid. One of these is Greater Than Sudoku. In this a 3×3 grid of the Sudoku is given with 12 symbols of Greater Than (&gt;) or Less Than (&lt;) on the common line of the two adjacent numbers. Another variant on the logic of solution is Clueless Sudoku, in which nine 9×9 Sudoku grids are themselves placed in a three-by-three array. The center cell in each 3×3 grid of all nine puzzles is left blank and form a tenth Sudoku puzzle without any cell completed; hence, &quot;clueless&quot;.

Duidoku

Duidoku is a two player variant of Sudoku. It is played on a 4X4 board i.e. 16 squares or four clusters each containing four squares.

The game is followed using the rules of Sudoku. Four numbers are used, and each player consecutively places one number out of the four such that he or she makes no illegal moves. The first player to make an illegal move loses.

===KenKen Puzzle===

'''KenKen''' and '''KenDoku''' are trademarked names for a style of arithmetic and logic puzzle invented in 2004 by the Japanese math teacher Tetsuya Miyamoto, an innovator who says he practices &quot;the art of teaching without teaching&quot;. The names '''Calcudoku''' and '''Mathdoku''' are sometimes used by those who don't have the rights to use the KenKen or KenDoku trademarks.



As in sudoku, the goal of each puzzle is to fill a grid with digits –– 1 through 4 for a 4×4 grid, 1 through 5 for a 5×5, etc. –– so that no digit appears more than once in any row or column (a Latin square). Grids range in size from 3×3 to 9×9. Additionally, KenKen grids are divided into heavily outlined groups of cells –– often called “cages” –– and the numbers in the cells of each cage must produce a certain “target” number when combined using a specified mathematical operation (either addition, subtraction, multiplication or division). For example, a three-cell cage specifying addition and a target number of 6 in a 4×4 puzzle might be satisfied with the digits 1, 2, and 3. Digits may be repeated within a cage, as long as they are not in the same row or column. No operation is relevant for a single-cell cage: placing the &quot;target&quot; in the cell is the only possibility (thus being a &quot;free space&quot;). The target number and operation appear in the upper left-hand corner of the cage.



Example
[[Image:KenKenProblem.svg|right|250px|thumb| A typical KenKen problem.]]
[[Image:KenKenSolution.svg|right|250px|thumb| Solution to the above problem.]]
The objective is to fill the grid in with the digits 1 through 6 such that:
*Each row contains exactly one of each digit
*Each column contains exactly one of each digit
*Each bold-outlined group of cells is a cage containing digits which achieve the specified result using the specified mathematical operation: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷). (Unlike Killer Sudoku, digits may repeat within a cage.)

Some of the techniques from Sudoku and Killer Sudoku can be used here, but much of the process involves the listing of all the possible options and eliminating the options one by one as other information requires.

In the example here:
*&quot;11+&quot; in the leftmost column can only be &quot;5,6&quot;
*&quot;2÷&quot; in the top row must be one of &quot;1,2&quot;, &quot;2,4&quot; or &quot;3,6&quot;
*&quot;20×&quot; in the top row must be &quot;4,5&quot;.
*&quot;6×&quot; in the top right must be &quot;1,1,2,3&quot;. Therefore the two &quot;1&quot;s must be in separate columns, thus row 1 column 5 is a &quot;1&quot;.
*&quot;30x&quot; in the fourth row down must contain &quot;5,6&quot;
*&quot;240×&quot; on the left side is one of &quot;6,5,4,2&quot; or &quot;3,5,4,4&quot;. Either way the five must be in the upper right cell because we have &quot;5,6&quot; already in column 1, and &quot;5,6&quot; in row 4.
*etc.

Extensions
More complex KenKen problems are formed using the principles described above but omitting the symbols +, −, × and ÷, thus leaving them as yet another unknown to be determined.
== Puzzle Motivated Explorations of Problem Solving ==

In the previous section, we described a variety of puzzles that people enjoy.  In this section, we will discuss a variety of mathematical concepts relevant to problem solving in the context of these puzzles.  Many of these explorations can be used in more than one puzzle, but these will be discussed with one specific examples and other relevant puzzles will be noted.  As students may have liking for a particular puzzle or teachers may have chosen to utilize some puzzle after practical considerations, they may want to study the exploration here and practice these in the context of specific puzzles.  Intention of the book is benefit the widest audience of students fascinated by puzzles.

===Exploration of Sets and  Venn Diagrams===
&lt;/p&gt;
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg|width=250|caption1=A Sudoku puzzle|alt1=A  Sudoku puzzle grid, with nine rows and nine columns that intersect at square spaces. Some of the spaces are pre-filled with one number each; others are blank spaces for a solver to fill with a number.}}
&lt;p&gt;Relevant puzzles: Sudoku, Sudoku Variants, KenKen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; is a collection of things. For example, the items you wear 
are a set: these would include skirt, socks, hat, shirt, jeans, and 
so on. You write sets with curly brackets like this: {skirt, shoes, 
jeans, watches, shirts, ...}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt; of two sets is the set of elements that are in either 
set. For example: let A = {1, 2, 3} and let B = {3, 4, 5}. The union 
of A and B is written as A U B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. There is no need to 
list the 3 twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;intersection&lt;/span&gt; of two sets is the set of elements that are in 
both sets. For example: let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}. The intersection 
of A and B is written as   A &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Symbol','Arial'&quot;&gt;Ç&lt;/span&gt; B = {3}. Sometimes there will be no intersection at all. 
In that case, we say the answer is the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;empty set&lt;/span&gt; or the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;null set&lt;/span&gt;. For example, given set A = all prime numbers greater 
than 5 and set B = all even prime numbers, then the intersection of 
A and B = {}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;difference&lt;/span&gt; between A and B are elements that are in A but not 
in B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = {1, 2, 3} B = {3, 4} Then, A – B = {1, 2}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S1 = The set of numbers that are not assigned in the 
second row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S2 = The set of numbers that are not assigned in the 
second column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S3 = The set of numbers that are consistent with 3x3 top left grid constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S4 = The set of numbers that are assigned in the second

column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;S2: The set of unassigned 
values in row 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Find the intersection 
of S1 and S2. Use this to determine possible values in the third square in 
the first column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot; start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;. What are the possible numbers that can go in the square 
  at the intersection of the ninth row and the first column in the puzzle above?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;S1 
  has 10 members. S2 has 8 members. Their union has 16 members. How many 
  members does their intersection have?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;S1 
  has 30 members. S2 has 28 members. Their union has 46 members. How many 
  members does their intersection have?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;S1 
  has 100 members. S2 has 108 members. Their union has 200 members. How 
  many members does their intersection have?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;S1 
  has 100 members. S2 has 128 members. Their union has 128 members. How 
  many members does their intersection have?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Look 
  for patterns in the following table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There 
  are many different patterns in the table. One pattern is that the number 
  of elements in S1 + the number of elements in S2 = the number of elements 
  in the intersection + the number of elements in the union.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;Determining numbers that 
go in a KenKen product cage like 5040x above involves finding if the 
target number is divisible by a particular factor. Divisibility rules 
are particularly helpful in doing this. In this exploration, we will 
study divisibility concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
Exercises
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Examples of numbers divisible 
by 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 15, 20, 105, 110, 205, 2300. Do you see any 
patterns in these numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;2) Do you see any patterns in the table below that lists numbers that 
are divisible by 9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Do you see any patterns 
in the table below that lists numbers that are divisible by 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Do you see any patterns 
in the table below that lists numbers that are divisible by 11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:32pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;486&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Sum of odd numbered digits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Sum of even numbered digits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;5) You have numbers from 1 to 11, but not necessarily in that order. 
The product of the first nine is 441,760. The sum of the last two is 
19. What are the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;6) KenKen product cages in a puzzle have targets of 35, 80, 99, 96 
and 100. Which of these are divisible by 5? Which of these are divisible 
by 6? Which of these are divisible by 9? Which of these are divisible 
by 11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;7) The following numbers are divisible by 11: A343, B15060, C22701, 
D030. What A, B, C and D?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;8) 2313E is divisible by 6. What is E?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)  A number is divisible by 
8 if the number formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8. Which 
of the following numbers are divisible by 8: (a) 12,001, (b) 24,007,  
(c) 11,022, (d) 456,008, (e) 456,012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;10) If you double the last digit of a number and subtract it from 
the rest of the numbers and the answer is 0, or divisible by 7, then 
the number is divisible by 7. Use this rule to determine which of the 
following numbers are divisible by 7: (a) 842, (b) 231, (c) 7078.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;11) Reflect on the things you learnt in this exploration. Write some 
things you learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Solutions
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;1) Numbers divisible 
by 5 end in 5 or 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;2) The sum of the digits 
is a multiple of 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The sum of the digits is 
a multiple of 3 and the numbers end in an even number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4)  The difference between 
the sum of even numbered digits and odd numbered digits is a multiple  
of 11 or 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;5)  Looking at the sum of the last two numbers to be 19, we may conclude 
that 11 + 8 and 10 + 9 are two possibilities that would result in a 
sum of 19. We know that the product of the remaining numbers is 441,760. 
Let us examine if 11 is a factor of 441,760.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;Obviously, we can try 
to divide 441,760 by 11. There is an easier way to determine if 11 is 
a factor of 441760. This involves using a rule called ‘the divisibility 
rule of 11’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;Starting from the first 
digit, add all of the alternate digits to obtain Sum_odd. Next, add 
the remaining digits to obtain Sum_even. Find the difference between 
Sum_odd and Sum_even (Sum_odd - Sum_even or Sum_even - Sum_odd). If 
the difference turns out to be 0 or a multiple of 11, then the original 
number will be divisible by 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;Let us compute Sum_odd 
and Sum_even to see whether &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;441,760&lt;/span&gt; is divisible by 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;We obtain Sum_odd = 4 
+ 1 + 6 = 11 and Sum_even = 4 + 7 + 0 = 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;Therefore, Sum_odd - 
Sum_even = 0. Hence, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;441,760&lt;/span&gt; is divisible by 11. If 11 is among the first 9 numbers, 
it must not be in the last two numbers.  As we discussed earlier, 
the only two possibilities for the last two numbers are (11, 8) or (10, 
9).  Therefore, we can conclude that the numbers in the two-squares 
are 9 and 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;So, the procedure for 
checking divisibility by 11 is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;1. Add the odd-numbered digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;2. Add the even-numbered digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;3. Subtract the smaller of the two sums from the larger of the two 
sums. If the number you obtain is divisible by 11, then so is the original 
number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;6)  35, 80 and 100 are divisible by 5. 96 is divisible by 6. 99 is 
divisible by 9. 99 is divisible by 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;7)  A343 is divisible by 11. Therefore, the difference between (A + 
4) and 3 + 3 = 6 is a multiple of 11. If A + 4 = 6, then A = 2. With 
similar reasoning, we find that B is 1, C is 8 and D is 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;8)  2313E is divisible by 6. Therefore, E is even. In addition, as 
the sum of the digits has to be divisible by 3, 9 + E is divisible by 
3. Hence, E has to be 3, 6, or 9. As E is even, E has to be 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;9)  Only 456,008 is divisible by 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10)  Only 231 is divisible 
by 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;

===Exploration of Multiplication Tricks===
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasoning about KenKen product cages involves multiplication 
and division of a set of numbers. It is useful to learn a few tricks 
that allow us to multiply numbers quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
Exercises

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;210&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;2,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 28, 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;1800&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Solutions
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;1)  To look for patterns, look for similarities between entries in 
each row and for similarities between different columns. We observe 
that the product is the same as the middle number followed by 0. In 
general, if we have a product of a series of numbers that includes 2 
and 5, then do the following: (a) replace 2 and 5 by 10, (b) multiply 
the rest of the numbers (c) multiply the product by 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;Because multiplying by 10 can be done easily by 
adding a zero at the end of the number, this re-ordering allows us to 
do the multiplication faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;2) 120&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;3) 720&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;4) 180&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;5) 300&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;6)  To look for patterns, look for similarities between entries in 
each row and for similarities between different columns. We observe 
that the product is the same as the middle number followed by 00. In 
general, if we have a product of a series of numbers that include 4 
and 25, then do the following: (a) Replace 4 and 25 by 100. (b) Multiply 
the rest of the numbers (c) Multiply the product by 100. Because multiplying 
by 100 can be done easily by adding two zeros at the end of the number, 
this re-ordering allows us to do the multiplication faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more explorations regarding multiplication 
tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:upper-alpha&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Take 
  a few even numbers and compare following results: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
    product you obtain after multiplying by 5 &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
    result you obtain by dividing the number by 2 and then multiplying by 
    10. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:54pt&quot;&gt;Organize your results 
in a list. Are the results the same? Why? Which is an easier way to 
obtain to the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

===Exploration of Factor Pairs===
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining numbers that go in a two-square cage with 
a product target involves finding a factor pair, the product of which 
is the given target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure to find the factors of a given number 
is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Starting 
  with 1, divide each number from 1 to the maximum allowed in the puzzle 
  into the given number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:lower-alpha&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;If 
    the numbers divide exactly and there is no remainder, then you have 
    a pair of factors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;List 
    the divisor and the quotient of your division as a pair of factors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Keep 
  dividing until a factor pair repeats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Exercises

Solutions
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:77pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;408&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;70&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;147&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;88&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factor Pair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 / 1 = 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1, 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 / 2 = 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2, 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 / 3 = 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3, 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 / 4 = 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat pair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor pairs of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:77pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;408&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;70&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;147&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;88&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factor Pair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 / 1 = 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1, 20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 / 2 = 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2, 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not divisible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 / 4 = 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4, 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 / 5 = 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factor pairs of 20 are (1, 20), (2, 10) and (4, 
5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The factor pairs of 25 are (1, 25) and (5, 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) The factor pairs of 36 are (1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 
12), (4, 9) and (6, 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) The factor pairs of 49 are (1, 49) and (7, 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) The factor pairs of 50 are (1, 50), (2, 25) and 
(5, 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;7)  Try numbers between 1 and 10. We find that the numbers with odd 
number of factors are 1, 4 and 9. Look for patterns. These are square 
numbers. This is so because square numbers have one factor pair where 
both numbers are the same and other factor pairs with two different 
numbers. Numbers less than 100 with odd number of factors are 1, 4, 
9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.&lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt&quot;&gt;
===Exploration of Factor Triplets===
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procedure to find factor triplets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;First, 
  find all factor pairs of a given number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Now, 
  for each factor pair, find factor pairs of the second factor. Replace 
  this factor by the corresponding factor pairs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Remove 
  any duplicate factor triplets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;For 12, we have the following 
factor pairs (1) 1, 12 (2) 2, 6 (3) 3, 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;When we replace 12 by 
its factor pairs, we will obtain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;1, 1, 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;1, 2, 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;1, 3, 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;When we replace 6 by its 
factor pairs, we will obtain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;2, 1, 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;2, 2, 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;When we replace 4 by its 
factor pairs, we will obtain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;3, 1, 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;3, 2, 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;We remove duplicate instances, 
what we obtain is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;1, 1, 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;1, 2, 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;1, 3, 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:36pt&quot;&gt;2, 2, 3&lt;/p&gt;
EXERCISES
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Find all factors of 15, 45, and 36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:13pt&quot;&gt;To be sure that you found 
all of the factors, it would be useful to know how many factors a number 
has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Number of factors of 1 is 1. Number of factors 
of 10 is 4. Number of factors of 100 is 9. Number of factors of 1000 
is 16. Recognize the pattern. How many factors does 10,000 have? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Find all factor pairs and factor triplets of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Find all factor triplets of 12, 16, and 18.&lt;/p&gt;
SOLUTIONS
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;1)  Factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. Factors of 45 are 1, 5, 3, 15, 
9, and 45. Factors of 36 are 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 12, 9, 18, and 36.&lt;/p&gt;
2) 
 10,000 has 25 factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;3)  Factor pairs and factor triplets of 15 are (1, 15), (3, 5), (1, 
1, 15), (1, 3, 5)&lt;/p&gt;
4) 
 Factor triplets of 12 are (1, 1, 12), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 4), (2, 2, 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Factor triplets of 16 
are (1, 2, 8), (1, 1, 16), (1, 4, 4), (2, 2, 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Factor triplets of 18 
are (1, 1, 18), (1, 2, 9), (1, 3, 6), (2, 3, 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

===Exploration of Creating a Table===
&lt;p&gt;Relevant puzzles: Killer Sudoku,  KenKen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the following 3x3 KenKen puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1 A2 A3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B1 B2 B3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C1 C2 C3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A1 * B1 = 6 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Difference between A2 and A3 is 1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Difference between C1 and C2 is 1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; B2 + B3 + C3 = 7 &lt;/p&gt;

Figure what A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2 and C3 are.


&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;One may proceed to reason 
about this puzzle as follows. Numbers 2 and 3 would be the only ones 
that can go in 6x. The bottom left corner must have 1 as 2 and 3 go 
in the 6x cage in the same column. The bottom middle square must have 
2 because it is in a cage with target 1- and the bottom left square 
has 1. The bottom right corner must have 3 as the bottom left square 
is 1 and the bottom middle square is 2. As bottom right square is 3, 
remaining squares in the 7+ cage must add up to 4.  Therefore, 
the 7+ cage must have 3 and 1 as the middle and right square of the 
middle row. As 1, 2 and 3 must be in the middle row, 2 must be in the 
left square of the middle row. Now, we can conclude that the top row 
must have 3, 1 and 2 as left, middle and right squares of the top row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back and reflecting on a solution is often 
useful in obtaining further insights about a problem solving approach. 
In the above problem, it was helpful to know in the beginning that 6x 
cage has 2 and 3 even though we did not know the order. Often, it is 
useful to identify cages that have unique solutions. We would explore 
this further in this chapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, consider the following question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which two-square cages with target sums in a 20x20 
KenKen puzzle have unique solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you may be able to come up with one or two such 
cages, it is more difficult to be sure of all such cages. In general, 
if we have a difficult problem, it is useful to do exploration and obtain 
insights from explorations. Here, we will consider the following problem, 
which is a simpler version of the above-mentioned problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which two-square cages with target sums in a 4x4 KenKen 
puzzle have unique solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good strategy here is to make a table of the possible 
two-square cages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a table, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Identify the related quantities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Understand the relations between these quantities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Understand the relation between the results and these quantities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Understand the possible values these quantities can take and create 
  an ordered list of these values.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Begin with the first value of one quantity and create all possible 
  rows corresponding to this quantity by varying the values of other quantities 
  from low to high.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Once, you are done with creating all possible rows corresponding to 
  that possible value of the row, consider the next possible value of 
  the quantity and create corresponding rows. Continue until you are done 
  considering all possible values of this quantity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;For each of these rows in the table, compute results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Create a table of all possible sums of two different numbers where 
  each number can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The first column in the table should 
  be the smaller number and the second column should be the larger number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;In this table, identify sums for which there is a unique pair of numbers 
  that can be added to obtain the target sum.&lt;/li&gt;

  be the larger number and the second column should be the smaller number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;In the table you created in the previous question, identify sums for

  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Identify patterns in the following table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

SOLUTIONS
&lt;p&gt;1) Let us use the procedure described in this chapter 
to create a table. Our two columns can be the smaller of the two numbers 
and the larger of the two numbers.  We know that the result of 
interest is the sum of these quantities. Possible values these numbers 
can take are 1, 2, 3, and 4. A list is [1, 2, 3, 4] We can start with 
the smaller number being 1 and consider the possibilities (1, 2), (1, 
3) and (1, 4). Then, we can consider the possibility of the smaller 
number being 2. Here, we will consider the possibilities (2, 3) and 
(2, 4). Finally, we consider the smaller number being 3 and compute 
the sum to be 7.  Now, we compute the sums of quantities in each 
row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:41pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;468&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;126&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller 
  Number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;117&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;108&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;2) 
Examining the table for a 4x4 KenKen, we can find that 3+, 4+, 6+

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;5)  Left for student to create the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;6)

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;7)  Left for student to create the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;8) 
 Examining the table for a 7x7 KenKen, we can find that 3+, 4+, 12+ 
and 13+ are the targets with a single pair of numbers associated with 
targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)  Let us examine patterns in the following table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial'&quot;&gt; ,4, 8, 
  9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;6x6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;3,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial'&quot;&gt; 4,10, 
  11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;7x7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;3,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial'&quot;&gt; 4, 12, 
  13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Do you see a pattern here 
in the numbers? &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One strategy to look for patterns is to see what is common between 
successive rows.&lt;/span&gt; First, 3 and 4 are common to all of these. Now, 
let us examine the largest target numbers in these rows: 7, 9, 11, 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When looking for a pattern, another strategy is to look for differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Differences between successive 
numbers here turn out to be two. Aha! So, these numbers are all increasing 
by two. There are two kinds of patterns: Patterns relating successive 
numbers and patterns relating entries in two columns. Another possible 
pattern between two types of quantities is that one is a multiple of 
another quantity. Here, we can try doubling numbers in the first column 
and we find that results are close to what we have in the second column, 
but fall short by one. What we notice is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;7 = 2 * 4 - 1 (* means 
‘multiplied by’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;9 = 2* 5 - 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;11 = 2 * 6 -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;13 = 2 * 7 -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;We can generalize this 
as the following hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;We can only create one 
pair of numbers that can create a sum of 2 * n - 1 in an n * n KenKen 
puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial Bold','Arial';font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Often, it is a good idea to verify a given hypothesis 
with additional examples.&lt;/span&gt; Here, if we can examine sums in 8x8 
and 9x9 KenKen puzzles, we find that this hypothesis is indeed true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Now, let us examine the 
pair of numbers that result in the largest possible unique sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:32pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;528&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;63&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzle 
  size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;333&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Largest 
  sum target with unique solution and associated numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4x4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 = 3 + 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5x5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 = 4 + 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;6x6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 = 5 + 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;7x7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 = 6 + 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Looking at the differences 
between successive rows, we will find that numbers increase by 1 from 
one row to the next row. Furthermore, the numbers are n and n - 1 for 
an n * n KenKen puzzle. Now, let us see if we can create a logical 
explanation why a target 2n - 1 will have a unique solution. If one 
of the two numbers is less than (n - 1), then the other number will 
have to be larger than n for the sum to be 2n - 1. However, we can’t 
use a number larger than n in the sum. Therefore, we can’t have one 
of the numbers be smaller than (n - 1). In addition, we can’t use 
the numbers larger than n. Therefore, the only numbers we can use to 
create a sum of 2n - 1 are n and n -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Similarly, one can notice 
that there is a pattern between the second largest target number we 
have identified so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:27pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;534&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;76&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzle &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;324&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second largest 
  target&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; with unique solution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;4x4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;5x5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;6x6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;7x7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent:36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Can you identify a pattern 
here? Can you provide a logical explanation for the pattern you observe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Again, when looking for 
a pattern, a possible strategy is to look for differences. Differences 
between successive numbers here turn out to be two. Therefore, these 
numbers are all increasing by two. Another pattern we notice is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;7 = 2 * 4 - 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;9 = 2* 5 - 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;11 = 2 * 6 - 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;13 = 2 * 7 - 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Our observation here is 
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;We can only create one 
pair of numbers that can create a sum of 2 * n - 2 in an n * n KenKen 
puzzle. Overall, the target sums n * n KenKen puzzle with unique solutions 
are 3, 4, 2n - 2 and 2n -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;10) 3, 
4, 18, 19 are target sums in a 10 x 10 KenKen puzzle where there are 
unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;11) 3, 
4, 20, 21 are target sums in an 11 x 11 KenKen puzzle where there 
are unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;12) 3, 
4, 22, 23 are target sums in a 12 x 12 KenKen puzzle where there are 
unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;13) 3, 
4, 24, 25 are target sums in a 13 x 13 KenKen puzzle where there are 
unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;14) 3, 
4, 26, 27 are target sums in a 14 x 14 KenKen puzzle where there are 
unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;15) In 
a 5x5 KenKen, targets in three-square linear row cages with unique 
sums are 6, 7, 11, and 12. Those in a 6x6 KenKen are 6, 7, 14, and 
15. Those in a 7x7 KenKen are 6, 7, 17, and 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;16) The 
pattern: the unique target sums are 6, 7, and 3n - 4 and 3n - 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;17) The 
targets in a 12x12 KenKen with unique sums are 6, 7, 32, and 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;18) 4, 
5, 10, 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;19) 4, 
5, 13, 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;20) 4, 
5, 16, 17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;21) 4, 
5, 19, 20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;22) An 
n x n KenKen puzzle with three-square T-targets of 4, 5, and 3n - 
1, 3n - 2 will have unique solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;23) 4, 
5, 34, 35 are the target sums in three-square T-cages that have unique 
solutions in a 12x12 KenKen. 4, 5, 37, 38 are the target sums in three-square 
T-cages that have unique solutions in a 13x13 KenKen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;24) Those 
are prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;25) In 
a 4x4 KenKen, the target is 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;26) In 
a 5x5 KenKen, the target is 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;27) In 
a 6x6 KenKen, the target is 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;28) In 
an n x n KenKen, the target is n - 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;29) 4 
and 3 are division target numbers in a 4x4 KenKen for which there 
is a unique solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;30) 5, 
4, and 3 are division target numbers in a 5x5 KenKen for which there 
is a unique solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;31) 6, 
5, and 4 are division target numbers in a 6x6 KenKen for which there 
is a unique solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;32) For 
an n x n KenKen puzzle, all numbers higher than n/2 and less than 
or equal to n are division target numbers for which there is a unique 
solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;33) The 
second columns are all prime numbers smaller than the size of the KenKen 
puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;34) These 
numbers are higher than the maximum number allowed in any cage and these 
are products of two prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:24pt&quot;&gt;

===Exploration of Logical Reasoning===
&lt;p&gt;Relevant puzzles: Sudoku, Sudoku variants, KenKen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a situation, one can use logical reasoning to 
identify the following: What must be true? What must not be true? What 
may or may not be true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, consider the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-square row cage is a cage of the kind shown 
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-square row cage in a 6x6 KenKen puzzle has 
13+ as a target. Can you say which numbers must be in the cage and which 
numbers must not be there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 may or may not be 
there. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 + 4 + 3 = 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 + 5 + 2 = 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an example of a target sum with 5 as one of 
the numbers in the cage and we have an example of a target sum without 
5 as one of the numbers. Therefore, 5 may or may not be there. Now, 
we will discuss one possible method that allows us to conclude that 
some number must be there or some number must not be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;Example 1 of 
Proof by contradiction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We claim that 6 must be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove this, we will show what happens if we assume 
that 6 is not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 6 is not there, the maximum sum possible with three 
numbers is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the target sum is larger than 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we have an impossible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we assumed must be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, 6 must be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;Example 2 of 
Proof by contradiction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We claim that 1 must not be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove this, we will show what happens if we assume 
that 1 is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 1 is there, the largest numbers among the remaining 
numbers would be 6 and 5. Then, the maximum sum possible with three 
numbers is 6 + 5 + 1 = 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the target is larger than 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we have an impossible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we assumed must be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, 1 must not be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;The general procedure for proof by contradiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to show that X is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show this, we will show what happens if we assume 
that X is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If X is not true, logical reasoning would lead to 
an impossible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, what we assumed must be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, X must be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of reasoning is called “proof by contradiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
EXERCISES
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following challenge problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a five-square row cage in a 12 x 12 KenKen 
with a target sum of 17. What can we conclude about possible numbers 
in the cage? Which numbers must be there? Which numbers must not be 
there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do an exploratory study to understand these 
types of problems so that we can progress on this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;1) 
 What can you say about possible numbers in a three-square row cage in 
6x6 KenKen for target sums from 6 to 15?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;2) 
 For a three square row cage target sum of 8 in a 20x20 KenKen puzzle, 
what is the largest possible number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;3) 
 For a three square row cage a target sum of 49 in a 20x20 KenKen, 
what is the smallest possible number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;4) 
 For a four-square row cage with a target sum 35 in an 11x11 KenKen, 
what is the smallest possible number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;5) 
 For a four-square row cage with a target sum 11 in a 20x20 KenKen, 
what is the largest possible number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;6) 
 What can you say about possible numbers in a three-square row cage in 
a 12x12 KenKen for target sums of: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 29, 30, 31, 32, 
33? Which numbers must be there? Which number can’t be there? Which 
numbers may be there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) Identify patterns in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:18pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;373&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;117&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers 
  allowed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;162&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The m&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;aximum sum possible &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial'&quot;&gt;with&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 
  three different numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 2, 3, 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 2, 3, 4, 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;7)  Here are some strategies to look for differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Compare successive rows 
and look for similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Compare successive rows 
and look for differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Look at differences between 
successive numbers and look for patterns in the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Patterns in the table 
include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  sums are all multiples of three.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  numbers allowed increase by one more number from one row to the next 
  row.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  sums increase by three in each successive row.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  maximum sum is the sum of the largest three numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  maximum sum is three x ( the largest number -   3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;The 
  maximum sum is three times the second largest number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;8)  Given the pattern we observed in the previous question’s analysis, 
we would expect that the maximum possible sum with the numbers from 
1 to 100 would be 297. The reason for that is the largest possible sum 
would be the largest three numbers, which would be 98, 99, and 100. 
Therefore, this sum would be 98 + 99 + 100 = 297.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;9)  Here are some strategies to look for differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Compare successive rows 
and look for similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Compare successive rows 
and look for differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Look at differences between 
successive numbers and look for patterns in differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Patterns in the table 
include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The sums are all multiples 
of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The numbers allowed increase 
by one more number from one row to the next row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The sums increase by three 
in each successive row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The minimum sum is the 
sum of the smallest three numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The minimum sum is three 
times the smallest number + 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The minimum sum is three 
times the second smallest number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;10) 36 is the minimum possible sum with three different numbers that 
are 11 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;11) 
63 is the minimum possible sum with three different numbers that are 
20 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;12) 
303 is the minimum possible sum with three different numbers that are 
100 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;13)  5 is the largest possible number in a three-square row cage in 
a 10x10 KenKen with target 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;14) 
 6 is the largest possible number in a three-square row cage in a 10x10 
KenKen with target 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;15) 
 Patterns include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;Numbers in successive 
columns increase by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;One strategy is to look 
at the differences between the values of two columns. Here, we find 
that the difference is always three. Therefore, another relevant pattern 
is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;The maximum possible number 
is the target sum minus three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;A way to explain this 
pattern is as follows. When we use the maximum possible number, the 
sum of the remaining two numbers would be the smallest possible sum. 
The minimum sum we can create with two different numbers would be the 
sum of 1 and 2, which is 3. Therefore, the maximum possible number that 
can be used in the cage is a target sum of minus three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;16) 
3 is the smallest possible number in a three-cage in a 10x10 KenKen 
if the target sum is 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;17) 
4 is the smallest possible number in a three-cage in a 10x10 KenKen 
if the target sum is 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;18) 
5 is the smallest possible number in a three-cage in a 10x10 KenKen 
if the target sum is 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;19) 
6 is the smallest possible number in a three-cage in a 10x10 KenKen 
if the target sum is 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;20) 
Pattern: The smallest possible number = Target sum - 19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;21) 
Pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;The size of the puzzle 
reduces by 1 in successive columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;The minimum number increases 
by 1 in successive columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;For a three-cage target 
sum of x in an m * m KenKen, the smallest possible number is x - m 
- (m - 1) if this number is positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;22)  Using the pattern above, 
we would conclude that it is 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;23) 
 For a four-square linear cage with a target sum of 11, 5 is the largest 
possible number. The largest possible number would correspond to the 
smallest sum created by the remaining three numbers. The smallest sum 
three numbers can create would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Hence, the largest 
possible number would be 11 - 6 = 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;24) 
 For a four-square linear cage with a target sum of 12, 6 is the largest 
possible number. Give your reasoning. The largest possible number would 
correspond to the smallest sum created by the remaining three numbers. 
The smallest sum that three numbers would create would be 1 + 2 + 3 
= 6. Hence, the largest possible number would be 12 - 6 = 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;25) For 
a four-square linear cage with a target sum of 13, 7 is the largest 
possible number. Give your reasoning. The largest possible number would 
correspond to the smallest sum created by the remaining three numbers. 
The smallest sum three numbers would create would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 
Hence, the largest possible number would be 13 - 6 = 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;26) 
Identify patterns in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:27pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;447&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;212&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Target sum&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; in linear four-square cage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;24&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;24&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;24&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Largest&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; possible number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;The 
largest possible number is T - 6 where T is the target sum in a linear 
four-square cage. This pattern can be explained as follows. The largest 
possible number would correspond to the smallest sum created by the 
remaining three numbers. The smallest sum three numbers can create would 
be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Hence, the largest possible number would be T - 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;27) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 34 in an 11x11, 4 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;28) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 35 in an 11x11, 5 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;29) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 36 in an 11x11, 6 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;30) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 37 in an 11x11, 7 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;31) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 34 in a 12x12, 1 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;32) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 35 in a 12x12, 2 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;33) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 36 in a 12x12, 3 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;34) 
For a four-square row cage with a target sum of 37 in a 12x12, 4 is 
the smallest possible number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;35) 
There are various patterns in the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;The smallest possible 
number = target - 3 * (size -1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:27pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;516&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;

  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;41&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;41&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smallest &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial'&quot;&gt;p&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;ossible 
  number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;This can also be put in 
the following form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;The smallest possible 
number is T - L if L is the largest sum that can be made with three 
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

SOLUTIONS
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;1) For certain type of puzzles, a graphical representation helps in 
understanding the description of clues. In the puzzle described in question 
1, a representation that captures all associations between people and 
seats is helpful. This type of representation is shown below. This is 
called a logic grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:23pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;258&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;45&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;Now let us examine how 
we interpret each clue using such a logic chart. We have been told that 
Mr. Yao sits in seat A. As you read each clue, cross out the boxes that 
are not consistent with the clue. For instance, a sentence that tells 
you Mr. Yao sits in A allows you to determine he doesn’t sit in seats 
B or C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;258&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;Once you’ve determined 
that Mr. Yao sits in seat A; then you can eliminate the possibility 
of sitting in seat A for any other person in the problem. As you can 
see, this really narrows down the options and helps you work toward 
a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the chart would like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;264&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;55&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;52&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;Now, let us represent the 
second clue in this table. Max does not sit in seat B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;264&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;55&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;52&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;If we know that Max sits 
in one of three seats and we have inferred that he can’t be sitting 
in two of the three seats, then Max must be sitting in the remaining 
seat. So, in this case, we can infer that Max is sitting in seat C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;266&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;55&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;52&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;51&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt&quot;&gt;If 
we know that Max is sitting in seat C, then Yao or Naz can’t be sitting 
in seat C. Let’s add this information to our logic chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;284&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;45&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;55&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt&quot;&gt;If 
we know that Yao sits in one of three seats and we have inferred that 
he can’t be sitting in two of the three seats, then Naz must be sitting 
in the remaining seat. Therefore, in this case, we can infer that Naz 
is sitting in seat B. Now, let us add this information to our logic 
chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;272&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;55&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;57&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;55&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;seat&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;es&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;Now, we have filled all 
of the entries in our logic chart with a ‘Yes’ or an ‘X’. Therefore, 
we have solved the puzzle. We know that Max sits in seat C. Yao sits 
in seat A and Naz sits in seat B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;2)  Let us examine the pairs of numbers between 1 and 6 that satisfy 
the constraint 2/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:28pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;296&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;???&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;???&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;???&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;???&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;text-align:center;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman','Arial';font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:24pt&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td height=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;We find that the pairs 
(6, 3), (4, 2) and (2, 1) can all satisfy the constraint 2/. Thus, any 
of the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 can be the third or fourth square in 
the bottom row. Now, let us examine which triples can satisfy the constraint 
18x. We find that &lt;3, 2, 3&gt; and &lt;6, 3, 1&gt; can satisfy the 
constraint 18x. Thus, any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 6 can be the first 
or second square of the bottom row. Similarly, &lt;5, 3, 1&gt; can satisfy 
the constrain 15x. Thus, the numbers, 1, 3, 5 can potentially be in 
the fifth or sixth square in the bottom row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our clues for the logic puzzle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;523&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Cage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;57&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;18x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;15x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt&quot;&gt;As 
4 must be in one of the squares and only the 2/ cage lists it as a possibility, 
we can conclude that 4 must be the 2/ cage. Hence, the 2/ cage must 
have 2 and 4 as numbers. We can now revise the logic chart as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;522&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Cage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;56&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;18x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;15x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;As 6 must be in one of 
the squares and only the 18x cage lists it as a possibility, we can 
conclude that 6 must be in the 18x cage. Therefore, other numbers in 
18x must be 6, 3 and 1. We can now revise the logic chart as below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;522&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Cage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;57&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;18x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial'&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;2/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;15x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;From this, we can conclude 
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2/ cage has 2 and 4. The 18x cage has 1, 3 and 
6. The 15x cage has 1, 3 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
===Exploration of Sum and Difference===
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a list of ten numbers. In this list, the numbers 
1 to 10 each occur exactly once, but not necessarily in the increasing 
order. The first eight numbers add up to 45. The difference between 
the last two is 2. What are the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy that most students try to solve this problem 
is ‘guess and check’. For example, they may come up with a combination 
such as (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and find that the difference between the 
remaining two numbers is not 2. It may take a long time to come up with 
the solution to this problem using the guess and check strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may believe that we are stuck. We need some insights 
to be able to make progress on the problem. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial Bold','Arial';font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;A strategy in such situations is to simplify the 
problem or to consider a similar problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can consider understanding similar situations in 
6x6 puzzles. Consider the following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise 1: Look at specific examples in Figure 1 
and identify any patterns in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt&quot;&gt;Solution 
to exercise 1: There are various patterns one may observe. These examples 
including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style:disc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;As the fifth number increases by 1, the target sum for the first cage 
  decreases by 1 as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;As the sixth number increases by 1, the target sum for the first cage 
  decreases by 1 as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;The target sum of the first cage = 21 - a - b if a and b are the fifth 
  and sixth numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;The sum of the fifth and sixth numbers = 21 – the target sum of 
  the first cage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;When a number in the first cage increases by 1 and other numbers in 
  that cage remain the same, a number in the second cage decreases by 
  1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;When a number in the first cage increases by 1 and other numbers in 
  that cage remain the same, the target sum for that cage increases by 
  1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;If we increase a number in the first cage by 1, the target sum for 
  the cage increases by 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Exercise 2: Can we explain 
why the sum of the fifth and sixth numbers equals the difference between 
21 and the target sum of the first cage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution to exercise 2: The pattern about the sum 
of the last two numbers allows inferring the sum of the last two numbers. 
Sometimes, a number relationship becomes clearer when we develop a mathematical 
model. Suppose the target for a sum cage is a and the sum of the rest 
of the numbers outside the cage is b. We also know that all of the numbers 
in the row are 1 to 6. Therefore, all numbers together will add up to 
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a + b = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a mathematical model for reasoning about numbers 
in the row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be manipulated mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we can write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 21 - a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we know the value of a, we can determine the 
value of b as well by solving this equation. If we know b, we know an 
additional constraint that the last two numbers would add up to b. In 
some problems, this would allow us to make further inferences. Now consider 
the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the last two numbers are x and y. Then the 
-2 target tells us that x - y = 2. Furthermore, based on what we discussed 
earlier, the last two numbers would add to 4. In addition, we have been 
told that the difference between them is 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x - y = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x + y = 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we have created a mathematical model here. 
Creating such a model would allow us to understand strategies to solve 
this type of problems that will recur in different forms in KenKen 
puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need a procedure to determine the two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the problem involves two unknown variables, one 
strategy would be guess and check. In this case, you will probably obtain 
the answer after making a few guesses. As the sum of x and y is 4, each 
of these can, at most, be 4. One can create a table listing possible 
values of x and y and their corresponding sums. Part of such a table 
is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;307&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;41&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;x&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;22&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;y&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;x&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; + y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;x&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;- y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;One can then identify values 
in the table for which the sum of the two numbers is 4 and the difference 
between the two numbers is 2. Matching numbers are x = 3 and y =1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let us examine additional approaches to solve 
this problem. Sometimes, when a solution to a problem is not obvious, 
we can represent the problem information in a diagram and then the solution 
becomes obvious. Below is one such representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, we may be able to see that the difference 
between x + y and x - y is 2y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, 2y = 4 - 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, 2y = 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividing both sides by two, we obtain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, we have the value of y, we can substitute it 
in the equation x + y = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will give us x + 1 = 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, 
we will obtain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x + 1 - 1 = 4 - 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, x = 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we provide a simple three-step procedure to 
determine the numbers with a sum of a and a difference of b&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Let x and y be the two numbers. Calculate y to be (a - b) / 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Substitute the value of y in the equation x + y = a.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Simplify this equation to calculate the value of x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;This is because (x + y) 
+ (x - y) = 2x = a + b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Similarly, (x + y) - (x 
- y) = 2y = a – b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
EXERCISES
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of the problems in the table below, find 
x and y. Solve this problem using two methods: drawing a diagram and 
using the three-step procedure described in the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;427&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;104&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem 
  Number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;x&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; + y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;x&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; -y &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;72&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is x?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;67&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is y?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;140&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure for determining two rightmost numbers 
in a row of the kind above in a KenKen puzzle where the rightmost 
cage has a subtraction target n consisting of two-squares and the remaining 
squares are in a cage with target sum m:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Add all numbers allowed in the KenKen puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Calculate the sum of the two rightmost numbers to be the difference 
  between the result in step (1) and m.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;The difference between the two rightmost numbers is n.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt;line-height:13pt&quot;&gt;Now, determine the numbers using the procedure described above for 
  determining numbers the sum and difference of which is given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider the problem we discussed earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a list of ten numbers. In this list, the numbers 
1 to 10 each occur exactly once, but not necessarily in increasing order. 
The first eight numbers add up to 45. The difference between the last 
two is 2. What are the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding all of the numbers from 1 to 10, we obtain 
55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the first eight numbers add up to 45, the 
sum of the rightmost numbers will be 55 - 45 = 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the rightmost two numbers is 
2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, using the procedure for finding numbers from 
the sum and difference, we can determine the numbers to be 6 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: 6 and 4&lt;/p&gt;

===Exploration of Product and Difference===
&lt;/p&gt;
Exercises
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Consider the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a list of eight numbers. In this list, the 
numbers 1 to 8 each occur exactly once, but not necessarily in increasing 
order. The product of the first six numbers is 720. The difference between 
the last two numbers is 1. What are the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt to solve the problem with the guess and check 
strategy where you guess the numbers. If you obtain an answer, write 
it down. Try to identify the difficulties in using the guess and check 
strategy on this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;2) Each 
row in the table below lists properties of a different list of 6 numbers 
consisting of numbers from 1 to 6 in different orders. What patterns 
do you observe in the table?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:27pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;438&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;4) 
 We have a list of six numbers from 1 to 6, but not necessarily in that 
order. The product of first four numbers is 24. We are trying to determine 
the product of the last two numbers. We know that the product of all 
six numbers = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 720. Suppose the product of the 
last two numbers is p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;720 = the product of all 
six numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Therefore, 720 = the product 
of the first four numbers multiplied by the product of the last two 
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Therefore, we determine 
that 720 = 24 x p. From this, determine the value of p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;5) We have been given two mystery numbers x and y that can be 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5 or 6. We have been told:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;x - y = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;x * y = 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Can you determine x and 
y from this information? One possible method to do this is to create 
a table with possible values of x and y and check whether given constraints 
are true.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15) Now, let us consider the first problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:27pt&quot;&gt;I have a list of 8 numbers. 
In this list, the numbers 1 to 8 each occur exactly once, but not necessarily 
in increasing order. The product of the first six numbers is 720. The 
difference between the last two numbers is 1. What are the last two 
numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) What is the product of all of the numbers from 
1 to 8?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) If 720 * a = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8, then 
what is a?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;(c) 
If the difference between two numbers is 1 and their product is given 
by the answer to the previous question, then what is the sum of the 
two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;(d) 
If the sum of the numbers is given by the answer to the previous question 
and the difference between the two numbers is 1, then what are the two 
numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:31pt&quot;&gt;16) Can 
you determine what two numbers are in the first cage given the difference 
between the first two numbers and the product of the last four numbers 
in the next table? Each row corresponds to a different problem and has 
a different solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:36pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;523&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;113&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difference 
  between&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; first two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;76&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product of 
  last &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;four&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;108&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller 
  number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;144&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;360&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;120&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;72&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;180&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;60&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;48&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;120&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;90&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17) Look back and identify some things you learnt 
from this exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

SOLUTIONS
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;1. A strategy that most students use on this problem is guess and check. 
While this strategy can lead to a solution, it is a time-consuming strategy 
that involves a lot of computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;2. There 
are various patterns one may observe in these examples including the 
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;As the last two numbers 
become smaller, the product of the first four increases. The product 
of the last two numbers and the first four numbers is always 720.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;3. There 
are various patterns one may observe in these examples including the 
following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;If the fifth number is 
a and it is replaced by 1, the product of the first four is multiplied 
by a. The product of the last two numbers and the first four numbers 
is always 720.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;4. p

may be stuck. However, exploring similar but simpler problem situations 
can provide us insights that helps to solve the problem. Though guess 
and check is one possible strategy that can be used for this problem, 
we learnt another way to solve the problem involving sums and differences 
of numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
===Exploration of Sum and Division===
&lt;/p&gt;
EXERCISES
&lt;p&gt;1) Consider the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a list of ten numbers. In this list, the numbers 
1 to 10 each occur exactly once, but not necessarily in increasing order. 
The sum of the first eight numbers is 46. The ratio of the last two 
numbers is 2. What are the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt to solve the problem with the guess and check 
strategy where you guess the numbers. If you obtain an answer, write 
it down. Try to identify the difficulties in using the guess and check 
strategy on this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Solve the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;a. What is the sum of 
the numbers from 1 to 10?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;b. If the first eight 
numbers add to 46, what is the sum of the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;3) 
 Create a table where the first column values vary from 1 to 4, the second 
column’s value is twice as much as the first column’s value, the 
third column’s value is the sum of the first two column’s values, 
and the fourth column’s value is the second column’s value divided 
by the first column’s value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) If the sum of two numbers is 9 and their ratio 
is 2, what are the two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;5) 
 Now, let us practice our skills on the following problems about determining 
unknown numbers from their sum and product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;Each row in the table 
below is a different problem. Determine the two unknown numbers in each 
case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) Can you discover a pattern in the solutions to 
the previous problem?&lt;/p&gt;
SOLUTIONS
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;1) 
A strategy that most students use on this problem is guess and check. 
While this strategy can lead to a solution, it is a time-consuming strategy 
that involves a lot of computation. Because it involves a lot of computation, 
this strategy is error-prone as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;2) 
The sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is 55. If the last two numbers add 
to a, then we can write it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;The sum of the first eight 
numbers + the sum of all pairs of numbers = the sum of all numbers that 
equal 55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;We know that the sum of 
the first eight numbers is 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;So, 46 + a = 55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;We can simplify this by 
subtracting 46 from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;46 + a - 46 = 55 – 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt; a + 0 = 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:18pt&quot;&gt;Hence, a must be 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top:12pt&quot;&gt;4) Suppose, the smaller 
of the last two numbers is a. As the ratio of two numbers is 2, then 
the two numbers are a and 2a. As we know the sum of the two numbers 
is 9, we can write as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;a + 2 a = 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;To determine what a is, 
let us realize that a + 2a should be 3a. Then, we can write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;3a = 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;So, a = 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:22pt&quot;&gt;As a = 3, the last two 
numbers are 3 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) The smaller number = (45 - sum) / (1 + ratio)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:13pt&quot;&gt;Below, we develop a formula 
to determine the numbers where the ratio of two numbers is r&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and the sum of two numbers is b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:13pt&quot;&gt;Let the two numbers be 
a and r * a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:13pt&quot;&gt;We can write a + r * a 
= b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:13pt&quot;&gt;Solving this, we will 
obtain a = b / (1 + r).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:13pt&quot;&gt;Now, we know one number 
to be a. The second number would be r * a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom:10pt&quot;&gt;(1) As x/y = 2, x is double of y. We will create a table of possible 
values of x and y where x is double of y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:23pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;

increases and y increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;The product 
of the ratio and the product is the square of x. The product divided 
by the ratio is the square of y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;I 
  have four numbers: 2, 3, 4 and 6. In how many ways can I put these in 
  a row of four squares?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;Consider 
  two 2 square cages in the first row of a 6x6 KenKen. Each number from 
  {2, 3, 4, 6} can occur at most once in these cages as 1 and 5 have already 
  been assigned to the remaining squares in the row. One cage has a target 
  of 12x. The other cage has a target of 1-. Which numbers are in the 
  1- cage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Solutions
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style:decimal&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;There 
  are 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ways to put in the numbers in four squares.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li style=&quot;margin-left:0pt&quot;&gt;There 
  are two possibilities (C1: 2, 6 C2: 3, 4) corresponding to a cage with 
  a 12x target. There are two possibilities (B1: 2, 3 B2:3, 4) corresponding 
  to the cage with a target of 1-. Considering all possible cases together, 
  there is only one possibility that is consistent with the target numbers. 
  This corresponds to C2 and B2: 2 and 6 in a 12x cage in addition to 
  3 and 4 in a 1- cage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Exploration of Working Backward===
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a list of ten numbers. In this list, the numbers 
1 to 10 each occur exactly once, but not necessarily in increasing order. 
The sum of the first seven numbers is 39. The eighth number is 7. The 
ratio of the last two numbers is 2. What are the last two numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the smaller of the numbers involved in the 
ratio is a.  Now, numbers from 1 to 10 add up to 55. So, if I begin 
with a, add twice of the number to it, then add 39 to it and finally 
add 7 more to it, the result will be 55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy you can use here is to work backward. 
Let us describe what we described as a diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work backward, we try to determine C first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As C + 7 = 55 and the inverse operation is C = 55 
- 7 = 48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we will try to determine B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As B + 39 = 48 and the inverse operation of is B = 
48-39 = 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will try to determine A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As A multiplied by 3 is 9 and the inverse operation 
of multiplication is division, A is 9 divided by 3 = 3.&lt;/p&gt;

===Exploration of Arithmetic Sequence===
&lt;p&gt; Relevant puzzles: Killer Sudoku, KenKen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of the previous explorations (sum difference), 
we saw that it is useful to know the sum of numbers from 1 to the maximum 
number allowed in the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
Exercises
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Look for patterns in the following table that 
lists a set of numbers in the first row and sum of these numbers in 
the second row. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:23pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;541&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;51&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1 to 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;36&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;45&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
SOLUTIONS
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) A good strategy to look for patterns is to examine 
the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:23pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;510&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;65&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diff&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;erence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;37&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diff&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;erence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;36&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;45&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1,&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;1&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;–10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another rule to remember is: When second level differences 
are constant, numbers are related to the square of n * n where n is 
the position of the number in the sequence. So, let’s examine these 
by looking for patterns in the following table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:23pt;text-align:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;529&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;62&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;42&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;31&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;n&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; x n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;36&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;49&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;64&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;81&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;S&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Arial';font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;um&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;36&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;45&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;55&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;After a little 
experimenting, we would find that the underlying pattern is the sum 
= (n x n + n) / 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;Let us examine 
the sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;1+ 2 + 3 … 
+ 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;One way to 
obtain the answer to this sum is to use the formula mentioned above 
(20 x 20 + 20) / 2 = 210.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;Another method 
is to pair up the first number and the last number, the second number 
and the second to last number and so on. In each case, the sum turns 
out to be 21. Now, let us determine how many pairs of numbers there 
are. There are ten such pairs. Hence, the sum would be 21 x 10 = 210.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;In an arithmetic 
sequence, the difference between one term and the next is a constant. 
For example, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25. In general, you could 
write an arithmetic sequence like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;{a, a + d, 
a + 2d, a + 3d, ... }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;• a is the 
first term, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;• d is the 
difference between the terms (called the “common difference”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;Consider the 
following problem about an arithmetic sequence: Find the sum of 1 + 
3 + 5 + … 49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;Here, we can 
pair up the first number and the last number, the second number and 
the second to last number and so on. We have twelve such pairs all adding 
up to 50. The number in the middle is 25 by itself. So, the total would 
be 12 x 50 + 25 = 625.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;A formula 
for arithmetic sequence is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20pt&quot;&gt;a + (a + d) 
+ (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + ...(a + (n - 1) d) = n/ 2 (a + a + (n - 1) d).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== History of the Cell Phone ==
=== Birth of Wireless Communication ===
In the latter half of the 19th century, two major innovations in communication technology occurred.  The first, made in 1876, was the invention of the wire-based telephone by Alexander Graham Bell.  Near instantaneous voice communication over long distances became possible, but only between points on a fixed infrastructure.  Roughly one decade later in 1887, &quot;German scientist Heinrich Hertz deduced the existence of wireless waves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Jr., James B.  ''Wireless Nation: The Frenzied Launch of the Cellular Revolution in America.'' Perseus Publishing, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;   Signal transmission through the air became a possibility.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the young scientist Guglielmo Marconi began putting the two together.  By 1986 he had patented a system for short-range wireless communication using telegraph signals.  In 1901 he successfully transmitted a Morse code signal across the Atlantic ocean using wireless radio signals proving the possibilities for long-range wireless communication.  At roughly the same time, Reginald Fessenden was adding audio to wireless transmissions for the first time.

Initially, these systems were adopted by maritime and aviation modes to overcome the difficulty of communicating between ship or plane and ground.  Into the early decades of the 20th century the military and police of the United States also caught on to wireless communication.  Motorola introduced the Handie-Talkie and Walkie-Talkie to provide real-time communication on the battlefield.  In the years after Lee de Forest first communicated with an automobile (1906), Police cars were also kitted with one- or two-way radios to communicate with their dispatch officers and more efficiently protect and serve.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbock, Dan. ''The Nokia Revolution: The Story of an Extraordinary Company that Transformed an Industry.'' AMACOM, 2001. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these early wireless communications devices were large, bulky, and expensive which kept them out of the hands of the general public.  In 1947, the famed Bell Labs made a breakthrough that would change wireless technology forever.  The transistor, a simple amplifier/switch component vital to modern electronics, greatly improved the portability and reliability of wireless communication against the older vacuum tube technology.

Through the early 1970s, wireless communication was primarily limited to the wealthy (who could afford car phones and the expensive subscription fees for operation) and amateur users within the Citizen Band (CB).  Ham radio was extremely popular due to the relatively low cost of entry in both training and equipment.  CB became a part of popular culture through both film and song.

=== Wireless Telephones ===
Wireless communication was severely limited in terms of concurrent users.  &quot;As late as 1981 [...] only twenty-four people in all of New York City could be on their mobile phones at once.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murray Jr., James B.  ''Wireless Nation: The Frenzied Launch of the Cellular Revolution in America.'' Perseus Publishing, 2001. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  To solve this issue, cellular technology was developed.  Instead of using high-powered, tall transmitters, cellular uses many smaller, low-powered transmitters.  In this way, the geographic region covered by the towers is split into smaller areas that can provide service for several 10s or 100s of individuals simultaneously.

The first real tests began in the late 1970s in Chicago and the Washington D.C./Baltimore areas.  AT&amp;T and Motorola were granted the operation of the systems to prove the potential of cellular phones.  At the time, there was skepticism concerning the potential within the cell phone market.  A 1980 study by AT&amp;T estimated a national subscriber base of only 900,000 by the year 2000 leading AT&amp;T executives to largely ignore wireless communication.

Others were more optimistic.  In 1983 the Federal Communications Commission began opening wireless frequencies for businesses to operate cellular phone services.  The entire nation was broken into segments based on city population and waves of 30 cities each were assigned to applicants by lottery.  In the first round, 190 applications were submitted; the second round saw 353; the third and fourth had 567 and 5180 applications respectively.  As investors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of huge returns, more and more crowded in to get a share of the spectrum being raffled off.

The rounds were fraught with red tape and behind-the-scenes dealing.  Of the many disparate applicants, coalitions and alliances began sprouting up to share and trade ownership of cities.  By the end, several major companies emerged to consolidate the majority of the United States.  Interestingly, the giant of land line communication - AT&amp;T - obtained wireless spectrum but this was calved off to smaller companies when AT&amp;T was forced to split due to an anti-trust suit.&lt;ref&gt;Cauley, Lesley.  ''End of the Line: The Rise and Fall of AT&amp;T.'' Free Press, 2005. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Mobile Phone Worldwide ===
The earliest days of establishing the cell phone network were perilous.  Significant capital investments were required to reach across large rural areas.  Hardware and software had to be developed, standardized, and deployed.  Policies had to be created to govern the interaction of cell phone users across different provider networks (roaming), what sorts of information could be relayed (voice or text via short-message system), and so forth.

Meanwhile international companies were also developing and deploying mobile phone technology.  Motorola, Nokia, Siemens, and others were getting into emerging markets throughout Europe.  Nokia in particular became a juggernaut of global cellular electronics, with products sold in 140 countries by more than 55,000 worldwide employees.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbock, Dan. The Nokia Revolution: The Story of an Extraordinary Company that Transformed an Industry. AMACOM, 2001. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the cell phone, both analog and eventually digital, reached out across the world, other technological advances also arrived to help push mobile communication even further.  The commercialized Internet emerged through the 1990s (along with the Dot-Com boom and bust) and radically changed the way business and society view communication.

The phones themselves also improved.  Smaller, lighter, longer lived phones became mass produced and extremely inexpensive.  It became easier for some extreme rural areas to get cellular service than clean water.  The current iteration of the cell phone, the smartphone, connects us through voice, video, text, web, and on and on.  Our pocket devices are no longer just mobile phones; they are fully fledged computers with access to a wide variety of communications avenues.

Because of this flexibility, mobile phones can be used to spur growth where it was previously impossible.  In rural areas of India, for example, micro-loan banks began opening through the mid 1990s and into the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Nicholas P.  ''You Can Hear Me Now: How Microloans and Cell Phones are Connecting the World's Poor to the Global Economy.'' Wiley, 2007. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  These banks communicate by cell phone in order to reach low-infrastructure villages.  The villagers could also become more connected by using mobile phones, opening their community up for larger business opportunities that would have otherwise been lost to geography.

== Similar Technologies ==
=== Land Line Telephone ===
Through the 20th century, the land line telephone became ubiquitous in the United States.  Short and long distance services were available nationwide through AT&amp;T and telephone use became commonplace.  Land lines have the advantage over wireless in speed and signal quality.  By using wire (previously copper and more recently fiber optic cable), signals can be carefully controlled so that loss is minimized and bandwidth is carefully allocated.

However, cell phones allow the extremely important feature of mobility.  The entire allure of mobile and cellular phone technology is the ability to connect with anyone from anywhere.  As technology improves and cell phones become more sophisticated, lighter, cheaper, faster, and longer-lasting, it is likely that most land-line telephones will be replaced.

=== Satellite Phone ===
Satellite telephone systems offer a close competitor to conventional cell phones in terms of mobility.  Instead of relying on cell towers for communication, a satellite phone communicates directly with a transceiver in orbit.  Demonstrated in 1962 by AT&amp;T, satellites have long been used to send information across the world for telephone, television, and now internet services.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasi, Wayne.  ''Advanced Electronic Communications Systems''.  5th Ed.  Prentice Hall, 2001. p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the extremely high cost of placing a satellite into orbit, person-to-person direct communications via satellite phone are prohibitively expensive for everyday consumer use.  They do find use for extreme environments or natural disaster sites where traditional mobile phones would be ineffective.

== Quantitative Analysis ==
To model the rise of the cell phone in the United States, annual subscription numbers were found for the years from 1985 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Infoplease.com.  ''Cell Phone Subscribers in the U.S., 1985-2010.'' http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0933563.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the data source did not include data for 2007 so that year was excluded from the fit.  The raw data shows the start of what could be an S-type curve with some carrying capacity at or above 300M annual subscribers.  Using regression tools, best-fit carrying capacity and curve parameters were found.  Using those values, the modeled subscriber growth curve was generated and is shown in the figure.

[[File:Annual Cell Phone Subscriptions - United States 1985 to 2010.jpg]]
 
The best-fit parameters have a carrying capacity of 320M annual subscribers.  This is only a slight increase over the current number of subscribers, suggesting that the US cell phone market is nearing or at saturation.  The model curve is slightly slower in growth during the 1990s than the actual values but exceeds actual growth in the later 2000s.

However, based on growth estimates for the United States population, this carrying capacity could be too low.  Over the past 50–60 years, the population growth of the United States has been roughly linear and even with a slowing growth the US population will likely grow over 350M in the coming 30–40 years.  A figure shown [http://www.npg.org/popfacts.htm here] gives one possible estimate of US population growth through 2050.

Based on this growth, it is conceivable that the total number of cell phone subscribers in the United States would approach something in the neighborhood of 450M.  This would mean an average of between 1 and 1.3 cell phone subscriptions per person across the entire US.  (Users with multiple subscriptions could push the total subscriptions above the population.)  Using the 450M subscriber capacity, a second model was generated.

It could be that the S-curve model being used does not represent the growth of the cell phone market.  The initial growth up to the year 2000 does seem to fit the S-curve, but from roughly 2002 to 2010 the growth year to year has been more or less linear.  A better model may use three parts: an S-curve fit through 1999-2000, a linear fit from 2000 to sometime in the 2010s, and an S-curve in the 2010s to 2020s and beyond to model the slowing and end of growth in the market.  In this way, the steady growth through the 2000s would be better captured, but the early increase and eventual slowing of subscriptions would be captured by the S-curves.

=== Finding the Right Market Niche ===

The technology and innovation for aviation was present prior to the 1920s, however it wasn’t until this time that aviation found its market niche by flying over water.  Being able to fly over water was essential during this time to transport goods more quickly compared to water transportation.  An important good that helped aviation enhance and meets the needs of its market niche was over land air mail.  Through the Air Mail Services policy of 1925 commercial airlines began to see the profit in this industry, which initiated the formation of the four major domestic airlines that were dominant during this time.  &lt;ref&gt;The Transportation Experience, pg. 225&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to advancements that lead to aviation, transportation was limited to land and water sources.  Over land both railroads and automobiles were able to transport both goods and passengers.  However these sources were limited by natural features.  Rough terrain, such as mountains, presented difficulties for vehicles and cars to pass easily as well as during different weather conditions.  Natural waterways also presented limitations for boats to pass.  Without canals and other waterway enhancements, rivers may be too low or rough for water transportation to easily pass through.  When advancements are needed to alleviate the flaws in other markets, technology then evolves to meet the needs of a market niche.  The market for transportation progressed as individuals continued to present the need to move passengers and goods as quickly and easily at possible. Air transportation allowed for passengers and goods to be transported without physical and natural feature limitations.  Therefore as limitations were minimized, the time it took to transport services over great distances decreased significantly.

== Policy ==

As airmail services became important during and after World War I, commercial applications of this mode of transportation showed promise for profit.  In order establish and set rates for transporting main the Air Mail Act of 1925 was enacted. The allowed private carriers to bid and be awarded government mail contracts by the United States Postal Service.  This established three major commercial passenger services including the Pan American Airways, Western Air Express, and Ford Air Transportation Service. These services were then able to dominate the air transportation system and the early market niche due to this policy, prior to this policy the aviation system was privately owned and operated.

Focuses on safety lead to the formation of government involvement through the form of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which provided government regulation to both improve and maintain safety standards in the system.

== Technology ==
==== Safety Advancements ====

As aviation took off, other technological advancements emerged to meet the needs of the market niche.  Early aviation developments was a highly dangerous activities, fatal accidents was a common occurrence During the 1930 advancements to during route navigation technology evolved, including AM radio range, voice communication radio, tower and during route traffic control.  Each of these technological advancements was important to improving safety during flights. &lt;ref&gt;www.faa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aircraft Advancements ====

After World War II since military airports were no longer needed they then became retrofitted for the transport of passengers and good transportation, however using these locations made location adjustments difficult.  Airports provided access to cities and allowed cities to participate in the air traffic system. With the increased participation of cities more traffic control technology evolved, including FM radios and radar technology.  Also after World War II international travel increased and the first commercial jet was introduced in 1952 by the British Overseas Aircraft Corporation.  With jets having the ability to hold more passengers and reach top speeds many U.S. companies became interested, which initiated the designing and building of their own jet airlines.

== Aviation Evaluation ==
==== Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  ====
[[File:Aviation Table.jpg|thumb|Aviation Table]]

Evaluating the quantitative data for Washington Dulles International Airport presents the birth, growth and maturity of this system.  In order to analyzing this growth model the total passengers, including both domestic and international flights, was collected between the years of 1962 and 2011.  The data presented through the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority was then graphed using a scatter plot (Series 1) and a regression test (Series 2) was run on the data.  &lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority &lt;/ref&gt;

The regression analysis formulated the “s-curve” to show where the birth of the mode was, the steady increase in curve represents the growth, and the leveling off of the curve shows the maturity of air transportation for Washington.  When looking at the curve compared to the original data, the s-curve fits at a rate of 0.87.  Since this fit is close to the number one it is a relatively good fit line.  However the variation in the fit is due to pulses or the three local maximums of the original data.  These pulses tend to be due to technology advancements that enhanced the systems in the market niche.  Overall the table above, representing air travel for the Washington Dulles International Airport, does a good do showing how the aviation evolved in order to meet a market niche.

== Conclusion ==

Both technology and policy have shaped the development of the aviation.  The birth of the system was lead by technology needs to meet the demands of a market niche. This time period was seen between 1920 and 1970.  Deregulation in the 1970s allowed for the market to create competition and meet the increased demand for air transportation until mid 2000s. After this growth period air transportation is reaching its maturity phase in the market niche.  This is where new technology, such as faster and more fuel efficient planes could for the market to continue to grow.  Otherwise the market will be locked in and the market will start to decline.  Since the air traffic market is currently within its maturity phase, new technology is needed to enhance the system and meet the needs of the market niche.

Being able to fly over water was essential during this time to transport goods more quickly compared to water transportation.  An important good that helped aviation enhance and meets the needs of its market niche was over land air mail.  Through the Air Mail Services policy of 1925 commercial airlines began to see the profit in this industry, which initiated the formation of the four major domestic airlines that were dominant during this time.&lt;ref&gt;The Transportation Experience, pg. 225&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to advancements that lead to aviation, transportation was limited to land and water sources.  Over land both railroads and automobiles were able to transport both goods and passengers.  However these sources were limited by natural features.  Rough terrain, such as mountains, presented difficulties for vehicles and cars to pass easily as well as during different weather conditions.  Natural waterways also presented limitations for boats to pass.  Without canals and other waterway enhancements, rivers may be too low or rough for water transportation to easily pass through.  When advancements are needed to alleviate the flaws in other markets, technology then evolves to meet the needs of a market niche.  The market for transportation progressed as individuals continued to present the need to move passengers and goods as quickly and easily at possible. Air transportation allowed for passengers and goods to be transported without physical and natural feature limitations.  Therefore as limitations were minimized, the time it took to transport services over great distances decreased significantly.

== Policy ==

As airmail services became important during and after World War I, commercial applications of this mode of transportation showed promise for profit.  In order establish and set rates for transporting main the Air Mail Act of 1925 was enacted. The allowed private carriers to bid and be awarded government mail contracts by the United States Postal Service.  This established three major commercial passenger services including the Pan American Airways, Western Air Express, and Ford Air Transportation Service. These services were then able to dominate the air transportation system and the early market niche due to this policy, prior to this policy the aviation system was privately owned and operated.

Focuses on safety lead to the formation of government involvement through the form of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which provided government regulation to both improve and maintain safety standards in the system.

== Technology ==
==== Safety Advancements ====

As aviation took off, other technological advancements emerged to meet the needs of the market niche.  Early aviation developments was a highly dangerous activities, fatal accidents was a common occurrence During the 1930 advancements to during route navigation technology evolved, including AM radio range, voice communication radio, tower and during route traffic control.  Each of these technological advancements was important to improving safety during flights.&lt;ref&gt;www.faa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aircraft Advancements ====

After World War II since military airports were no longer needed they then became retrofitted for the transport of passengers and good transportation, however using these locations made location adjustments difficult.  Airports provided access to cities and allowed cities to participate in the air traffic system. With the increased participation of cities more traffic control technology evolved, including FM radios and radar technology.  Also after World War II international travel increased and the first commercial jet was introduced in 1952 by the British Overseas Aircraft Corporation.  With jets having the ability to hold more passengers and reach top speeds many U.S. companies became interested, which initiated the designing and building of their own jet airlines.

== Aviation Evaluation ==
==== Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  ====
[[File:Aviation Table.jpg|thumb|Aviation Table]]

Evaluating the quantitative data for Washington Dulles International Airport presents the birth, growth and maturity of this system.  In order to analyzing this growth model the total passengers, including both domestic and international flights, was collected between the years of 1962 and 2011.  The data presented through the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority was then graphed using a scatter plot (Series 1) and a regression test (Series 2) was run on the data.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority&lt;/ref&gt;

The regression analysis formulated the “s-curve” to show where the birth of the mode was, the steady increase in curve represents the growth, and the leveling off of the curve shows the maturity of air transportation for Washington.  When looking at the curve compared to the original data, the s-curve fits at a rate of 0.87.  Since this fit is close to the number one it is a relatively good fit line.  However the variation in the fit is due to pulses or the three local maximums of the original data.  These pulses tend to be due to technology advancements that enhanced the systems in the market niche.  Overall the table above, representing air travel for the Washington Dulles International Airport, does a good do showing how the aviation evolved in order to meet a market niche.

== Conclusion ==

Both technology and policy have shaped the development of the aviation.  The birth of the system was lead by technology needs to meet the demands of a market niche. This time period was seen between 1920 and 1970.  Deregulation in the 1970s allowed for the market to create competition and meet the increased demand for air transportation until mid 2000s. After this growth period air transportation is reaching its maturity phase in the market niche.  This is where new technology, such as faster and more fuel efficient planes could for the market to continue to grow.  Otherwise the market will be locked in and the market will start to decline.  Since the air traffic market is currently within its maturity phase, new technology is needed to enhance the system and meet the needs of the market niche.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In transportation planning, analyzing the development of a mode can help predict future implications.  There are many motorcycle safety concerns that are debated, so considering the growth of motorcycle use in the United States is worthwhile.

==Introduction==

Motorcycles have been around since the late 1800's, and have grown into an important transportation method that can be a primary means of travel for people in many countries.  However, in the Untied States, motorcycles almost always serve as an alternative method that shifts the focus to the pleasure of travel from the extra freedom provided.  This does not mean that motorcycles are not used for normal everyday trips, but generally they are not nearly as important as cars in the United States (motorcycles are not able to transport much), and not everyone has the ability or desire to learn to ride a motorcycle.  Furthermore, states require additional license certification to operate a motorcycle, creating an additional barrier to use.  Despite the hinderances, development of motorcycle use has been possible because motorcycles are able to use the existing vehicle infrastructure without additional investments while proving a much different travel experience.  Just like in automobiles, motorcycles continue to improve and incorporate new technologies (such as fuel injection).&lt;ref name=&quot;trends&quot;&gt;Morris, C.  Motorcycle Trends in the United States.  Bureau of Transportation Statistics, May 2009. [http://www.bts.gov/publications/special_reports_and_issue_briefs/special_report/2009_05_14/html/entire.html]&lt;/ref&gt;


For transportation issues, only street legal motorcycles are of concern, so racing and off road motorcycles are not considered, while dual sport motorcycles (enduros) are included.&lt;ref name=&quot;trends&quot;/&gt;  The definition of a motorcycle in the United States varies by state (and is also applicable to other issues such as helmet laws), but e-bikes and generally small mopeds (having an engine sizes less than 50 cc and maximum speed around 45 kph typically) are not considered motorcycles, while larger scooters (with engine sizes greater than 70 cc and capable of traveling above 45 kph) are classified as motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;“Motorcycle and Bicycle Helmet Use Laws.”  Highway Loss Data Institute.  Insurance Institute For Highway Safety, December 2012.[http://www.iihs.org/laws/helmetusecurrent.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DMV Websites.&quot;  Moped Army, 30 October 2011. [http://www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/DMV_Websites]&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that smaller mopeds incapable of traveling on higher speed roads (and therefore only suited to short trips) are not grouped with motorcycles.  However, smaller mopeds provide better gas mileage at the cost of lower range, but motorcycles still have nearly twice as high of fuel economy as passenger vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;  Motorcycles are not often publicized as some of the best fuel efficient alternatives, and this is not surprising considering the safety concerns surrounding motorcycle use in the United States.  Furthermore, usefulness is greatly affected by weather, so motorcycles can not be used for portions of the year in many parts of the country or during storms.


To look at adaptation over time, the number of registered motorcycles in the United States for a given year is used to determine ownership and use.  The yearly data for registered motorcycles goes back to 1914 and is currently available up through 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;“Highway Statistics 2010.”  Federal Highway Administration.  U.S Department of Transportation, December 2011. [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2010/]&lt;/ref&gt; providing a large time period for analysis.

==Life Cycle Model==

An S-curve model is used to model the life cycle of motorcycle ownership, the equation:


&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \frac{K}{1+e^{-b(t-t_0)}}&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the year, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the inflection year, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation level, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the predicted number of registered motorcycles for the year.

The coefficient and saturation level are determined based on a best fit to the recored data.  The resulting S-curve generally displays periods of birth, growth, and maturity.  However, one curve does not fit the observed data well at all.  Therefore, multiple S-curve segments were used to fit different periods of development, and the figure also shows how the continuation of trends differs from the recorded number of motorcycles.


[[File:Trends in number of US motorcycles 3.jpg|framed|center|Three S-curves were used to fit the data. Dotted portions represent continuations of the fitted curves.]]
&lt;br /&gt;
The first period involved growth that lasted to approximately 1985.  From 1913 to 1945 there was very little change in the low amount of motorcycles, showing that motorcycles were not yet a developed method.  From 1945 to 1962 corresponds to a period birth, followed by rapid growth until 1974.  After this there is a slow down of growth and a peak that shows maturity, however, this is a rapid change is the trend.  The S-curve fitted to this section has a saturation quantity of 11 million motorcycles, and the inflection year would be 1981.  However, a peak occurs instead around the fitted inflection year, followed by a steady decrease in registered motorcycles that follows a trend to a low saturation volume of 3.3 million, with a maturity phase in the decrease visible in the figure between 1993 and 1997.  Around 1998 the trend quickly changes once again, and the number of motorcycles in the United States increases rapidly, following an almost linear path that the fitted S-curve predicts would reach 23 million motorcycles (more than double the previous value) with the trend starting to slow by 2016 (inflection year).  In this case there is very little discernible birth phase before the new growth phase starts.  The table below summarizes the parameters of the three curves.

 *Here K is still used in the S(t) equation but represents the range of decrease 
  to the low saturation value. Another parameter was then added to the equation 
  to estimate the low saturation level of 3,300,000 registered motorcycles.

==Conclusions==
The number of motorcycles registered seems to grow rapidly at times.  This may be because motorcycles in the United States are not the most essential expenditure when fluctuations occur.  Furthermore, sales of motorcycles tend to fluctuate greatly, as there was a high in 1980, then sales decreased to a low in 1995, then increased to a larger high in 2005, and then decreased again to another low currently as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Sales or Deliveries of New Aircraft, Vehicles, Vessels, and Other Conveyances.  Bureau of Transportation Statistics. [http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_12.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Motorcycle and Scooter Sales Get Pumped Up in First Half of 2006.  Motorcycle Industry Council, 20 July 2006. [http://www.mic.org/news072006.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though major fluctuations exist in motorcycle ownership in the United States, a general trend towards more registered motorcycles is visible, and the S-curve model predicts that this period of growth will continue for many years, unless another rapid shift interups growth.  The available sales data indicates that another change will most likely occur unless motorcycles sales start to grow (the rate of junked motorcycles also has the opposite effect too).  Because of the expendability of motorcycles in the United States, predicting ownership trends accurately will likely be more difficult than exploring other transportation methods.

----
Subsidiarity is generally defined as the &quot;organizing principle stating that a matter ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized authority capable of addressing that matter effectively&quot;. While this is the standard way by which the word &quot;subsidiarity&quot; is used in institutional governance, its concept is more relevant and refers to the way that different authorities interact so that they reciprocally recognize and empower each other avoiding that &quot;the bigger&quot; is put higher in the hierarchical order then &quot;the smaller&quot;. Subsidiarity means that each level of authority requires  the others in a process that all are reciprocally &quot;subsidiary&quot;. The &quot;smaller&quot; in a geographic sense may actually be &quot;higher&quot; in a &quot;ethical&quot; sense and may have much more relevance to the life of the individuals then the far away &quot;big powers&quot;. At the same time it is the peaceful and synergistic coordination of the &quot;smalls&quot; into widely coordinated &quot;bigger&quot; authorities that enable the smalls to be really autonomous authorities that really recognized and protect the rights of the individual persons.



== The EU subsidiarity model ==

Subsidiarity is a fundamental principle of the European Union law,  established in EU law by the Treaty of Maastricht (Article 5), and signed Feb 7 1992. It is described in the Treaty as the principle whereby “the Community shall act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by this Treaty and of the objectives assigned to it therein. 
&lt;br /&gt;
In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.

== Catholic social teaching ==

The word subsidiarity is derived from the Latin word subsidiarius and has its origins in Catholic social teaching. The concept or principle is found in several constitutions around the world (see for example the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). The principle of subsidiarity was developed in the encyclical Rerum Novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, as an attempt to articulate a middle course between the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of communism, which subordinate the individual to the state, on the other. The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of 1931, and Economic Justice for All by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The principle of subsidiarity holds that government should undertake only those initiatives which exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently. The principle is based upon the autonomy and dignity of the human individual, and holds that all other forms of society, from the family to the state and the international order, should be in the service of the human person. Subsidiarity assumes that these human persons are by their nature social beings, and emphasizes the importance of small and intermediate-sized communities or institutions, like the family, the church, and voluntary associations, as mediating structures which empower individual action and link the individual to society as a whole. &quot;Positive subsidiarity&quot;, which is the ethical imperative for communal, institutional or governmental action to create the social conditions necessary to the full development of the individual, such as the right to work, decent housing, health care, etc., is another important aspect of the subsidiarity principle.

The principle of subsidiarity was developed in the encyclical Rerum Novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, as an attempt to articulate a middle course between the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of communism, which subordinate the individual to the state, on the other. The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of 1931, and Economic Justice for All by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

== European Union law ==

Subsidiarity was established in EU law by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Maastricht Treaty of Maastricht], signed on 7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. The present formulation is contained in Article 5 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (consolidated version following the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nice Treaty of Nice], which entered into force on 1 February 2003):

::&quot;The Community shall act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by this Treaty and of the objectives assigned to it therein.
::In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.
::
::Any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty.
::
::A more descriptive analysis of the principle can be found in Protocol 30 to the EC Treaty.''

Article 9 of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_constitution proposed European constitution] states

::''Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence the Union shall act only if and insofar as the objectives of the intended action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.''

Formally, the principle of subsidiarity applies to those areas where the Community does not have exclusive competence, the principle delineating those areas where the Community should and should not act. In practice, the concept is frequently used in a more informal manner in discussions as to which competences should be given to the Community, and which retained for the Member States alone.

The concept of subsidiarity therefore has both a legal and a political dimension. Consequently, there are varying views as to its legal and political consequences, and various criteria are put forward explaining the content of the principle. For example:

:* The action must be necessary because actions of individuals or member-state governments alone will not achieve the objectives of the action (the sufficiency criterion)
:* The action must bring added value over and above what could be achieved by individual or member-state government action alone (the benefit criterion).
:* Decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen (the close to the citizen criterion)
:* The action should secure greater freedoms for the individual (the autonomy criterion).

The European Union, however, has as part of its phraseology a call for &quot;an ever-closer union.&quot; What restraints upon the progress of centralised decision making would be brought about by strict reference to the principle of subsidiarity have yet to be proven by major constitutional clashes.
