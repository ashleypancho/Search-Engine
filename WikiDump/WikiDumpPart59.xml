==7. Know how to properly sharpen a hatchet and knife. ==
A tool can be sharpened with a whetstone.  Most whetstones need to be kept wet when they are in use - some are wet with water and others are wet with oil.  Stones with finer grain typically use oil, but you can use water on them as well.  The purpose of wetting a whetstone is to allow the steel removed from the blade to float away.  The finer the stone, the finer the edge it will make on a tool, but the longer it will take to sharpen it.  For this reason, a very dull tool should be sharpened first with a coarser stone, and then with a finer stone.  Then it should be kept sharp.  You can keep a blade sharp by respecting it - do not chop into the ground with a hatchet, and to not stick a knife blade in the ground either.  Dirt is highly abrasive, and a rock will ding the edge very quickly.  Close a pocket knife when you are finished using it, and do not allow the business end of a blade to touch anything other than the things you are trying to cut with it.

===Hatchet===
It is tempting to take a dull hatchet to a power grinder, but unless you are very careful, this could be a huge mistake.  A grinder will not only remove steel from a blade, it will also heat it.  It is ''very'' easy to heat it too much, causing the steel to lose its temper (tempered steel is hard and holds an edge better than untempered steel).  Steel is tempered by heating it to the point that it becomes non-magnetic, then quickly cooling it.  If it is allowed to cool slowly, the iron crystals in the blade will align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field as they cool, and aligned crystals make for soft steel.  So the first advice we can give on sharpening a hatchet is to stay away from the grinder. 

Instead, use a file or a stone.  Hold the file so that it passes over the edge of the blade, but at a steep angle.  Sharpen one side, and then the other.

===Knife===
To sharpen a knife, hold the blade at about a 15° angle and scrape it along a whetstone as if you were trying to shave off a thin layer of the stone. Be sure to sharpen both sides.

==8. Cook a one-pot meal using fresh or dried food. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/One-pot meal}}

==9. Describe the various types of tents and their uses. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Tent/Styles}}


&lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt;ifferent types of tents are used for different purposes. A 4 season tent is going to do well for any type of conditions, where as other types of tents (most today are 3 season) don't do as well in all seasons (usually the winter season is not a good time to use such a tent). So, seasons are one way of signifying different types of tents.

&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;he different types of camping would be another way to distinguish the types of tents. A family tent is more than likely going to be heavy (weight wise) and bulky. It will often have ''lots'' of room (can fit 6 people). A backpacking tent is small and light weight. Usually you won't put gear in a backpacking tent (you hang your pack or keep it out of your tent). A backpacking tent will fit people snuggly (usually no more than 2 per tent). A mountaineering tent can stand the rough climate and terrain in addition to being light weight. Mountaineering tents are designed for some gear to fit inside the tent (thus being a little bit more spacious than backpacking tents). Mountaineering tents may also allow for up to 3 or four people to sleep snuggly in a single tent.

&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;he final way to classify tents by different types is by material used. I don't use this method for teaching camping skills 3 though. Tents may be classified by the materials used to build them (like aluminum poles vs carbon fiber poles, etc.).

==10. How does condensation occur in tents, and how can it be prevented? ==
Each breath a person exhales contains water because of the moisture content of the lungs, throat, mouth and nasal cavity. This moisture rises until it comes in contact with a cool surface such as the inside of the tent, where it condenses.

A good tent will be made of breathable material that allows the moisture to pass through (such as a nylon mesh), and there will be a rain fly on the outside to keep rain out of the tent.  Water vapor passes through the mesh and condenses on the fly.  It then runs off the underside of the fly and drips off the edge outside the tent.

==11. Demonstrate your ability to anchor a tent down, using the taut-line hitch and two half hitches. ==
===Taut-Line Hitch===

===Two Half Hitches===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Knot/Two half hitches}}

: ''This is your activity''.

==13. Properly locate and build one of the following and describe its importance to the individual and the environment: ==

You should take into consideration where your sleeping area(s) are in relation to these ''water-related'' areas. Specifically, water flows downhill, so, you do not want water runoff from the 'sink and dishwashing' or 'shower water' flowing to your sleeping area(s). 

Also, the location of the 'latrine' should be considered depending on where you get your water source. For example, you do not want to put the 'latrine' upstream and take your shower and wash your dishes downstream.  But pay attention!  Just because your latrine is downstream and downhill from ''you'' does not mean it is downstream and downhill from ''other campers''.  Be considerate.  A latrine should never be located within {{units|60 meters|200 feet}} of any water supply.

===a. Latrine ===

===b. Shower ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/CampShower}}
===c. Camp sink and dishwashing area ===

==15. Know how to replace the mantels on a camp lantern. Demonstrate how to refill gas in a camp lantern and stove. Know how to maintain the pressure pump on a camp stove in good working order. ==
===Replace Mantel on Camp Lantern===
[[Image:Tranby house 49 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kerosene Lantern]]
:''As with most things, practice and repetition makes a task simple''.

:# Turn OFF the gas valve completely.
:# Remove the lantern cover and the glass covering. Place these in a safe and stable place.
:# Remove any remains of the old mantel. ''Do this carefully if the lantern is still '''HOT'''.''
:# Tie the new mantel in place on the gas pipe. There is a string around the collar that slips over the gas pipe.
:# Pressurize the gas tank.
:# Hold a lighted match near the mantel and turn on the gas valve. The mantel should begin to burn.
:# Replace the glass cover and the lantern cover.
:# Open the gas valve completely when the mantel starts to glow brightly.

:Be sure not to spill any fuel, or if you do, make sure you clean up properly.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===Maintain Pressure Pump on a Camp Stove===
[[Image:Kerosene stove.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kerosene pressure stove. The pressurising pump knob is protruding from the fuel tank at the lower right.]]
:Most stoves can use either liquid or gas fuel. Gas-fuel stoves are simpler to operate than liquid fueled stoves. The gas, being already pressurized, flows from the fuel canister into the burner, where it ignites, in the same manner as a domestic kitchen stove.

:Liquid-fuel stoves are more complex because the liquid fuel must be vaporized prior to burning. To accomplish this, the stove design brings the fuel line containing the liquid fuel near the flame of the burner. The heat from the flames converts the liquid fuel to a gas before it reaches the burner, where it mixes with air and is ignited. Some models use a spray system which does not require preheating.

:Most stoves operating with liquid fuels must be heated or primed before the burner is turned on. Many stoves require the operator to open the fuel valve briefly without igniting the fuel, so that it flows into a small pan. This small quantity of fuel is then lit and allowed to burn down. When the fuel valve is opened again, the fuel vaporizes from the heat of the pan. Some stoves do not have this apparatus, and must be preheated by the application of an external heat source such as a solid fuel block.

:In many stoves, the priming pressure is generated by a small hand pump that forces air into the fuel container. As the fuel is consumed, the pressure decreases according to Boyle's Law, so the pump must be operated occasionally during use to maintain steady stove operation.


:''In the picture (above/right), '''the pressure pump''' knob is also the cover to the fuel tank. This '''MUST''' fit on the tank properly. If this cover is not correctly fitted, you cannot pressurize the stove. You would pressurize the tank by operating the pump several times before lighting the stove. During the course of use, you will need to operate the pump again, to maintain the pressure in the tank.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Would it be possible for someone to put a full example in here including the creation of a sample dll a .def file, possibly a .manifest, and something to call the dll? There should be shell commands for compiling this in windows with cl.exe (the visual studio C compiler). That would make this a bit more clear. It would be good to have a discussion of using other people's dlls and how to find out what those dlls export.

I want full examples!!! Thanks -[[User:69.122.196.117|69.122.196.117]] 01:21, 14 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

;24 December 2008: All pages reviewed. Many of the pages are very monolithic and might need to be broken down into smaller pages. Some pages are equation-heavy and need more prose. Images need general improvement, and more new images need to be added. Needs a public collection and associated artifacts.</text>

== Choosing a Secure Web Browser ==
There are many different web browsers available to you, all of which will display the web in a similar way. However, they are all built in different ways, and for this reason the security features employed in each will be different.  Listed below are some of the popular browsers:

*Microsoft Internet Explorer
*Mozilla Firefox
*Safari
*Opera
*Google Chrome

== Microsoft Internet Explorer ==

Though in the past Internet Explorer (abbreviated to IE) was described as a generally insecure browser, much has been done to keep its users safe on the Internet. With version 7 of Internet Explorer, there are a wide range of security features that have been employed. This particular version checks visited websites against a black-list of reported phishing websites to try and ensure that you do not give your details away to a fraudulent website. Whilst this is not 100% effective, it helps keep your data secure. IE7 supports the latest data encryption technologies as well as the most up-to-date web certificate verification techniques. IE 7 will automatically check a website's security certificate to see whether or not it is valid. IE will not let a website download or install a program without your explicit consent.

Unfortunately, Internet Explorer 7 is only supported in Windows XP SP2 (or above) and Windows Vista. For this reason many people tend to opt for Mozilla Firefox, which will work on almost any version of Windows.

== Mozilla Firefox ==
[[File:Firefox LiNsta.png|thumb|right|100px|Mozilla Firefox]]
Mozilla Firefox has for a very long time been touted as a very secure web browser. As it is open source, any holes in the browser are patched quickly as there are always a large number of people developing patches at any one time. The security features employed in Firefox are almost identical to those used in Internet Explorer, checking websites against phishing black-lists, supporting certificates and encryption, and giving the user complete control over downloaders and installers.  Another advantage of Firefox over Internet Explorer is that it is compatible with multiple operating systems as well as most versions of Windows.

== Safari ==
[[Image:Apple_Safari.png|thumb|left|100px|The Safari logo.]]
Safari is the proprietary browser for Apple's computers as well as the iPhone.  While generally secure under Apple systems, the Windows version of the Safari browser has had problems.  These problems are regarding &quot;carpet bombing.&quot;  Since many Windows users have multiple web browsers installed, the carpet bombing technique makes use of a &quot;blended attack&quot;.  The original carpet bomb would allow the download of files onto the system without user confirmation.  A second flaw allowed files to be stolen from the users computer.

== Opera ==
Opera is a proprietary web browser based on open-source code but is not as common as the other already listed. It has some special security features, e.g. cookie and cache clean up every time the browser shuts down and a possibility to edit cookies directly from the browser.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Romanisation System=

In order to make Arabic more accessible, this book uses transliteration along with Arabic written in Arabic letters. The system used in this book is based on the loose conventions used to chat in Arabic when the Arabic alphabet is not supported.

* The following numerals are used to represent Arabic letters not having a Latin equivalent: 2 3 6 7 9        
** 2 represents hamza ء (original alif sound). This is the sound that separates vowels for example if &quot;Martin&quot; were written in Arabic. It would most likely not be written with a hamza, because that is not how it is usually pronounced in English. But if you find that someone pronounces &quot;Martin&quot; as &quot;Mart-in&quot; rather than &quot;Mar-tin&quot; then that pronunciation would be written with a hamza in Arabic (like this in transliteration: mart2in). 
** 3 represents 3ain. 3ain is an important Arabic sound, and doesn't come automatically to people unfamiliar with Arabic. 
** 6 is the &quot;emphatic&quot; &quot;t&quot; sound. It is a &quot;t&quot; sound pronounced with more of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth.
** 7 is a special &quot;h&quot; sound. It is pronounced far deeper in the throat the normal &quot;h&quot;. 
** 9 is the emphatic &quot;s&quot; sound. Unlike the normal Arabic &quot;s&quot; sound this &quot;s&quot; sound is pronounced with the tongue near the place behind the upper teeth. This is not a very important phoneme to master.


* The apostrophe is used to indicate modify consonants to represent different consonants. For example: t', d', 7', 3' represent the more frictive versions i.e. (the th in think, the th in &quot;the&quot;, the throaty &quot;ch&quot; in Munich, the throaty Parisian French &quot;r&quot; (approximately)).
* The apostrophe is used after a vowel to lengthen it.  


The orthography or spelling conventions used with the transliteration are a compromise between transcribing actual pronunciation, and spelling (although in Arabic they do not significantly differ). Keep the following in mind:
* tilde (~) indicates that the letter before must be pronounced like the letter after it. so (eL~Da'r must be pronounced ed-da'r)
* The definite article in Arabic will be spelt (L), It is pronounced the same as (L)
* Anything in parentheses after a word are pronounced in some registers and not others. You will most likely need to be capable of understanding Arabic pronounced either way.

== Examples ==
# L kalime(tu) huna'k(a)
# L kita'b(u) huna'k(a)
# L kursiy(yu) huna'k(a)
# L madrase(tu) huna'k(a)
# L mu3allim(u) huna'k(a)
# L~tilmi'd'(u) huna'k(a)
# L qalam(u) huna'k(a)
# L ma77a'ye(tu) huna'k(a)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Sometimes you have a text body and you want to filter out words that are on a given list, often called a ''stoplist''.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XQuery-test-for-string-in-list.jpg|center|frame|Screen Image]]

== Sample Program ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: Test to see if a word is in a list :)

declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes omit-xml-declaration=yes&quot;;

(: A list of words :)
let $stopwords :=
&lt;words&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;a&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;and&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;in&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;the&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;or&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;over&lt;/word&gt;
&lt;/words&gt;

let $input-text := 'a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Test of is a word on a list&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt; Test of is a word on a list&lt;/h1&gt;
   
   &lt;h2&gt;WordList&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;thead&gt;
       &lt;tr&gt;
         &lt;th&gt;StopWord&lt;/th&gt;   
       &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/thead&gt;
     &lt;tbody&gt;{
     for $word in $stopwords/word
     return
        &lt;tr&gt;       
           &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;{$word}&lt;/td&gt;              
        &lt;/tr&gt;
     }&lt;/tbody&gt;
   &lt;/table&gt;
   
   &lt;h2&gt;Sample Input Text&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Input Text: &lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid black&quot;&gt;{$input-text}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;thead&gt;
       &lt;tr&gt;
         &lt;th&gt;Word&lt;/th&gt;
         &lt;th&gt;On List&lt;/th&gt;       
       &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/thead&gt;
     &lt;tbody&gt;{
     for $word in tokenize($input-text, '\s+')
     return
     &lt;tr&gt;       
        &lt;td&gt;{$word}&lt;/td&gt;      
        &lt;td&gt;{
          if ($stopwords/word = $word)
            then(&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;true&lt;/font&gt;)
            else(&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;false&lt;/font&gt;)
        }&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
     }&lt;/tbody&gt;
   &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/stoplist.xq Execute]

== Discussion ==
The input string is split into words using the &lt;b&gt;tokenize&lt;/b&gt; function which accepts two parameters, the string to be parsed and a separator expressed as a regular expression.  Here words are separated by one or more spaces. The result is a sequence of words.

This program uses XPath generalized equality to compare the sequence &lt;b&gt;$stopwords/word&lt;/b&gt; with the sequence (of one item) &lt;b&gt;$word&lt;/b&gt;.  This is true if the two sequences have items in common, that is if the stoplist contains the word.  

== Alternative coding ==
You can also use a quantified expression to perform a stopword lookup using the '''some...satisfies''' - see [[XQuery/Quantified Expressions]] expression such as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   some $word in $stopwords
   satisfies ($word = $thisword)
&lt;/source&gt;

There are other alternatives; the stop words as a sequence of strings, or a long string and use contains() or a element in the database.  

There are however significant differences in performance. There is a set of tests which show the differences in a number of alternatives.
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/UnitTest2/runTests.xql?uri=/db/Wiki/UnitTest2/Tests/match.xml Unit Tests]

What these tests reveal is that, on the eXist db platform, both the suggested implementations are far from optimal. Testing against a sequence of strings takes about a fifth of the time to compare with elements. Generalised equality is equally superior to the use of a qualified expression.

== Recommended Practice ==

It would appear that the preferable approach is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $stopwords := (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;in&quot;,&quot;the&quot;,&quot;or&quot;,&quot;over&quot;)
let $input-string :=  'a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
let $input-words := tokenize($input-string, '\s+')
return 
    for $word in $input-words 
    return $stopwords = $word
&lt;/source&gt;

If the stop words are held as an element, it is better to convert to a sequence of atoms first:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $stopwords :=
&lt;words&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;a&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;and&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;in&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;the&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;or&lt;/word&gt;
   &lt;word&gt;over&lt;/word&gt;
&lt;/words&gt;
let $stopwordsx := $stopwords/word/string(.)
let $input-string :=  'a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
let $input-words := tokenize($input-string, '\s+')
return 
    for $word in $input-words 
    return $stopwordsx = $word
&lt;/source&gt;
 
Note that referencing the stop list in the database slightly improved performance.

In case your watchlist doesn't cover these pages - you might want to read [[Talk:Middle_School_Extension]] and [[WB:SLP#Middle_School_Extension]]. [[User:Mchua|Mchua]] 21:08, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

:Hello AuroraBooks, welcome to wikibooks! I just wanted to get in touch with you about this MSE project of yours, it's creating a bit of a stir. If I may begin with a question, what exactly is the goal and the scope of the MSE project?
:Wikibooks doesnt allow &quot;subprojects&quot;, we allow books and collections of books, but everything is directly under the Wikibooks project. Two pages need to be moved: [[Wikibooks:MSE New Titles Request]] and [[Wikibooks:What is MSE?]]. Since MSE isn't a &quot;subproject&quot;, these pages should not be in the project namespace. I recommend that you move them to [[Middle School Extensions/New Titles Requests]] and [[Middle School Extensions/What is MSE?]] respectively. If you need help with this, please let me know.
:Concerning your &quot;New Titles Requests&quot; page, you cannot restrict what books or pages that people create. On Wikibooks, any person may create any page or book at any time. Also, there really isn't an authority hierarchy here, so you can't require people to get your permission, or even to obey your commands.
:If you have questions or if you need help you can ask me any time. However, these are not issues on which we can really negotiate. Sorry if this ruins any of your plans. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:41, 15 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be reconized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist, which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[Wikipedia:database|database]] is a program that stores data.  There are many types of databases: flat-file, hierarchical, relational, object-relational, object-oriented, xml, and others.  The original databases were mainly proprietary and non-standardized.

Relational databases were the first databases to achieve great success and standardization. Relational databases are characterized by the [[Wikipedia:SQL|SQL]] (structured query language) standard to query and modify the database, their [[Wikipedia:client/server|client/server]] architecture, and relational table storage structure.  Relational databases achieved great success because their standardization allowed many different vendors such as [[Wikipedia:Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Wikipedia:IBM|IBM]], and [[Wikipedia:Sybase|Sybase]] to produce interoperable products giving users the flexibility to switch their vendor and avoid vendor lock-in to a proprietary solution.  Their client/server architecture allows the client programming language to be decoupled from the server, allowing the database server to support interface APIs into multiple different programming languages and clients.

Although relational databases are relatively old technology, they still dominate the industry.  There have been many attempts to replace the relational model, first with object-oriented databases, then with object-relational databases, and finally with XML databases, but none of the new database models achieved much success and relational databases remain the overwhelmingly dominant database model.

The main relational databases used today are: [[w:Oracle database|Oracle]], [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] (Oracle), [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]], [[w:DB2|DB2]] (IBM), [[w:Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] (Microsoft).

Chapters: Nature and Purpose of Education | Human Nature | Pedagogy | Curricula | Metaphors | References
Rodney H. Clarken

==Introduction== 
What knowledge is most worth knowing and how can it be best taught are questions that have confronted and confounded humankind down through the ages. Today's answers differ from yesterday's, and will likely differ from tomorrow's. One culture's answer will differ from another culture's. By looking to the Bahá'í teachings on this subject, we can begin to answer this question using the divine guidance they provide. By following this guidance, we can provide the best education to our children and our communities.

In an attempt to find answers to questions related to education, I have categorized the quotations from the compilation Bahá'í Education (Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, 1976) and have added some introductory comments that may be useful to the readers. Though many of these quotations have insights for various areas of education, each quotation has only been used once and is categorized according to the topic that seemed most relevant or useful. Much more work needs to be done with this important topic, but I thought it was valuable enough to make available to the general public at this time. I hope to develop this work, along with others I have done, to create a document that may be of use to educators in their process of improving education. Another work (Clarken, 1998) can be referred to for additional treatment of some of the topics discussed in this paper. Your feedback and suggestions are welcomed.

All extracts come from the compilation on Bahá'í education released by the Universal House of Justice in 1976, and are numbered consecutively. Because this document consists mostly of quotations, the quotations are not italicized or indented as is often the custom. They will be identified by the number that is used in several publications of the 1976 compilation of extracts on Baha'i education from the writings and talks of Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice. Quotations numbered 1-28 are from Bahá'u'lláh, 29-106 from the writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 107-115 from 'Abdu'l-Bahá's talks, 116-123 from Shoghi Effendi's writings, and 124-162 are from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi. All passages have been included except for a small number from the letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, also referred to as the Guardian, which did not add substantively to the areas discussed.

This is but one more attempt to further understanding concerning the ever-important topic of education. May it stimulate those who have more talent and insight to produce a more suitable approach to this topic. The following two extracts serve as an introduction and rationale for this work.
130. He is very glad to know that you attach importance to the training of the children, for whatever they learn in that early stage of their development will leave its traces upon their whole life. It becomes part of their nature.
There is no especial book which the Guardian can recommend. It is for the older friends to attempt a compilation that would suit that purpose, and after many attempts a good one will ultimately be produced. . . .
Such stories regarding the life of different Prophets together with Their sayings will also be useful to better understand the literature of the Cause for there is constant reference to them. It is, however, the work of experienced people to bring together such materials and make of them interesting text books for the children.

The Cause will gradually produce people who would answer these needs. It is only a question of time. What we should strive to do is to stimulate different individuals who have the talent to attempt the task.
(October 19, 1932 to an individual believer)

139. You have asked him for detailed information concerning the Bahá'í educational program; there is as yet no such thing as a Bahá'í curriculum, and there are no Bahá'í publications exclusively devoted to this subject, since the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá do not present a definite and detailed educational system, but simply offer certain basic principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that should guide future Bahá'í educationalists in their efforts to formulate an adequate teaching curriculum which would be in full harmony with the spirit of the Bahá'í Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements and needs of the modern age.

These basic principles are available in the sacred writings of the Cause, and should be carefully studied, and gradually incorporated in various college and university programs. But the task of formulating a system of education which would be officially recognized by the Cause, and enforced as such throughout the Bahá'í world is one which the present-day generation of believers cannot obviously undertake, and which has to be gradually accomplished by Bahá'í scholars and educationalists of the future.
(June 7, 1939 to an individual believer)
 
==Nature and Purpose of Education==
===Financing Education===

Many different methods of financing education exist throughout the world today. The Baha'i writings offer some suggestions.

7. Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is required for their instruction, if he be wealthy, and if not the matter devolveth upon the House of Justice. Verily, have We made it a shelter for the poor and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My Glory, My loving kindness, My Mercy, that have compassed the world.
(Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, pages 15-16)

8. Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted person a portion of what he or she earneth through trade, agriculture or other occupation, for the training and education of children, to be spent for this purpose with the knowledge of the Trustees of the House of Justice.
(From Tablet of the World, published in Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, page 90).

45. And among the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh is the promotion of education. Every child must be instructed in sciences as much as is necessary. If the parents are able to provide the expenses of this education, it is all right, otherwise the community must provide the means for the teaching of that child.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 227, page 304)

===Discipline, Perseverance and Order Needed===

Schools should be places of discipline and order. Perseverance is needed to bring about good education.

46. There are certain pillars which have been established as the unshakable supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is learning and the use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness, and insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of Almighty God.
To promote knowledge is thus an inescapable duty imposed on every one of the friends of God. It is incumbent upon that Spiritual Assembly, that assemblage of God, to exert every effort to educate the children, so that from infancy they will be trained in Bahá'í conduct and the ways of God, and will, even as young plants, thrive and flourish in the soft-flowing waters that are the counsels and admonitions of the Blessed Beauty. Work then with heart and soul, loose your tongues to further this endeavor, sacrifice your possessions so that the School of 'Ishqábád* will ever advance in discipline and order.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 97, page 126)

*See God Passes by, pages 300, 301, 361

71. O ye the cherished loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Bahá! One of the friends hath sent us a letter regarding the school at 'Ishqábád, to the effect that, praised be God, the friends there are now working hard to get the school in order, and have appointed teachers well qualified for their task, and that from this time forward the greatest care will be devoted to the supervision and management of the school.

It is likewise my hope that the favors and bestowals of God, the bountiful King, will encompass you, so that the friends may come to excel the others in all things.

One of the most important of undertakings is the education of children, for success and prosperity depend upon service to and worship of God, the Holy, the All-Glorified.

Among the greatest of all great services is the education of children, and promotion of the various sciences, crafts and arts. Praised be God, ye are now exerting strenuous efforts toward this end. The more ye persevere in this most important task, the more will ye witness the confirmations of God, to such a degree that ye yourselves will be astonished.
This verily is a matter beyond all doubt, a pledge that shall certainly be redeemed.

104. The Sunday school for the children in which the Tablets and Teachings of Bahá'u'lláh are read, and the Word of God is recited for the children is indeed a blessed thing. You must certainly continue this organized activity without cessation, and attach importance to it, so that day by day it may grow and be quickened with the breaths of the Holy Spirit. If this activity is well organized, rest thou assured that it will yield great results. Firmness and steadfastness, however, are necessary, otherwise it will continue for some time, but later be gradually forgotten. Perseverance is an essential condition. In every project firmness and steadfastness will undoubtedly lead to good results; otherwise it will exist for some days, and then be discontinued.
===Principles of School===

The Baha'i writings describe the purpose of schools and offer guidelines for their functioning.

74. Make ye every effort to improve the Tarbíyat School** and to develop order and discipline in this institution. Utilize every means to make this School a garden of the All-Merciful, from which the lights of learning will cast their beams, and wherein the children, whether Bahá'í or other, will be educated to such a degree as to become God's gifts to man, and the pride of the human race. Let them make the greatest progress in the shortest span of time, let them open wide their eyes and uncover the inner realities of all things, become proficient in every art and skill, and learn to comprehend the secrets of all things even as they are;this faculty being one of the clearly evident effects of servitude to the Holy Threshold.

It is certain that ye will make every effort to bring this about, and will also draw up plans for the opening of a number of schools. These schools for academic studies must at the same time be training centres in behavior and conduct, and they must favor character and conduct above the sciences and arts. Good behavior and high moral character must come first, for unless the character be trained, acquiring knowledge will only prove injurious. Knowledge is praiseworthy when it is coupled with ethical conduct and a virtuous character; otherwise it is a deadly poison, a frightful danger. A physician of evil character, and who betrayeth his trust, can bring on death, and become the source of numerous infirmities and diseases.
Devote ye the utmost attention to this matter, for the basic, the foundation-principle of a school is first and foremost moral training, character building, and the rectification of conduct.
------------------------
**The first school owned and operated by the Bahá'í community of Persia, located in Tihrán. See God Passes By, pages 299, 363, 371, 372 for references to the establishment and later forced closure of Bahá'í schools in Persia.

81. As to the organization of the schools: If possible the children should all wear the same kind of clothing, even if the fabric is varied. It is preferable that the fabric as well should be uniform; if however, this is not possible, there is no harm done. The more cleanly the pupils are, the better; they should be immaculate. The school must be located in a place where the air is delicate and pure. The children must be carefully trained to be most courteous and well-behaved. They must be constantly encouraged and made eager to gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that from their earliest years they will be taught to have high aims, to conduct themselves well, to be chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful resolve and firm of purpose in all things. Let them not jest and trifle, but earnestly advance unto their goals, so that in every situation they will be found resolute and firm.

Training in morals and good conduct is far more important than book learning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, well-behaved;even though he be ignorant;is preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and arts. The reason for this is that the child who conducts himself well, even though he be ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even though he be learned. If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the result is light upon light.

Children are even as a branch that is fresh and green; they will grow up in whatever way you train them. Take the utmost care to give them high ideals and goals, so that once they come of age, they will cast their beams like brilliant candles on the world, and will not be defiled by lusts and passions in the way of animals, heedless and unaware, but instead will set their hearts on achieving everlasting honor and acquiring all the excellences of humankind.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 110, pages 135-6)
===Schools Must be Established and Supervised===

Schools and institutions of higher education must be established so that every person may receive an adequate education.

69. 0 ye recipients of the favors of God! In this new and wondrous Age, the unshakable foundation is the teaching of sciences and arts. According to explicit Holy Texts, every child must be taught crafts and arts, to the degree that is needful. Wherefore, in every city and village, schools must be established and every child in that city or village is to engage in study to the necessary degree.

It followeth that whatever soul shall offer his aid to bring this about will assuredly be accepted at the Heavenly Threshold, and extolled by the Company on high.

Since ye have striven hard toward this all-important end, it is my hope that ye will reap your reward from the Lord of clear tokens and signs, and that the glances of heavenly grace will turn your way.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 109, pages 134-5)

117. They (the Local Spiritual Assemblies) must promote by every means in their power the material, as well as the spiritual, enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of children, institute, whenever possible, Bahá'í educational institutions, organize and supervise their work, and provide the best means for their progress and development.
(March 12,1923 to the Bahá'ís of America, Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Japan and Australasia, published in Principles of Bahá'í Administration, page 40)

122. In philanthropic enterprises and acts of charity, in promotion of the general welfare and furtherance of the public good including that of every group without any exception whatever, let the beloved of God attract the favorable attention of all, and lead all the rest.

Let them, freely and without charge, open the doors of their schools and their higher institutions for the study of sciences and the liberals arts, to non-Bahá'í children and youth who are poor and in need.

. . . And next is the propagation of learning and the promulgation of Bahá'í rules of conduct, practices and laws. At this time, when the nation has awakened out of its sleep of negligence, and the Government has begun to consider the promotion and expansion of its educational establishment, let the Bahá'í representatives in that country arise in such a manner that as a result of their high endeavors in every hamlet, village and town, of every province and district, preliminary measures will be taken for the setting up of institutions for the study of sciences, the liberal arts and religion. Let Bahá'í children without any exceptions learn the fundamentals of reading and writing and familiarize themselves with the rules of conduct, the customs, practices and laws as set forth in the Book of God; and let them, in the new branches of knowledge, in the arts and technology of the day, in pure and praiseworthy characteristics, Bahá'í conduct, the Bahá'í way of life;became so distinguished above the rest that all other communities, whether Islamic, Zoroastrian, Christian, Judaic or materialist, will of their own volition and most gladly enter their children in such advanced Bahá'í institutions of learning and entrust them to the care of Bahá'í instructors.

So too is the promotion and execution of the laws set forth in the Book of God.
(January 1929 to the believers of the East;translated from the Persian)

===Obligations of Spiritual Assemblies===

The Spiritual Assemblies have the responsibility to promote education and establish schools.

121. Among the sacred obligations devolving upon the Spiritual Assemblies is the promotion of learning, the establishing of schools and creation of the necessary academic equipment and facilities for every boy and girl.
Every child without exception must from his earliest years make a thorough study of the art of reading and writing, and according to his own tastes and inclinations and the degree of his capacity and powers, devote extreme diligence to the acquisition of learning, beneficial arts and skills, various languages, speech, and contemporary technology.

To assist the children of the poor in the attainment of these accomplishments, and particularly in learning the basic subjects, is incumbent upon the members of the Spiritual Assemblies, and is accounted as one of the obligations laid upon the conscience of the trustees of God in every land.

'He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My Glory, My loving-kindness, My Mercy, that have compassed the world.'
(June 8, 1925 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia;translated from the Persian) 

===Education Promotes the Advancement and Welfare of World===

The importance of education is emphasized in the Baha'i writings. It is the cause of advancement, prosperity and well being.

6. We prescribe unto all men that which will lead to the exaltation of the Word of God amongst His servants, and likewise, to the advancement of the world of being and the uplift of souls. To this end, the greatest means is education of the child. To this must each and all hold fast. We have verily laid this charge upon you in manifold Tablets as well as in My Most Holy Book. Well is it with him who deferreth thereto. We ask of God that He will assist each and every one to obey this inescapable command that hath appeared and been caused to descend through the Pen of the Ancient of Days.

36. Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization bring honor, prosperity, independence and freedom to a government and its people.
(The Secret of Divine Civilization, page 111)

34. Close investigation will show that the primary cause of oppression and injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity and disorder, is the people's lack religious faith and the fact that they are uneducated. When, for example, the people are genuinely religious and are literate and well-schooled, and a difficulty presents itself, they can apply to the local authorities; if they do not meet with justice and secure their rights and if they see that the conduct of the local government is incompatible with the Divine good pleasure and the king's justice, they can then take their case to higher courts and describe the deviation of the local administration from the spiritual law. Those courts can then send for the local records of the case and in this way justice will be done. At present, however, because of their inadequate schooling, most of the population lack even the vocabulary to explain what they want.
(The Secret of Divine Civilization, page 18)
===Education Must be Promoted===

The promotion of education is the most urgent requirement, and the most important of all human endeavors. Education is a vital and essential institution.

35. The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward. The principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples is ignorance. Today the mass of the people are uninformed even as to ordinary affairs, how much less do they grasp the core of the important problems and complex needs of the time.
(The Secret of Divine Civilization, page 109)

70. 0 ye of high resolve and noble aims! Your letter was eloquent, its contents original and sensitively expressed, and it betokened your great and praiseworthy efforts to educate the children, both girls and boys. This is among the most important of all human endeavors. Every possible means of education must be made available to Bahá'í children, tender plants of the Divine garden, for in this consisteth the illumination of humankind.
Praised be God, the friends in 'Ishqábád have laid a solid foundation, an unassailable base. It was in the City of Love* that the first Bahá'í House of Worship was erected; and today in this city the means for the education of children are also being developed, inasmuch as even during the war years this duty was not neglected, and indeed deficiencies were made up for. Now must ye widen the scope of your endeavors and draw up plans to establish schools for higher education, so that the City of Love will become the Bahá'í focal centre for science and the arts. Thanks to the bountiful assistance of the Blessed Beauty, means for this will be provided.
Devote ye particular attention to the school for girls, for the greatness of this wondrous Age will be manifested as a result of progress in the world of women. This is why ye observe that in every land the world of women is on the march, and this is due to the impact of the Most Great Manifestation, and the power of the teachings of God.

Instruction in the schools must begin with instruction in religion. Following religious training, and the binding of the child's heart to the love of God, proceed with his education in the other branches of knowledge.
_________________
*'Ishqábád in the Persian language means &quot;City of Love.&quot;

72. O ye true servants of the Lord of Hosts!
The services ye are rendering in support of the Ta'yíd School* merit the highest praise. It is certain that God in His bounty will send down His manifold, heavenly blessings upon you.

The believers are in duty bound to establish schools where children can acquire knowledge, and since these friends have pledged themselves to make sacrifices in this connection, and are contributing to the support of the Ta'yíd School, 'Abdu'l-Bahá in all lowliness and submission offereth thanks and praise to the Kingdom of Mysteries. He asketh that bounties will be sent down unto you, and peace of mind, so that ye may succeed in rendering this most laudable service with ease and joy.

O Thou Provider! These souls are doing good. Make them dear to both worlds, make them the recipients of measureless grace. Thou art the Powerful, Thou art the Able, Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Incomparable Lord.

*A Bahá'í school for boys in Hamadán, Persia.

73. O thou who hast arisen to serve the Cause of God with all thy being!
What thou hadst written as to the school is a cause for great rejoicing, and delighteth the heart. The friends one and all were cheered and refreshed by this news.

This school is one of the vital and essential institutions which indeed support and bulwark the edifice of humankind. God willing, it will develop and be perfected along every line. Once this school hath, in every respect, been perfected, once it hath been made to flourish and to surpass all other schools, then, each following the other, more and more schools must be established.

Our meaning is that the friends must direct their attention toward the education, and training of all the children of Persia, so that all of them, having, in the school of true learning, achieved the power of understanding and come to know the inner realities of the universe, will go on to uncover the signs and mysteries of God, a will find themselves illumined by the lights of the knowledge of the Lord, and by His love. This truly is the very best way to educate all peoples.

83. As to the education of children, exert every effort to further this; it is of the utmost importance. So too, the education of girls in all the rules of righteous conduct, that they may grow up with a good character and high standards of behavior. For mothers are the first educators of the child, and every child at the beginning of life is like a fresh and tender branch in his parents' hands. His father and mother can train him in any way they choose.

===Education for Girls===

As they will become the first educators of children, the education of girls takes precedence over that of boys. Education is a means for women to achieve full equality with men. As such it is very important. Some qualities and virtues to be taught are given.

84. 0 esteemed handmaid! . . . Thou hast written about the girls' school. What was previously written still holdeth true. There can be no improvement unless the girls are brought up in schools and centres of learning, unless they are taught the sciences and other branches of knowledge, and unless they acquire the manifold arts, as necessary, and are divinely trained. For the day will come when these girls will become mothers. Mothers are the first educators of children, who establish virtues in the child's inner nature. They encourage the child to acquire perfections and goodly manners, warn him against unbecoming qualities, and encourage him to show forth resolve, firmness, and endurance under hardship, and to advance on the high road to progress. Due regard for the education of girls is, therefore, necessary. This is a very important subject and it should be administered and organized under the aegis of the Spiritual Assembly.

85. 0 ye handmaids of the Merciful!
The school for girls taketh precedence over the school for boys, for it is incumbent upon the girls of this glorious era to be fully versed in the various branches of knowledge, in sciences and the arts and all the wonders of this pre-eminent time, that they may then educate their children and train them from their earliest days in the ways of perfection.
If, as she ought, the mother possesseth the learning and accomplishments of humankind, her children, like unto angels, will be fostered in all excellence, in right conduct and beauty. Therefore the School for Girls that hath been established in that place must be made the object of the deep concern and high endeavors of the friends. The teachers of that school are handmaids close to the Sacred Threshold, for they are of those who, obedient to the commandments of the Blessed Beauty, have arisen to educate the girl children. The day will come when those children will be mothers, and each one of them in her deep gratitude will offer up prayers and supplications to Almighty God and ask that her teachers will be granted joy and well-being forever, and a high station in the Kingdom of God. Name ye this school the Mawhibat School (The School of Bounty).*
______________________
*A Bahá'í school for girls in Hamadán, Persia.

86. O handmaid of the Most High!
Our hearts rejoiced at thy letter concerning a school for girls.**
Praised be God that there is now a school of this type in Tihrán where young maidens can, through His bounty, receive an education and with all vigor acquire the accomplishments of humankind. Ere long will women in every field keep pace with the men.

Until now, in Persia, the means for women's advancement were non-existent. But now, God be thanked, ever since the dawning of the Morn of Salvation, they have been going forward day by day. The hope is that they will take the lead in virtues and attainments, in closeness to the Court of Almighty God, in faith and certitude;and that the women of the East will become the envy of the women of the West.

Praised be God, thou art confirmed in thy service, art exerting every effort in this work and taking great pains; and so, too, the teacher in the school, Miss Lillian Kappes.*** Give her my most affectionate greetings.
---------------------
**The Tarbíyat School, Tihrán, Persia.
***See Star of the West Vol, XI, No. 19, pages 324-6.

87. O ye daughters of the Kingdom!
In past centuries the girl children of Persia were deprived of all instruction. They had neither school nor academy, no kindly tutor and no teacher. Now in this greatest of centuries the bounty of the All-Bountiful hath encompassed the girls as well, and many schools have been founded in Persia for the education of girl children;but what is missing from them is character training, and this despite the fact that such training is more important than instruction, for it is the primary accomplishment of humankind.

Praised be God, a school for girls hath now been established in Hamadán.**** Ye who are the teachers thereof must devote more of your efforts to character training than instruction, and must raise up your girl children to be modest and chaste, of
good character and conduct;and in addition must teach them the various branches of knowledge.

If ye follow this course, the confirmations of the All-Glorious Kingdom, in a great rolling swell, will rise and surge above that school.
My hope is that ye will succeed in this.

===Education of Orphans===
All should have an opportunity for an education, especially those who might otherwise be deprived.

90. In this holy Cause the question of orphans hath the utmost importance. The greatest consideration must be shown towards orphans; they must be taught, trained and educated. The Teachings of Bahá'u'lláh, especially, must by all means be given to them as far as is possible.
I supplicate God that thou mayest become a kind parent to orphaned children, quickening them with the fragrances of the Holy Spirit, so that they will attain the age of maturity as true servants of the world of humanity and as bright candles in the assemblage of mankind.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 112, page 138)

91. 0 steadfast in the Covenant!
Your letter hath come and hath occasioned the utmost joy, with its news that, praised be God, in Hamadán a welfare and relief association hath been established I trust that this will become a source of general prosperity and assistance, and that means will be provided to set the hearts of the poor and weak at rest, and to educate the orphans and other children.

The question of training the children and looking after the orphans is extremely important, but most important of all is the education of girl children, for these girls will one day be mothers, and the mother is the first teacher of the child. In whatever way she reareth the child, so will the child become, and the results of that first training will remain with the individual throughout his entire life, and it would be most difficult to alter them. And how can a mother, herself ignorant and untrained, educate her child? It is therefore clear that the education of girls is of far greater consequence than that of boys. This fact is extremely important, and the matter must be seen to with the greatest energy and dedication.

God sayeth in the Qur'án that 'they shall not be equals, those who have knowledge and those who have it not.'* Ignorance is thus utterly to be blamed, whether in male or female; indeed, in the female its harm is greater.
I hope, therefore, that the friends will make strenuous efforts to educate their children, sons and daughters alike. This is verily the truth, and outside the truth there is manifestly naught save perdition.

*Qur'án 39:12

===Role of Parents in Education===
The responsibility of parents in the education of their children is great. The mother and father are assigned different duties in training their children. These duties are described, and their importance emphasized.

98. O maid-servants of the Merciful! It is incumbent upon you to train the children from their earliest babyhood! It is incumbent upon you to beautify their morals! It is incumbent upon you to attend to them under all aspects and circumstances, inasmuch as God;glorified and exalted is He!;hath ordained mothers to be the primary trainers of children and infants. This is a great and important affair and a high and exalted position, and it is not allowable to slacken therein at all!

If thou walkest in this right path, thou wouldst become a real mother to the children, both spiritually and materially.
(Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, Vol. III, page 606)

99. Deliver my longing and greetings to the consolation of thine eye* . . . and to thy younger son. . . . Verily I love them both even as a compassionate father loveth his dear children. As to thee, have for them an abundant love and exert thine utmost in training them, so that their being may grow through the milk of the love of God, forasmuch as it is the duty of parents to perfectly and thoroughly train their children.

There are also certain sacred duties on children toward parents, which duties are written in the Book of God, as belonging to God.** The (children's) prosperity in this world and the Kingdom depends upon the good pleasure of parents, and without this they will be in manifest loss.
(Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, Vol. II, pages 262-3)
_________________________
*&quot;Consolation of thine eye&quot;;idiomatic Persian expression meaning &quot;child.&quot;
**In Questions and Answers, an appendix to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh lays upon children the obligation of serving their parents and categorically states that after the recognition of the oneness of God, the most important of all duties for children is to have due regard for the rights of their parents.

100. The father must always endeavor to educate his son and to acquaint him with the heavenly teachings. He must give him advice and exhort him at all times, teach him praiseworthy conduct and character, enable him to receive training at school and to be instructed in such arts and sciences as are deemed useful and necessary. In brief, let him instil into his mind the virtues and perfections of the world of humanity. Above all he should continually call to his mind the remembrance of God so that his throbbing veins and arteries may pulsate with the love of God.

96. Today it is obligatory for the loved ones of God, and their imperative duty, to educate the children in reading, writing, the various branches of knowledge, and the expansion of consciousness, that on all levels they may go forward day by day.

The mother is the first teacher of the child. For children, at the beginning 
of life, are fresh and tender as a young twig, and can be trained in any fashion you desire. If you rear the child to be straight, he will grow straight, in perfect symmetry. It is clear that the mother is the first teacher and that it is she who establisheth the character and conduct of the child.

Wherefore, O ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, the best of all ways to worship Him is to educate the children and train them in all the perfections of humankind; and no nobler deed than this can be imagined.

101. 0 dear one of 'Abdu'l-Bahá! Be the son of thy father and be the fruit of that tree. Be a son that hath been born of his soul and heart and not only of water and clay. A real son is such one as hath branched from the spiritual part of a man. I ask God that thou mayest be at all times confirmed and strengthened.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 117, page 140)

143. With reference to the question of the training of children; given the emphasis placed by Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá on the necessity for the parents to train their children while still in their tender age, it would seem preferable that they should receive their first training at home at the hand of their mother, rather than be sent to a nursery. Should circumstances, however, compel a Bahá'í mother to adopt the latter course, there can be no objection.**
(November 13, 1940 to an individual believer)
_____________________________
**This advice was given in the case of some mothers who wanted to place their children (ages 2 1/2;3 years) in a nursery school because there were no playmates in the vicinity and because they felt they would not have adequate time for the children for several months after the birth of their babies.
===Education is Compulsory===

All must receive an education.

114. Bahá'u'lláh has announced that inasmuch as ignorance and lack of education are barriers of separation among mankind, all must receive training and instruction. Through this provision the lack of mutual understanding will be remedied and the unity of mankind furthered and advanced. Universal education is a universal law.
(The Promulgation of Universal Peace, page 300)

123. The Bahá'í Faith . . . advocates compulsory education . . .
(June 17, 1933 to the High Commissioner of Palestine)

115. The education of each child is compulsory. . . . In addition to this widespread education each child must be taught a profession, art, or trade, so that every member of the community will be enabled to earn his own livelihood. Work done in the spirit of service is the highest form of worship.
('Abdu'l-Bahá on Divine Philosophy, page 78)

===Bahá'í Education: Foundation of Law of God and Basis for Happiness===

A Baha'i education is the foundation of the Law of God, and the bedrock of the Faith. It is the basis for human happiness in both this world and the next.

48. My wish is that these children should receive a Bahá'í education, so that they may progress both here and in the Kingdom, and rejoice thy heart.
In a time to come, morals will degenerate to an extreme degree. It is essential that children be reared in the Bahá'í way, that they may find happiness both in this world and the next. If not, they shall be beset by sorrows and troubles, for human happiness is founded upon spiritual behavior.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 100, page 127)

49. 0 thou who art enamored of the holy breathings of God!
Child education is a matter of the utmost importance. The infant, while yet a suckling, must receive Bahá'í training, and the loving spirit of Christ and Bahá'u'lláh must be breathed into him, that he may be reared in accord with the verities of the Gospel and the Most Holy Book.

54. 0 ye two servants at the Holy Threshold! We have been greatly cheered and refreshed to know that ye have organized meetings for the education of children.

Whoso is active in those meetings whether as a teacher of the children or a sponsor, will certainly become the recipient of confirmations from the invisible Realm, and endless bounties will compass him about.
With great joy, therefore, encouragement is offered for this highly laudable endeavor, that ye may witness an exceeding great reward.

Await ye the sure and certain confirmations of the All-Merciful.

56. 0 steadfast in the Covenant!
Your letter hath come and imparted great delight, with its word that, praised be God, the youth of the Abhá Paradise are verdant and tender, from showers scattered out of clouds of heavenly grace; that they thrive and flourish in the April rains of heavenly guidance, and are progressing day by day.

It is certain that each and every one of them will grow to be as a banner of guidance, a symbol of the bestowals that come from the Realm of the All-Glorious. They will be sweet-singing nightingales in the gardens of knowledge, gazelles delicate and comely, roaming the plains of the love of God. You must attach the greatest importance to the education of children, for this is the foundation of the Law of God, and the bedrock of the edifice of His Faith.

If it were known how much joy you have imparted through what hath been done for the children, the believers would surely educate all their children in the same way.

==Human Nature==

If we do not understand human nature, we will not be able to properly help individuals develop along the right lines. Many misconceptions about who we are and how we develop are made clear in the following passages. We all differ as the result of the innate, inherited and acquired character.

38. There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human dignity will prevent man from committing evil actions and ensure his spiritual and material perfection. That is, that an individual who is characterized with natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving zeal, will, without any consideration for the severe punishments consequent on evil acts, or for the great rewards of righteousness, instinctively refrain from inflicting harm on his fellow men and will hunger and thirst to do good. And yet, if we ponder the lessons of history it will become evident that this very sense of honor and dignity is itself one of the bounties deriving from the instructions of the Prophets of God. We also observe in infants the signs of aggression and lawlessness, and that if a child is deprived of a teacher's instructions his undesirable qualities increase from one moment to the next. 

It is therefore clear that the emergence of this natural sense of human dignity and honor is the result of education. Secondly, even if We grant for the sake of the argument that instinctive intelligence and an innate moral quality would prevent wrongdoing, it is obvious that individuals so characterized are as rare as the philosopher's stone. An assumption of this sort cannot be validated by mere words, it must be supported by the facts. Let us see what power in creation impels the masses toward righteous aims and deeds!

Aside from this, if that rare individual who does exemplify such a facility should also become an embodiment of the fear of God, it is certain that his strivings toward righteousness would be strongly reinforced.
(The Secret of Divine Civilization, pages 97-8)

*Cf. Genesis 1:26.

39. As to the differences among human beings and the superiority or inferiority of some individuals to others, the materialists are of two schools of thought: one group is of the opinion that these differences and the superior qualities of some individuals are in-born, and are, as they would put it, an exigency of nature. According to them, it is obvious that differences within the species are inherent. For example, there are, in nature, different kinds of trees; animals, too, are varied in their nature; even minerals vary naturally among themselves and you have here a quarry filled with stones, there a mine of rubies, translucent and richly red; here a shell with pearl enclosed, there only a bit of clay.

The other school of traditional philosophers holdeth to the view that the differences among individuals and the varying levels of intellects and talents derive from education: for with training, a crooked branch can grow straight, and a barren tree of the desert can be domesticated; it can be grafted and made to bear fruit, which may be bitter, but with time turneth sweet. At first, its fruit may be small; but it will grow large and full of flavor, a delight to the taste.

The strongest proof adduced by the second group is this, that the tribes of Africa are, generally speaking, ignorant and wild, while the civilized peoples of America are, in general, possessed of wisdom and understanding, which proveth that the difference between these two peoples is due to education and experience. Such are the stated views of the philosophers.
The Manifestations of God, on the other hand, affirm that differences are demonstrably and indisputably innate, and that 'We have caused some of you to excel others&quot;* is a proven and inescapable fact. It is certain that human beings are, their very nature, different one from the other. Observe a small group of children, born of the same parents, attending the same school, receiving the same education, living on the same diet: some, becoming well educated, will achieve a high degree of advancement: some will reach a middle level; and some will not prove educable at all. It is therefore clear that the disparity among individuals is due to differences of degree which are innate.

But the Manifestations also consider that training and education demonstrably exert a tremendous influence. If, for example, a child is deprived of schooling he will certainly remain ignorant, and his knowledge will be limited to what he is able find out for himself; but if he is brought to a qualified teacher to study the sciences and arts, he will learn of the discoveries made by thousands of other human beings. Thus education is a guide to those who have gone astray, it maketh the blind to see; it bestoweth judgement on the foolish, and a yield of greatness on the unproductive, it causeth the mute to speak, and turneth the false dawn into the true morning's light; through it the tiny seed will become a towering palm, and the runaway slave, a reigning king.

Thus is it certain that education exerteth an influence, and for this reason the Manifestations of God, the Well-Springs of His mercy, are raised up in the world, that through the breaths of holiness They may educate the human race, and make of the sucking child a strong and valiant man. Through them will the outcasts of the earth become the cherished companions of Heaven, and the portionless receive their due. __________________
*Qur'án 17:22

40. Question.;How many kinds of character has man and what is the cause of the differences and varieties in men?
Answer.;He has the innate character, the inherited character, and the acquired character which is gained by education.
With regard to the innate character, although the divine creation is purely good, yet the varieties of natural qualities in man come from the difference of degree; all are excellent, but they are more or less so, according to the degree. So all mankind possess intelligence and capacities, but the intelligence, the capacity and the worthiness of men differ. This is evident.
For example, take a number of children of one family, of one place, of one school, instructed by one teacher, reared on the same food, in the same climate with the same clothing, and studying the same lessons;it is certain that among these children some will be clever in the sciences, some will be of average ability and some dull. Hence it is clear that in the original nature there exists a difference of degree and varieties of worthiness and capacity. This difference does not imply good or evil but is simply a difference of degree. One has the highest degree, another the medium degree, and another the lowest degree. So man exists; the animal, the plant and the mineral exist also;but the degrees of these four existences vary. What a difference between the existence of man and of the animal! Yet both are existences. It is evident that in existence there are differences of degrees.

The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and weakness of constitution;that is to say, when the two parents are weak, the children will be weak; if they are strong, the children will be robust. In the same way; purity of blood has a great effect; for the pure germ is like the superior stock which exists in plants and animals. For example, you see that children born from a weak and feeble father and mother will naturally have a feeble constitution and weak nerves; they will be afflicted, and will have neither patience, nor endurance, nor resolution nor perseverance, and will be hasty; for the children inherit the weakness and debility of their parents.

Besides this, an especial blessing is conferred on some families and some generations. Thus it is an especial blessing that from among the descendants of Abraham should have come all the Prophets of the children of Israel. This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent: to Moses from his father and mother, to Christ from his mother's line; also to Muhammad and the Báb, and to all the Prophets and the Holy Manifestations of Israel. The Blessed Beauty is also a lineal descendant of Abraham, for Abraham had other sons besides Ishmael and Isaac who in those days migrated to the lands of Persia and Afghanistan, and the Blessed Beauty is one of their descendants.

Hence it is evident that inherited character also exists, and to such a degree that if the characters are not in conformity with their origin, although they belong physically to that lineage, spiritually they are not considered members of the family, like Canaan,* who is not reckoned as being of the race of Noah.

But the difference of the qualities with regard to culture is very great, for education has great influence. Through education the ignorant become learned, the cowardly become valiant. Through cultivation the crooked branch becomes straight; the acid, bitter fruit of the mountains and woods becomes sweet and delicious; and the five-petalled flower becomes hundred petalled. Through education savage nations become civilized, and even the animals become domesticated. Education must be considered as most important, for as diseases in the world of bodies are extremely contagious, so, in the same way, qualities of spirit and heart are extremely contagious. Education has a universal influence, and the differences caused by it are very great.
Perhaps some one will say that, since the capacity and worthiness of men differ therefore, the difference of capacity certainly causes the difference of characters.**

But this is not so, for capacity is of two kinds: natural capacity and acquired capacity. The first, which is the creation of God, is purely good;in the creation of God there is no evil; but the acquired capacity has become the cause of the appearance of evil. For example, God has created all men in such a manner and has given them such a constitution and such capacities, that they are benefitted by sugar and honey and harmed and destroyed by poison. This nature and constitution is innate, and God has given it equally to all mankind. But man begins little by little to accustom himself to poison by taking a small quantity each day, and gradually increasing it, until he reaches such a point that he cannot live without a gramme of opium every day. The natural capacities are thus completely perverted. Observe how much the natural capacity and constitution can be changed, until by different habits and training they become entirely perverted. One does not criticize vicious people because of their innate capacities and nature, but rather for their acquired capacities and nature.

In creation there is no evil; all is good. Certain qualities and natures innate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in reality. For example, from the beginning of his life you can see in a nursing child the signs of greed, of anger and of temper. Then, it may be said, good and evil are innate in the reality of man, and this is contrary to the pure goodness of nature and creation. The answer to this is that greed, which is to ask for something more, is a praiseworthy quality provided that it is used suitably. So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge, or to become compassionate, generous and just, it is most praise- worthy If he exercises his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are like ferocious beasts, it is very praiseworthy. But if he does not use these qualities in a right way, they are blameworthy.

===Prevention of Criminal or Harmful Acts===

The writings about the treatment of criminals and the causes of crime offer insights into education. The importance of proper training from infancy is stressed, along with the proper use of reward and punishment.

41. As to the difference between that material civilization now prevailing, and the divine civilization which will be one of the benefits to derive from the House of Justice, it is this: material civilization, through the power of punitive and retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from criminal acts; and notwithstanding this, while laws to retaliate against and punish a man are continually proliferating, as ye can see, no laws exist to reward him.
In all the cities of Europe and America, vast buildings have been erected to serve as jails for the criminals.

Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member of society that no one with the exception of a negligible few, will undertake to commit a crime. There is thus a great difference between the prevention of crime through measures that are violent and retaliatory, and so training the people, and enlightening them, and spiritualizing them, that without any fear of punishment or vengeance to come, they will shun all criminal acts. They will, indeed, look upon the very commission of a crime as a great disgrace and in itself the harshest of punishments. They will become enamored of human perfections, and will consecrate their lives to whatever will bring light to the world and will further those qualities which are acceptable at the Holy Threshold of God.

See then how wide is the difference between material civilization and divine. With force and punishments, material civilization seeketh to restrain the people from mischief, from inflicting harm on society and committing crimes. But in a divine civilization, the individual is so conditioned that with no fear of punishment, he shunneth the perpetration of crimes, seeth the crime itself as the severest of torments, and with alacrity and joy, setteth himself to acquiring the virtues of humankind, to furthering human progress, and to spreading light across the world.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 105, pages 132-3)

42. Among the safeguards of the Holy Faith is the training of children, and this is among the weightiest of principles in all the Divine Teachings. Thus from the very beginning mothers must rear their infants in the cradle of good morals;for it is the mothers who are the first educators;so that, when the child cometh to maturity, he will prove to be endowed with all the virtues and qualities that are worthy of praise.

And further, according to the Divine commandments, every child must learn reading and writing, and acquire such branches of knowledge as are useful and necessary, as well as learning an art or skill. The utmost care must be devoted to these matters; any neglect of them, any failure to act on them, is not permissible.

Observe how many penal institutions, houses of detention and places of torture are made ready to receive the sons of men, the purpose being to prevent them, by punitive measures, from committing terrible crimes;whereas this very torment and punishment only increaseth depravity, and by such means the desired aim cannot be properly achieved. Therefore must the individual be trained from his infancy in such a way that he will never undertake to commit a crime, will, rather, direct all his energies to the acquisition of excellence, and will look upon the very commission of an evil deed as in itself the harshest of all punishments, considering the sinful act itself to be far more grievous than any prison sentence. For it is possible so to train the individual that, although crime may not be completely done away with, still it will become very rare.

The purport is this, that to train the character of humankind is one of the weightiest commandments of God, and the influence of such training is the same as that which the sun exerteth over tree and fruit. Children must be most carefully watched over, protected and trained; in such consisteth true parenthood and parental mercy.

Otherwise, the children will turn into weeds growing wild, and become the cursed, Infernal Tree,* knowing not right from wrong, distinguishing not the highest of human qualities from all that is mean and vile; they will be brought up in vainglory, and will be hated of the Forgiving Lord.
Wherefore doth every child, new-risen in the garden of Heavenly love, require the utmost training and care.

* The Zaqqúm, Qur'án 37:60, 44:43
===Discipline===

Some philosophies of education suggest that the best approach is to leave children to develop free from outside influences. The Baha'i writings recognize that education, training and discipline are needed to help the child properly develop. One of the most challenging and vital responsibilities of a teacher is maintaining a proper atmosphere in the class and developing individual discipline. This topic receives much attention today as educators try to find ways to improve both individual and class behavior. The Bahá'í guidance represents a minority view among those currently in practice, which more closely approximate the type of control 'Abdu'l-Bahá attributes to material civilization. This training is intimately related to character education and addressing the character and conduct parts of the curriculum. The first quote is a good summary of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's advice on discipline. Although it was addressed to mothers, its applicability to teachers is apparent.

97b. Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of children is of the first importance. Let them put forth every effort in this regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in whatever way ye train it. Therefore is it incumbent upon the mothers to rear their little ones even as a gardener tendeth his young plants. Let them strive by day and by night to establish within their children faith and certitude, the fear of God, the love of the Beloved of the worlds, and all good qualities and traits. Whensoever a mother seeth that her child hath done well, let her praise and applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the slightest undesirable trait should manifest itself, let her counsel the child and punish him, and use means based on reason, even a slight verbal chastisement should this be necessary. It is not, however, permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child's character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal abuse.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 95, pages 124-5)

152. He is sorry to hear your little boy is not developing satisfactorily; very few children are really bad. They do, however, sometimes have complicated personalities and need very wise handling to enable them to grow into normal, moral, happy adults. If you feel convinced your son will really benefit from going to Father Flanagan's school you could send him there. But in general we should certainly always avoid sending Bahá'í children to orthodox religious schools, especially Catholic, as the children receive the imprint of religious beliefs we as believers know are out-dated and no longer for this age. He will especially pray for the solution of this problem.
(May 30, 1947 to an individual believer)

140. With regard to the statement attributed to 'Abdu'l-Bahá and which you have quoted in your letter regarding a 'problem child'; these statements of the Master, however true in their substance, should never be given a literal interpretation. 'Abdu'l-Bahá could have never meant that a child should be left to himself, entirely free. In fact Bahá'í education, just like any other system of education is based on the assumption that there are certain natural deficiencies in every child, no matter how gifted, which his educators, whether his parents, schoolmasters, or his spiritual guides and preceptors should endeavor to remedy. Discipline of some sort, whether physical, moral or intellectual, is indeed indispensable, and no training can be said to be complete and fruitful if it disregards this element. The child when born is far from being perfect. It is not only helpless, but actually is imperfect, and even is naturally inclined towards evil. He should be trained, his natural inclinations harmonized, adjusted and controlled, and if necessary suppressed or regulated, so as to ensure his healthy physical and moral development. Bahá'í parents cannot simply adopt an attitude of non-resistance towards their children, particularly those who are unruly and violent by nature. It is not even sufficient that they should pray on their behalf. Rather they should endeavor to inculcate, gently and patiently, into their youthful minds such principles of moral conduct and initiate them into the principles and teachings of the Cause with such tactful and loving care as would enable them to become 'true sons of God' and develop into loyal and intelligent citizens of His Kingdom. This is the high purpose which Bahá'u'lláh Himself has clearly defined as the chief goal of every education.
(July 9, 1939 to an individual believer)

149. The Guardian, in his remarks to Mrs. Maxwell about parents and children, wives and husbands relations in America meant that there is a tendency in that country for children to be too independent of the wishes of their parents and lacking in the respect due to them.
(July 22, 1943 to an individual believer)

150. Regarding your question about children fighting: the statement of the Master, not to strike back, should not be taken so extremely literally that Bahá'í children must accept to be bullied and thrashed. If they can manage to show a better way of settling disputes than by active self-defense, they should naturally do so.
(May 11, 1945 to an individual believer)

===Encouragement Rather Than Censure===

The role of praise and encouragement in teaching is a controversial topic. 'Abdu'l-Bahá's guidance on this matter could go far to improving the progress of students in schools, especially those who feel less intelligent.

52. As to thy question regarding the education of children: It behoveth thee to nurture them at the breast of the love of God, and urge them onward to 
the things of the spirit;that they may turn their faces unto God; that their ways may conform to the rules of good conduct and their character be second to none; that they make their own all the graces and praiseworthy qualities of humankind; that they acquire a sound knowledge of the various branches of learning;so that from the very beginning of life they may become spiritual beings, dwellers in the Kingdom, enamored of the sweet breaths of holiness, and may receive an education religious, spiritual, and of the Heavenly Realm. Verily will I call upon God to grant them a happy outcome in this.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 122, page 142)

110. If a pupil is told that his intelligence is less than his fellow-pupils, it is a very great drawback and handicap to progress. He must be encouraged to advance. . . .
(The Promulgation of universal Peace, pages 76-7)

113. The child must not be oppressed or censured because it is undeveloped; it must be patiently trained.
(The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pages 180-1 )

134. Shoghi Effendi was deeply saddened to learn from your letter . . . of the rather serious situation which your daughter's conduct and her general attitude towards the Cause have created. . . .

Although he highly deplores this fact, and is fully aware of the bad repercussions which it may have on the Cause, yet he feels that nothing short of your motherly care and love and of the counsels which you and the friends can give her, can effectively remedy this situation. Above all, you should be patient, and confident that your efforts to that end are being sustained and guided through the confirmations of Bahá'u'lláh. He is surely hearing your prayers, and will no doubt accept them, and thus hasten the gradual and complete materialization of your hopes and expectations for your daughter and for the Cause.

The Guardian would advise you, therefore, not to take any drastic action with regard to your daughter's attendance at the meetings. . . . For in this way there is much greater chance to reform her character than through force or any other drastic method. Love and kindness have far greater influence than punishment upon the improvement of human character.
The Guardian, therefore, trusts that by this means you will succeed in gradually introducing a fundamental change in your daughter's life, and also in making of her a better and truer believer. He is fervently praying on her behalf that she may fully attain this station.
(January 26, 1935 to an individual believer)

==Pedagogy==

Throughout the Baha'i writings, methods of instruction can be inferred from the voluminous material on teaching, especially teaching the Faith. There are also some specific instructions given to educators. It is hard to judge their applicability to general situations, but certainly some guidance can be extracted from them. Some of the following quotations also address curricular and administrative issues.

77. O steadfast in the Covenant! The method of instruction which ye have established, beginning with proofs of the existence of God and the oneness of God, the mission of the Prophets and Messengers and Their teachings, and the wonders of the universe, is highly suitable. Keep on with this. It is certain that the confirmations of God will attend you. It is also highly praiseworthy to memorize the Tablets, divine verses and sacred traditions.
Ye will surely exert every effort in teaching, and in furthering understanding.

78. As to the children: From the age of five their formal education must begin. That is, during the daytime they should be looked after in a place where there are teachers, and should learn good conduct.
Here they should be taught, in play, some letters and words and a little reading;as is done in certain countries where they fashion letters and words out of sweets and give them to the child. For example, they make an 'a' out of candy and say its name is 'a', or make a candy 'b' and call it 'b', and so on with the rest of the alphabet, giving these to the young child. In this way children will soon learn their letters. . . .

When the children are ready for bed, let the mother read or sing them the Odes of the Blessed Beauty, so that from their earliest years they will be educated by these verses of guidance.

79. 0 thou servant of God! Thou didst ask as to the education of children. Those children who, sheltered by the Blessed Tree, have set foot upon the world, those who are cradled in the Faith and are nurtured at the breast of grace;such must from the beginning receive spiritual training directly from their mothers. That is, the mother must continually call God to mind and make mention of Him, and tell of His greatness, and instill the fear of Him in the child, and rear the child gently, in the way of tenderness, and in extreme cleanliness. Thus from the very beginning of life every child will be refreshed by the gentle waftings of the love of God and will tremble with joy at the sweet scent of heavenly guidance. In this lieth the beginning of the process; it is the essential basis of all the rest.

And when the child hath reached the age where he can make distinctions, let him be placed in a Bahá'í school, in which at the beginning the Holy Texts are recited and religious concepts are taught. At this school the child is to study reading and writing as well as some fundamentals of the various branches of knowledge, such as can be learned by children.
To be specific, at the start the teacher must place a pen in the child's hand, arrange the children in groups, and instruct each group according to its capacity. When the children have, in a given place, been seated in rows, and each holdeth a pen, and each hath a paper before him, and the teacher hath suspended blackboards in front of the children, let him write thereon with his chalk and have the children copy what he hath written. For example, let the teacher write an alif (a) and say, 'This is an alif.' Let the children then copy it and repeat: 'This is an alif.' And so on, till the end of the alphabet. As soon as they properly recognize the letters, let the teacher make combinations of the letters, while the children follow his lead writing the combinations on their paper, until, by this method, they come to recognize all the letters, singly and combined in words. Let the teacher then proceed to writing sentences, while the children copy what he hath written, each on his own sheet of paper. Let the teacher then explain the meaning of the sentence to the children.

And once they have become skilled in the Persian tongue, let the teacher first translate single words and ask the students the meaning of those words. If a pupil hath grasped a little of this, and hath translated the word, let the teacher praise him; if all the students are unable to accomplish this, let the teacher write the foreign language translation beneath the given word. For example, let him write samá' (heaven) in Arabic, and ask: 'How do we say this in Persian?' If one of the children replieth, 'The Persian translation of this word is ásimán', let the teacher praise and encourage him. If they are unable to answer, let the teacher himself give the translation and write it down, and let the children copy it.
Later, let the teacher ask: 'How do they say this in Russian, or French, or Turkish?' If they know the answer, excellent. If not, let the teacher say, 'In Russian, or French, the translation is thus and so', write the word on the board, and have the children copy it down.

When the children have become skilled in translating single words, let the teacher combine the words into a sentence, write this on the board and ask the children to translate it. If they are unable, let the teacher himself translate the sentence and write down the translation. It would of course be preferable for him to make use of several languages.

In this way, over a short period;that is, three years;the children will, as a result of writing the words down, become fully proficient in a number of languages, and will be able to translate a passage from one language into another. Once they have become skilled in these fundamentals, let them go on to learning the elements of other branches of knowledge, and once they have completed this study, let each one who is able and hath a keen desire for it, enroll in higher institutions of learning and study advanced courses in the sciences and arts.

Not all, however, will be able to engage in these advanced studies. Therefore, such children must be sent to industrial schools where they can also acquire technical skills, and once the child becometh proficient in such a skill, then let consideration be given to the child's own preferences and inclinations. If the child hath a liking for commerce, then let him choose commerce; if for industry, then industry; if for higher education, then the advancement of knowledge; if for some other of the responsibilities of humankind, then that. Let him be placed in that field for which he hath an inclination, a desire and a talent.

But the indispensable basis of all is that he should develop spiritual characteristics and the praiseworthy virtues of humankind. This is the primary consideration. If a person be unlettered, and yet clothed with Divine excellence, and alive in the breaths of the Spirit, that individual will contribute to the welfare of society, and his inability to read and write will do him no harm. And if a person be versed in the arts and every branch of knowledge, and not live a religious life, and not take on the characteristics of God, and not be directed by a pure intent, and be engrossed in the life of the flesh;then he is harm personified, and nothing will come of all his learning and intellectual accomplishments but scandal and torment.

If, however, an individual hath spiritual characteristics, and virtues that shine out, and his purpose in life be spiritual and his inclinations be directed toward God, and he also study other branches of knowledge;then we have light upon light:* his outer being luminous, his private character radiant, his heart sound, his thought elevated, his understanding swift, his rank noble.

Blessed is he who attaineth this exalted station.

*Qur'án 24:35

107. Among these children many blessed souls will arise, if they be trained according to the Bahá'í Teachings. If a plant is carefully nurtured by a gardener, it will become good, and produce better fruit. These children must be given a good training from their earliest childhood. They must be given a systematic training which will further their development from day to day, in order that they may receive greater insight, so that their spiritual receptivity be broadened. Beginning in childhood they must receive instruction. They cannot be taught through books. Many elementary sciences must be made clear to them in the nursery; they must learn them in play, in amusement. Most ideas must be taught them through speech, not by book learning. One child must question the other concerning these things, and the other child must give the answer. In this way, they will make great progress. For example, mathematical problems must also be taught in the form of questions and answers. One of the children asks a question and the other must give the answer. Later on, the children will of their own accord speak with each other concerning these same subjects. The children who are at the head of the class must receive premiums. They must be encouraged and when any one of them shows good advancement, for the further development they must be praised and encouraged therein. Even so in Godlike affairs. Oral questions must be asked and the answers must be given orally. They must discuss with each other in this manner.
(The Bahá'í World, Vol. IX, page 543)

130. . . .The Master used to attach much importance to the learning by heart of the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh and the Báb. During His days it was a usual work of the children of the household to learn Tablets by heart; now, however, those children are grown up and do not have time for such a thing. But the practice is most useful to implant the ideas and spirit those words contain into the minds of children.

With The Dawn Breakers in your possession you could also arrange interesting stories about the early days of the movement which the children would like to hear. There are also stories about the life of Christ, Muhammad and the other Prophets which if told to the children will break down any religious prejudice they may have learned from older people of little understanding.
(October 19, 1932 to an individual believer)

===Role Models===

'Abdu'l-Bahá is a perfect exemplar. Teachers and others also serve as role models and should be looked to for examples and inspiration.

103. It is incumbent upon the youth to walk in the footsteps of Hakím* and to be trained in his ways, for such important souls as he and his like have now ascended to the Kingdom of Abhá.
The youth must grow and develop and take the place of their fathers, that this abundant grace, in the posterity of each one of the loved ones of God who bore great agonies, may day by day increase, until in the end, it shall yield its fruit on earth and in Heaven.

===Station of the Teacher===

The importance and high regard afforded teachers is expressed in several ways in the Bahá'í writings. The teacher is the only non-relative that is to be included in the list of persons to receive inheritance. It is helpful for teachers to refer to these passages for the guidance and inspiration to accomplish their difficult and vital task. The teachers have a high station and a high calling. They are to be knowledgeable in their subjects taught and in pedagogy, and to be distinguished in character and conduct.

27. 0 Husayn! O thou Preceptor!

From His Most Great Prison, the countenance of the Ancient of Days is turned towards thee, and He teacheth thee that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of mankind.

Blessed is that teacher who shall arise to instruct the children, and to guide the people into the pathways of God, the Bestower, the Well-Beloved.

28. Blessed is that teacher who remaineth faithful to the Covenant of God, and occupieth himself with the education of children. For him hath the Supreme Pen inscribed that reward which is revealed in the Most Holy Book.
Blessed, blessed is he!

60. O servant of the Blessed Beauty!

Blessed art thou, since thou art engaged in rendering a service which will make thy face to shine in the Abhá Kingdom, and that is the education and training of children. If one should, in the right way, teach and train the children, he will be performing a service than which none is greater at the Sacred Threshold. According to what we have heard, you are succeeding in this. You must, however, struggle unceasingly to perfect yourself and win ever higher achievements.

At all times, I implore Almighty God to make you the means of illuminating the minds of those children, of bringing their hearts to life and sanctifying their souls.

66. 0 steadfast in the Covenant! In reply to thy letter, I am obliged to be brief. Praise thou God that thou hast succeeded in becoming a teacher of young Bahá'ís, young trees of the Abhá Paradise, and at the same time art able to benefit the other children as well.

According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the children is indispensable and obligatory. It followeth that teachers are servants of the Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this task, which is the same as worship. You must therefore offer praise with every breath, for you are educating your spiritual children.

The spiritual father is greater than the physical one, for the latter bestoweth but this world's life, whereas the former endoweth his child with life everlasting. This is why, in the Law of God, teachers are listed among the heirs.

Now you in reality have acquired all these spiritual children free and gratis, and that is better than having physical children; for such children are not grateful to their fathers, since they feel that the father serveth them because he must;and therefore no matter what he doeth for them, they pay it no mind. Spiritual children, however, are always appreciative of their father's loving-kindness. This verily is out of the grace of thy Lord, the Beneficent.

67. 0 thou who art steadfast in the Covenant! Thou hast exerted strenuous efforts for the education of children and I have been, and am, infinitely pleased with thee. Praise God, thou hast been enabled to serve in this field, and it is certain that the confirmations of the Abhá Kingdom will encompass thee, and thou shalt achieve prosperity and success.

Today the training and education of the believers' children is the pre-eminent goal of the chosen. It is the same as servitude to the Sacred Threshold and waiting upon the Blessed Beauty. Joyously, therefore, canst thou pride thyself on this.

65. Make every effort to acquire the advanced knowledge of the day, and strain every nerve to carry forward the divine civilization. Establish schools that are well organized, and promote the fundamentals of instruction in the various branches of knowledge through teachers who are pure and sanctified, distinguished for their high standards of conduct and general excellence, and strong in faith; educators with a thorough knowledge of sciences and arts.

It is incumbent upon the exalted body of the Hands of the Cause of God to watch over and protect these schools in every way, and see to their requirements, so that all the means of progress will continually be at hand, and the lights of learning will illumine the whole world.

53. O loving friends! Exert every effort to acquire the various branches of knowledge and true understanding. Strain every nerve to achieve both material and spiritual accomplishments.

Encourage the children from their earliest years to master every kind of learning, and make them eager to become skilled in every art;the aim being that through the favoring grace of God, the heart of each one may become even as a mirror disclosing the secrets of the universe, penetrating the innermost reality of all things; and that each may earn worldwide fame in all branches of knowledge, science and the arts.

Certainly, certainly neglect not the education of the children. Rear them to be possessed of spiritual qualities, and be assured of the gifts and favors of the Lord.

93. Thus the husband and wife are brought into affinity, are united and harmonized, even as though they were one person. Through their mutual union, companionship and love great results are produced in the world, both material and spiritual. The spiritual result is the appearance of divine bounties. The material result is the children who are born in the cradle of the love of God, who are nurtured by the breast of the knowledge of God, who are brought up in the bosom of the gift of God, and who are fostered in the lap of the training of God. Such children are those of whom it was said by Christ, &quot;Verily, they are the children of the Kingdom!&quot;
(Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbas, Vol. III, pages 605-6)

===Necessity of an Educator===

Some philosophers believe that the most ideal condition is to not interfere with the growth and development of the child. The Bahá'í teachings acknowledge the value and necessity of a teacher.

11. There are many things which will, if neglected, be wasted, and come to nothing. How often in this world do we see a child who has lost his parents and who, unless attention is devoted to his education and training, can produce no fruit. And better off dead than alive is he who produceth no fruit.

68. 0 thou teacher of the children of the Kingdom!
Thou hast arisen to perform a service which would justly entitle thee to vaunt thyself over all the teachers on earth. For the teachers of this world make use human education to develop the powers, whether spiritual or material, of humankind, whilst thou art training these young plants in the gardens of God according to the education of Heaven, and art giving them the lessons of the Kingdom.

The result of this kind of teaching will be that it will attract the blessings of God, and make manifest the perfections of man.
Hold thou fast to this kind of teaching, for the fruits of it will be very great. The children must, from their infancy, be raised to be spiritual and godly Bahá'ís. If such be their training, they will remain safe from every test.

44. Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures.
It is for this reason that, in this new cycle, education and training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary. That is, it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in the bosom of sciences and arts. Should they neglect this matter, they shall be held responsible and worthy for reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 98, pages 126-7)

===Teacher's Character and Behavior===

Of the various ideas that could be drawn from the following extracts, the 
idea that seems to be the most unique is that of the character and behavior of the teachers having an effect on their students. This point is one which makes the teacher's role as a model to the students more important than the content knowledge they impart, but as the first quote suggests, they should have both.

63. Make ye inquiries as to a woman teacher. She must be extremely modest, even-tempered, forbearing, and well bred, and she must be expert in the English language.

64. O thou spiritual teacher! In thy school, instruct thou God's children in the customs of the Kingdom. Be thou a teacher of love, in a school of unity. Train thou the children of the friends of the Merciful in the rules and ways of His loving-kindness. Tend the young trees of the Abhá Paradise with the welling waters of His grace and peace and joy. Make them to flourish under the downpour of His bounty. Strive with all thy powers that the children may stand out and grow fresh, delicate, and sweet, like the ideal trees in the gardens of Heaven.

All these gifts and bounties depend upon love for the Beauty of the All-Glorious, and on the blessings in the teachings of the Most High, and the spiritual instructions of the Supreme Concourse, and on ecstasy and ardor and diligent pursuit of whatsoever will redound to the eternal honor of the community of man.

92. Thou didst write about the believers' daughters who attend the schools of other faiths. It is true that, while these children do learn a little in such schools, still the character and behavior of the women teachers have an effect on them, and through the inculcation of doubts and ambiguities, the minds of these girls are influenced and changed.

It is incumbent upon the friends to provide a school for Bahá'í girls whose women teachers will educate their pupils according to the teachings of God. There must the girls be taught spiritual ethics and holy ways.

A child is as a young plant: it will grow in whatever way you train it. If you rear it to be truthful, and kind, and righteous, it will grow straight, it will be fresh and tender, and will flourish. But if not, then from faulty training it will grow bent, and stand awry, and there will be no hope of changing it.

Certainly, the women teachers from Europe give instruction in language and scripts, and housekeeping, and embroidery and sewing; but their pupils' character is completely altered, to such a point that the girls no longer care for their mothers, their disposition is spoiled, they misbehave, they become self-satisfied and proud.

Rather, girls ought to be trained in such a manner that from day to day they will become more self-effacing, more humble, and will defer to and obey their parents and forebears, and be a comfort and a solace to all.
94. Consider that if the mother is a believer, the children will become believers too, even if the father denieth the Faith; while, if the mother is not a believer, the children are deprived of faith, even if the father be a believer convinced and firm. Such is the usual outcome, except in rare cases.

For this reason both fathers and mothers must carefully watch over their little daughters and have them thoroughly taught in the schools by highly qualified women teachers, so that they may familiarize themselves with all the sciences and arts and become acquainted with and reared in all that is necessary for human living, and will provide a family with comfort and joy.
It is therefore incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly of 'Ishqábád to take the lead in this most urgent matter, so that by the grace and favour of God they may establish an institution which will be a source of security and happiness forever and ever.

===Prayer for Knowledge===

The role of prayer in the accomplishment of any task is explained in the Bahá'í writings. There are several prayers revealed for the education of children and youth. These prayers should assist the teachers in their sacred task. Below is a prayer 'Abdu'l-Bahá revealed as a preamble to one of his tablets.

29. 0 God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendor over the luminous realities of men, shedding upon them the resplendent lights of knowledge and guidance, and have chosen them out of all created things for this supernal grace, and hast caused them to encompass all things, to understand their inmost essence, and to disclose their mysteries, bringing them forth out of darkness into the visible world! 'He verily showeth His special mercy to whomsoever He will.'**

O Lord, help Thou Thy loved ones to acquire knowledge and the sciences and arts, and to unravel the secrets that are treasured up in the inmost reality of all created beings. Make them to learn the hidden truths that are written and embedded in the heart of all that is. Make them to be ensigns of guidance amongst all creatures, and piercing rays of the mind shedding forth their light in this, the 'first life.'***

Make them to be leaders unto Thee, guides unto Thy path, runners urging men on to Thy Kingdom.

Thou verily art the Powerful, the Protector, the Potent, the Defender, the Mighty, the Most Generous.
**Qur'án 3:67
***Qur'án 56:62. In a Tablet 'Abdu'l-Bahá explains that this is a reference to life in this world as distinct from the next.

==Curricula==

===Teaching about God and Religion===

One of the major differences between the Bahá'í conceptions and those popular today is its focus on spiritual concerns and the teaching of religion.

1. The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth. The purpose underlying their revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the Most High.
(Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, LXXXI, page 156, page 156-7)

12. It is the bounden duty of parents to rear their children to be staunch in faith, the reason being that a child who removeth himself from the religion of God will not act in such a way as to win the good pleasure of his parents and his Lord. For very praiseworthy deed is born out of the light of religion, and lacking this supreme bestowal the child will not turn away from any evil, nor will he draw nigh unto any good.

47. Thou didst write as to the children: From the very beginning, the children must receive divine education and must continually be reminded to remember their God. Let the love of God pervade their inmost being, commingled with their mother's milk.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 99, page 127)

===Fear===

The element of fear is needed to control behavior, but must be combined with love and based on justice so as not to be injurious. Fear has a role to play in education according to the Bahá'í teachings. In one instance Bahá'u'lláh states the fear of God is the prime factor in education and in another He talks about the elimination of fear as if it is a virtue. I assume the first fear is of God, and the second is of those things not related to God. As the Guardian states that we do not know what will eliminate the second fear referred to by Bahá'u'lláh, we can only surmise as to its meaning and value as related to education.

13. The fear of God hath ever been the prime factor in the education of His creatures. Well is it with them that have attained thereunto!

21. In the treasuries of the knowledge of God there lieth concealed a knowledge* which, when applied, will largely, though not wholly, eliminate fear. This knowledge, however, should be taught from childhood, as it will greatly aid in its elimination.
(Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, page 32)
* When Shoghi Effendi was asked about the 'knowledge' referred to in the above passage, his secretary wrote the following reply on his behalf:
&quot;Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge 'which could largely eliminate fear' has not been disclosed or identified by Bahá'u'lláh, so we do not know what it is.'&quot; (From a letter dated January 5, 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Charles S. Krug, published in &quot;Bahá'í News, No. 210, August 1948, page 3).
(Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, page 27)

151. You ask him about the fear of God: perhaps the friends do not realize that the majority of human beings need the element of fear in order to discipline their conduct? Only a relatively very highly evolved soul would always be disciplined by love alone. Fear of punishment, fear of the anger of God if we do evil, are needed to keep people's feet on the right path. Of course we should love God;but we must fear Him in the sense of a child fearing the righteous anger and chastisement of a parent; not cringe before Him as before a tyrant, but know His mercy exceeds His justice!
(July 26, 1946 to an individual believer)

14. That which is of paramount importance for the children, that which must precede all else, is to teach them the oneness of God and the Laws of God. For lacking this, the fear of God cannot be inculcated, and lacking the fear of God an infinity of odious and abominable actions will spring up, and sentiments will be uttered that transgress all bounds. . . .
The parents must exert every effort to rear their offspring to be religious, for should the children not attain this greatest of adornments, they will not obey their parents, which in a certain sense means that they will not obey God. Indeed, such children will show no consideration to anyone, and will do exactly as they please.

15. Schools must first train the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of God, may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.
(From Words of Paradise, published in Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, page 68)

161. In explaining the fear of God to children, there is no objection to teaching it as 'Abdu'l-Bahá so often taught everything, in the form of parables. Also the child should be made to understand that we don't fear God because He is cruel, but we fear Him because He is just, and, if we do wrong and deserve to be punished, then in His justice He may see fit to punish us. We must both love God and fear Him.
(February 15, 1957 to some individual believers)

===Recognition of the Manifestation===

The recognition of the Manifestation of God for this day and the promotion of His teachings is a central concern of a Bahá'í curriculum. This teaching will generally not be found in most curricula today.

2. We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all learning be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge.
(Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, XCVIII, page 198, 199)

5. Bend your minds and wills to the education of the peoples and kindreds of the earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may, through the power of the Most Great Name, be blotted out from its face, and all mankind become the upholders of one Order, and the inhabitants of one City.
(Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, CLVI, pages 332-3, 333-4) 

===Arts, Crafts, and Sciences===

Besides the focus on the spiritual reality and religion, the Bahá'í teachings also endorse the more worldly endeavors if they profit society. Religious knowledge addresses our spiritual nature and worldly knowledge addresses our material natures. Arts, crafts, and sciences are specifically mentioned by Bahá'u'lláh as being worthy of learning, as these are seen as conducive to promoting the welfare of the people.

16. Arts, crafts and sciences uplift the world of being, and are conducive to its exaltation. Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words. . . .

In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him. Happy the man that cleaveth unto it, and woe betide the heedless.
(Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pages 26-27)

17. The purpose of learning should be the promotion of the welfare of the people, and this can be achieved through crafts. It hath been revealed and is now repeated that the true worth of artists and craftsmen should be appreciated, for they advance the affairs of mankind. Just as the foundations of religion are made firm through the Law of God, the means of livelihood depend upon those who are engaged in arts and crafts. True learning is that which is conducive to the well-being of the world, not to pride and self-conceit, or to tyranny, violence and pillage.

18. We have granted you permission to study such sciences as will benefit you, not those which lead to idle disputes. Better is this for you, did ye but know.
(Kitáb-i-Aqdas)

===Criterion of Usefulness===

The important criterion that Bahá'u'lláh applies to any academic pursuit, and which can be used by in selecting what should be taught or learned, is its value to the individual and society. A relationship of this to eliminating lawlessness is suggested.

19. The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom. Such academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of Persia's learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words.
(From Tablet of Maqsúd, published in Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, page 169)

25. At the outset of every endeavor, it is incumbent to look to the end of it. Of all the arts and sciences, set the children to studying those which will result in advantage to man, will ensure his progress and elevate his rank. Thus the noisome odors of lawlessness will be dispelled, and thus through the high endeavors of the nation's leaders, all will live cradled, secure and in peace. . . .

The Great Being saith: The man of consummate learning and the sage endowed with penetrating wisdom are the two eyes to the body of mankind. God willing the earth shall never be deprived of these two greatest gifts.
(From Tablet of Maqsúd, published in Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, pages 168-171)

===Reading and Writing===

Bahá'u'lláh's references to reading and writing, widely considered as basic 
skills in education, takes on a different flavor from the arts, crafts and sciences. Children should try to learn to read and write, but writing skills may only need to be developed according to its projected value to the individual's pursuits. Reading and writing are referred to as arts, not skills, as is common today. It also seems that Bahá'u'lláh's last statement supports the specialization of individuals to achieve the highest perfection.

'Abdu'l-Bahá states that it is essential that all be able to read and write. The passage below also seems to suggest that reading and writing are fundamentals of knowledge. The Guardian also states that reading and writing must be taught: &quot;Every child without exception must from his earliest years make a thorough study of the art of reading and writing.&quot; (#121)

Mathematics or computation is not accorded the same importance that reading and writing. Most curricula today consider it a basic skill on a level comparable to reading and writing. It may be assumed that mathematics will be needed to pursue a livelihood and that the amount of mathematics needed will be dependent on different individual's needs.

20. It is incumbent upon the children to exert themselves to the utmost in acquiring the art of reading and writing. Writing skills that will provide for urgent needs will be enough for some; and then it is better and more fitting that they should spend their time in studying those branches of knowledge which are of use.

As for what the Supreme Pen hath previously set down, the reason is that in every art and skill, God loveth the highest perfection.

76. O steadfast in the Covenant! God be praised that ye have succeeded in establishing a school in Mihdíyábád* and are, with great energy and enthusiasm, engaged in educating the children.

In this new and wondrous Cause, the advancement of all branches of knowledge is a fixed and vital principle, and the friends, one and all, are obligated to make every effort toward this end, so that the Cause of the Manifest Light may be spread abroad, and that every child, according to his need, will receive his share of the sciences and arts;until not even a single peasant's child will be found who is completely devoid of schooling.

It is essential that the fundamentals of knowledge be taught; essential that all should be able to read and write. Wherefore is this new institution most worthy of praise, and its program to be encouraged. The hope is that other villages will take you for a model, and that in every village where there is a certain number of believers, a school will be founded where the children can study reading, writing, and basic knowledge.

This is what bringeth joy to the heart of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, cheer and peace to His soul.

===Auxiliary Language===

Another curricular requirement that Bahá'u'lláh includes that will not be found in any existing curricula is the teaching of an international language. This language has not yet been selected, so this requirement cannot be included, but the spirit of it can be addressed by trying to learn a language that would best promote the goals outlined by Bahá'u'lláh.

22. It beseemeth . . . the . . . officials of the Government to convene a gathering and choose one of the diverse languages, and likewise one of the existing scripts, or else to create a new language and a new script to be taught children in schools throughout the world. They would, in this way, be acquiring only two languages, one their own native tongue, the other the language in which all peoples of world would converse. Were men to take fast hold on that which hath been mentioned, the whole earth would come to be regarded as one country, and people would be relieved and freed from the necessity of acquiring and teaching different languages.
(Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, page 138)

===Melodiously Reciting Words of God===

Bahá'u'lláh prescribes the melodious recitation of the Words of God. Both recitation and religion are currently in general disfavor in schools, so reciting Bahá'í verses will certainly be a new addition to most curricula. This may form the foundation of the music education of children.

23. Teach unto your Z ù bà rds that hav W³&amp;endash;en sent down from God, that; they may recite them in the sweetest of tones. This standeth revealed in a mighty Book.

24. Teach your children that which hath been sent down from the heaven of majesty and power that they may recite the Tablets of the Merciful in the halls of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkárs in most melodious tones.
(Kitáb-i-Aqdas)

88. . . . 'Abdu'l-Bahá's supreme joy is in observing that a number of leaves from among the handmaidens of the Blessed Beauty have been educated. that they are the essence of detachment, and are well-informed of the mysteries of the world of being; that they raise such a call in their glorification and praise of the Greatest Name as to cause the inmates of the Fanes of the Kingdom to become attracted and overjoyed, and that they recite prayers in prose and poetry, and melodiously chant the divine verses. I cherish the hope that thou wilt be one of them, wilt cast forth pearls, wilt be constantly engaged in singing His praise and wilt intone celestial strains in glorification of His attributes.

===Character Education===

Bahá'u'lláh accords morals, character or values a central place in the curriculum. His guidance concerning the teaching of religion and the importance of pursuing studies of worth to humanity is an example of this concern. He also identifies a number of specific attributes that should be taught to children. His writings are replete with numerous other virtues that should be taught in schools.

'Abdu'l-Bahá further emphasizes the role of character education, suggesting that its lack is the root cause of wrongdoing. This passage, one of the clearest and strongest on character education that is currently translated into English in the Bahá'í writings, offers many ideas worthy of further exploration. He suggests that the tools of perception and knowledge are vital to eliminating ignorance, that fear plays a role, that the standard is higher than popularly accepted and that character education is much more important than currently regarded in schools. The guidance given on human nature and the role of education in developing the character contains many insights that will that will need to be further explored by educators and psychologists.

26. As to the children: We have directed that in the beginning they should be trained in the observances and laws of religion, and thereafter, in such branches of knowledge as are of benefit, and in commercial pursuits that are distinguished for integrity, and in deeds that will further the victory of God's Cause or will attract some outcome which will draw the believer closer to his Lord.

We beg of God to assist the children of His loved ones and adorn them with wisdom, good conduct, integrity and righteousness.
He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Clement.

43. The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must therefore hold fast to the tools of perception and knowledge. Good character must be taught. Light must be spread afar, so that, in the school of humanity, all may acquire the heavenly characteristics of the spirit, and see for themselves beyond any doubt that there is no fiercer Hell, no more fiery abyss, than to possess a character that is evil and unsound; no more darksome pit nor loathsome torment than to show forth qualities which deserve to be condemned.

The individual must be educated to such a high degree that he would rather have his throat cut than tell a lie, and would think it easier to be slashed with a sword or pierced with a spear than to utter calumny or be carried away by wrath.

Thus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and pride, to burn away the reapings of lustful appetites. Then will each one of God's beloved shine out as a bright moon with qualities of the spirit, and the relationship of each to the Sacred Threshold of his Lord will not be illusory but sound and real, will be as the very foundation of the building, not some embellishment on its facade.

It followeth that the children's school must be a place of utmost discipline and order, that instruction must be thorough, and provision must be made for the rectification and refinement of character; so that, in his earliest years, within the very essence of the child, the divine foundation will be laid and the structure of holiness raised up.

Know that this matter of instruction, of character rectification and refinement, of heartening and encouraging the child, is of the utmost importance, for such are basic principles of God.
Thus, if God will, out of these spiritual schools illumined children will arise, adorned with all the fairest virtues of humankind, and will shed their light not only across Persia, but around the world.

It is extremely difficult to teach the individual and refine his character once puberty is passed. By then, as experience hath shown, even if every effort be exerted to modify some tendency of his, it all availeth nothing. He may, perhaps, improve somewhat today; but let a few days pass and he forgetteth, and turneth backward to his habitual condition and accustomed ways. Therefore it is in early childhood that a firm foundation must be laid. While the branch is green and tender it can easily be made straight.
Our meaning is that qualities of the spirit are the basic and divine foundation, and adorn the true essence of man; and knowledge is the cause of human progress. The beloved of God must attach great importance to this matter, and carry it forward with enthusiasm and zeal.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 111, pages 136-7)

===Knowledge Should Lead to God===

Not only is recognition of God the goal of all knowledge, but it becomes a condition by which to weigh other knowledge.

31. 0 thou true friend! Read, in the school of God, the lessons of the spirit, and learn from love's Teacher the innermost truths. Seek out the secrets of Heaven, and tell of the overflowing grace and favour of God.
Although to acquire the sciences and arts is the greatest glory of mankind, this is so only on condition that man's river flow into the mighty Sea, and draw from God's ancient source His inspiration. When this cometh to pass, then every teacher is a shoreless ocean, every pupil a prodigal fountain of knowledge. If, then, the pursuit of knowledge lead to the beauty of Him Who is the Object of all Knowledge, how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on error and indifference to God.
The sciences of this world are bridges to reality; if then they lead not to reality, naught remains but fruitless illusion. By the one true God! If learning be not a means of access to Him, the Most Manifest, it is nothing but evident loss.

It is incumbent upon thee to acquire the various branches of knowledge, and to turn thy face towards the beauty of the Manifest Beauty, that thou mayest be a sign of saving guidance amongst the peoples of the world, and a focal centre of understanding in this sphere from which the wise and their wisdom are shut out, except for those who set foot in the Kingdom of lights and become informed of the veiled and hidden mystery, the well-guarded secret.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, page 72, page 110)

===Three Kinds of Education===

The Bahá'í writings suggests categorizing education, learning and knowledge according to their material, human and spiritual aspects, and makes clear that education, in order to be comprehensive, should address all three aspects. 'Abdu'l-Bahá also gives guidance on the role of the educator for these three aspects.

37. But education is of three kinds: material, human and spiritual. Material education is concerned with the progress and development of the body, through gaining its sustenance, its material comfort and ease. This education is common to animals and man.

Human education signifies civilization and progress: that is to say, government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and handicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries, and elaborate institutions, which are the activities essential to man as distinguished from the animal.
Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God: it consists in acquiring divine perfections, and this is true education; for in this state man becomes the focus of divine blessings, the manifestation of the words, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image and after Our likeness.&quot; This is the goal of the world of humanity.

Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a material, human and spiritual educator, and whose authority will be effective in all conditions. So if any one should say. &quot;I possess perfect comprehension and intelligence, and I have no need of such an educator,&quot; he would be denying that which is clear and evident, as though a child should say, &quot;I have no need of education; I will act according to my reason and intelligence, and so I shall attain the perfections of existence;&quot; or as though the blind should say, &quot;I am in no need of sight, because many other blind people exist without difficulty.&quot;

Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator, and this educator must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects, and distinguished above all men. Otherwise, if he should be like the rest of humanity, he could not be their educator, more particularly because he must be at the same time their material and human as well as their spiritual educator;that is to say, he must teach men to organize and carry out physical matters, and to form a social order in order to establish cooperation and mutual aid in living so that material affairs may be organized and regulated for any circumstances that may occur. In the same way he must establish human education;that is to say, he must educate intelligence and thought in such a way that they may attain complete development, so that knowledge and science may increase, and the reality of things, the mysteries of beings and the properties of existence may be discovered; that, day by day instructions, inventions and institutions may be improved; and from things perceptible to the senses conclusions as to intellectual things may be deduced.

He must also impart spiritual education, so that intelligence and comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world, and may receive benefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit, and may enter into relationship with the Supreme Concourse. He must so educate the human reality that it may become the centre of the divine appearance, to such a degree that the attributes and the names of God shall be resplendent in the mirror of the reality of man, and the holy verse &quot;We will make man in Our image and likeness&quot; shall be realized.*
(Some Answered Questions, pages 8-9, 8-9)

128. Your short but impressive letter addressed to Shoghi Effendi was received. He perused it with deep interest and charged me to thank you on his behalf and to express his fondest hopes that you will pursue with an abiding zeal your academic studies. Being a Bahá'í you are certainly aware of the fact that Bahá'u'lláh considered education as one of the most fundamental factors of a true civilization;this education, however, in order to be adequate and fruitful should be comprehensive in nature and should take into consideration not only the physical and the intellectual side of man but also his spiritual and ethical aspects. This should be the program of the Bahá'í youth all over the world.
(July 9, 1931 to an individual believer)

===Developing Volition===

Teaching resolve, perseverance and other related character traits is prescribed in a Bahá'í curriculum. 'Abdu'l-Bahá seems to suggest that by teaching those things that several praiseworthy outcomes will result.

97a. 0 Handmaids of the Lord! The spiritual assemblage that ye established in that illumined city is most propitious. Ye have made great strides; ye have surpassed the others, have arisen to serve the Holy Threshold, and have won heavenly bestowals. Now with all spiritual zeal must ye gather in that enlightened assemblage and recite the Holy Writings and engage in remembering the Lord. Set ye forth His arguments and proofs. Work ye for the guidance of the women in that land, teach the young girls and the children, so that the mothers may educate their little ones from their earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them to have goodly character and good morals, guide them to all the virtues of humankind prevent the development of any behaviour that would be worthy of blame, and foster them in the embrace of Bahá'í education. Thus shall these tender infants be nurtured at the breast of the knowledge of God and His love. Thus shall they grow and flourish, and be taught righteousness and the dignity of humankind, resolution and the will to strive and to endure. Thus shall they learn perseverance in all things, the will to advance, high mindedness and high resolve, chastity and purity of life. Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a successful conclusion whatsoever they undertake.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 95, pages 124-5)

===Kindness to Animals===

'Abdu'l-Bahá's recommends teaching children to be kind to animals. This guidance could also be applied to a person who needs education.

108. Educate the children in their infancy in such a way that they may become exceedingly kind and merciful to the animals. If an animal is sick they should endeavor to cure it; if it is hungry, they should feed it; if it is thirsty, they should satisfy its thirst; if it is tired, they should give it rest.

Man is generally sinful and the animal is innocent; unquestionably one must be more kind and merciful to the innocent. The harmful animals, such as the bloodthirsty wolf, the poisonous snake and other injurious animals are excepted, because mercy towards these is cruelty to man, and other animals.
(The Bahá'í World, Vol. IX, page 544)

===Universal Curriculum for All===
Equality of opportunity is a fundamental right promoted in the Bahá'í teachings. The need for equality of education as a fundamental aspect of unity, peace, communications and opportunity 'Abdu'l-Bahá states that boys and girls must follow the same curriculum. This guidance might also be applied to other group differences such as geographic location, race and class.

112. He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education for man and woman. Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of study, thereby promoting unity of the sexes. When all mankind shall receive the same opportunity of education and the equality of men and women be realized, the foundations of war will be utterly destroyed. Without equality this will be impossible because all differences and distinction are conducive to discord and strife. Equality between men and women is conducive to the abolition of warfare for the reason that women will never be willing to sanction it. Mothers will not give their sons as sacrifices upon the battlefield after twenty years of anxiety and loving devotion in rearing them from infancy, no matter what cause they are called upon to defend. There is no doubt that when women obtain equality of rights war will entirely cease among mankind.
(The Promulgation of Universal Peace, page 175)

89. . . . The establishment of a women's assemblage for the promotion of knowledge is entirely acceptable, but discussions must be confined to educational matters. It should be done in such a way that differences will, day by day, be entirely wiped out, not that, God forbid, it will end in argumentation between men and women. Like the question of the veil, nothing should be done contrary to wisdom. The individual women should, today, follow a course of action which will be the cause of eternal glory to all womankind, so that all women will be illumined. And that lieth in gathering to learn how to teach, in holding meetings to recite the verses, to offer supplications to the kingdom of the Lord of evident signs, and to institute education for the girls.

82. Bahá'u'lláh hath proclaimed the universality of education, which is essential to the unity of mankind, that one and all may be equally educated, whether girls or boys, and receive the same education. When education is universalized in all schools, perfect communication between the members of the human race will be established. When all receive the same kind of education the foundations of war and contention will be utterly destroyed.

===Love in the Curriculum===

'Abdu'l-Bahá says &quot;Be thou a teacher of love, in a school of unity. Train thou the children of the friends of the Merciful in the rules and ways of His loving-kindness&quot; (64). In several passages he alludes to what that means, but this area will need further exploration, especially as it is new to most curricula.

61. It is the hope of 'Abdu'l-Bahá that those youthful souls in the schoolroom of the deeper knowledge will be tended by one who traineth them to love. May they all, throughout the reaches of the spirit, learn well of the hidden mysteries; so well that in the Kingdom of the All-Glorious, each one of them, even as a nightingale endowed with speech, will cry out the secrets of the Heavenly Realm, and like unto a longing lover pour forth his sore need and utter want of the Beloved.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 107, page 134)

===Brief Summary of a School Curriculum===

'Abdu'l-Bahá gives a brief outline of what is recommended to be taught in a school. It is one of the most concise and complete descriptions in the Bahá'í writings. Another standard for measuring the worth of any lesson or curricular offering is given--does it further the acquisition of human perfections. The second quotation is addressed to a group of women preparing to educate their girls in Persia. Elsewhere 'Abdu'l-Bahá prescribes the same curriculum for both boys and girls, but recognizing the role girls will likely play as the trainers of their own children, some special training is recommended. These guidelines are instructive for those interested in trying to apply this guidance to general education. Elsewhere (#121), Shoghi Effendi adds two areas that have not been specifically mentioned to the list of areas to be taught: speech and contemporary technology.

80. The subjects to be taught in children's schools are many, and for lack of time We can touch on only a few: First and most important is training in behavior and good character; the rectification of qualities; arousing the desire to become accomplished and acquire perfections, and to cleave unto the religion of God and stand firm in His Laws, to accord total obedience to every just government, to show forth loyalty and trustworthiness to the ruler of the time, to be well wishers of mankind, to be kind to all.
And further, as well as in the ideals of character, instruction in such arts and sciences as are of benefit, and in foreign tongues. Also the repeating of prayers for the well-being of ruler and ruled; and the avoidance of materialistic works that are current among those who see only natural causation, and tales of love, and books that arouse the passions.
To sum up, let all the lessons be entirely devoted to the acquisition of human perfections.

Here, then, in brief are directions for the curriculum of these schools.

95. O handmaids of the Beauty of Abhá!

Your letter hath come, and its perusal brought great joy. Praised be God, the women believers have organized meetings where they will learn how to teach the Faith, will spread the sweet savours of the Teachings and make plans for training the children.

This gathering must be completely spiritual. That is, the discussions must be confined to marshalling clear and conclusive proofs that the Sun of Truth hath indeed arisen. And further, those present should concern themselves with every means of training the girl children; with teaching the various branches of knowledge, good behaviour, a proper way of life, the cultivation of a good character, chastity and constancy, perseverance, strength, determination, firmness of purpose; with household management, the education of children, and whatever especially applieth to the needs of girls;to the end that these girls, reared in the stronghold of all perfections, and with the protection of a goodly character, will, when they themselves become mothers, bring up their children from earliest infancy to have a good character and conduct themselves well.

Let them also study whatever will nurture the health of the body and its physical soundness, and how to guard their children from disease.
When matters are thus well arranged, every child will become a peerless plant in the gardens of the Abhá Paradise.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 94, pages 123-4)

51. We have previously written and sent out a detailed letter regarding the education of children in faith, certitude, learning and spiritual knowledge, and their being taught to call upon the Heavenly Kingdom with suppliant hearts.

It is certain that ye will exert every effort toward this end.

62. O thou handmaid of God! Do thou establish a heavenly school and be thou a teacher in that house of learning. Educate the children in the things of God; and, even as pearls, rear them in the heart of the shell of divine guidance.

Strive thou with heart and soul; see to it that the children are raised up to embody the highest perfections of humankind, to such a degree that every one of them will be trained in the use of the mind, in acquiring knowledge, in humility and lowliness, in dignity, in ardor and love.

119. A basic and vital requirement of these days is the matter of educating the boys and girls. One of the duties devolving upon the members of Spiritual Assemblies is that, with the support of the friends, they should exert all their powers to establish schools for the instruction of boys and girls in the things of the spirit, the fundamentals of teaching the Faith, reading the Sacred Writings, learning the history of the Faith, the secular branches of knowledge, the various arts and skills, and the different languages;so that Bahá'í methods of instruction will become so widely known that children from every level of society will seek to acquire divine teachings as well as secular knowledge in Bahá'í schools, and thereby means for the promotion of the Cause of God will be provided.
(December 19, 1923 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihrán, Irán ;translated from the Persian)

===Balance Mental and Spiritual===

The Bahá'í writings make clear the importance of spiritual education, especially for young children, but a letter written on behalf of the Guardian also stresses the importance of mental training and education in colleges of high standing.

127. We had heard through various channels the wonderful way your children had grown to speak about the Cause in public. Shoghi Effendi's hope is that they will, the three of them, become able and devoted speakers on the Cause and subjects akin to it. To do this properly they will need a firm foundation of scientific and literary training which fortunately they are obtaining. It is just as important for the Bahá'í young boys and girls to become properly educated in colleges of high standing as it is to be spiritually developed. The mental as well as the spiritual side of the youth has to be developed before he can serve the Cause efficiently.

==Metaphors about Education==

The metaphors used in the Bahá'í writings have tremendous explanatory power. The metaphors we use become so much a part of our way of seeing things that we often fail to think very deeply about their implications. Some of the dominant metaphors used in the Bahá'í writings related to educators and students are shared below.

===Teacher as Physician===

There are several metaphors used in the following quote, as well as a number of potentially very useful allusions. The first paragraph uses the gardener as teacher and plants as students analogy, the second that of doctor to teacher. The third paragraph describes the transformation that can result from education in opposites, such as demons to angels. The fourth and fifth paragraphs use descriptive language to describe human potentialities and the positive role that education can play.

58. The education and training of children is among the most meritorious acts of humankind and draweth down the grace and favor of the All-Merciful, for education is the indispensable foundation of all human excellence and alloweth man to work his way to the heights of abiding glory. If a child be trained from his infancy, he will, through the loving care of the Holy Gardener, drink in the crystal waters of the spirit and of knowledge, like a young tree amid the rilling brooks. And certainly he will gather to himself the bright rays of the Sun of Truth, and through its light and heat will grow ever fresh and fair in the garden of life.

Therefore must the mentor be a doctor as well: that is, he must, in instructing the child, remedy its faults; must give him learning, and at the same time rear him to have a spiritual nature. Let the teacher be a doctor to the character of the child, thus will he heal the spiritual ailments of the children of men.

If, in this momentous task, a mighty effort be exerted, the world of humanity will shine out with other adornings, and shed the fairest light. Then will this darksome place grow luminous, and this abode of earth turn into Heaven. The very demons will change to angels then, and wolves to shepherds of the flock, and the wild-dog pack to gazelles that pasture on the plains of oneness, and ravening beasts to peaceful herds; and birds of prey, with talons sharp as knives, to songsters warbling their sweet native notes.

For the inner reality of man is a demarcation line between the shadow and the light, a place where the two seas meet;* it is the lowest point on the arc of descent,** and therefore is it capable of gaining all the grades above. With education it can achieve all excellence; devoid of education it will stay on, at the lowest point of imperfection.
Every child is potentially the light of the world;and at the same time its darkness; wherefore must the question of education be accounted as of primary importance. From his infancy, the child must be nursed at the breast of God's love, and nurtured in the embrace of His knowledge, that he may radiate light, grow in spirituality, be filled with wisdom and learning, and take on the characteristics of the angelic host. Since ye have been assigned to this holy task, ye must therefore exert every effort to make that school famed in all respects throughout the world; to make it the cause of exalting the Word of the Lord.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 103, pages 130-1)

**See Some Answered Questions, pages 2667, 285-6 for 'Abdu'l-Bahá's comments on the arc of descent and ascent.

===God as Educator===

One of the great metaphors we can look to for inspiration and guidance, is the Godhead or the Manifestation as educator. They are the first and greatest educators, and as such, offer much insight as to how one should teach.

3. Consider . . . the revelation of the light of the Name of God, the Educator. Behold, how in all things the evidences of such a revelation are manifest, how the betterment of all beings dependeth upon it. This education is of two kinds. The one is universal. Its influence pervadeth all things and sustaineth them. It is for this reason that God hath assumed the title, 'Lord of all worlds'. The other is confined them that have come under the shadow of this Name, and sought the shelter of this most mighty Revelation. They, however, that have failed to seek this shelter, have deprived themselves of this privilege, and are powerless to benefit from the spiritual sustenance that hath been sent down through the heavenly grace of this Most Great Name. How great the gulf fixed between the one and the other!

57. 0 true companions!

All humankind are as children in a school, and the Dawning-Points of Light, the Sources of divine revelation, are the teachers, wondrous and without peer. In the school of realities they educate these sons and daughters, according to teaching from God, and foster them in the bosom of grace, so that they may develop along every line, show forth the excellent gifts and blessings of the Lord, and combine human perfections; that they may advance in all aspects of human endeavor, whether outward or inward, hidden or visible, material or spiritual, until they make of this mortal world a widespread mirror, to reflect that other world which dieth not.

O ye friends of God! Because, in this most momentous of ages, the Sun of Truth hath risen at the highest point of the spring equinox, and cast its rays on every clime, it shall kindle such tremulous excitement, it shall release such vibrations in the world of being, it shall stimulate such growth and development, it shall stream out with such a glory of light, and clouds of grace shall pour down such plentiful waters, and fields and plains shall teem with such a galaxy of sweet-smelling plants and blooms, that this lowly earth will become the Abhá Kingdom, and this nether world the world above. Then will this fleck of dust be as the vast circle of the skies, this human place the palace-court of God, this spot of clay the day-spring of the endless favours of the Lord of Lords.

Wherefore, O loved ones of God! Make ye a mighty effort till you yourselves betoken this advancement and all these confirmations, and become focal centres of God's blessings, day-springs of the light of His unity, promoters of the gifts and graces of civilized life. Be ye in that land vanguards of the perfections of humankind; carry forward the various branches of knowledge, be active and progressive in the field of inventions and the arts. Endeavor to rectify the conduct of men, and seek to excel the whole world in moral character. While the children are yet in their infancy feed them from the breast of heavenly grace, foster them in the cradle of all excellence, rear them in the embrace of bounty. Give them the advantage of every useful kind of knowledge. Let them share in every new and rare and wondrous craft and art. Bring them up to work and strive, and accustom them to hardship. Teach them to dedicate their lives to matters of great import, and inspire them to undertake studies that will benefit mankind.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 102, pages 128-9)

===Children as Pearls===

Another metaphor is that of children as pearls and education as the shell. 'Abdu'l-Bahá says &quot;Educate the children in the things of God; and, even as pearls, rear them in the heart of the shell of divine guidance.&quot; (62)

59. Among the greatest of all services that can possibly be rendered by man to Almighty God is the education and training of children, young plants of the Abhá Paradise, so that these children, fostered by grace in the way of salvation, growing like pearls of divine bounty in the shell of education, will one day bejewel the crown of abiding glory.

It is, however, very difficult to undertake this service, even harder to succeed in it. I hope that you will acquit yourself well in this most important of tasks, and successfully carry the day, and become an ensign of God's abounding grace; that these children, reared one and all in the holy Teachings, will develop natures like unto the sweet airs that blow across the gardens of the All-Glorious, and will waft their fragrance around the world.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 106, pages 133-4)

===Parents as Teachers===

We can see parents as teachers, or teachers as parents, as both analogies are helpful. Some differences between them involve varying levels of responsibility, concern, attention, emotional attachment and charges. 'Abdu'l-Bahá calls mothers the primary trainers of children and infants. Some of the more illuminating guidance given concerning education is to mothers. Children have the obligation of serving, obeying and honoring their parents, and parents have the responsibilities of caring for and educating their children. The wisdom and guidance given parents and families in the Baha'i writings can be applied to teaching, classes and schools.

111. According to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh, the family being a human unit must be educated according to the rules of sanctity. All the virtues must be taught the family. The integrity of the family bond must be constantly considered and the rights of the individual members must not be transgressed. The rights of the son, the father, the mother, none of them must be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. Just as the son has certain obligations to his father, the father likewise has certain obligations to his son. The mother, the sister and other members of the household have their certain prerogatives. All these rights and prerogatives must be conserved, yet the unity of the family must be sustained. The injury of one shall be considered the injury of all; the comfort of each the comfort of all; the honor of one the honor of all.
(The Promulgation of Universal Peace, page 168)

===Teacher as Gardener===

The teacher as a gardener is a frequently used metaphor throughout the Bahá'í writings.

50. 0 thou who gazest upon the Kingdom of God!

Thy letter was received and we note that thou art engaged in teaching the children of the believers, that these tender little ones have been learning The Hidden Words and the prayers and what it meaneth to be a Bahá'í.
The instruction of these children is even as the work of a loving gardener who tendeth his young plants in the flowering fields of the All-Glorious. There is no doubt that it will yield the desired results; especially is this true of instruction as to Bahá'í obligations and Bahá'í conduct, for the little children must needs be made aware in their very heart and soul that 'Bahá'í' is not just a name but a truth. Every child must be trained in the things of the spirit, so that he may embody all the virtues and become a source of glory to the Cause of God. Otherwise, the mere word 'Bahá'í,' if it yield no fruit, will come to nothing.

Strive then to the best of thine ability to let these children know that a Bahá'í is one who embodieth all the perfections, that he must shine out like a lighted taper;not be darkness upon darkness and yet bear the name 'Bahá'í.'
Name thou this school the Bahá'í Sunday School.*
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 123, page 143)

55. 0 ye two well-loved handmaids of God! Whatever a man's tongue speaketh, that let him prove by his deeds. If he claimeth to be a believer, then let him act in accordance with the precepts of the Abhá Kingdom.

Praised be God, ye two have demonstrated the truth of your words by your deeds, and have won the confirmations of the Lord God. Every day at first light, ye gather the Bahá'í children together and teach them the communes and prayers. This is a most praiseworthy act, and bringeth joy to the children's hearts: that they should, at every morn, turn their faces toward the Kingdom and make mention of the Lord and praise His Name, and in the sweetest of voices, chant and recite.

These children are even as young plants, and teaching them the prayers is as letting the rain pour down upon them, that they may wax tender and fresh, and the soft breezes of the love of God may blow over them, making them to tremble with joy.

Blessedness awaiteth you, and a fair haven.
(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, 115, page 139)

===Metaphors about Students===

Many analogies are found in the Bahá'í literature to help us understand human reality. People are compared to many different things that may help teachers better understand and teach them, such as talisman, mine, tree, steel, mirror, niche, lamp, night/day, animal/angel, book of creation, coal/diamond, plants, magnetized matter, branches, apprentices of God, physicians and awakeners.

4. Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess. Through a word proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into being; by one word more he was guided to recognize the Source of his education; by yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded. The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.
(Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, CXXII, pages 258-9, 259-60)

9. Strain every nerve to acquire both inner and outer perfections, for the fruit of the human tree hath ever been and will ever be perfections both within and without. It is not desirable that a man be left without knowledge or skills, for he is then but a barren tree. Then, so much as capacity and capability allow, ye needs must deck the tree of being with fruits such as knowledge, wisdom, spiritual perception and eloquent speech.

10. Man is even as steel, the essence of which is hidden: through admonition and explanation, good counsel and education, that essence will be brought to light. If, however, he be allowed to remain in his original condition, the corrosion of lusts and appetites will effectively destroy him.

30. 0 Company of God! To each created thing the Ancient Sovereignty hath portioned out its own perfection, its particular virtue and special excellence, so that each in its degree may become a symbol denoting the sublimity of the true Educator of humankind, and that each, even as a crystalline mirror, may tell of the grace and splendor of the Sun of Truth.
And from amongst all creatures He hath singled out man, to grant him His most wondrous gift, and hath made him to attain the bounties of the Company on high. That most precious of gifts is attainment unto His unfailing guidance, that the inner reality of humankind should become as a niche to hold this lamp; and when the scattering splendors of this light do beat against the bright glass of the heart, the heart's purity maketh the beams to blaze out even stronger than before, and to shine in glory on the minds and souls of men.

The attainment of the most great guidance is dependent upon knowledge and wisdom, and on being informed as to the mysteries of the Holy Words. Wherefore must the loved ones of God, be they young or old, be they men or women, each one according to his capabilities, strive to acquire the various branches of knowledge, and to increase his understanding of the mysteries of the Holy Books, and his skill in marshalling the divine proofs and evidences.
The eminent Sadru's-Sudur,**** who hath verily attained a most exalted station the Retreats of Bliss, inaugurated the teaching meeting. He was the first blessed soul to lay the foundation of this momentous institution. God be praised, during the course of his life he educated persons who today are strong and eloquent advocates of the Lord God, disciples who are indeed pure and spiritual descendants of him who was so close to the Holy Threshold. After his passing, certain blessed individuals took steps to perpetuate his teaching work, and when He learned of it, this Captive's heart rejoiced.

At this time, likewise, I most urgently request the friends of God to make every effort, as much as lieth within their competence, along these lines. The harder they strive to widen the scope of their knowledge, the better and more gratifying will be the result. Let the loved ones of God, whether young or old, whether male or female, each according to his capabilities, bestir themselves and spare no efforts to acquire the various current branches of knowledge, both spiritual and secular, and of the arts. Whensoever they gather in their meetings let their conversation be confined to learned subjects and to information on the knowledge and sciences of the day.

If they do thus, they will flood the world with the Manifest Light, and change this dusty earth into gardens of the Realm of Glory.
****A distinguished Persian believer who established the first classes from training Bahá'í teachers.

32. Man is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the beginning of spirituality;that is to say, he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the last degree of darkness, and at the beginning of light; that is why it has been said that the condition of man is the end of the night and the beginning of day, meaning that he is the sum of all the degrees of imperfection, and that he possesses the degrees of perfection. He has the animal side as well as the angelic side, and the aim of an educator is to so train human souls that their angelic aspect may overcome their animal side.
(Some Answered Questions, page 218, 235)

33. Man is said to be the greatest representative of God, and he is the Book of Creation because all the mysteries of beings exist in him. If he comes under the shadow of the True Educator and is rightly trained, he becomes the essence of essences, the light of lights, the spirit of spirits; he becomes the centre of the divine appearances, the source of spiritual qualities, the rising-place of heavenly lights, and the receptacle of divine inspirations. If he is deprived of this education, he becomes the manifestation of satanic qualities, the sum of animal vices, and the source of all dark conditions.

The reason of the mission of the Prophets is to educate men, so that this piece of coal may become a diamond, and this fruitless tree may be engrafted and yield the sweetest, most delicious fruits. When man reaches the noblest state in the world of humanity, then he can make further progress in the conditions of perfection, but not in state; for such states are limited, but the divine perfections are endless.
(Some Answered Questions, page 219, 236-7)

75. 0 ye friends of God, the All-Merciful hath created humankind for the adornment of this contingent world, so that men may array the earth with the manifold blessings of Heaven; that the inner reality of the human being may, like unto a lamp of the spirit, cause the community of man to become as a mirror for the assemblage on high.

It is clear that learning is the greatest bestowal of God; that knowledge and the acquirement thereof is a blessing from Heaven. Thus is it incumbent upon the friends of God to exert such an effort and strive with such eagerness to promote divine knowledge, culture and the sciences, that ere long those who are school-children today will become the most erudite of all the fraternity of the wise. This is a service rendered unto God Himself, and it is one of His inescapable commandments.

Wherefore, O loving friends, strive with heart and soul and strength to make the Tarbíyat School a centre of enlightenment, and a well-spring of truth, that the children of God may shine with the rays of boundless learning, and that these tender plants of the divine garden may grow and flourish in the grace that showereth down from the clouds of knowledge and true understanding, and advance to such a degree as to astonish the company of those who know.

I swear by the bounty of God's wisdom that if they win this great prize, the members of the Tarbíyat School will be admitted to the assemblage of God, and that unto them, beyond a peradventure, the portals of His grace will open wide.

102. O ye dear children!
Your father is compassionate, clement and merciful unto you and desireth for you success, prosperity and eternal life in the Kingdom of God. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you, dear children, to seek his good pleasure, to be guided by his guidance, to be drawn by the magnet of the love of God and be brought up in the lap of the love of God; that ye may become beautiful branches in the Garden of El-Abhá, verdant and watered by the abundance of the gift of God.
(Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, Vol. III, page 622)

105. 0 ye children of the Kingdom! Your letters with your photographs have been received. From the perusal of the letters the utmost heartfelt emotions were experienced and at the sight of the portraits a spiritual joy and gladness was felt. Praise be to God the letters were indicative of the turning of the faces toward the Kingdom and from those faces it was evident that the light of the love of God is manifest and resplendent upon the brows.
I pray to God that in this school on Sundays ye may acquire heavenly knowledge, ye may secure a training of merciful characteristics and that ye may advance from day to day so that each of you may become a peerless shrub in the Divine Rose-garden and may be adorned with full foliage, blossoms and fruits.
(From a Tablet to the children of the Bahá'í school, Urbana, Illinois, U.S.A.)

106. O young trees and plants, matchless and tender, that grow in the meadows of guidance! O ye newcomers to the Fraternity of Truth!
Although now ye be learners, the hope is that through showerings from the clouds of grace, ye will become teachers; that ye will flourish even as flowers and fragrant herbs in the garden of that knowledge which is both of the mind and of the heart; that each one of you will grow as a tree rich in yield, fair, fresh and strong, heavy with sweet fruit.

May the hidden confirmations of God make each one of you to become a wellspring of knowledge. May your hearts ever receive inspiration from the Denizens of the Concourse on high. May the drop become as the great sea; may the mote dazzle as the shining sun.

His Holiness the Báb hath said: 'Should a tiny ant desire in this day to be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel the abstrusest and most bewildering passages of the Qur'án, its wish will no doubt be fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might vibrates within the innermost being of all created things. If so helpless a creature can be endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more efficacious must be the power released through the liberal effusions of the grace of Bahá'u'lláh! What confirmations will be garnered, what influxes of the heart!

Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by day to unravel the mysteries of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the secrets of the Day of God. Inform yourselves of the evidences that the Most Great Name hath dawned. Open your lips in praise. Adduce convincing arguments and proofs. Lead those who thirst to the fountain of life; grant ye true health to the ailing. Be ye apprentices of God; be ye physicians directed by God, and heal ye the sick among humankind. Bring those who have been excluded into the circle of intimate friends. Make the despairing to be filled with hope. Waken them that slumber; make the heedless mindful.

Such are the fruits of this earthly life. Such is the station of resplendent glory.

== Overview ==

The '''''Disillusionment Charm''''' allows you to either become temporarily invisible or temporarily unnoticable, depending on how well it is cast.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Disillusionment charm makes you blend in with your surroundings to a certain extent; depending on how well it is cast, it can make you nearly invisible.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] casts this on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] when he and the Advance Guard are transporting Harry to the Headquarters of the Order.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we learn that many [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloaks]] are made by casting Disillusionment Charms over ordinary traveling cloaks. A number of other techniques are used as well. None of these techniques are perfect; physical and spell damage, or simple age, will cause them to fail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">INTRODUCTION

Rodney H. Clarken

Peter T. Terry


The problems of education in each of our discrete societies are increasingly becoming global issues which we ignore at the risk of placing our collective future in peril.  Education is the among the most potent vehicles for ushering in peace, unity and moral advancement, and these are indispensable.  But as we become a global culture, we must ask what knowledge is worth knowing and how it can be best taught.  These are questions that have confronted human societies down through the ages and that face the governments and peoples of the world today.  Our challenge is to discover answers that transcend the particularity of human existence in its great variety of cultural niches...to discover global, universal education. 

This book sets forth a composite statement on education.  It introduces the answers found in the authoritative literature of the Baha'i Faith to the questions that we all face as we engage in contributing to an ever-advancing civilization.  This Bahá’í literature, consisting primarily of English translations from the Arabic and Persian writings and sayings of Bahá’u’lláh and 'Abdu’l-Bahá, and the English language letters written by and on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, and the Universal House of Justice, contains wise counsels on a great variety of topics, including the field of education.

This book identifies many of the specific and general principles and practical measures found in Bahá’í literature, concerning educational administration, child development, pedagogy, and curriculum.  It addresses problems related to education in diverse settings and suggests areas of research that should be pursued. 
	
In &quot;The Secret of Divine Civilization&quot;, 'Abdu'l-Bahá's outstanding contribution to the future reorganization of the world, we read the following:

''The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward. The principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples is ignorance. Today the mass of the people are uninformed even as to ordinary affairs, how much less do they grasp the core of the important problems and complex needs of the time
	
''It is therefore urgent that beneficial articles and books be written, clearly and definitely establishing what the present-day requirements of the people are, and what will conduce to the happiness and advancement of society. These should be published and spread throughout the nation, so that at least the leaders among the people should become, to some degree, awakened, and arise to exert themselves along those lines which will lead to their abiding honour. The publication of high thoughts is the dynamic power in the arteries of life; it is the very soul of the world. Thoughts are boundless sea, and the effects and varying conditions of existence are as the separate forms and individual limits of the waves; not until the sea boils up will the waves rise and scatter their pearls of knowledge on the shore of life. . .
	
''Public opinion must be directed toward whatever is worthy of this day, and this is impossible except through the use of adequate arguments and the adducing of clear, comprehensive and conclusive proofs. For the helpless masses know nothing of the world, and while there is no doubt that they seek and long for their own happiness, yet ignorance like a heavy veil shuts them away from it.'' &lt;small&gt;(1975, pp. 109-110 passim)&lt;/small&gt;

These principles and ideals will not be realized until effort is directed toward their fulfillment.  As Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha indicated on many occasions, there is no shortage of high ideals, but what is needed practice, actions, deeds:

''The essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds; he whose words exceed his deeds, know verily his death is better than his life.''  &lt;small&gt;(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah written after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 156)&lt;/small&gt;

''It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action.''  &lt;small&gt;(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah written after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 166; Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 249)&lt;/small&gt;

''All must hold to that which floweth from the Pen of Reminder, and practice it.''  &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha, A Traveller's Narrative, p. 84)&lt;/small&gt;

''By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds.'' &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha, Tablet in Baha'i World Faith, p. 383)&lt;/small&gt;

''Realizing that wealth is desirable is not becoming wealthy. The admission that scientific attainment is praiseworthy does not confer scientific knowledge. Acknowledgment of the excellence of honor does not make a man honorable. Knowledge of human conditions and the needed remedy for them is not the cause of their betterment. To admit that health is good does not constitute health. A skilled physician is needed to remedy existing human conditions. As a physician is required to have complete knowledge of pathology, diagnosis, therapeutics and treatment, so this World Physician must be wise, skillful and capable before health will result. His mere knowledge is not health; it must be applied and the remedy carried out.
“The attainment of any object is conditioned upon knowledge, volition and action. Unless these three conditions are forthcoming, there is no execution or accomplishment. In the erection of a house it is first necessary to know the ground, and design the house suitable for it; second, to obtain the means or funds necessary for the construction; third, actually to build it.''  &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 157)&lt;/small&gt;

''What profit is there in agreeing that universal friendship is good, and talking of the solidarity of the human race as a grand ideal? Unless these thoughts are translated into the world of action, they are useless.
''The wrong in the world continues to exist just because people talk only of their ideals, and do not strive to put them into practice. If actions took the place of words, the world's misery would very soon be changed into comfort.''  &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 16)&lt;/small&gt;

''Love manifests its reality in deeds, not only in words -- these alone are without effect. In order that love may manifest its power there must be an object, an instrument, a motive.'' &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha, Paris Talks, p. 35)&lt;/small&gt;

''To know this is not enough. All knowledge is good, but it can bear no fruit except by action. It is well to know that riches are good, but that knowledge will not make a man rich; he must work, he must put his knowledge into practice.''  &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 60)&lt;/small&gt;

''Every progress depends on two things, knowledge and practice. First acquire knowledge, and, when conviction is reached, put it into practice.''  &lt;small&gt;(‘Abdu'l-Baha in London, p. 108)&lt;/small&gt;

It is hoped that this compilation of source texts will serve as a stimulus to action, and not remain purely theoretical.
	
A categorization of extracts from ''Bahá’í Education'' (Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, 1977) along with brief introductory commentaries has been prepared by Rodney H. Clarken, and is located in an appendix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I'm Mel. I'm most active on [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:Mchua the OLPC wiki] but am beginning to make appearances in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mchua en-Wikipedia] and [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Mchua en-Wikiversity] as well.

Got drawn in here by [[User:darklama|darklama]] during a #wikiversity discussion on the [[Middle School Extension]] project, which led to the creation of [[Wikibooks:Subprojects]] in a &quot;be bold!&quot; attempt to understand the way things work here. The IRC discussion is documented [[WB:SLP#Middle_School_Extension|here on SLP]] and in links from that section, notably [[Talk:Middle School Extension]]. Pointers on where to go with this much appreciated.</text>

Hemp is the only plant that contains all of the essential fatty acids required by humans. The body does not generate these EFAs and so must ingest them. EFAs clear cholesterol from arteries, supports the immune system efficiency and a provide necessary brain nourishment. Hempseeds provide the oils for creating food out of Hemp.

      <comment>Added short explanation of pronouns and full tables of standalone and suffix (subject and object) forms</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In Arabic, pronouns can appear either as independent words or as suffixes, depending on their function.  Pronouns that act as subjects use the standalone form, while pronouns acting as objects--either of verbs or of prepositions--use the suffix form.

== Devmon howto split: acceptable? ==
As can be seen, I've split the &quot;devmon howto&quot; into a couple of sections -- one for initial setup and one for adding an unrecognized device or new test (which seemed somewhat outside the beginner's scope). The only problem now is that the last part (Test!) has content that should perhaps go in the initial part. The most concerning is the safety of running multiple devmon processes.

If the sections should be combined (i.e. the devmon documentation is adequate for beginners, and people would only come here to see how to add new devices/tests) then by all means recombine.--[[User:Goldfndr|Goldfndr]] 04:20, 15 August 2007 (UTC)
: Additionally, the length of the Devmon part of the Howto is really long. I think it's long enough to deserve its own Howto module (i.e. a sibling of [[System Monitoring with Hobbit/Other Docs/HOWTO/Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit]]).--[[User:Goldfndr|Goldfndr]] 04:25, 15 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Energy is a precious commodity. It keeps a nation alive. It runs industries, transport, and communication facilities. It provides us conveniences in daily living. The radio, television, light fixtures, stove, water pump and other devices, and appliances require energy to function.

The unifying theme of this module is energy—its many forms and the changes it undergoes. This module discusses the importance of energy in the different aspects of daily living. The content is divided into the following units:

Unit I, Energy and Society, discusses the different views of physics—as a discipline and its relation to the other science disciplines, the activities of physicists and how their work relate to the developments in science and technology, and how physics interrelates with technology and society.

Unit II, Energy in the Environment, starts with light, a form of energy that we are familiar with. The behavior of light as it interacts with materials is presented in the context of light and vision. Everyday situations are used to advantage to describe the properties of light. Nuclear radiation, a form of energy other than sunlight, is the other theme included in this unit. The discussion shows the benefits derived from and the environmental hazards of nuclear energy.

Unit III, Energy in the Home, focuses on the use of electrical energy in the household. Concepts are discussed with the circuitry in the house as the starting point. The transformation of electrical energy to other forms, electrical energy consumption, and how to use energy wisely are given emphasis. The benefits derived from and dangers posed by the use of electrical energy conclude the unit.

Unit IV, Energy and the Economy, gives importance to the transformation of other forms of energy to electrical energy as it describes electrical energy generation, transmission, and distribution. Electromagnetic forces and electromagnetic induction are the major concepts of the unit.   

The module features simple laboratory activities requiring readily available materials. Some activities are investigatory. Others are verifications. Some are meant to guide you in analyzing abstract ideas or experimental data. Some activities may be done at home. Doing the activities will concretize or operationalize certain physics concepts to enhance your understanding of the theories involved. It will also help you acquire analytical skills and familiarity with the science processes, which in turn will help you in decision-making. 

The questions and problems in the study guide will help you integrate the main ideas discussed in each chapter.

I hope that this module will help you become more aware of the relevance and importance of science, particularly physics, and technology in your everyday life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a minor issue when using NonCopyable. Please consider:

&lt;code&gt;
struct A : NonCopyable {};&lt;br&gt;
struct B : NonCopyable {};&lt;br&gt;
struct C : A, B {};&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

In this case C inherits two sub-objects of the same base class NonCopyable. The standart requires sub-objects of the same base class to have distinct addresses, which prohibits empty base class optimization in this case and make the sizeof(C) at least 2.

To make empty base class optimization work something like the following can be done:

&lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;class Tag&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
class NonCopyable { /* original declaration */ };&lt;br&gt;
struct A : NonCopyable&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; {};&lt;br&gt;
struct B : NonCopyable&amp;lt;B&amp;gt; {};&lt;br&gt;
struct C : A, B {};&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Here, C does not have any base class sub-objects of the same type, which allows for empty base class optimization.

== NonCopyable&lt;T&gt;::operator= gets hidden ==

In the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
class NonCopyable
{
    // ...
    T &amp; operator = (const T &amp;);
};
class CantCopy : private NonCopyable &lt;CantCopy&gt;
{};

&lt;/source&gt;

The compiler generated CantCopy::operator=() hides NonCopyable&lt;CantCopy&gt;::operator=(), thus making the latter useless. Assignment in the following code does not cause a compiler error as it should.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main()
{
    CantCopy a;
    a = a; // &lt;- should produce a compiler error
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To fix the code NonCopyable&lt;CantCopy&gt;::operator=() signature needs to be changed to:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    NonCopyable &amp; operator = (const NonCopyable &amp;);
&lt;/source&gt;

:Make it &quot;NonCopyable&lt;T&gt; &amp; operator = (const NonCopyable&lt;T&gt; &amp;);&quot; and I agree. ;) --[[Special:Contributions/212.111.224.237|212.111.224.237]] ([[User talk:212.111.224.237|talk]]) 15:39, 16 March 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
To calculate the &quot;effective&quot; age of many documents you want to count the number of working days they have been in various stages.  This means you count the weekdays but not the weekend days.  You can even discard the holidays if you want to have consistent aging reports.

== Approach ==
Since NetWorkingDays is a calculation that is shared by many systems, it makes sense to use a XQuery module to put the logic into.

&lt;pre&gt;
module namespace fxx = &quot;http://xquery.wikibooks.org/fxx&quot;;

declare function fxx:net-working-days-n($s as xs:date, $f as xs:date, $dates as xs:date*, $total as xs:integer) as xs:integer {
    if ($s= $f)
    then $total
    else if (fxx:weekday($s) and not($s = $dates))
             then fxx:net-working-days-n($s + xs:dayTimeDuration('P1D'), $f, $dates,$total + 1)
             else fxx:net-working-days-n($s + xs:dayTimeDuration('P1D'), $f, $dates,$total )
};

declare function fxx:net-working-days($s as xs:date, $f as xs:date) as xs:integer {

(:  this function returns one less than the number returned from Excel NETWORKDAY :
    networkdays($d,$d) should be 0 but it is 1.
    networkdays and workday should be inverses and they are not
    common practice seems to be to subtract one anyway.
  :)
  (:  assumes  $s &lt;= $f :)
    fxx:net-working-days-n($s,$f, (), 0)

};

 

declare function fxx:net-working-days($s as xs:date,$f as xs:date, $dates as xs:date*) as xs:integer {
    fxx:net-working-days-n($s,$f, $dates, 0)

};
&lt;/pre&gt;

The heart of this calculation is a NetWorkingDays algorithm that is passed two dates.

== Sample Test Driver ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

import module namespace fxx = &quot;http://xquery.wikibook.org/fxx&quot; at &quot;net-working-days.xq&quot;;

 :
 : @return XHTML table for next &quot;caldays&quot; days from now including working days calculations from today
 : @input-parameter: caldays - an integer number of calendar days in the future from now
 :
 :)
 
let $cal-days := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;caldays&quot;, &quot;30&quot;))

let $now := xs:date(substring(current-date(),1,10))
return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Days from {$now}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today is a {fxx:day-of-week-name-en(xs:date(substring(current-date(),1,10)))}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Format: net-working-days.xq?cal-days=50&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Cal Days&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Furture Date&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Day of Week&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Net Working Days&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/thead&gt;
      {
      for $i in (0 to $cal-days)
         let $d :=  $now + xs:dayTimeDuration(concat('P',$i,'D'))
         let $dow := fxx:day-of-week($d)
         return
         &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;{$i}&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;{$d}&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;{fxx:day-of-week-name-en(xs:date(substring($d,1,10)))}&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;{fxx:net-working-days(xs:date(substring(current-date(),1,10)),$d)}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      }
      &lt;/table&gt;
   &lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;index.xhtml&quot;&gt;Back to Unit Testing Main Menu&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;../../index.xhtml&quot;&gt;Back to CRV Main Menu&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Discussion ==
The recursive function works but it is slow.  It has to call itself once for each date between the two dates.  An alternative approach is to count the end days in each fraction of a week, count the weeks and multiply by five.

Code??

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Java Persistence Architecture API ([[Wikipedia:Java Persistence API|JPA]]) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database.  JPA was defined as part of the [[Wikipedia:EJB|EJB]] 3.0 specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification. JPA is now considered the standard industry approach for Object to Relational Mapping (ORM) in the Java Industry.

JPA itself is just a specification, not a product; it cannot perform persistence or anything else by itself.  JPA is just a set of interfaces, and requires an implementation.  There are open-source and commercial JPA implementations to choose from and any Java EE 5 application server should provide support for its use.  JPA also requires a database to persist to.

JPA allows [[Wikipedia:POJO|POJO]] (Plain Old Java Objects) to be easily persisted without requiring the classes to implement any interfaces or methods as the EJB 2 CMP specification required.  JPA allows an object's object-relational mappings to be defined through standard annotations or XML defining how the Java class maps to a relational database table.  JPA also defines a runtime EntityManager API for processing queries and transaction on the objects against the database.  JPA defines an object-level query language, JPQL, to allow querying of the objects from the database.

JPA is the latest of several Java persistence specifications.  The first was the OMG persistence service Java binding, which was never very successful; I'm not sure of any commercial products supporting it. Next came EJB 1.0 CMP Entity Beans, which was very successful in being adopted by the big Java EE providers (BEA, IBM), but there was a backlash against the spec by some users who thought the spec requirements on the Entity Beans were overly complex and the overhead and performance were poor.  EJB 2.0 CMP tried to reduce some of the complexity of Entity Beans through introducing local interfaces, but the majority of the complexity remained.  EJB 2.0 also lacked portability, in that the deployment descriptors defining the object-relational mapping were not specified and were all proprietary.

This backlash in part led to the creation of another Java persistence specification, [[Wikipedia:Java Data Objects|JDO]] (Java Data Objects).  JDO obtained somewhat of a &quot;cult&quot; following of several independent vendors such as Kodo JDO, and several open-source implementations, but never had much success with the big Java EE vendors.

Despite the two competing Java persistence standards of EJB CMP and JDO, the majority of users continued to prefer proprietary api solutions, mainly [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] (which had been around for some time and had its own POJO API) and [[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] (which was a relatively new open-source product that also had its own POJO API and was quickly becoming the open-source industry standard).  The TopLink product formerly owned by WebGain was also acquired by Oracle, increasing its influence on the Java EE community.

The EJB CMP backlash was only part of a backlash against all of Java EE which was seen as too complex in general and prompted such products as the Spring container.  This led the EJB 3.0 specification to have a main goal of reducing the complexity, which led the spec committee down the path of JPA.  JPA was meant to unify the EJB 2 CMP, JDO, Hibernate, and TopLink APIs and products, and seems to have been very successful in doing so.

Currently most of the persistence vendors have released implementations of JPA confirming its adoption by the industry and users. These include Hibernate (acquired by JBoss, acquired by Red Hat), TopLink (acquired by Oracle), and Kodo JDO (acquired by BEA, acquired by Oracle).  Other products that have added support for JPA include Cocobase (owned by Thought Inc.) and JPOX.

For help, contact Whiteknight.&lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;[[Category:User:Whiteknight/Gadgets]]&lt;noinclude&gt;

== How to Install ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Gadget Instructions 2|Whiteknight's Visual Book Designer|ff2=yes|ff3=yes|ie7=yes|ie6=yes|safari=yes|chrome=yes|opera=yes}}

=== Known Issues ===

None.

== About this Gadget ==

This gadget is used to apply categories to a book, and comes in two different parts. This gadget is the first, and the [[User:Whiteknight/Categorization Links]] template is the second. This page will only talk about the first part.

=== Selecting a Category ===

Enter the title of the book in the textbox and click the down-arrow to select a subject. Subjects are arranged by [[WB:ABS|Wikibooks Department]], although they do not necessarily line up with the available bookshelves. Once you have picked the appropriate category, click on the &quot;'''Categorize'''&quot; button. This will start the categorization process, but will not display any results.

=== Displaying the Wikitext ===

Once you have pressed the &quot;'''Categorize'''&quot; button, you may click the &quot;'''Display'''&quot; button. This will show the created wikitext code from the categorization process, as well as some helpful notes for applying these categories to your book. 

You may select the &quot;'''Display'''&quot; option if you have not entered the Book's title in the textbox. However, the {{tlx|Alphabetical}} template will not be properly categorized.

=== Editing and Saving ===

After you press the &quot;'''Categorize'''&quot; button, you can click &quot;'''Edit'''&quot; to display a standard edit window that is preloaded with the page text and the generated categorization templates. Check and edit the text to ensure that it is correct, and then press the &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; button. This will save the page with the new categorization templates added. 

You may not click the &quot;'''Edit'''&quot; button unless you have entered a bookname. If the page does not currently exist, the edit window will be blank except for the categorization templates. Do not save a page with just templates.

== How to Install ==

To install, add this line to your personal javascript:
 
 import_script('User:Whiteknight/gadgets.js');

Your personal Javascript page is most likely located at &quot;User:&lt;YOUR USER NAME&gt;/monobook.js&quot; Go to that page and copy+paste the above line of code and click &quot;Save Page&quot;. Once you save your javascript, you will need to perform a '''hard reset''', typically by pressing CTRL + F5, or some other key combination. This will install all my gadgets simultaneously.

== About this Tool ==

This tool is not useful by itself. It is used as an addon to other gadgets and tools to provide a categorization form to a standard edit window. If an edit window is not present, this tool will do nothing.

== To Do ==

*Nothing.

== Version History ==

*1.00 First and only stable version. All updates will be made via the [[User:Whiteknight/Categorization Gadget]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Teaching your language to a group of foreigners may be a lot easier than you think.  The human brain has the innate ability to process language and understand it.  Your students will begin learning from the very first class.  Still, it never hurts to know what you’re doing.  Here are some useful tips for making the learning process easier.
'''
==Breaking the Ice==

Imagine that you enter your first class.  Twelve pairs of eyes are fixed on you.  Other than the nervous swallows you can literally hear the crickets chirping.  The students don’t know you, they don’t know one another, and they don’t know the language.  They’re tense and they’re not ready to learn, at least, not yet.  You need to make the class fun, help the students relax, help them meet each other, and help them get to know you.  This is accomplished with an icebreaker.
There is no single perfect icebreaker to use.  It depends on the teacher, on the type of students, on the level of the students, on whether the students know one another, and many other factors.  If the students don’t have the same native tongue (L1) and know basically nothing in the language they’re trying to learn (L2) it can be difficult just to get them to follow the directions.
If the students have the same native language (L1) and know very little you can get them to write down all the L2 words they know.  Have them work in groups and give only one of them a pen.  The other students will call out words and the writer will write them down.  Students will naturally start to ask what the words mean in their own L1 and may remember some of the words.  That will make your job easier.
If the students have different L1s then you may have to just resort to having a large ball.  Calling out your name you then throw the ball to the next student.  He or she will (hopefully) say their name and pass the ball around.  Once that’s done the ball will come back to you.  You will have remembered one of the names of the students and you can toss the ball to the student (saying his or her name) and encourage her to pass the ball to someone else while calling his or her name.  This can be hard to do if your class is a room full of executives, but what else is there?
If your students speak some English you can have a simple exercise like, “Guess the Question.”  Write on the board (or provide the student[s] with handouts) that tell your name, where you live, your job, etc. and have them guess the questions.  Once they accomplish that have them interview one another, asking the questions or (in a one-on-one class) you can simply say, “Now you know something about me, tell me something about you.”

==Having Objectives==

Now that your students are relaxed you want them to learn something.  You should set objectives for each class and objectives for the entire course.  Each class objective should move you closer to the course objective.  For example, if you want the students to be able to watch and enjoy a Disney movie or read and enjoy a simple book by the end you will want them to learn the vocabulary and grammar structures of the book.  Each lesson should move them closer to that objective.
If the students know little or nothing your first objective may be to teach them pronouns (I, you, he, she, we, you, they) or the appropriate form(s) of the verb(s) “to be” in the new language (L2) they are learning.  In English, for example, you might want them to know: I am American/Mexican/French along with You are…, He is…, and She is… by the end of the class.

==Vocabulary Instruction==

The first thing a student needs to know is words.  Words can be presented by a translation method, but this is not generally used for the following reasons:

A.	The students may not have the same L1.
B.	The teacher may not know the student’s L1.
C.	The teacher may incorrectly translate the word or otherwise give a false impression of the word.
D.	The students may come to rely on translation to learn new words.
E.	The students are more likely to forget the new words.
F.	The students may be discouraged from speaking the L2 in class.
G.      Words do not always directly translate. They often have subtle connotations in L1 which does not come over in the translation or vice versa.

Generally, therefore, the students are taught words with pictures and their L2 words.  The following pitfalls need to be observed and avoided:

A.	Certain words cannot be taught by pictures, e.g., trust, shame, jealousy
B.	The teacher cannot always have pictures available to teach every new word that comes up.
C.	Teaching words in a written manner may cause the students to mispronounce the words based on the phonetic system of their own language.
D.	The students may have an L1 written form (Chinese, Japanese) that is completely different from the written form of the L2.
E.	If the exercise is too easy (just showing pictures with the words next to them) the students may readily forget the new words.

Accordingly most low-level vocabulary learning exercises show a variety of pictures and require the students to match the pictures up with the words in the L2.  Students can use bilingual dictionaries or rely on other students in the class to try to work out the right combinations.  Students should normally work in pairs or small groups to pool their knowledge.
Higher level vocabulary learning can be spontaneous or planned.  During any reading or listening exercise a student is likely to encounter one or more words that they do not know.  When that happens and when the students notice the word as an unknown word they will attempt to learn the word.  Teachers can help the students to notice new words by using a highlighter, a different font or by underlining the words.
Students will adopt a variety of strategies to help them learn a new word.  Some may ask the teacher what the word means while others will consult a dictionary.  Some students may ignore the word or try to guess it from the context.  Once the meaning is located the students may adopt a variety of other strategies.  They may repeat the word aloud several times, underline it, highlight it, or make notes in the margin of the meaning or translation of the word.  Other students may actually copy the word into a notebook or try to make a sentence with the word.  Each strategy may or may not be effective.  Students should be encouraged to try a variety of strategies and use the methods they find most effective.  Obviously a vocabulary notebook is a good strategy, but many students may not be motivated enough to take that step.

==Grammar Instruction==

Grammar instruction normally follows the deductive method, because it is considered by its followers to be the fastest way. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/methodology/grammar.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.academia.edu/2130993/The_Inductive_Approach_in_Teaching_Foreign_Languages Inductive methods] of grammar instruction are also used and its proponents would argue that it is the most effective in terms of learning outcomes. One example of an approach that uses this approach is called The Silent Way.

The deductive method is sometimes known as PPP (Presentation, Practice, Production).  Briefly a new grammatical structure or usage is presented in a reading or listening, the rules governing that structure are explicitly revealed to the student, and the student is given a very controlled practice to give them a chance to apply the rule, to aid them in seeing more examples of the structure and to prevent them from going wrong.  Finally the students are given an uncontrolled practice to allow them to use the structure in a freer and more natural way.  A brief example is given below.

Presentation
A:	Hello Eric!  What are you doing here?
B:	I work here.
A:	Really?  I didn’t know that.
B:	That’s strange.  I’ve worked here for three years.

Eric says: “I’ve worked here for three years.”  That’s the present perfect.  We use the present perfect to talk about things that started in the past and are still true now, e.g., I’ve been married for 5 years.  I’ve had this car for 2 years.  I’ve been here for 30 minutes.

We form the present perfect with the auxiliary verb have and the past participle.  A list of irregular past participles can be found on page….

Practice
Fill in the blanks below.

I ____________ (live) here for 1 year.
I ____________ (know) John for 3 years.
I ____________ (work) in Seattle for 6 months.

Production
Ask your partner the following questions.

Do you have a car?  How long have you had it?
Where do you live?  How long have you lived there?
How long have you been studying ____________ ?

==Teaching Speaking==

There are many ways to teach speaking. How it is taught would depend upon the language level of the students. 

One way to teaching speaking is through games or activities based on an information gap.  The classic information gap exercise has students work in pairs.  Each student is given a picture that is slightly different.  Through descriptions and without showing the picture to each other the students are expected to communicate to solve the problem of identifying a certain number of differences.  Other information gap activities may be to have students read different stories on related issues and have them tell what they remember to their partners.  At lower levels students may simply repeat after the teacher or the tape.  At higher levels the students may engage in debates on controversial subjects.  Questionnaires with open-ended questions may also work well, e.g., Who’s your favorite singer?  Why do you like him/her?

Another way of teaching speaking, especially at the lower levels is to talk about what is being done in the class. This way students can match the language with an instruction, an action, a request or a description.

==Teaching Listening==

Teaching listening is basically a matter of practice.  Listening activities can be divided into levels based on their difficulty and can be given to the student in various orders.  Students will normally hear the teacher speak and the other students and so they will have some listening abilities.
Students must be encouraged to engage in active listening.  Most people passively listen to whatever is around them, but without paying a lot of attention.  An example might be a person listening to a news program.  When an interesting tidbit is played a person’s ears will perk up and they will pay close attention until they’ve learned what they wanted to know at which point they will go back to passive listening.
Students should be given a task to complete to help them listen actively.  A simple true/false question that isn’t answered until the middle or end of the program can be enough.  Alternatively the students can speculate before the audio is played about what the speaker may say and then listen to see if they were right or wrong.
Audio recordings should generally be played at least twice.  It can be helpful to listen a final time while the students read along with the tape script.  If the students cannot understand the listening it’s either too difficult or it wasn’t properly set up.

==Teaching Reading==

Reading comprehension is directly proportional to vocabulary knowledge.  Studies have shown that a person should know between 95 to 98 percent of a reading text for maximum effect. &lt;ref&gt;http://content.grin.com/data/6/31684.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Students should be provided with Graded Reader books to let them progress at their own rate.  Most language teaching books contain a certain number of reading passages in them, as well.
Students should not read aloud as this only distracts the other students from their reading process and the students may well anticipate when it will be their turn to read and stop listening in order to practice their paragraph to avoid potential embarrassment.  If the teacher reads aloud the reading exercise will probably turn into a listening exercise (see above).
Like listening, reading should be set up to promote interest in the subject.  Students can speculate about the content, be assigned specific tasks, or given true/false questions to give them something to do.  Studies have shown that second reading provides the greatest increase in reading comprehension.  Accordingly most books have a pre-reading task coupled with a post-reading (re-reading task) to encourage the students to read the text twice.  A student’s chance of learning and retaining the vocabulary is proportional to the number of times the new word(s) occur in the text.  It has been shown that reading the text more than once can be an effective method to increase the number of exposures to the new word(s).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/r21270/cv/Casterbridge.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Two to three times seems to be the optimal number.

==Teaching Writing==

A full discussion of how to teach writing is beyond the scope of this work.  Generally speaking the more vocabulary a student possesses the better he will write.  Students should be assigned periodic writing assignments, which the teacher should correct for them.  Systematic or class wide errors can become the subject of future lessons.  Writing exercises can often be presented by the teacher writing a letter and the students imitating the letter to write similar versions based on their own life, or by having them reply to an opening letter from a pen pal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive communication to their parents when in need of feeding and also in discomfort or feeling neglected. These cries can be heard or seen using a babycam.

Feeding is typically done by breastfeeding, or bottle feeding with expressed breast-milk or with a special, heavily processed industrial milk product, &quot;infant formula&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda-milk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Powdered Infant Formula: An Overview of Manufacturing Processes | publisher = Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/AC/03/briefing/3939b1_tab4b.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants have a sucking instinct allowing them to extract the milk from the nipples of the breasts or the nipple of the baby bottle, as well as an instinctive behavior known as '''rooting''' with which they seek out the nipple. Sometimes a wet nurse is hired to feed the infant. Breastfeeding provides infants with many natural immune substances and isolates the infant from most bacteria or other contaminants in the local water supply. Infant formula does not provide these immune substances and in places with poor quality water supply, subjects the infant to an increased risk of disease. Only breast milk is considered to have all that an infant requires to grow normally (thrive), although formula undergoes frequent alterations in order to more closely imitate human milk. &lt;ref name=&quot;ajcn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carver | first = Jane D. | title = Advances in nutritional modifications of infant formulas | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 1550-1554 | publisher = American Society for Clinical Nutrition  | date = June 2003 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/77/6/1550S | id = PMID 12812153 | accessdate = 2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As infants age, and their appetites grow, many parents choose from a variety of commercial, ready-made baby foods to feed the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary needs of their child.

Infants are incontinent, therefore diapers are generally used in industrialized countries, while methods similar to elimination communication&lt;ref name=&quot;elim&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Elimination Communication | publisher = Yahoo! Groups | url = http://groups.yahoo.com/group/eliminationcommunication/ | accessdate = 2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; are common in third world countries. Practitioners of these techniques assert that babies can control their bodily functions at the age of six months and that they are aware when they are urinating at an even earlier age. Babies can learn to signal to the parents when it is time to urinate or defecate by turning or making noises. Parents have to pay attention to the baby's actions so they can learn the signals.

Children need a relatively larger amount of sleep to function correctly (up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages), specially after feeding.

Babies cannot walk, although more mature infants may crawl or scoot; baby transport may be by perambulator (stroller or buggy), on the back or in front of an adult in a special carrier, cloth or cradle board, or simply by being carried in the arms. 

Most industrialized countries have laws requiring infants to be placed in special seats when in motor vehicles.

As is the case with most other young children, infants are usually treated as special persons. Their social presence is different from that of adults, and they may be the focus of attention. Fees for transportation and entrance fees at locations such as amusement parks or museums are often waived. This special attention will wear out as the child grows older.

Common care issues for infants:

* Baby colic
* Childhood development
* Hygiene:
** Bathing or showering.
** Cord and navel.
* Day care
* Diaper rash
* Feeding: Breastfeeding or Infant formula (Baby bottle)

      <comment>/* Conception */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

'''Pregnancy''' is the period where a fetus grows inside the uterus of the mother. Pregnancy starts with '''conception''', and ends with delivery of the baby, or premature termination of the pregnancy.

Childbirth usually occurs about 38 weeks from fertilization, i.e. approximately 40 weeks from the start of the last menstruation.  Thus, pregnancy lasts about nine months, although the exact definition of the English word “pregnancy” is a subject of controversy.  The term ''embryo'' is used to describe the developing human during the initial weeks, and the term ''fetus'' is used from about two months of development until birth.

In many societies' medical and legal definitions, human pregnancy is somewhat arbitrarily divided into three trimester periods, as a means to simplify reference to the different stages of fetal development. The first trimester period carries the highest risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus). During the second trimester the development of the fetus can start to be monitored and diagnosed. The third trimester often marks the beginning of viability, or the ability of the fetus to survive, with or without medical help, outside of the mother's womb. 

== Conception ==
Conception happens when the sperm combine with the egg. This usually normally occurs if a heterosexual couple has vaginal intercourse without contraception, especially if performed in the several days before the woman ovulates. To prevent conception, '''birth control''' methods should be used, such as condoms and hormonal contraceptives such as '''The Pill'''. Even if a man does not ejaculate inside the vaginal canal, semen released near the vulva can still enter the vagina and fertilize an egg. For this reason, it is possible (although unlikely) for a heterosexual couple to conceive without actually having any vaginal intercourse. Further, it is important to know that  contraception may not be completely effective, and conception can still occur, although this is rare if the manufacturers' recommendations are strictly followed. 

If a heterosexual couple wants to conceive, they should have natural vaginal intercourse, and neither partner should be taking hormonal contraceptives. Fertility changes over a woman's ovulation period, so it may be helpful to study a fertility awareness method, or use devices called Ovulation Predictor Kits (OPKs). This may help couples know to have intercourse on the woman's most and least fertile days. The '''Rhythm Method''' of birth control is not however very effective.  If you and your partner want to conceive a baby, it is important to talk about the various factors involved in pregnancy with a trained professional. Neonatal death (death of either mother or baby about the time of birth) was once very common and can still occasionally occur, even when advanced medical attention is available. 

About the time that sexual intercourse becomes routine the adult human body prepares itself for pregnancy and parenting regardless of the use of contraceptives. Typically a man may sprout additional body hair and a woman may develop more prominent breasts. These quite severe hormonal changes are likely to have emotional effects, so that the man may become excessively protective and the woman excessively insular ('''broody''') In extreme cases this can lead to post natal depression. Pre-natal classes usually address these psychological changes, and are therefore recommended for both expectant mothers and fathers, especially during the gestation of the first baby.

==Parenthood==
Having a baby is an important, life-changing moment, and couples should not attempt to conceive without talking about the consequences. A baby requires a lot of effort and patience, and it is a big responsibility to take care of a child for 15 or 20 years until it is entirely self-sufficient. 

Having a baby before academic education is complete increases a person's risk of dropping out of school, having a lower-than-average income, and needing government assistance or charity services. Young men who are not mature may not accept the long term responsibilities of fatherhood and become untraceable, and in consequence children born to teenage parents  or single mothers tend to be less socialized than regularly parented children and so (statistically at least) at higher risk of committing crimes and going to jail.

It is important for people expecting their first child to have family and friends to support them during this emotionally tumultuous time, when emotions are experienced with extreme force. Arguments and rows are common between couples about this time, and a wide range of mature mediators (parents, older relations, more experienced friends) can greatly reduce fear and confusion that is natural in such an important life-changing period. The desire to run away and abandon one's parental obligation to the new child is common, often severe but always transitory. Both abortion and separation have long term psychological consequences that may be worse than the short-term panic that often provokes such extreme acts.

== Know if you are pregnant ==

It is important to know if you are pregnant or not. Women commonly suspect they are pregnant if they do not get an expected period. During pregnancy, the normal menstrual cycle ceases, and women will not menstruate again until after the pregnancy is over.

Modern over-the-counter pregnancy tests are just as accurate as tests at a doctor's office. Pregnancy tests become accurate between one and three weeks after the last act of intercourse (or other sexual contact in which semen came near the woman's vagina).  There are two reasons for this delay.  First, sperm can live for up to five days before fertilizing an egg.  Thus, a woman may have sex on Monday and not become pregnant until Friday.  Second, a newly created embryo does not implant in the woman's uterus until six to twelve days after fertilization.  Before implantation, there is no method available to detect pregnancy.

Many women occasionally have longer menstrual cycles (&quot;late periods&quot;) without being pregnant.  Stress will delay ovulation, and menstruation does not happen until about two weeks after ovulation.  Women who frequently have longer menstrual cycles may worry needlessly about being pregnant.  These women may benefit from [[Sexual Health/Other Birth Control Methods#Fertility Awareness Methods|fertility awareness]], which allows them to predict the length of even irregular cycles.

{{SideBox|'''Prenatal Care:''' The medical care that you get for yourself and your baby while you are pregnant}}

If you are pregnant, it is important that you see a doctor. Pregnant women should receive '''prenatal care''', to protect their own health, and the health of their unborn babies. Pregnant women have different nutritional needs from non-pregnant women.

Women who take folic acid supplements ''before'' becoming pregnant significantly lower the risk of certain birth defects.  As half of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, all sexually active women should take folic acid supplements.

== Stages of Pregnancy ==
{{wikipedia|Fetal development}}
Pregnancy begins with fertilization, when the sperm from the man join with the egg from a woman.  Fertilization, also called conception, occurs in the fallopian tubes, and the newly created embryo will continue to develop in the fallopian tubes for several days.  Six to twelve days after fertilization, the embryo will embed itself into the uterine wall, where it will begin secreting hormones that can be detected by pregnancy tests.  Because pregnancy cannot be detected before implantation, some groups define conception, the beginning of pregnancy, as the time of implantation.

Doctors count the beginning of pregnancy as the first day of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP).  Because ovulation happen on average two weeks after menstruation, a newly created embryo is already two weeks old!  It is normal and common for ovulation to happen earlier or later in the menstrual cycle, however, so often age estimates based on LMP will be wrong.  Sometimes doctors will do an ultrasound of an early pregnancy to estimate its age (based on size of the embryo).  This measurement is more accurate than calculation from a woman's LMP.

Development of all major proto-organs is complete seven weeks after fertilization, about nine weeks LMP.  At this point, the embryo is called a fetus.  The fetus continues to develop until the end of pregnancy.

The average pregnancy lasts 40 weeks from a woman's last menstrual period (this would be 38 weeks from fertilization).  Pregnancy lengths of between 38 and 42 weeks are considered normal.  Any baby born before 38 weeks is considered premature, and is at increased risk for health problems.  Pregnant women should ask their doctor to describe the symptoms of premature labor, and should call their doctor or go to the hospital if they are worried they might be in premature labor.

==Miscarriage==
{{wikipedia|Miscarriage}}
Over 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, almost all in the first trimester.  Some of these miscarriages may occur without a woman ever knowing she is pregnant.  While there are medical treatments for later-term pregnancies that threaten to miscarry, there are no known treatments for early miscarriages.  It is believed that most early miscarriages are caused by chromosomal defects in the embryo or fetus.

Sometimes a miscarriage is 'incomplete', meaning some embryonic or fetal tissue is left inside the woman.  This tissue can become infected, which is a serious health concern for the woman.  Women who know they have miscarried should be monitored by a doctor to verify that the miscarriage was complete.  The doctor might make sure the levels of pregnancy hormone (hCG) in the woman's blood have dropped.  An ultrasound could also be performed to see that the woman's uterus was empty.  Even if the doctor is not concerned about infection, the woman may want to finish the process of miscarriage without waiting the weeks it sometimes takes to occur naturally.  A procedure called Dilation and Curettage(D&amp;C) may be used to remove the contents of the uterus.

==Childbirth==
{{wikipedia|Childbirth}}
===Type===
There are two ways to give birth to a baby: vaginally and by C-section (the &quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;caesarian,&quot; because people used to think this was how Julius Caesar was born.)  Vaginal birth is where the baby is pushed out the woman's vagina.  C-section is where an incision is made in the woman's abdomen, and surgeons pull the baby out.

The average woman will recover from a vaginal birth about three times faster than from a C-section.  A C-section is major abdominal surgery, and like all surgeries, it carries risks such as infection and blood loss.

In case of birth complications, however, C-sections can be lifesaving to both mother and baby.  

===Birth options===
Most women give birth to their babies in a hospital.  Hospitals have the most up-to-date technology and have surgical teams available to deliver babies by C-section if necessary.

Women may also birth in a birth center.  These centers tend to provide more support for women seeking to avoid medical interventions (such as drugs for pain control), and are almost always run by midwives. Many birth centers are attached to hospitals, so the resources of the hospital are readily available in case of complications. Some birth centers have a &quot;Know Your Midwife&quot; scheme, where during their pregnancy women get to meet the midwives that will be with them for their birth.

Depending on where they live, women may also be able to find a midwife that will attend a birth at their home. In this way women get to know really well the person who will help them at the birth of their baby. Some women who plan to birth at home will transfer to a hospital to receive pain medicines or for other medical assistance. Most midwives who offer home births will provide follow-up care for up to 6 weeks after the baby is born. Studies of planned home births in low-risk pregnancies have shown that they are just as safe as planned hospital births.

== Pregnancy Issues ==
===Keeping healthy===
Not every pregnancy is straight-forward, and this is why it is important that pregnant women receive pre-natal care. These days many women are offered tests during their pregnancy to determine how things are going, and whether they need help keeping themselves and their babies healthy. Women may be offered blood or urine tests to check for gestational diabetes, and ultrasounds to check on the growth of the baby -  different places test for different things and it is always good to ask questions before consenting to any procedure. 

People today know that drug, alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy can create problems for the mother and the baby, and most health care providers will have strategies to help pregnant women where this is an issue.

=== Morning Sickness ===
During pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, women are often nauseous and may throw up.  While this condition is called 'morning' sickness, it may occur at any time of day.

Eating frequent small meals and snacks may help reduce the severity of morning sickness.  In extreme cases, IV fluids and anti-nausea drugs may be needed to protect the woman's health.

Several natural and mild drug remedies exist to treat morning sickness. Natural remedies include an increase in vitamin B12 intake and using ginger. Vitamin B12 can be increased by drinking red raspberry leaf tea or through an oral vitamin.

=== Ectopic Pregnancy ===
An ectopic pregnancy occurs when an embryo implants in a location other than the uterus.  Most commonly, this is in a fallopian tube (a &quot;tubal pregnancy&quot;), but embryos may also implant in the abdominal cavity or an ovary. Tubal pregnancies, if allowed to continue, will burst and threaten the woman's life due to internal bleeding.

== Multiple Births ==

Sometimes a woman can be pregnant with more then one child at a time. 2 fetuses are called &quot;twins&quot;, 3 are called &quot;triplets&quot;, and 4 are called &quot;quadruplets&quot;. If the fetuses are '''identical''', it means that they are split from a single fertilized egg, and therefore have the same DNA. Fetuses that are '''fraternal''' are the result of multiple eggs that were released simultaneously, and each fertilized by different sperm.

Couples who are having difficulty conceiving a child may resort to fertility treatments. Fertility treatments known as injectables can cause many eggs to be released, and therefore create the potential for multiple births. If in vitro fertilization is used, the woman and her doctor might choose to place many embryos into the woman's uterus.  It is not unheard of for a couple on such treatments to have groups of 5 babies or more simultaneously, although couples are offered selective reduction (abortion of one or more fetuses to decrease health risks to the remaining fetuses) for any pregnancy higher than twin.

== Adoption ==
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.  These couples may choose to make an '''adoption''' plan for their baby. In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may parent the child.  Adoption is considered one of the three options (in addition to abortion or raising a child) available to women and couples who experience unplanned or unwanted pregnancy.  

Couples who cannot have children themselves often consider adopting a child or children.  Also, couples who have a child or children of their own may want to help other children through adoption.  Single people may also choose to grow their family through adoption.

Adoption may be done through a government agency, a private agency, or through a &quot;private adoption.&quot;  Government and private agencies require single people or couples considering adoption to go through a home study, where a caseworker evaluates their ability to parent a child.  Government agencies typically handle adoption cases where the child was abandoned or removed from the parents due to abuse or neglect.  Private agencies typically handle adoption cases where the birth parents choose to make an adoption plan.  In countries where private adoption is legal, the birth parents choose a couple to adopt their child without any formal evaluation process.

== Abortion ==
Women may decide it is not in their best interest to continue the pregnancy.  Abortion means a doctor helps a woman end the pregnancy, which kills the developing embryo or fetus. Abortion may not be legal in all jurisdictions, and aborting a pregnancy at certain times in the pregnancy might be illegal as well.

I love the intro. This wikibook's material could come in handy with the other one. [[User:Peteturtle|Peteturtle]] 23:15, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:I dont know that it needs to be merged, but I think that the title should likely be changed to reflect what exactly this book wants to do and how it is different from the other book. If this really isn't going to be different from the other physics books we have, it should definitely be merged. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:19, 16 August 2007 (UTC)
:I think that the title should be changed to something more energy related. Perhaps even just &quot;Energy&quot; if it is categorised correctly in the physics bookshelf, or &quot;Energy in Physics&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Coercion by Member Template&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To increase the flexibility of a class template's interface by allowing the class template to participate in the same implicit type conversions (coercion) as its parameterizing types enjoy.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
It is often useful to extend a relationship between two types to class templates specialized with those types. For example, suppose that class D derives from class B. A pointer to an object of type D can be assigned to a pointer to B; C++ supports that implicitly. However, types composed of these types do not share the relationship of the composed types. That applies to class templates as well, so a &lt;code&gt;Helper&amp;lt;D&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object normally cannot be assigned to a &lt;code&gt;Helper&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class B {};
class D : public B {};
template &lt;class T&gt;
class Helper {};

B *bptr;
D *dptr;
bptr = dptr; // OK; permitted by C++

Helper&lt;B&gt; hb;
Helper&lt;D&gt; hd; 
hb = hd; // Not allowed but could be very useful
&lt;/source&gt;

There are cases where such conversions are useful, such as allowing conversion from &lt;code&gt;std::auto_ptr&amp;lt;D&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;std::auto_ptr&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That is quite intuitive, but isn't supported without using the Coercion by Member Template Idiom.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Define member template functions, in a class template, which rely on the implicit type conversions supported by the parameter types. In the following example, the templated constructor and assignment operator work for any type U, for which initialization or assignment of a &lt;code&gt;T *&lt;/code&gt; from a &lt;code&gt;U *&lt;/code&gt; is allowed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
class Ptr
{
  public:
    Ptr () {}

    Ptr (Ptr const &amp; p)
      : ptr (p.ptr)
    {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Copy constructor\n&quot;;
    }

    // Supporting coercion using member template constructor.
    // This is not a copy constructor, but behaves similarly.
    template &lt;class U&gt;
    Ptr (Ptr &lt;U&gt; const &amp; p)
      : ptr (p.ptr) // Implicit conversion from U to T required
    {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Coercing member template constructor\n&quot;;
    }

    // Copy assignment operator.
    Ptr &amp; operator = (Ptr const &amp; p)
    {
      ptr = p.ptr;
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Copy assignment operator\n&quot;;
      return *this;
    }

    // Supporting coercion using member template assignment operator.
    // This is not the copy assignment operator, but works similarly.
    template &lt;class U&gt;
    Ptr &amp; operator = (Ptr &lt;U&gt; const &amp; p)
    {
      ptr = p.ptr; // Implicit conversion from U to T required
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Coercing member template assignment operator\n&quot;;
      return *this;
    } 

    T *ptr;
};

int main (void)
{
   Ptr &lt;D&gt; d_ptr;
   Ptr &lt;B&gt; b_ptr (d_ptr); // Now supported
   b_ptr = d_ptr;         // Now supported
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Another use for this idiom is to permit assigning an array of pointers to a class to an array of pointers to that class' base. Given that D derives from B, a D object '''is-a''' B object. However, an array of D objects '''is-not-an''' array of B objects. This is prohibited in C++ because of slicing. Relaxing this rule for an array of pointers can be helpful. For example, an array of pointers to D should be assignable to an array of pointers to B (assuming B's destructor is virtual). Applying this idiom can achieve that, but extra care is needed to prevent copying arrays of pointers to one type to arrays of pointers to a derived type. Specializations of the member function templates or [[More C++ Idioms/SFINAE|SFINAE]] can be used to achieve that.

The following example uses a templated constructor and assignment operator expecting &lt;code&gt;Array&amp;lt;U *&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to only allow copying Arrays of pointers when the element types differ.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
class Array
{
  public:
    Array () {}
    Array (Array const &amp; a)
    {
      std::copy (a.array_, a.array_ + SIZE, array_);
    }

    template &lt;class U&gt;
    Array (Array &lt;U *&gt; const &amp; a)
    {
      std::copy (a.array_, a.array_ + SIZE, array_);
    }

    template &lt;class U&gt;
    Array &amp; operator = (Array &lt;U *&gt; const &amp; a)
    {
      std::copy (a.array_, a.array_ + SIZE, array_);
    }

    enum { SIZE = 10 };
    T array_[SIZE];
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Many smart pointers such as std::auto_ptr, boost::shared_ptr employ this idiom.

=== Caveats ===
A typical mistake in implementing the Coercion by Member Template Idiom is failing to provide the non-template copy constructor or copy assignment operator when introducing the templated copy constructor and assignment operator. A compiler will automatically declare a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator if a class does not declare them, which can cause hidden and non-obvious faults when using this idiom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Checked delete&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Increase safety of delete expression.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation and Sample Code ===
The C++ Standard allows, in 5.3.5/5, pointers to incomplete class types to be deleted with a delete-expression. When the class has a non-trivial destructor, or a class-specific operator delete, the behavior is undefined. Some compilers issue a warning when an incomplete type is deleted, but unfortunately, not all do, and programmers sometimes ignore or disable warnings.

In the following example, main.cpp can see the definition of Object.  However, main() calls delete_object() -- defined in deleter.cpp -- which ''does not'' see the definition of Object, but only forward declares it.  Calling &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; on a partially defined type like this is undefined behavior which some compilers do not flag.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
////////////////////
// File: deleter.hpp
////////////////////
// declares but does not define Object
struct Object;
void delete_object(Object* p);

////////////////////
// File: deleter.cpp
////////////////////
#include &quot;deleter.hpp&quot;

// Deletes an Object without knowing its definition
void delete_object(Object* p) { delete p; }

////////////////////
// File: object.hpp
////////////////////
struct Object
{
  // this user-defined destructor won't be called when delete
  // is called on a partially-defined (i.e., predeclared) Object
  ~Object() {
     // ...
  }
};

////////////////////
// File: main.cpp
////////////////////
#include &quot;deleter.hpp&quot;
#include &quot;object.hpp&quot;

int main() {
  Object* p = new Object;
  delete_object(p);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The checked delete idiom relies on calls to a function template to delete memory, rather than calls to &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;, which fails for declared but undefined types.

The following is the implementation of boost::checked_delete, a function template in the Boost Utility library. It forces a compilation error by invoking the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; operator on the parameterizing type, &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is declared but not defined, &lt;code&gt;sizeof(T)&lt;/code&gt; will generate a compilation error or return zero, depending upon the compiler. If &lt;code&gt;sizeof(T)&lt;/code&gt; returns zero, checked_delete triggers a compilation error by declaring an array with -1 elements. The array name is ''type_must_be_complete'', which should appear in the error message in that case, helping to explain the mistake.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;class T&gt; 
inline void checked_delete(T * x)
{
    typedef char type_must_be_complete[ sizeof(T)? 1: -1 ];
    (void) sizeof(type_must_be_complete);
    delete x;
}
template&lt;class T&gt; 
struct checked_deleter : std::unary_function &lt;T *, void&gt;
{
    void operator()(T * x) const
    {
        boost::checked_delete(x);
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

'''NOTE''': This same technique can be applied to the array delete operator as well. 

'''WARNING''': std::auto_ptr does not use anything equivalent to checked delete. Therefore, instantiating std::auto_ptr using an incomplete type may cause undefined behavior in its destructor if, at the point of declaration of the std::auto_ptr, the template parameter type is not fully defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dark Ages ==

I replaced &quot;Dark Ages&quot; title of the section after Arab conquest with &quot;Advent of Islam&quot; 
Dark Ages as a title of part of history is too controversial and might be considered politically motivated, especially in the history of a country of 98% Muslim population, many of who believe Islam is not a solely Arab religion but a religion for the world. 
If any consensus exists about the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, it would rather suit more Mongolian invasion era.

:: Dark Ages does not refer to the Islamic Invasions in particular but to the period of history following Sassanid rule when the center of power was shifted from Iran to Arabia and a period of political instability when a number of regional dynasties rose and fell with none able to provide a stable government. If &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is used to refer to the MOngolian Invasion then it is equally politically motivated. Opinions differ. Iranian Islam is the Shiite variety which is very different from the variety practised in Arabia and many Iranians (some even devout Muslims) believe that the rule of the Caliphate (especially the Omayyads) was a period when persecution of Iranians was rampant and a dark chapter in Iran's history. To verify these points, I request yo to perform a search in Wikipedia :-) -[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 03:44, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

== Some suggestions ==

Here are some mistakes I've seen cross-wiki and would not want repeated:
*Focus on current events-i.e., half of the book is on current events, the other half on &quot;real&quot; history.
*Framework but not content-i.e., a ton of headers per page but maybe one paragraph on the whole page.
*NPOV-taking the position of things that are just theories and not fact, unless there is some weighing of facts exhibited.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Physics is a way of thinking, a way of doing things, and a way of learning about the world around us. 

Much information about the natural world is gathered through our five senses. Thus, the subject matter of scientific inquiry is sensory information, which is obtained through the use of our senses. Observations and experiences evolve into concepts. For example, the push or pull we experience in our muscles is conceptualized as force. 

In physics, concepts take on meaning only as we operate ''with'' them, that is, we do something with them or about them, or use them in a special way. In this module, you will do laboratory investigations (anytime you can, if you can). You will also make estimates of human speeds or calculate the acceleration of a skater. You will also be required to design solutions to everyday problems and perform a series of tests on the solution you have provided, like in the following activity. 

==Problem Solving and the Scientific Method==

The following activity is an example of a problem that physicists, scientists, or engineers may be working on. Remember the moon buggy and the Mars explorer? These vehicles were actually designed and built for navigating and investigating extra-terrestrial locations. Concepts on forces and motion were considered in the design.

'''Activity 1.1'''     &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Balloon-powered Car&lt;/font&gt;

'''Materials'''

:2 large balloons&lt;br&gt;
:drinking straw&lt;br&gt;
:various materials to construct a race

'''Your Task'''

:To design, construct, and test a race car that:

* is powered by no more than two large balloons.

* is made from any materials available.

* must have at least three wheels. The wheels cannot be taken from a toy car, but from something that was not originally meant to be used as wheels.

* must remain in contact with the ground at all times.

* must be capable of traveling at least 5 meters.

Scientists do not just come up with one design—rather, they plan and work with several possible solutions to the problem. From a list of possible solutions, they select a few and start constructing the design which is most likely to work. Once a working model is available, they perform various tests to answer problems related to the design and construction aspects. Figure 1.14 outlines the steps that a problem solver like you can follow in coming up with a balloon-powered race car.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Physics is the pioneer science. 
Its development into a full-blown science is largely attributed to the successful works of Galileo (1584-1642) and Newton (1642-1727). Moreover, the concepts of the younger sciences, like chemistry, are reducible to that of physics. 

Like all other sciences, though, physics employs the scientific method. It deals with the basic nature of all matter and various ways that matter interacts with other matter. 

Chemistry deals with the interaction between atoms and properties of substances that result from such interaction. Geology and astronomy are specialized sciences in which the basic principles of physics and chemistry are used to understand Earth and other heavenly bodies. 

Biology is concerned with the nature of living things. You have learned that the cell is the basic unit of life. Inside the cell, particularly in the nucleus, are the molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA—the storehouse of information about different life forms in this planet Earth.

The boundary between sciences has been broken down. Most of the promising fields of research today lie at the borders of physics and other sciences. Some examples are biophysics, physical chemistry and chemical physics. The interface of physics, biology and chemistry is most important in the molecular and atomic levels.

==Physics and Mathematics==

Physics has progressed using the tools of mathematics. On the other hand, mathematics has developed from its association with physics. Differential calculus and integral calculus were developed by Newton to cope with the problem of motion and rates. Vector analysis arose as a tool of mechanics.

== Negative numbers ==

''The intended audience for this lesson is students, whether children or adults.  For the same lesson, but aimed at an audience of parents and educators, whether in traditional or home-schooling environments, please see [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Primary_mathematics:Negative_numbers this Wikiversity page].'' 

===Introduction===

Negative numbers are numbers less than zero.  A convenient way to think of them is as a number owed.  For example, if you have negative four apples, that means you owe four apples to someone.  A dash is typically used to indicate a negative value.  In our case, we would write -4 apples.

Some other examples of negative numbers are temperatures below zero, depths below sea-level, or floors in a building below the ground.  Opposites can also be used, like forward and backward (negative distance), going faster and slower (negative acceleration), give and take (giving negative quantities), and heating and cooling (adding negative heat).

Negative numbers are always shown with a minus sign (-) directly in front.  Positive numbers, which haven't required a label until now, are sometimes shown with a plus sign (+) directly in front, but this is optional.

===Addition involving negative numbers===

When adding two negative numbers, just find the sum and make it negative:

 -4 + -3 = -7

This can be visualized by the use of negative ''tiles'', each of which represent the number negative one (-1).

[[Image:-4+-3tiles.PNG|300px]]

The situation gets a bit more complicated when one of the numbers to be added together is negative and the other is positive.  Let's say we want to add positive two (+2) to negative three (-3).  If we draw the plus and minus signs, we can pair up each positive sign with one negative sign and then they cancel each other out.  This leaves one negative sign, though, meaning that +2 plus -3 equals -1:

[[Image:2+-3tiles.png]]

We can write this as:

 +2 + -3 = -1

It doesn't matter if we change the order in addition, so we also get:

 -3 + +2 = -1

Some people skip the plus sign on positive numbers, this gives us these two equations:

 2 + -3 = -1

 -3 + 2 = -1

Let's review.  To add two negative numbers, just add normally, then make the result negative:

 -4 + -3 = -7

When adding one negative number to one positive number, it can be rewritten as a subtraction problem:

 4 + -3 = 4 - 3 = 1

It may sometimes be necessary to change the order of the two terms to do this:

 -3 + 4 = 4 - 3 = 1

Any subtraction problem can also produce a negative value:

  -4 + 3 = 3 - 4 = '''-1'''






The last problem can be visualized as if you owed 4 apples, then got 3 (which you gave to the person to whom you owed the apples), so you would still owe them 1 apple.

===Subtraction involving negative numbers===

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the same positive number.  In other words, two negative signs makes a positive:

 5 - -2 = 5 + 2 = 7

Or, if both numbers are negative:

 -5 - -2 = -5 + 2 = 2 - 5 = -3

To illustrate the last example, imagine five negative signs, then you subtract, or take away, two negative signs, leaving you with three negative signs:

[[Image:-5--2tiles.png]]

It gets a bit trickier when you need to subtract more negatives than you start with.  Here we start with one negative but need to take away four.  This requires us to add three sets of positives and negatives, which cancel each other out.  Then, once we remove the four negatives, that leaves us with three positives:

[[Image:-1--4tiles.png]]

This means:

 -1 - -4 = +3

The other method is to say, since two negative signs make a positive sign, we instead can write:

 -1 + 4 = 4 - 1 = 3

Note that, unlike addition, you can't change the order in a subtraction problem, or you may get a different answer.  This is true whether you are subtracting positive or negative numbers:

 9 - 8 = +1

 8 - 9 = -1

===Multiplication involving negative numbers===

Just multiply normally, then apply the following rules:

*If both numbers are negative (or both are positive), the result is positive.

*If only one number is negative, the result is negative.

Thus:
 
  4 ×  3 =  12
 -4 × -3 =  12
 -4 ×  3 = -12
  4 × -3 = -12

You can change the order in multiplication, but, unlike addition, there isn't much advantage to doing this.  Here are the previous examples in the reverse order:

  3 ×  4 =  12
 -3 × -4 =  12
  3 × -4 = -12
 -3 ×  4 = -12

===Division involving negative numbers===

Just divide normally, then apply the following rules:

*If both numbers are negative (or both are positive), the result is positive.

*If only one number is negative, the result is negative.

Note that these are the same rules as were used for multiplication:

  12 ÷  3 =  4
 -12 ÷ -3 =  4
  12 ÷ -3 = -4
 -12 ÷  3 = -4

Here's those examples are again, using the alternate slash notation instead of the familiar division sign:

  12 /  3 =  4
 -12 / -3 =  4
  12 / -3 = -4
 -12 /  3 = -4

Note that you can't change the order in division, just like you can't in subtraction, or you get a different answer.  Here are the previous examples in the reverse order:

  3 /  12 =  1 / 4
 -3 / -12 =  1 / 4
 -3 /  12 = -1 / 4
  3 / -12 = -1 / 4

===Other notations===

Negative numbers are sometimes shown in parenthesis, in red, or with DB (for DeBit) next to them, in the field of accounting (that is, when dealing with money).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Classical physics had for its scope the three dimensions of space: length, width, and depth. With Einstein's Theory of Relativity, a fourth dimension was added, time. Now with science affecting almost all facets of our lives, a fifth dimension has emerged, society. As members of society, we would like to learn how physics can be used for personal development. Science through technology influences and determines not only the way we live our lives but our very being as well. We may not be aware of it but science pervades our daily life. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;6. As you travel from your home to school, make a list of all things you pass by which you think have physics applications.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Right in our very homes we apply the laws and principles of physics even in simple activities like cooking. We know that food cooks faster in covered pots or pans. Preparing food is made even faster and more convenient with the invention of gadgets like the microwave oven, pressure cooker, turbo broiler, and food processor, all of which applies to the principles of physics.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;7. Cite other common health practices and their scientific basis.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Physics, Technology, and Society==

Physics is different from technology. Technology yields inventions; physics provides explanations of the natural world. Technology is concerned with the practical applications of scientific laws and theories. The cell phone, electric motor, flat screen colored TV, DVD players, and computers are technological advances. These are results of the application of the laws of electromagnetism. 

A further explanation of the distinction between physics and technology is that during Newton's time, only the theory of space travel had been developed and not its technology. Landing on the moon was then only a dream, more so with studying Jupiter or the Sun up close. However, developments in space travel technology have turned those dreams into realities.

Many of our modern technologies are physics-based. The products of these technologies are in the form of goods and services utilized by the people: medical  techniques for diagnosis and therapy using ultrasound or ionizing radiation; advances in transportation and communication such as natural gas or hybrid vehicles, the rapid mass transit system, satellites, and wireless communication. While physics provides solutions to our questions about nature, technology provides solutions to our practical problems such as better food production, greater supply of fuel, and alternative sources of energy for power generation or the transport industry. 

The demands for energy or technology-related solutions stimulate developments in science. For instance, dwindling fossil fuel resources encouraged scientists to look for new energy sources.

On the other hand, science stimulates technological growth. Discovery of new energy sources and their most efficient utilization served as basis for the development of large-scale technologies. The scientist's need for better and accurate tools and instruments for observation and experiments motivates technologists to develop sophisticated equipment such as those used in the medical field and telecommunications industry. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;8. Read about developments on fuels for the transport industry. What physics-related ideas were applied in these developments?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;9. Visit the University of the Philippines National Institute of Physics website at http://www.nip.upd.edu.ph to learn more about researches they are doing and instruments they have constructed to facilitate their research. Prepare a report on one research/instrument in line with your interest.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Modern technology demands large quantities of energy. It is estimated that residents of industrialized countries use between 150 and 350 gigajoules per person each year; mostly in the form of electricity. Figure 1.5 shows the world's energy consumption. 

[[Image:energyconsumption.jpg|center|Fig. 1.5 The world's energy consumption]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;10. Create your own physics timeline of events which reflects important physics-related inventions and discoveries in the course of time from the dawn of history up to this time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The history of technology is a story of the mechanization of labor by using large amounts of energy. It all began with the invention of the steam engine which ushered in the Industrial Revolution. The steam engine, along with significant developments such as the internal combustion engine and the large-scale generation of electricity, has supplied energy requirements for producing goods and the delivery of services to people. 

Through the use of transistors and IC's, electrical devices have been transistorized, miniaturized, and automated. Computers and robots are used not only in industry but in homes and business establishments as well. Their use has helped bring about greater productivity, although they have tended to displace people in the work force. 

Computers and robots are considered technological advances which bring about increased efficiency. Fewer people can do more in less time because more extensive means are available to utilize nature more rapidly and completely.

Humankind's technological needs have been greatly met and many of our dreams like landing on the moon or living in space have been realized as a result of such high-energy consumption. 

Science and technology have influenced to a great extent the quantity and the quality of the modern or technological man's life. A person's average life span has been increased by medical advances. We enjoy the conveniences that electrical appliances provide, like the light bulb and flatiron. Today's smart homes combine information and communication technology to make life easier and more efficient. At night, lights in a smart home automatically turn on or off depending on the presence of the people in the room. You don't need to open the refrigerator to get cold water. It can be dispensed right from the refrigerator door. 

For increased mobility, there are cars, buses, bicycles, tricycles, trains, and airplanes. These fast and convenient means of transportation afford more time for other worthwhile activities.

Communication has also become fast and efficient with mobile phones and the services they offer. Gone are the days of the telegraph where the sender had to wait for at least three days before a message was received. Now, there is the fax, e-mail, and short messaging service (SMS) where information can be received in real time. 

We must, however, remember that whatever the advancements made in science and technology are, these should benefit mankind. Their wise and proper utilization to ensure the greatest good for everyone lies in the hands of those who have studied and understood the pros and cons of every scientific endeavor.

In this chapter, the way the cells of the body are organised into different tissues is described. You will find out how these tissues are arranged into organs, and how the organs form systems such as the digestive system and the reproductive system. Also in this chapter, the important concept of homeostasis is defined. You are also introduced to those pesky things -- directional terms.

==Objectives==
After completing this section, you should know:
* the “Mrs Gren” characteristics of living organisms
* what a tissue is
* four basic types of tissues, their general function and where they are found in the body
* the basic organisation of the body of vertebrates including the main body cavities and the location of the following major organs: thorax, heart, lungs, thymus, abdomen, liver, stomach, spleen, intestines, kidneys, sperm ducts, ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, urinary bladder
* the 11 body systems
* what homeostasis is
* directional terms including dorsal, ventral, caudal, cranial, medial, lateral, proximal, distal, rostral, palmar and plantar.  Plus transverse and longitudinal sections

==The Organisation Of Animal Bodies==
Living organisms move, feed, respire (burn food to make energy), grow, sense their environment, excrete and reproduce.  These seven characteristics are sometimes summarized by the words “MRS GREN”. functions of:

'''M'''ovement

'''R'''espiration

'''S'''ensitivity

'''G'''rowth

'''R'''eproduction

'''E'''xcretion

'''N'''utrition

Living organisms are made from cells which are organised into tissues and these are themselves combined to form organs and systems.

Skin cells, muscle cells, skeleton cells and nerve cells, for example. These different types of cells are not just scattered around randomly but similar cells that perform the same function are arranged in groups. These collections of similar cells are known as '''tissues'''. 

There are four main types of tissues in animals. These are: 

* '''Epithelial''' tissues that form linings, coverings and glands,
* '''Connective''' tissues for transport and support
* '''Muscle''' tissues for movement and 
* '''Nervous''' tissues for carrying messages.

===Epithelial Tissues===

Epithelium (plural epithelia) is tissue that covers and lines.  It covers an organ or lines a tube or space in the body. There are several different types of epithelium, distinguished by the different shapes of the cells and whether they consist of only a single layer of cells or several layers of cells. 

====Simple Epithelia  - with a single layer of cells====
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals squamous epithelium.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.1''': Squamous epithelium]]
=====Squamous epithelium=====
Squamous epithelium consists of a single layer of flattened cells that are shaped rather like ‘crazy paving’.  It is found lining the heart, blood vessels, lung alveoli and body cavities (see diagram 4.1).  Its thinness allows molecules to diffuse across readily.                                                                
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals cuboidal epithelium.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.2''': Cuboidal epithelium]]
=====Cuboidal epithelium=====
Cuboidal epithelium consists of a single layer of cube shaped cells. It is rare in the body but is found lining kidney tubules (see diagram 4.2). Molecules pass across it by diffusion, osmosis and active transport. 
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology columinar epithelium.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.3''': Columnar epithelium]]
=====Columnar epithelium===== 
Columnar epithelium consists of column shaped cells. It is found lining the gut from the stomach to the anus (see diagram 4.3).  Digested food products move across it into the blood stream.
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals columnar epithelium with cilia.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.4''': Columnar epithelium with cilia]]
=====Columnar epithelium with  cilia=====
Columnar epithelium with  cilia on the free surface (also known as the apical side of the cell) lines the respiratory tract, fallopian tubes and uterus (see diagram 4.4). The cilia beat rhythmically to transport particles. 
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals transitional epithelium.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.5''': Transitional epithelium]]

====Transitional epithelium - with a variable number of layers====
The cells in transitional epithelium can move over one another allowing it to stretch. It is found in the wall of the bladder (see diagram 4.5).
{{clear}}
====Stratified epithelia - with several layers of cells====
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals stratified squamous epithelium.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.6''': Stratified squamous epithelium]]
Epithelia with several layers of cells are found where toughness and resistance to abrasion are needed.

=====Stratified squamous epithelium=====
Stratified squamous epithelium has many layers of flattened cells. It is found lining the mouth, cervix and vagina. Cells at the base divide and push up the cells above them and cells at the top are worn or pushed off the surface (see diagram 4.6). This type of epithelium protects underlying layers and repairs itself rapidly if damaged. 

=====Keratinised stratified squamous epithelium=====
Keratinised stratified squamous epithelium has a tough waterproof protein called '''keratin''' deposited in the cells.  It forms the skin found covering the outer surface of mammals. (Skin will be described in more detail in Chapter 5).
{{clear}}

===Connective Tissues===
Blood, bone, tendons, cartilage, fibrous connective tissue and fat (adipose) tissue are all classed as connective tissues.  They are tissues that are used for supporting the body or transporting substances around the body. They also consist of three parts: they all have cells suspended in a ground substance or '''matrix''' and most have '''fibres''' running through it. 

====Blood====
Blood consists of a  matrix - plasma, with several types of cells and cell fragments suspended in it. The fibres are only evident in blood that has clotted. Blood will be described in detail in chapter 8.

====Lymph====
Lymph is similar in composition to blood plasma with various types of white blood cell floating in it. It flows in lymphatic vessels. 

====Connective tissue ‘proper’====
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals loose connective tissue.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.7''': Loose connective tissue]]
Connective tissue 'proper' consists of a jelly-like matrix with a dense network of collagen and elastic fibres and various cells embedded in it. There are various different forms of ‘proper’ connective tissue (see 1, 2 and 3 below). 

=====Loose connective tissue=====
Loose connective tissue is a sticky whitish substance that fills the spaces between organs. It is found in the dermis of the skin (see diagram 4.7).

=====Dense connective tissue=====
Dense connective tissue contains lots of thick fibres and is very strong. It forms tendons, ligaments and heart valves and covers bones and organs like the kidney and liver. 
{{clear}}
====Adipose tissue====
Adipose tissue consists of cells filled with fat. It forms the fatty layer under the dermis of the skin, around the kidneys and heart and the yellow marrow of the bones.

[[File:Anatomy and Physiology of animals cartilage.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.8''': Cartilage]]
====Cartilage====
Cartilage is the ‘gristle’ of the meat. It consists of a tough jelly-like matrix with cells suspended in it.  It may contain collagen and elastic fibres.  It is a flexible but tough tissue and is found at the ends of bones, in the nose, ear and trachea and between the vertebrae (see diagram 4.8).
{{clear}}
====Bone====
Bone consists of a solid matrix made of calcium salts that give it its hardness. '''Collagen''' fibres running through it give it its strength. Bone cells are found in spaces in the matrix. Two types of bone are found in the skeleton namely '''spongy''' and '''compact bone'''. They differ in the way the cells and matrix are arranged. (See Chapter 6 for more details of bone).

===Muscle Tissues===
Muscle tissue is composed of cells that contract and move the body. There are three types of muscle tissue:

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals smooth muscle fibres.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.9''': Smooth muscle fibres]]
====Smooth muscle====
Smooth muscle consists of long and slender cells with a central nucleus (see diagram 4.9).
It is found in the walls of blood vessels, airways to the lungs and the gut. It changes the size of the blood vessels and helps move food and fluid along. Contraction of smooth muscle fibres occurs without the conscious control of the animal.
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals skeletal muscle fibres.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.10''': Skeletal muscle fibres]]
====Skeletal muscle====
Skeletal muscle (sometimes called '''striated''', '''striped''' or '''voluntary muscle''') has striped fibres with alternating light and dark bands. It is attached to bones and is under the voluntary control of the animal (see diagram 4.10).
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals cadriac muscle fibres.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.11''': Cardiac muscle fibres]]

====Cardiac muscle====
Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart where it produces the ‘heart beat’. Cardiac muscle cells are branched cylinders with central nuclei and faint stripes (see diagram 4.11). Each fibre contracts automatically but the heart beat as a whole is controlled by the '''pacemaker''' and the involuntary '''autonomic nervous system'''.
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals motor neuron.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.12''': A motor neuron]]
===Nervous Tissues=== 
Nervous tissue forms the nerves, spinal cord and brain. Nerve cells or '''neurons''' consist of a cell body and a long thread or axon that carries the nerve impulse. An insulating sheath of fatty material ('''myelin''') usually surrounds the axon. Diagram 4.12 shows a typical motor neuron that sends messages to muscles to contract.
{{clear}}

==Vertebrate Bodies== 

We are so familiar with animals with backbones (i.e. vertebrates) that it seems rather unnecessary to point out that the body is divided into three sections. There is a well-defined '''head''' that contains the brain, the major sense organs and the mouth, a '''trunk''' that contains the other organs and a well-developed '''tail'''. Other features of vertebrates may be less apparent. For instance, vertebrates that live on the land have developed a flexible neck that is absent in fish where it would be in the way of the gills and interfere with streamlining. Mammals but not other vertebrates have a sheet of muscle called the '''diaphragm''' that divides the trunk into the chest region or '''thorax''' and the '''abdomen'''.   

==Body Cavities==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals body cavities.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.13''': The body cavities]]

In contrast to many primitive animals, vertebrates have spaces or '''body cavities''' that contain the body organs. Most vertebrates have a single body cavity but in mammals the diaphragm divides the main cavity into a '''thoracic''' and an '''abdominal cavity'''. In the thoracic cavity the heart and lungs are surrounded by their own membranes so that cavities are created around the heart - the '''pericardial cavity''', and around the lungs – the '''pleural cavity''' (see diagram 4.13).
{{clear}}

==Organs==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals forming digestive systems.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.14''': Cells, tissues and organs forming the digestive system]]

Just as the various parts of the cell work together to perform the cell’s functions and a large number of similar cells make up a tissue, so many different tissues can “cooperate” to form an organ that performs a particular function. For example, connective tissues, epithelial tissues, muscle tissue and nervous tissue combine to make the organ that we call the stomach. In turn the stomach combines with other organs like the intestines, liver and pancreas to form the digestive system (see diagram 4.14).
{{clear}}

==Generalised Plan Of The Mammalian Body==
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals main organs vertebrate body.jpg|frame|'''Diagram 4.15''': The main organs of the vertebrate body]]

At this point it would be a good idea to make yourself familiar with the major organs and their positions in the body of a mammal like the rabbit. Diagram 4.15 shows the main body organs.
{{clear}}

==Body Systems== 

Organs do not work in isolation but function in cooperation with other organs and body structures to bring about the MRS GREN functions necessary to keep an animal alive. For example the stomach can only work in conjunction with the mouth and oesophagus (gullet). These provide it with the food it breaks down and digests. It then needs to pass the food on to the intestines etc. for further digestion and absorption. The organs involved with the taking of food into the body, the digestion and absorption of the food and elimination of waste products are collectively known as the digestive system.

===The 11 body systems=== 
# Skin
#: The skin covering the body consists of two layers, the '''epidermis''' and '''dermis'''. Associated with these layers are hairs, feathers, claws, hoofs, glands and sense organs of the skin. 
# Skeletal System
#: This can be divided into the bones of the skeleton and the joints where the bones move over each other.
# Muscular System
#: The muscles, in conjunction with the skeleton and joints, give the body the ability to move.
# Cardiovascular System
#: This is also known as the circulatory system. It consists of the heart, the blood vessels and the blood. It transports substances around the body.
# Lymphatic System
#: This system is responsible for collecting and “cleaning” the fluid that leaks out of the blood vessels. This fluid is then returned to the blood system.  The lymphatic system also makes antibodies that protect the body from invasion by bacteria etc. It consists of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, the spleen and thymus glands.
# Respiratory System
#: This is the system involved with bringing oxygen in the air into the body and getting rid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of processes that occur in the cell. It is made up of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, diaphragm, ribs and muscles that move the ribs in breathing.
# Digestive System
#: This is also known as the '''gastrointestinal system''', '''alimentary system''' or '''gut'''. It consists of the digestive tube and glands like the liver and pancreas that produce digestive secretions.  It is concerned with breaking down the large molecules in foods into smaller ones that can be absorbed into the blood and lymph. Waste material is also eliminated by the digestive system.
# Urinary System
#: This is also known as the '''renal system'''. It removes waste products from the blood and is made up of the kidneys, ureters and bladder.
# Reproductive System
#: This is the system that keeps the species going by making new individuals. It is made up of the ovaries, uterus, vagina and fallopian tubes in the female and the testes with associated glands and ducts in the male. 
# Nervous System
#: This system coordinates the activities of the body and responses to the environment. It consists of the sense organs (eye, ear, semicircular canals, and organs of taste and smell), the nerves, brain and spinal cord. 
# Endocrine System
#: This is the system that produces chemical messengers or hormones. It consists of various '''endocrine glands''' (ductless glands) that include the pituitary, adrenal, thyroid and pineal glands as well as the testes and ovary.

==Homeostasis==

All the body systems, except the reproductive system, are involved with keeping the conditions 
inside the animal more or less stable. This is called '''homeostasis'''. These constant conditions are essential for the survival and proper functioning of the cells, tissues and organs of the body. The skin, for example, has an important role in keeping the temperature of the body constant. The kidneys keep the concentration of salts in the blood within limits and the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas maintain the correct level of glucose in the blood through the hormone insulin. As long as the various body processes remain within normal limits, the body functions properly and is healthy. Once homeostasis is disturbed disease or death may result. (See Chapters 12 and16 for more on homeostasis).

==Directional Terms==
[[File:Direcoes anatomicas.svg|thumb|522px|'''Diagram 4.16''': The directional terms used with animals]]
[[File:TS mouse.JPG|frame|'''Diagram 4.17''': Transverse and longitudinal sections of a mouse]]
In the following chapters the systems of the body in the list above will be covered one by one.  For each one the structure of the organs involved will be described and the way they function will be explained. 

In order to describe structures in the body of an animal it is necessary to have a system for describing the position of parts of the body in relation to other parts. For example it may be necessary to describe the position of the liver in relation to the diaphragm, or the heart in relation to the lungs. Certainly if you work further with animals, in a veterinary clinic for example, it will be necessary to be able to accurately describe the position of an injury. The terms used for this are called '''directional terms'''.  

The most common directional terms are '''right''' and '''left'''. However, even these are not completely straightforward especially when looking at diagrams of animals. The convention is to show the left side of the animal or organ on the right side of the page. This is the view you would get looking down on an animal lying on its back during surgery or in a post-mortem. Sometimes it is useful to imagine ‘getting inside’ the animal (so to speak) to check which side is which. The other common and useful directional terms are listed below and shown in diagram 4.16.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! Term || Definition || Example
|-
| Dorsal || Nearer the back of the animal than || The backbone is dorsal to the belly
|-
| Ventral || Nearer the belly of the animal than || The breastbone is ventral to the heart
|-
| Cranial (or anterior) || Nearer to the skull than || The diaphragm is cranial to the stomach
|-
| Caudal (or posterior) || Nearer to the tail than || The ribs are caudal to the neck
|-
| Proximal || Closer to the body than (only used for structures on limbs) || The shoulder is proximal to the elbow
|-
| Distal || Further from the body than (only used for structures on limbs) || The ankle is distal to the knee
|-
| Medial || Nearer to the midline than || The bladder is medial to the hips
|-
| Lateral || Further from the midline than || The ribs are lateral to the lungs
|-
| Rostral || Towards the muzzle || There are more grey hairs in the rostral part of the head
|-
| Palmar || The &quot;walking&quot; surface of the front paw || There is a small cut on the left palmar surface
|-
| Plantar || The &quot;walking&quot; surface of the hind paw || The pads are on the plantar side of the foot
|}

Note that we don’t use the terms '''superior''' and '''inferior''' for animals. They are only used to describe the position of structures in the human body (and possibly apes) where the upright posture means some structures are above or superior to others.

In order to look at the structure of some of the parts or organs of the body it may be necessary to cut them open or even make thin slices of them that they can be examined under the microscope. The direction and position of slices or sections through an animal’s body have their own terminology.

If an animal or organ is sliced lengthwise this section is called a '''longitudinal''' or '''sagittal section'''. This is sometimes abbreviated to LS. 

If the section is sliced crosswise it is called a '''transverse''' or '''cross section'''. This is sometimes 
abbreviated to TS or XS (see diagram 4.17).

==Summary==

* The characteristics of living organisms can be summarised by the words “'''MRS GREN'''.”
* There are 4 main types of tissue namely: '''epithelial, connective, muscle''' and '''nervous tissues'''.
* '''Epithelial tissues''' form the skin and line the gut, respiratory tract, bladder etc.
* '''Connective tissues''' form tendons, ligaments, adipose tissue, blood, cartilage and bone, and are found in the dermis of the skin.
* '''Muscular tissues''' contract and consist of 3 types: '''smooth, skeletal and cardiac'''.
* Vertebrate bodies have a '''head, trunk''' and '''tail'''. Body organs are located in '''body cavities'''. 11 body systems perform essential body functions most of which maintain a stable environment or '''homeostasis''' within the animal.
* '''Directional terms''' describe the location of parts of the body in relation to other parts.

==Worksheets==

Students often find it hard learning how to use directional terms correctly. There are two worksheets to help you with these and another on tissues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Light is a form of energy. It travels in straight lines. 

* The speed of light is constant in a vacuum. It is approximately equal to 3.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;m/s.

* Light rays are regularly reflected by smooth, shiny surfaces. Images form on these surfaces. These are irregularly reflected by rough surfaces. No image forms on these surfaces. 

* Light rays are refracted when they pass at an angle from one medium to another. 

* Light travels in a less dense than in a denser medium. 

* Sunlight separates into different colors, called the visible spectrum, as it passes through a prism. The spectrum consists of the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

* Dispersion is the separation of visible light into its different colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

* Red, green, and blue (RGB) are the primary colors in light. 

* When white light falls on an object which does not transmit light, one of the following happens:

** all of the colors in white light are reflected: the object will appear light;

** some of the colors may be reflected: the object appears colored; and 

** all the colors are absorbed by the object: the object appears black.

* The colors of opaque objects are the colors they reflect and which reaches our eyes. The colors of transparent materials are the colors they transmit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Vedas (Sanskrit véda वेद &quot;knowledge&quot;) are a large body of texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures  of Hinduism.

==Source Of Veda==
The Veda is said to have been revealed by Brahma to ancient Rishis. The mode of communication was known as Sruti (what is heard in the minds of a person).

==The Four Samhitas==
Due to huge amount of the text present in the Veda, it was impossible for a single human to memorize, recite and understand the Veda. Vyasa Muni then decided to break the Veda into four Samhitas and simplify the same. The four Samhitas were as follows:

# [[/Rigveda|The Rigveda Samhita]]
# [[/Yajurveda|The Yajurveda Samhita]]
# [[/Samveda|The Samveda Samhita]]
# [[/Atharvaveda|The Atharvaveda Samhita]]

BookName=[[Orthopaedic Surgery]]|
CurrentPage=Swan Neck Deformity|
PrevPage=[[Orthopaedic Surgery/Lumbrical_Plus_Finger|Lumbrical Plus Finger]]|
NextPage=[[Orthopaedic Surgery/Boutonniere_Deformity|Boutonniere Deformity]]}}&lt;/br&gt;

The term swan neck derives from the shape of the finger when this deformity is present.  The neck of the swan arches back (into extension) as one moves from the torso to the head.  Finally, before reaching the head, the neck flexes forward to allow the swans head to sit upright and forward.  

With this introduction, one should realize that the Swan Neck Deformity is one of the most common conditions treated by the hand surgeon.  Unlike [[Orthopaedic_Surgery/Boutonniere_Deformity|Boutonniere deformity]] , the swan neck can be caused by many different anatomic problems.  These will be discussed along with some treatment principles.  

The so called &quot;double jointed&quot; finger:

Many children and even some adults have the ability to cock back the joints of the finger in a way they term &quot;double jointed&quot;.  In fact, all fingers are triple jointed and the phenomenon that they are exhibiting is usually nothing more than the formation of a temporary, self-induced, swan-neck deformity.  They do this by hyperextending their proximal interphalangeal joints and allowing the lateral bands of the extensor to sublux dorsally.  This anatomic configuration: dorsally subluxed lateral bands, hyperextended PIP joint and flexed dip joint is the signature of all types of swan neck deformity.

The pathological basis of Swan-Neck Deformity

The normal three jointed finger is designed to allow for controlled motion at three joints (DIP, PIP, and MCP).  Because of space considerations, the joints of the finger cannot contain separate flexors and extensors for all three joints.  These and other constraints make it so that the controlled flexion and extension of all three joints in a finger must be accomplished with only three separate groups of muscles:  Extrinsic extensors, extrinsic flexors, and intrinsics.  The design of the extensor mechanism is so refined that these three systems of muscles are all that is needed to independently control each of the joints of a finger.  

In the setting of swan-neck deformity.  The conjoined lateral bands which are normally volar to the axis of rotation of the PIP joint, sublux uncontollably dorsal to that same axis.  Instead of functioning normally as flexors of the PIP joint, they become extensors of that same joint.  The route that the lateral bands normally take around the condyles of the proximal phalanx as they proceed to their terminal insertion is thereby shortened.  The shortening of the route of the lateral bands serves to &quot;slacken&quot; them and the decreased tension is manifested at the DIP joint.  At the DIP joint, there is not enough tension to keep the joint fully extended and so the DIP joint droops down into flexion completing the swan neck deformity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section you will learn how to spell out numbers in English. Before we can spell out we must learn how numbers are arranged. We must know what we mean by units, tens , hundreds place and so on.

0 - Zero

1 - One

2 - Two

3 - Three

4 - Four

5 - Five

6 - Six

7 - Seven

8 - Eight

9 - Nine


Places: Using the number 1,234

The place names are: 
4 - Ones
3 - Tens
2 - Hundreds
1 - Thousands

It is spelled out as: One Thousand Two Hundred and Thirty Four

(Note: After the Thousands, place names can vary depending on local customs. Place a comma after every third number starting at the end of the number to show place value family names change.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hyperref also works with plain 'latex', not only 'pdflatex'. One must specify the right driver instead of 'pdftex', though. I only tested it with 'dvipdfm' (dvi-&gt;pdf directly), so I don't know if the ps output has hyperlinks, but the pdf output does.

See for example the documentation at http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html

== Addition ==

How about custom colours? Maybe you could add examples, like dark blue or teal (as in biblatex documentation for instance).

One can define custom colors for hyperref package by writing a small style file that adds to the predefined colors in the color.sty.
Specifically create the following mycolor.sty file containing the following lines:

\RequirePackage{color}

\definecolor{bwgreen}{rgb}{0.183,1,0.5}

\definecolor{bwmagenta}{rgb}{1,0.169,0.909}

\definecolor{bwblue}{rgb}{0.317,0.161,1}


These particular colors provide a clear high contract result when printed in color or black and white. Therefore they are useful when making figures that need to be readable in color or monochrome.

To use the newly defined colors with hyperref in your LaTeX document:


\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{mycolor}

\usepackage{hyperref}

\hypersetup{linkcolor=bwmagenta}

[...]


== Algorithms package ==
The following is stated in the end of the section named &quot;Problems with links&quot;

&quot;The problem can also occur with the algorithms package: because each algorithm uses the same line-numbering scheme, the line identifiers for the second and follow-on algorithms will be duplicates of the first.&quot;

As I get around 300 errors due to this, any method for fixing it is much appreciated.

== Problem with column separators ==

What if the url contains a symbol &amp;amp; (ampersand)? How to use \href?
:*In the URL section of an href, it doesn't seem that the TeX processor much cares about ampersands.  If the TeX processor gives you an error, escape the ampersand like &quot;\&amp;amp;&quot;.  If the link doesn't work as you expect it to in the final product, escape the ampersand for the browser by writing &quot;&amp;amp;amp;&quot;.  You may have to end up escaping the ampersand twice, writing &quot;\&amp;amp;amp;&quot;
:*If it's the description that contains the ampersand, just use \&amp;amp; instead of &amp;amp; to escape the ampersand for the TeX processor.
:[[Special:Contributions/68.118.159.98|68.118.159.98]] ([[User talk:68.118.159.98|talk]]) 06:53, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

== Underlining? ==
Is there any way to automatically underline links in the final output using the hyperref package, as is common in the world wide web?  Perhaps an &quot;underline=true&quot; configuration option? - [[Special:Contributions/68.118.159.98|68.118.159.98]] ([[User talk:68.118.159.98|talk]]) 06:55, 9 November 2008 (UTC)
:* The configuration option that works for me is &quot;pdfborderstyle={/S/U/W 1}&quot;, but I've googled that some older pdf viewer may have problems rendering it.

== Will table of contents be displayed as bookmarks (structured tree) in .pdf? ==
Hyperlinks will be in the pdf, but what about the bookmarks of the pdf?
[[User:Kazkaskazkasako|Kazkaskazkasako]] ([[User talk:Kazkaskazkasako|talk]]) 10:32, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
* everything that's included in the ToC will be included as bookmark. Because the Table of content isn't mentioned in the ToC itself it will not be included as a bookmark. [[User:Thijs.de.meester|Thijs]]([[User talk:Thijs.de.meester]]) 9:58 14 july 2009 (UTC)

== \hyperref example ==

It seems that including a \ref inside a \hyperref destroys its purpose: for the example given -- &quot;\hyperref[mainlemma]{lemma \ref{mainlemma}}&quot; -- only the lemma number is hyper-refed, and the &quot;lemma &quot; (sans quotes) part is not, whereas &quot;\hyperref[mainlemma]{lemma blah}&quot; would hyperref &quot;lemma blah&quot; (sans quotes). I will let someone more knowledgable than me correct it or correct me before changing it myself. [[User:Unco|Unco]] ([[User talk:Unco|talk]]) 23:08, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

== \hyperlink and \hypertarget ==

I found it much more useful to use \hyperlink{labelname}{descriptive text about link} and \hypertarget{labelname}{} for referencing things in my document than \hyperref[labelname}{some text}. In fact, I couldn't get the \hyperref command to work in conjunction with a \label{labelname}, so I gave up and luckily found this little tidbit. Hope it helps.

== ampersand problem ==

I need to have an ampersand in my url. I have to escape it by \&amp; to be able to compile latex code. But in the url the whole \&amp; is the shown and destroys the link.
Anybody knows a workaround? Hm ok the problem only exists within a table where &amp; is the column separator.

I have the same problem. If there's a workaround for this, please let me know. Thanks.

== Preventing a link? ==

I was wondering if there's a way to switch off the hyperlink for a particular thing.  Eg I have &quot;Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}&quot; in my header, and each header has the last page number highlighted as a link.  Of course, I could just wait until I was finished the document and replace it, but we all know that's not geek enough...[[User:Grj23|Grj23]] ([[User talk:Grj23|talk]]) 04:10, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

Ah, of course.  The starred form &quot;\pageref*{LastPage}&quot;, does the trick!  I wonder if this is worth incorporating into the main text, or is it too niche?  It's of course in the manual...[[User:Grj23|Grj23]] ([[User talk:Grj23|talk]]) 04:25, 26 July 2010 (UTC)


== Acrobat question, or link depth ==
When I try to follow multiple links through Acrobat, say *click* *click*, links don't do anything.  Exactly one link will work.  I assume this is an Acrobat problem, but I have checked through every setting and nothing fixes it.  Any ideas? [[Special:Contributions/99.155.53.151|99.155.53.151]] ([[User talk:99.155.53.151|talk]]) 08:35, 31 December 2010 (UTC)

== Colors as rgb triples ==

From trial and error, I found out, that only the ...bordercolor values can be set as RGB triples. If this is true (and not, possibly, due to some other package clash or so), please state this ''explicitely'' in the article, and please give some information about the allowed colors for the others. This information seems to be completely omitted in the hyperref manual, by the way.--[[User:SiriusB|SiriusB]] ([[User talk:SiriusB|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiriusB|contribs]]) 12:57, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

Addition: I have inserted a note about RGB triples being only valid for bordercolors. Please correct this if it is wrong; but then please answer the question why rgb triples for non-border colors lead to an error message about unknown colors while the same works fine for bordercolors.--[[User:SiriusB|SiriusB]] ([[User talk:SiriusB|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiriusB|contribs]]) 13:04, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

== It does too much! ==

Great, but what if I ''don't'' want to turn all my internal references into hyperlinks? Suppose I just want to create an ordinary pdf, with one or more links to webpages? The section on Hyperlinks ought to discuss that simpler question first.

==Mistake in hypersetup?==

I'm not a registered user, so I can't edit the book page, but I think there's a mistake in the section on using the \hypersetup command. The keyword attribute-value pair currently looks like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
pdfkeywords={keyword1} {key2} {key3}, % list of keywords
&lt;/source&gt;
but I think there are missing brackets, and it should be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
pdfkeywords={{keyword1} {key2} {key3}}, % list of keywords
&lt;/source&gt;
Can somebody change this?</text>

== Percentages ==

===Introduction===

A percentage is a value divided by 100, shown with the percent symbol (%).  For example, 4% is the same as the decimal value 0.04 or the fraction 4/100 (which could also be reduced to 1/25).

===Uses for percentages===

Traditionally, percentages are used when dealing with changes in a value, particularly money.  For example, a store may have a 20% off sale or a bank may charge 7.6% interest on a loan. 

===Defining the base===

The '''base''' of a percentage change is the starting value.  Many errors occur from using the wrong base in a percentage calculation.

===Example===

If a store has an $100 item, marks it 20% off, then charges 6% sales tax, what is the final price ?

First, calculate 20% of $100.  That's 0.20 × $100 or $20.  We then subtract that $20 from the original price of $100 to get a reduced sale price of $80.

Now we add in the sales tax.  Here's where the tricky part comes in; what is the base ?  That is, do we pay 6% tax on the original $100 price or on the reduced $80 price ?  In most places, we would pay tax on the reduced sales price, so $80 is the base.  Thus, we multiply $80 × 0.06 to get $4.80 and add that to $80 to get $84.80 for a final price.

Notice that even though we took off 20% and then added back in 6%, this is '''not''' the same as taking off 14%, since the 20% and the 6% figures each had a different base.  If the 6% sales tax did apply to the original full price, however, then both percentages would have the same base and the total reduction in price would, indeed, be 14%, bring the price down from $100 to $86.

===Terms used with percentages===

*If you take 20% '''off''' an amount (or a 20% reduction), that means the new price is 20% less than the original (100%) price, so it's now 80% '''of''' the original price.

*If you apply 20% '''interest''' to an amount, that means the new price is 20% higher than the original (100%) price, or 120% '''of''' the original price.  (Note that this is '''simple interest''', we will consider '''compound interest''' next.)

===Compound interest===

'''Simple interest''' is when you apply a percentage interest rate only once.  

'''Compound interest''' is when you apply the same percentage interest rate repeatedly.  

For example, let's say a $1000 deposit in a bank earns 10% interest each year, compounded annually, for three years.  After the first year, $100 in interest will have been earned for a total of $1100.  In the second year, however, there is not only interest on the $1000 deposit, but also on the $100 interest earned previously.  This &quot;interest on your interest&quot; is a feature of compounding.  So, in year two we earn 10% interest on $1100, for $110 in interest.  Add this to $1100 to get a new total of $1210.  The 10% interest in the third year on $1210 is $121, which gives us a total of $1331.

For those familiar with powers and exponents, we can use the following formula to calculate the total:

 T = P x (1 + I)&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;

Where:

 T = final Total
 P = initial Principal
 I = Interest rate per compounding period
 N = Number of compounding periods

In our example, we get:

 T = $1000 x (1 + 10%)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
   = $1000 x (1 + 0.10)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
   = $1000 x (1.10)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
   = $1000 x (1.10 x 1.10 x 1.10)
   = $1000 x (1.331)
   = $1331

More complex calculations involving compound interest will be covered in later lessons.

== Average, median, and mode ==

There are three primary '''measures of central tendency''', and a couple less often used measures, which each, in their own way, tell us what a typical value is for a set of data. Generally, when finding the measures of central tendency, one would order the values of the data set from '''least to greatest'''.

===Mode===

The '''mode''' is simply the number which occurs most often in a set of numbers.  For example, if there are seven 12-year olds in a class, ten 13-year olds, and four 14-year olds, the mode is 13, since there are more 13 year olds than any other age.  In elections, the mode is often called the '''plurality''', and the candidate who gets the most votes wins, even if they don't get the '''majority''' (over half) of the votes.

===Median===

The '''median''' is the middle value of a set of values.  For example, if students scored 81, 84, and 93 on a test; we select the middle value of 84 as the median.  

If you have an even number of values, the average of the two middle values is used as the median.  For example, the median of 81, 84, 86, and 93 is 85, since that's midway between 84 and 86, the two middle values.

===Average===

The '''straight average''', or '''arithmetic mean''',(sometimes referred to simply as &quot;'''average'''&quot; or &quot;'''mean'''&quot;), is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.  For example, if students scored 81, 84, and 93 on a test, the average is (81+84+93)/3 or 86.

===Weighted average===

The '''weighted average''' or '''weighted mean''', is similar to the straight average, with one exception.  When totaling the individual values, each is multiplied by a weighting factor, and the total is then divided by the sum of all the weighting factors.  These weighting factors allow us to count some values as &quot;more important&quot; in finding the final value than others.

===Example===

Let's say we had two school classes, one with 20 students, and one with 30 students.  The grades in each class on a particular test were:

:Morning class = 62, 67, 71, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 89, 93, 98

:Afternoon class = 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 90, 90, 90, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

The straight average for the morning class is 80% and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90%.  If we were to find a straight average of 80% and 90%, we would get 85% for the mean of the two class averages.  However, this is not the average of all the students' grades.  To find that, you would need to total all the grades and divide by the total number of students:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{4300\%}{50} = 86\%
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, you could find the weighted average of the two class means already calculated, using the number of students in each class as the weighting factor:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(20)80\% + (30)90\%}{20 + 30} = 86\%
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if we no longer had the individual students' grades, but only had the class averages and the number of students in each class, we could still find the mean of all the students grades, in this way, by finding the weighted mean of the two class averages.

===Geometric mean===

The '''geometric mean''' is a number midway between two values by multiplication, rather than by addition.  For example, the geometric mean of 3 and 12 is 6, because you multiply 3 by the same value (2, in this case) to get 6 as you must multiply by 6 to get 12.  The mathematical formula for finding the geometric mean of two values is:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{AB}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

 A = one value
 B = the other value

So, in our case:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3(12)} = \sqrt{36} = 6&lt;/math&gt;

Note the new notation used to show multiplication.  We now can omit the multiplication sign and show simply AB to mean A×B.  However, when using numbers, 312 would be confusing, so we put parenthesis around at least one of the numbers to make it clear.

The geometric mean can be extended to additional values:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{(2)(9)(12)} = \sqrt[3]{216} = 6&lt;/math&gt;

For three values, a cube root is performed instead of a square root.  On four values, the fourth root is performed.

{{Wikipedia|Cuisine of Cyprus}}
'''Cypriot cuisine''' is the cuisine encountered on the island of [[w:Cyprus|Cyprus]] located in the eastern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean Sea]].

==Overview==
Cypriot cuisine is shaped by the island's Mediterranean climate, its geography and history. Reflecting the two dominant populations, Cypriot cuisine has evolved as a fusion of Greek and Turkish cuisine with local twists to well known dishes. Further influences are evident from neighbouring countries, namely Arabic and [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern]] cuisine. There are remnants too of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Anglo-Saxon]] influences stemming from the island's occupation by the Luisignan Franks, the Venetians and the British. Modern western cuisine (especially fast food) has an ever increasing influence on the day-to-day diet followed on the island.

==Meals==

===Seafood===
Seafood dishes include [[Cookbook:Squid|calamari]], [[Cookbook:octopus|octopus]] in red wine, parpouni (red mullet), and sea bass.

===Vegetable===
Some common vegetable preparations are potatoes in [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]], pickled [[Cookbook:cauliflower|cauliflower]] and [[Cookbook:Beet|beets]], [[Cookbook:zucchini|zucchini]], [[Cookbook:Taro Root|kolokasi]] (taro), and [[Cookbook:asparagus|asparagus]].

===Meat===
Meat based dishes include [[Cookbook:souvlaki|souvlaki]], souvla, sheftalia and pork sausages.

==Food preparation==

Rice is prepared as the chard pilaf, locally called seskoulorizo, which contains [[Cookbook:Swiss Chard|chard]] leaves, chopped onions, long grain rice, peeled and chopped tomatoes, freshly ground pepper, olive oil and parsley. The meal is usually served with plain yoghurt and crusty bread. There is a variety of sweet snacks, which are found in most of the café bars around Cyprus, like the honey and syrup doughnuts. Honey is also used for the pastellaki, which is a snack prepared with sesame, peanut and honey syrup. There can be found many Oriental kebabs, with various kinds of beef or chicken meat, wrapped in a special bread and with various dressings.

==Drink==

===Non alcoholic===
[[Cookbook:Ayran|Ayran]] is a traditional [[Cookbook:yogurt|yoghurt]]-based drink also found in several countries of the region. In bygone days it was sold on streets by individual producers but it is now found on chilled supermarket shelves.

===Alcoholic===
[[Cookbook:Wine|Wine]] has a long tradition on the island, evidence of which goes back for millennia. [[w:Commandaria|Commandaria]] is a popular desert wine, and [[w:zivania|zivania]] is a potent spirit. [[w:Cyprus Brandy|Cyprus Brandy]] is also drunk with meze dishes. Local beer such as [[w:Keo beer|KEO]] and [[w:Leon beer|Leon]] are popular served chilled in the summer months especially as an adjunct to the Cypriot version of souvlaki.

The '''cuisine of Wales''' has influenced, and been influenced by, other [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British cuisine]].

Although both [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in [[w:Carmarthenshire|Carmarthenshire]] and [[w:Pembrokeshire|Pembrokeshire]], Wales is best known for its sheep, and thus [[Cookbook:lamb|lamb]] is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking. Specific dishes associated with Wales include:

*[[Cookbook:Bara brith|Bara brith]], &quot;speckled bread,&quot; is a sweetbread which originated in Wales. It is traditionally made with [[Cookbook:raisin|raisins]], [[Cookbook:Currant|Zante currant]], and candied peel.
*[[Cookbook:Cawl|Cawl]] is a Welsh [[Cookbook:stew|stew]] with lamb and [[Cookbook:Leek|leeks]].
*[[Cookbook:Crempog|Crempogs]] are Welsh [[Cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]] [[Cookbook:pancake|pancakes]].
*[[Cookbook:Faggot|Faggots]] are Welsh [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] meatballs.
*[[Cookbook:Laverbread|Laverbread]] is a Welsh [[Cookbook:seaweed|seaweed]] delicacy.
*[[Cookbook:Welsh Cake|Welsh cakes]] are small cakes cooked on a bakestone.
*[[Cookbook:Scouse|Lob Scows]] is a popular stew in [[w:Holyhead|Holyhead]] and [[w:Anglesey|Anglesey]], a version of the Liverpudlian 'Scouse'.
*[[Cookbook:Welsh Rarebit|Welsh rabbit]], or Welsh rarebit, is [[Cookbook:toast|toast]] with [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]] and [[Cookbook:butter|butter]].
*[[Cookbook:Glamorgan Sausage|Glamorgan sausage]] is cheese in breadcrumbs in the shape of a sausage.
*[[Cookbook:Cockles|Cockles]] are very popular in Wales and served in a variety of ways although usually steamed.

Various cheeses are produced in Wales. These include [[w:Caerphilly cheese|Caerphilly cheese]], [[w:Y Fenni (cheese)|Y Fenni cheese]], [[w:Farmhouse Llanboidy|Llanboidy cheese]], [[w:Red Devil (cheese)|Red Devil]], and an exceptionally strong variety of [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]], the &quot;Black Bomber.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a list of common (and uncommon) accessories you can get for guitar. It is not a buying guide, but it will give you an idea of what to expect in your local guitar shop. While they are not all necessary for playing guitar, some of them are extremely useful and are a good investment.

==Picks==
[[Image:Guitar picks-KayEss-1.jpeg |thumb|right|From top going clockwise:
1)Standard plastic pick
2)Imitation turtoiseshell pick
3)Plastic pick with high-friction coating
4)Stainless steel pick
5)Triangular plastic pick
6)&quot;Shark's fin&quot; pick]]
Picks are probably the most frequently bought guitar accessory. There are several reasons, but mostly it is because there are so many types of picks, and picks are so easily lost. When you go to the guitar store, you are overwhelmed by the agony of choice, and this is especially true for the beginner.

Picks are probably as old as guitars themselves, although most modern picks are made out of plastic, or sometimes metal. Apart from shape and size of the picks, its strength and the material used to make it are important, because these affect the &quot;feel&quot; of playing with the pick.

Up until about the 70's, most picks were made out of horn or turtle shell. Turtle shell was generally better, because it allowed some flexibility when hitting the strings. However, over time this was devastating the turtle population, and now most picks are made of nylon or plastic. Generally nylon picks have the same properties of the turtle shells, and plastic picks are thicker and denser. However, the general disadvantage of plastic picks is that they wear out quickly, especially if you play fast and hard.

Since the guitar industry constantly experiments with new materials, you might walk into the guitar shop and find something completely exotic. For example, you can buy picks made from hard leather, which are outstanding for classical guitars because of the soft feeling.

Selecting the correct pick for you depends above all on what style of guitar you want to play. Lead or rhythm? Will you be slowly strumming chords, or chugging away on distorted power chords? Each style is most easily accomplished with a particular type of pick. Generally speaking, how hard a pick you use depends on how hard your strings are. Heavier strings will require thicker picks, and vice versa. The shape of the pick determines how much operating area you have to use. For example, rhythm guitarists usually use blunter, larger picks, and lead guitarists use pointier picks so they can more precisely hit individual strings.

If you use hard picks, you will get a hard sound out of the strings, especially with metal picks. Generally the thicker the pick the less &quot;give&quot; there will be when you strum a chord. However, because no two companies manufacture picks with the same material, Company X's 76 mm pick will feel different than Company Y's 76 mm. Above all, remember that you should always select a pick based on your ability to handle it. You can only play well with a pick if it fits well in your hand.

Picks for the guitar typically range in thickness from the ultra thin 0.38 mm to the really thick 1.14 mm, although bass picks can be thicker. A mid range pick would be something about 76 mm thick. Beginners will usually prefer softer picks until they can learn to hold them securely.

Aside from the thickness and mass of the pick, there also exist different pick types. There's the finger pick, which fits over your fingers with a ring (thumb-pick is special because it's angled), and even your normal picks may have different shapes, such as shark-fin (better at chord), sharppoint, etc.

==Strings==

Each type of guitar uses its own type of strings. Strings are specifically designed for a type of guitar to give it a particular sort of sound. The differences between string types affect the guitar's tone, and it is not recommended to use a set of strings not made for your guitar. Not only would the result not sound good, but attempting to string a guitar with the wrong kind of strings would be difficult, frustrating, and might damage your instrument.

Three of the best and most popular brands of guitar strings for both acoustic and electric guitar are currently Ernie Ball, D'Addario, and Elixir. Ernie Balls and D'Addarios are much cheaper than Elixirs, but Elixirs will keep their bright tone for months (which is why they are higher-priced). But Elixirs can break as easily as any other strings, so they are perhaps best left to people who have been playing a long time and rarely snap strings. The difference between the other two brands is a matter of taste; try them both.

A '''classical guitar''' has three bronze wound strings and three strings made out of nylon, which are the higher pitched. 

A set of strings for a '''steel string acoustic''' has four bronze wound strings and two silvered steel strings, the steel ones being the thinnest and highest pitched.

A set of '''electric guitar strings''' are similar to an acoustic guitar's, except the strings are made of nickel instead of bronze and steel. Often there are three wound strings and three nickel strings, but you can also get four wound and two nickel.

The two most common gauges for the high E string in electric guitars are .009 inches and .010 inches (these measurements appear to be used often even in countries using the metric system). Often a whole set of strings is referred to by the gauge of the high E string, e.g., &quot;nines&quot; or &quot;tens&quot; for .009 and .010 gauges respectively. The beginning guitarist is recommended to start with .009s; many professionals also use this gauge, so many guitarists never &quot;outgrow&quot; it.

However, if you wish to try something new, you may want to try out .010 gauge strings once you get used to the lighter .009s. This is only recommended after you have been playing for a while, as your calluses need time to form, and your fingers need to get stronger. This procedure also applies to strings above the .010 range. There are also .011, .012, and .013 gauge strings readily available from all of the manufacturers mentioned above. The benefit of higher gauge strings is tone. If you are planning on playing metal guitar, or any other genre that uses a lot of distortion or overdrive, you probably will not notice a difference in the sound. Alternatively, if you are playing blues or rock, a higher gauge string will give you a heavier, &quot;dirtier&quot; sound, very preferable to these types of music. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan Stevie Ray Vaughan] is notorious for using very heavy gauge strings (some sources claim .014 gauge), contributing a lot to his signature tone.

==Tuning Aids==
[[Image:Chromatic-tuner.jpg|right|200px]]
'''Electronic tuners''' are a quick, accurate, and precise method of tuning. A tuner can be used in two ways, either through a built in microphone which detects sound, or by directly jacking in an electric guitar. When a note is played, the tuner determines the note you are playing, and then represents visually how sharp or flat the note is. Most models use a combination of lights and a display screen to indicate the tone of the note.

Electronic tuners can be easily drowned out by background noise when you do not jack directly into them. Because of this, they are best used in a quiet environment.
[[Image:Stimmgabel.jpg|left|75px]]

A '''tuning fork''' is a piece of U-shapes piece of metal that, when struck, emits a particular tone. Tuning forks are good because, unless bent, they will always emit the same note. The most common tuning forks resonate at either an A, which at the frequency of 440 hertz, or C. Using a tuning fork is generally recommended for more advanced players. You can buy a tuning fork that sounds the note E. Many guitarists prefer this due to the fact that the guitar's lowest and highest strings are both E.

To use a tuning fork, gently strike it against the heel of your hand and it will vibrate. Then, set the base of the fork against the body of the guitar if it is acoustic. The sound of the fork will be amplified through the guitar, and you can use it to tune your strings. If you have an electric guitar, you must hold the tuning fork to your ear, and then tune your strings. It is important not to strike the fork against a hard surface, as this may bend the fork out of tune.

If you are using an A tuning fork, then you should tune first to the harmonic on A string. However, you can also use the 5th fret on the low E string, the 7th fret of the D string, the 2nd fret on the G string, or the 5th fret on the high E string. All of these frets produce an A, although some are in a higher octave.

A '''pitchpipe''' is much like a tuning fork, in that it only plays one note and that note is used for tuning. To use a pitchpipe, you blow through the end like a whistle. Traditional breath powered pitchpipes are notoriously unreliable, because temperature changes can affect the note that they play. You can also purchase electronic pitchpipes, which emit notes through a speaker. Some electronic tuners also have this feature.

==Cables==

[[Guitar/Cables|Cables]] are used to connect two sound devices together, like a guitar and an amplifier. There are many different types, each for a different purpose, and it is good for a guitarist to familiarize themselves with some common types.

==String Crank==

A string crank is essentially a handle with a rotating cap, designed to fit over top of a tuning peg. It makes unwinding strings much quicker, and some also have a slot to help remove the pegs near the bridge that hold the strings in the body.

==Slide==
[[Image:Bottleneck.jpg |thumb|right|Metal Slide]]
A '''slide''' or '''bottleneck''' is a ceramic, glass or metal cylinder, usually worn on the fingers rather than held in the hand. The term slide is in reference to the sliding motion of the slide against the strings, while bottleneck refers to the original material of choice for such slides, which were the necks of glass bottles.

Instead of altering the pitch of the strings in the normal manner (by pressing the string against frets), a slide is placed upon the string to vary its vibrating length and pitch. This slide can then be moved along the string without lifting, creating continuous transitions in pitch.

==Capo==

[[Image:Capo2.jpg|thumb|200px|A basic guitar capo]]

A '''capo''' (short for ''capotasto'', which is Italian for &quot;head of fretboard&quot;) is a device used for shortening the strings, and hence raising the pitch of the guitar. Capos are used to change the key and pitch of a guitar sound without having to adjust the strings with the tuning keys. It was invented by the Flamenco guitarist Jose Patino Gonzalez.

[[image:Guitar capo (shubb)-KayEss-1.jpeg|thumb|left|A Shubb capo which uses a lever operated ''over-centre locking action'' clamp]]

[[Guitar/Flamenco|Flamenco]] and [[Guitar/Folk Guitar|folk guitar]] make extensive use of the capo, while it is used very rarely, if at all, in styles like [[Guitar/Classical Guitar|classical guitar]] and [[Guitar/Jazz|jazz]]. Capos are useful and good to have, but sometimes they prevent a player from properly learning how to play barre chords. Capos and barre chords both have their uses, and there certainly is no reason you cannot learn to use both.

There are several different styles of capo available, but the basic method is the same; a rubber covered bar pressed down on the strings, and it is fastened  on the neck with a strip of elastic or some sort of clamping mechanism. Some special capos can fret individual strings at individual frets, enabling a player to create an open tuning, or have two fretting bars, allowing you to quickly change from one tuning to another without having to move the capo itself.

A simple version can be made with a pencil and a rubber band. Lay the pencil (preferably one with flat surfaces) across the strings at the desired fret, and holding it in place by wrapping the rubber band around both ends and underneath the fretboard.

[[Image:Makeshiftcapo.jpg |thumb|right|A makeshift guitar capo]]

Because of the different techniques and chord voicings available in different keys, chords played with a capo may sound different. For example, placing the capo at the second fret and strumming a C major chord-shape sounds different than strumming an open D major chord. Although both of these produce the same chords, they each have a different tone and texture. Capos also change the timbre of the strings as the scale length is shortened, making the guitar sound more like a mandolin. Capos give you a greater varieties of sounds you can achieve on the guitar, using [[Guitar/Open Chords|open chords]] and [[Guitar/Alternate Tunings|alternate tunings]].

A capo is almost essential for older twelve string guitars because manufacturers would strongly recommend that the instrument ''not be tuned above a tone below standard guitar tuning'' to reduce stress on the neck. Modern 12-strings can be tuned up to pitch with ultra light gauge strings, but many players still prefer to tune a tone lower and use a capo to play in tune with six-string or bass guitars.

==Metronome==
[[Image:Metronome (pendulum swinging).jpg |thumb|right|A wooden metronome]]

A '''metronome''' is a device that produces a regulated audible beat, and/or a visual pulse, used to establish a steady tempo. Tempos are measured in beats-per-minute (BPM), and a metronome is invaluable for setting a proper pace, especially when practicing. Although it is possible to buy metronomes with moving parts, most modern ones are electronic.

Sophisticated metronomes can produce two or more distinct sounds. A regular &quot;tick&quot; sound indicates the beat within each measure, and another, distinct sound (often of a different timbre, higher pitch or greater volume) indicates the beginning of each measure. A tempo control adjusts the amount of time separating each beat (typically measured in beats per minute), while another, discrete, control adjusts the meter of the rhythm and thus the number of beats in each measure. This number is an integer often ranging from one to six, though some metronomes go up to nine or higher. Some devices also have options for irregular time signatures such as 5/4 or 7/8, in which other distinct sounds indicate the beginning of each subgroup of beats within a measure.

==Music Stand==
When reading music, it's best to use a music stand, as it can be set up at a proper angle. Furthermore, with a sturdy collapsible stand, one can have a reliable platform anywhere.

== Pulse Width Modulation ==

Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is the use of the length of an electric signal to represent a value, instead of a large bit pattern. To display the number 12, as an example, we could send a +5V pulse for 12 milliseconds (ms), instead of sending out the binary number 1100. The most common use for PWM is in digital servo motors, especially for robotics. However, other external devices operate using PWM communications as well. To send a PWM signal, instead of a regular binary signal, we use the PULSIN and PULSOUT commands.

=== Clock Speed ===

The units of time for PULSIN and PULSOUT are 2 microseconds (&amp;mu;s). A microsecond is 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. For instance, if we sent a PULSOUT with a value of 25, we would have the length of the pulse be:

:&lt;math&gt;25 \times 2\mu s = 25 \times (2 \times 10^{-6}) = 50 \times 10^{-6} = 50\mu s = 0.05 ms&lt;/math&gt;

The reason why we make the conversion above from microseconds to milliseconds is that many devices display their requirements in terms of milliseconds. It is always important for the programmer to be able to convert between different units. 

== PULSOUT ==

To send a PWM signal, you need to specify the port and the amount of time. For example, to send a pulse on port 10 with a length of 4 microseconds, we would write:

 PULSOUT 10, 4

=== Length Between Pulses ===

The PAUSE function, as we have seen before, can be used to delay operation of the next command. When using PAUSE to insert a delay between PWM pulses, keep in mind that it uses milliseconds, not Microseconds (&amp;mu;s). Remember that &lt;code&gt;PAUSE 1&lt;/code&gt; takes the same amount of time as &lt;code&gt;PULSOUT 12, 500&lt;/code&gt;.

== PULSIN ==

In a similar manner to sending a PWM signal, we can also read a PWM signal from an external device. We must specify which port we are reading from, and we must also provide a variable to receive the length of the pulse. For instance, if we wanted to read a PWM pulse on port 5, we could write:

 MyByte VAR Byte
 PULSIN 5, MyByte

Like with PULSOUT, the units of time are 2 &amp;mu;s.

One common device that uses PWM input like this is the Parallax ultrasonic sensor. These sensors return a pulse for a length of time equal to the amount of time it takes sound waves to travel to an object and bounce back. Using some simple arithmetic, if we know the speed of sound and if we know the amount of time, we can calculate the distance of the object.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Counting Words ==

A [[w:Tag cloud|tag cloud]] (or weighted list in visual design) is a visual depiction of user-generated tags, or simply the word content of a site, typically used to describe the content of web sites.

One method of creating a tag cloud is to create a list of the words in a document, count the number of occurrences of each word, and depict the more frequently occurring words with a larger font size than the words that occur less frequently.

== Counting the total number of words in a text object ==

To get a feeling for one of the basic techniques, let's examine Jon Robie's code, which takes all of the text nodes in a document, strings them together, splits them into a sequence of &quot;words&quot; (tokenizing by whitespace, punctuation, or the 'nbsp' entity), and counts the number of resulting words:

&lt;pre&gt;
let $txt := string-join( $doc//text() , &quot; &quot;)
return
  count(tokenize($txt,'(\s|[,.!:;]|[n][b][s][p][;])+'))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the string-join() function here takes an input sequence and returns a single string that is separated by single spaces (the second argument of string-join).

If you want to see what this routine treats as a &quot;word&quot; in your document, use the following variation.

&lt;pre&gt;
let $txt := string-join( $doc//text() , &quot; &quot;)
let $words := tokenize($txt,'(\s|[,.!:;]|[n][b][s][p][;])+')
return   
  &lt;words count=&quot;{count($words)}&quot;&gt;
     { for $word in $words return &lt;word&gt;{$word}&lt;/word&gt; }
  &lt;/words&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another variation is the word-count() function found at xqueryfunctions.com:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:word-count( $arg as xs:string? )  as xs:integer {       
   count(tokenize($arg, '\W+')[. != ''])
 } ;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This version uses the &lt;code&gt;\W+&lt;/code&gt; regular expression (which matches non-alphabetical characters) to return word tokens.

== Counting Keywords ==

Kurt Cagle suggested the following XQuery for counting keywords:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace xqwb=&quot;http://xquery.wikibooks.org&quot;;

declare function xqwb:word-count($wordlist as element() ) as element() {
&lt;terms&gt;
   {for $term in distinct-values($wordlist/term)
    let $term-count := count($wordlist/term[.  = $term])
    return 
     &lt;term count=&quot;{$term-count}&quot;&gt;{$term}&lt;/term&gt;
   }
&lt;/terms&gt;
};

let $keywords := 
&lt;keywords&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;green&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;violet&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;orange&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;green&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;yellow&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;indigo&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;/keywords&gt;

let $result := xqwb:word-count($keywords)
return $result

&lt;/pre&gt;

[[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmldb/rest//db/Wiki/wordCount.xq Execute]]

=== This Returns the Following ===

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;terms&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;5&quot;&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;2&quot;&gt;green&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;3&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;1&quot;&gt;violet&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;1&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;1&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;term count=&quot;1&quot;&gt;indigo&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;/terms&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Creating a Tag Cloud ==

From this you can create a [[w:Tag Cloud|Tag Cloud]] or word density map such as the &quot;Popular Tags&quot; link on the flickr web site [http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags Flicker Popular Tags]

&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace xqwb=&quot;http://xquery.wikibooks.org&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

declare function xqwb:word-count($wordlist as element() ) as element() {
&lt;terms&gt;
   {for $term in distinct-values($wordlist/term)
    let $term-count := count($wordlist/term[.  = $term])
    return 
       &lt;term count=&quot;{$term-count}&quot;&gt;{$term}&lt;/term&gt;
   }
 &lt;/terms&gt;
};


let $keywords := 
&lt;keywords&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;green&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;violet&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;blue&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;orange&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;green&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;yellow&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;indigo&lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;red&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;/keywords&gt;

let $result := xqwb:word-count($keywords)
let $total := count($keywords/term)
let $scale := 20

return 
 &lt;div&gt;
  {
  for $term in $result/term
  let $fontSize := round( $term/@count div $total * 100 * $scale)
  order by $term
  return &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:{$fontSize}%&quot;&gt;{string($term)}&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;
  }
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Analog Circuits ==

Many times, the devices that we connect to our BasicStamp will be regular analog devices, not digital devices. The difference is that instead of sending out ones or zeros, we need to send out a voltage value. As an example, if we wanted to send the value 4, we could either send a digital signal (100), or we could send an analog signal (+4V).

== Resistors and Capacitors ==

A resistor is a device that slows down the flow of electric current. We have already seen Ohm's law before, but we will repeat it here:

:&lt;math&gt;v = ir&lt;/math&gt;

''r'' is the relationship between the voltage ''v'' and and the current ''i''. The value of a resistor is measured in units of Ohms (&amp;Omega;).

A capacitor is a special type of device that stores energy. When you put a voltage across a capacitor, it fills with energy. When you take the voltage away, the capacitor releases that energy. For an example, a flash bulb in a camera uses a capacitor to store lots of energy until you press the picture button. When you press the button, the capacitor releases the energy very quickly, and the camera makes a bright flash. Without the capacitor the batteries would never be able to produce enough energy so quickly. 

The ability of a capacitor to store energy is measured in units called Farads. Most capacitors that will be used in small applications have very small values, such as 1 millifarad or less.

=== RC Circuits ===

An electric circuit that contains both resistors and capacitors is known as an RC circuit. A capacitor does not charge or discharge it's energy instantly. There is a special value, known as the '''time constant''' that determines the amount of time the capacitor takes to charge. The time constant is dependant on the value of the capacitor and the value of the resistor. 

=== Time Constants ===

The time constant of a circuit is calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = rC&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;tau; is the time constant, in seconds. ''r'' is the resistance, in Ohms, and ''C'' is the capacitance, in Farads. It takes approximately 5 time constants for an RC circuit to completely charge or discharge energy. 

=== Measuring a Time Constant ===

The BasicStamp can measure the time constant directly, without first needing to measure the resistance and the capacitance of the circuit. To do this, the BasicStamp outputs 5 volts into the circuit, long enough for the circuit to charge. Then, the BasicStamp turns the output port into an input port, allowing the circuit to discharge energy. When the amount of energy reaches zero, it has been 5 time constants. The BasicStamp divides the amount of time by 5 and returns the time constant value. Keep in mind that this is an approximate process, and it will fail for very large time constants (because the circuit will not have enough time to charge completely).

== RCTIME ==

The RCTIME function measures the time constant of a circuit attached to one of the ports. The other end of the circuit should be attached to ground. It will return a value for the time constant in milliseconds. To read the time constant on port 11, we would write:

 MyByte VAR Byte
 RCTIME 11, MyByte

== Special Resistors ==

There are several types of resistors that we can use in our circuits to do different tasks.

=== Potentiometers ===

A potentiometer, or more simply a &quot;pot&quot; is a resistor with variable resistance. Potentiometers typically have some sort of knob or dial that can be turned to alter the resistance. A good example of a potentiometer is a volume knob in a stereo. When the knob is turned up, the resistance decreases, more current flows, and the sound becomes louder. When the knob is turned down, the resistance increases, less current flows, and the sound becomes softer. Another example is a dimmer switch for a light bulb. The more dim the light, the higher the resistance in the switch must be.

If we have a circuit with a potentiometer, we know what C is, and we can measure the time constant, so we can calculate what the resistance must be. If we know what the maximum and minimum resistance is for the potentiometer, we can calculate how much the knob is turned, and in some cases we can even calculate the exact angle that the knob is pointing at. 

Potentiometers can appear as knobs, but they can also be attached to wheels to measure the amount that a wheel has rotated. They can also be available as slide switches.

=== Thermistors ===

Thermistors are resistors whose resistance changes with temperature. These are commonly used in electric thermometers. By measuring the RC time of a thermistor circuit, we can calculate the temperature.

=== Photoresistors ===

A photoresistor is a resistor whose resistance changes depending on how much light there is. By measureing the time constant of the photoresistor, we can determine how much light is shined on it. An example of this is an automatic  night-light, which turns on when it detects the light is off.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to run a small program that tests to see if your XQuery execution environment is working.

== XML Output ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
let $message := 'Hello World!'
return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;{$message}&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/helloWorld.xq Execute]

=== Expected Output ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;Hello World!&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Discussion ===
The program creates a temporary variable called &lt;code&gt;$message&lt;/code&gt; and assigns it a string value.  The output is an XML element containing a message element which contains the value of the variable.

=== Suggestions ===
Try omitting the curly braces from inside of the result message element.  What do you get? [[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/helloWorld_1.xq Execute]]

What happens if you omit the results wrappers? [[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/helloWorld_2.xq Execute]]

== Plain Text ==

You can get XQuery to return plain text using serialization options which define the serialization and the output [[w:Internet_media_type | media-type]].

For example to output the message as text, specify the serialization as text and the media-type as text/plain.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text media-type=text/plain&quot;;
let $message := 'Hello World!'
return
$message
&lt;/source&gt;

[[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Basics/helloWorld_3.xq Execute]]

=== Expected Output ===

Depending on your browser set-up, this will launch a viewer for text documents and display

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello World!
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Category:XQuery]]

=== Execution Methods ===
If you are using the oXygen IDE this can be done by selecting the &quot;transform&quot; icon on the toolbar.

If you are running this program in the eXist databases you can upload a file called hello.xq using the &quot;Browse&quot; function in the web administrator and then run the following in the browser:

http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/hello.xq

There are three important items to note in this URL.
# This is the URL that you would use if you used the default eXist configuration
# Note that the world &quot;rest&quot; is in the URL before the &quot;/db&quot; indicating that you are using the REST interface (as opposed to the WebDAV, Atom or SOAP interface)
# Note that the port is &quot;8080&quot; (the default port for development web sites) and that the &quot;context&quot; of the server is &quot;exist&quot;.  Both of these can be easily changed by editing the $EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/conf.xml file and restarting your eXist server.  The short-form on production sites might be:

http://localhost/rest/db/hello.xq

With tools like URL rewriting you can also remove the &quot;/rest&quot; and the &quot;/db&quot; components of the URL.</text>

}}Roger Pilgham is the pseudonym of a Dutchman who, while living in the USA in the 1990's, discovered so many possible ways of misspelling his name that he is now convinced of the utter pointlessness of using it in international cyberspace. For the WikiWorld, he aptly (if exaggeratedly) chose the name of a fictional character known for boldly and cheerfully altering other people's brainchilds beyond their recognition. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel_Concourse Read more about Roger Pilgham].

In real life, the user calling himself Roger Pilgham is a professional food writer and journalist, science fiction fan, amateur musician, travel nut, news addict and cat lover. He is fluent in English, French, German and his native Dutch, speaks reasonable Italian and Spanish and can crudely communicate in Russian, Turkish, Catalan, Norwegian and Mandarin Chinese--all of which did not keep him from flunking a bachelorship in comparative linguistics. He professes himself bewilderment incarnate when it comes to adding the graphic niceties to his profile that he has spotted with other WikiWorlders, but hopes to eventually expand on the pitiful tidbit that is his current excuse for a profile.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a short dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro and is a very good introduction to typical aspects of Plato's thought and the Socratic method. The Greek language of Euthyphro is less difficult than that in longer works such the Symposium or the Republic. This dialogue is placed first in the Oxford Classical Texts 'Platonis Opera'. In general this is a good place to start with Plato if you have at least a year's worth of classical Greek. 

Overall the piece is an interesting introduction to Greek theology and has an exact parallel in modern Christian theology, still being commented on in the twentieth century by writers such as C.S. Lewis as a live question. In essence the question put is, 'Does God command that we do or not do things because they are good or bad in themselves, or because God is good? And if the right commands are 'good' in themselves, does God obey these laws or does he make them?' Socrates has himself been summonsed to court by his political enemies and while waiting meets Euthyphro there, who is bringing a charge of manslaughter (of a slave) against his father. Socrates finds this remarkable, but Euthyphro maintains that 'a crime is a crime', and as family relations do not come into it, he is merely doing the right and proper thing. Socrates enquires how he is so sure of himself, and Euthyphro replies that he is an expert on morality as he understand piety toward the gods so well.

Socrates proceeds to tie poor Euthyphro up in knots with his gentle questions, which however amount to the typical Socratic skewering and dissection of self-proclaimed experts. He asks, 'are the gods themselves good and righteous and holy?' The religious and pious Euthyphro thinks so. He asks, 'are the gods to be emulated because they are good?'. The religious and pious Euthyphro thinks so. But, Socrates asks, 'why then, accoding to the poets, do the gods do so many things that we humans disapprove of - such as, stealing, making war, and adultery?' Euthyphro is at a loss to talk his way out of this fuzzy thinking and self-contradictions: he is left defeated but still defiant. The answers may not have been presented 'on a plate', but the clarity of the right question is now indisputable. This first dialogue strongly presages the 'Apology' of Socrates in which he defends himself against the charges brought in his famous court defence speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Useful|WB:DONATE}}

== Donating Books ==

Many times in the past, people and organizations have offered to donate books to Wikibooks. Wikibooks will accept donations of books under certain conditions, and the copyright holder of the book must agree to follow Wikibooks copyright restrictions and policies. This page will discuss book donations, how a book is eligible to be donated, and what is the process to donate an eligible book.

Authors are responsible for ensuring that their books to be donated are acceptable under the [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks inclusion criteria policy]]. Wikibooks is not a general purpose ebook host and books that do not conform to this policy, regardless of anything else written in this document, may be deleted from Wikibooks.

If you have a book that you wrote yourself, or that you own the copyright on, and understand what it means to release your work under a free license, you can skip to the [[#Donation Checklist|donation checklist]] below.

== Before you Donate: Copyright ==

All books on Wikibooks '''must''' be released under the GFDL. Books may optionally be cross-licensed under both the GFDL and a related license, such as CC-BY-SA. While possible, this arrangement is not common, and can be problematic. There are a few important points about copyrights that need to be mentioned first:

*'''Commercial Use''': All Wikibooks books must be available for commercial use. Some licenses, such as CC-NC-SA prohibit this. Such licenses are not compatible with Wikibooks. If your book is currently released under a non-commercial license, you must relicense it before it can be donated to Wikibooks.
*'''Derivatives''': Wikibooks requires that all books and book materials be released under a license that allows derivative works. This means that people, anybody at any time, can modify your book. People can edit, modify, expand, or contract your book, and that must be allowable under the license. Books which are currently released under a no-derivatives license must be relicensed to be released on Wikibooks.

=== GNU Free Documentation License ===

The complete version of the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) is available here: '''[[GFDL]]'''. All authors are encouraged to read this license before attempting to donate any materials to Wikibooks. Here are some key points:

*By uploading materials to Wikibooks, you are granting Wikibooks an '''irrevocable license''' to host your work, in addition to any derivatives of your work, so long as the work is copyrighted. Material on Wikibooks, once donated, may not be removed upon request of the author. As the copyright holder, you may choose to grant additional licenses to other users or other websites also.
*The GFDL is ''viral''. That is, once the work has been released to Wikibooks, all future versions and derivatives of that work on Wikibooks will also be released under the GFDL. Notice that as the original author, you may release your work under an alternate licensing scheme in other places as well. As the copyright holder, you may grant a non-viral license for your work to another user or website.

=== Images and Files ===

Books and text must be released under the GFDL, or cross licensed with the GFDL and a suitable secondary license. However, images, media files, PDF files, or other files that accompany your book may be released under a variety of free licenses, and do not need to be GFDL. It is not uncommon for image files to be released under a Creative Commons (CC) license, or even released into the Public Domain (PD). For maximum compatability, it is recommended that images be either GFDL or cross-licensed as GFDL and CC-BY-SA-2.5. For more information about media file uploads and licensing, see [[Wikibooks:Media]].

== Wikitext ==

Before a book can be uploaded to Wikibooks, it must be converted to Wikitext. Wikitext is a simplified markup language, similar to HTML. We use Wikitext because it is quick and easy to read, easy for people to edit and modify, and it is typically much smaller then equivalent HTML. If your book is available electronically in HTML or LaTeX source, there are converters available that can semi-automatically convert your book to Wikitext. 

Wikibooks does accept PDF and LaTeX versions of a book to be uploaded, but those versions must be released in addition to a Wikitext version. That is, we do not host lone PDF files, we host &quot;PDF versions&quot; of the existing Wikitext books. The same rule applies to LaTeX or any other document file format.

== Wikibooks or Wikisource? ==

Wikisource is another project, similar to Wikibooks, that contains original source books and documents. Typically, to be hosted at Wikisource, the book must have been previously published, and they must be GFDL or PD. Once a book on Wikisource has been uploaded and proofread, it is protected against future edits. This means that books on Wikisource cannot be changed.

If you meet all the following criteria, your book may be eligible to be uploaded at Wikisource:
*The book has been previously published, not self-published.
*The book is released into the public domain, or in some circumstances, has been released under the GFDL or another acceptable free license
*The value of the book as a historical reference would be diminished if the book were edited or modified, besides the addition of footnotes, or annotations.

Keep in mind that Wikisource is not a publishing house, and it's purpose is to preserve old text in a machine-readable form, not to host, promote, or preserve new or unpublished books.

== Wikibooks Policy ==

The goal of Wikibooks is to create new instructional materials, not just to accumulate existing materials. Wikibooks will not provide your donated book with special policies or special circumstances. This includes, but is not limited to, preventing certain people from editing your book, requiring people to ask your permission to edit your book, protecting your book from all editing to preserve it, watching your book more closely for spam or vandalism, advertising your book in a special or overbearing way, or giving the contributors to your book any special treatment. If your book is of high quality, it can be nominated to be [[WB:FBN|Featured]]. 

Your donated book must meet all of our content restrictions, or it will not be hosted here. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, [[WB:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (NPOV) and [[WB:NOR|No Original Research]] (NOR). Information taught in a book must also be verifiable, either academically (though the use of a citation) or experimentally (by the reader). If your book does not meet all our requirements, it might be suitable for hosting at [[v:|Wikiversity]], [[s:|Wikisource]], or [[centralwikia:About Wikia|Wikia]].

== Donation Checklist ==

Before you donate a book to Wikibooks, make sure that you can satisfy every point on this checklist. If you need help, or if you have questions about this, you can ask at [[WB:SLC|the '''Reading Room''']].

#Ensure that the book meets Wikibooks [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria policy]]. 
#Ensure that the book satisfies all content requirements, including [[WB:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] and [[WB:NOR|No original research]].
#Ensure that the book is either uncopyrighted, currently released under the GFDL, that you are the primary copyright holder, or that you have permission from the current copyright holders.
#Ensure that you have received permission from all other potential copyright holders, including authors, editors, publishers, and illustrators. Some images or passages of text (such as quotes) can be uploaded as '''fair use''', if express permission cannot be obtained.
#License the book under the GFDL, or cross-license it under the GFDL and an acceptable secondary license (such as CC-BY-SA).
#License all the images, media files, or other accompanying files under a suitable license.
#Convert the text of the book to Wikitext.

Once all the above steps are satisfied, you may begin to upload your book to Wikibooks. Make sure that your new book follows our [[WB:NC|Naming Conventions]]. If you need help, ask at [[WB:SLC|the '''Reading Room''']]. Once you have uploaded your book, or if you need additional help, post a notice in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|assistance reading room]].</text>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't ''mansum'' the fourth principal part of ''maneo''? Wouldn't ''sum'' (''esse fui futurus'') be a better example of a verb that usually uses a future participle as its fourth p.p.? --[[User:Hieronymous85|Hieronymous85]] 16:16, 17 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Example Program Using URL Parameters (HTTP GET) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
We would like to create a simple XQuery that takes two arguments and returns the the sum of the two numbers.

== Example Program Using URL Parameters (HTTP GET) ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;

(: get the parameters from the URL :)
let $arg1 := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;))
let $arg2 := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;arg2&quot;, &quot;5&quot;))

return
&lt;results&gt;
    &lt;sum&gt;{$arg1+$arg2}&lt;/sum&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Call this like ($hostname)/adder.xq?arg1=123&amp;arg2=456.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/adder.xq?arg1=123&amp;arg2=456 Execute]

== Results ==
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;sum&gt;579&lt;/sum&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Accumulating Adder ==

To make this into an interactive application, we can extend the script to create an XHTML document containing a Form.

The script computes the new sum from the URL parameters (if any) and returns a minimal XHTML document containing a Form which both reports the sum and prompts for new inputs. Note the embedded XQuery expressions (in curly braces) which interpolates the computed values into the created XML element.  The state of the computation, the value of the accumulator, is retained in a hidden input in the form.

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $sum := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;sum&quot;,0))
let $number := xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;number&quot;,&quot;0&quot;))
let $newSum := $sum + $number
return
&lt;html&gt;

== Clearing the accumulator ==
To support the operation of clearing the accumulator, we can add a couple of submit buttons to the form. The presence of the 'Clear' action is used to set the inputs to zero.

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $action := request:get-parameter(&quot;action&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
let $sum :=
    if ($action= &quot;clear&quot;)
    then 0 
    else xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;sum&quot;,0))
let $number :=
    if ($action = &quot;clear&quot;)
    then 0

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $sum  := if (exists(session:get-attribute(&quot;sum&quot;)))
             then session:get-attribute(&quot;sum&quot;)
             else 0
let $action := request:get-parameter(&quot;action&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
let $sum :=
    if ( $action= &quot;clear&quot;)
    then 0 
    else $sum
let $number :=
    if ($action = &quot;clear&quot;)
    then 0
    else xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;number&quot;,&quot;0&quot;))
let $newSum := $sum + $number
let $s := session:set-attribute(&quot;sum&quot;,$newSum)
return
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Accumulating Adder&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Accumulating Adder&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
       {$newSum} + &lt;input   type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;number&quot;   value=&quot;{$number}&quot; /&gt;   
      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;action&quot;  value=&quot;add&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;action&quot;  value=&quot;clear&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Vocabulary ==
;Exponent: a number written in superscript that denotes how many times the base will be multiplied by itself.
;Base: the number to be multiplied by itself.

Example: &lt;math&gt;5^2=25&lt;/math&gt;

In this example, the base is 5 and the exponent is 2.

== Lesson ==
We use '''exponents''' to show when we're multiplying the same number more than one time. 

;&lt;math&gt; 3 \cdot 3 = 3^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:Three times three equals three to the second power (or three squared)

;&lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 3^{3}&lt;/math&gt; 
:Three times three times three equals three to the third power (or three cubed)

;&lt;math&gt;3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3= 3^{4}&lt;/math&gt; 
:Three times three times three times three equal three to the fourth power 
  
;&lt;math&gt;2\cdot2\cdot2 = 2^{3}&lt;/math&gt;  
:Two times two times two equals two to the third power

Note that '''any''' nonzero number raised to the 0 power is '''always''' equal to 1.

;&lt;math&gt;2^{0} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:Two to the zero power equals one

We can also raise any number to a '''negative''' exponent.  This is called the '''inverse''' exponent and places the number on the bottom of a fraction with a 1 on top:

;&lt;math&gt;2^{-2} = \frac{1}{2^{2}} = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:Two to the negative two equals one over two to the second power

== Example Problems ==
Let's evaluate these expressions.

;Example 1
&lt;math&gt;7^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:Seven to the second power, or seven squared, means seven times seven.

&lt;math&gt;7\cdot7&lt;/math&gt; 
:Seven times seven is forty-nine.

49 
:Seven to the second power equals forty-nine.

; Example 2
Area of a square = (length of the side) ^2
:The area, or space inside, of a square is equal to the length of the side of the square to the second power.

Area of a square with side length 3 meters
:If the square had a side length of 3 meters,
(3 meters)^2
:Then the area would be (3 meters) squared.
&lt;math&gt;3\cdot3&lt;/math&gt; meters^2
:3 squared is the same as 3 times 3.
9 square meters
:So, the area of a square with a side length of 3 meters is 9 square meters.

; Example 3
&lt;math&gt;c^{2}&lt;/math&gt; where c=6
:First, we replace the variable &quot;c&quot; in the expression with 6, which is what it equals.
&lt;math&gt;6^{2}&lt;/math&gt; 
:6 squared equals 6 times 6.
&lt;math&gt;6\cdot6&lt;/math&gt; 
:6 times 6 equals 36.
36
:So, c squared is 36.

; Example 4
&lt;math&gt;x^{3}&lt;/math&gt; where x = 10. 
:First, we replace the variable &quot;x&quot; in the expression with 10, which is what it equals.
&lt;math&gt;10^{3}&lt;/math&gt; 
:10 to the third power, or 10 cubed, is equal to 10 times 10 times 10.
&lt;math&gt;10\cdot10\cdot10&lt;/math&gt;
:10 times 10 equals 100.
&lt;math&gt;100\cdot10&lt;/math&gt;
:100 times 10 equals 1000.
1000
:So, x to the third power is 1000.

;Example 5
&lt;math&gt;y^{4}&lt;/math&gt; where y = 2
:First, we replace the variable &quot;y&quot; in the expression with 2, which is what it equals.
&lt;math&gt;2^{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:2 to the fourth power is equal to 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.
&lt;math&gt;2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2 &lt;/math&gt; 
:2 times 2 equals 4.
&lt;math&gt;4\cdot2\cdot2&lt;/math&gt;
:4 times 2 equals 8.
&lt;math&gt;8\cdot2&lt;/math&gt;
:And 8 times 2 equals 16.
16
:So, y to the fourth is 16.

; Example 6
&lt;math&gt;3^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;
:Three to the negative third power, which can be expressed as 1 over three cubed.
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
:Three cubed equals 3 times 3 times 3 which equals 27.
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{27}&lt;/math&gt;
:So, three to the negative third power equals one twenty-seventh.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I forsee a potential problem in explaining Order of Operations: None of the preceeding lessons define an &quot;Operation&quot;. Should we explain binary (+,- for subtraction,*,/,^) and unary (- for negatives,square root) functions? I don't think that is a good idea if we haven't really introduced functions yet. I am not an educator; perhaps someone with experience could explain how they introduce order of operations to their students?

:&quot;Operations&quot; are now (maybe already were) explained in lesson 1, not rigorously, but I think well enough for the purposes here. We can probably talk about unitary operations (and their precedence) once we get to them. [[User:Zahlen|Zahlen]] 04:40, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

We should use the gerund form for the names of operations ('''adding''' instead of addition, '''multiplying''' instead of multiplication).  It is easier for a non-native speaker to understand.

;Operation
;Equals Sign
;Adding
;Subtracting
;Multiplying
;Dividing

== Lesson ==

An ''''operation'''&quot; is a thing you do to numbers.  You use signs like: ''+''', '''–''', '''×''', or '''÷'''  for operations.

The '''Equals Sign''' is not an operation.  You use the &quot;''' = '''&quot; sign for the Equals Sign.  It is a special sign that you put between two things that are the same.

===Adding===
Adding is a way to put two numbers together.  You use the &quot;''' + '''&quot; sign for the adding operation.  If you have 5 apples and a friend has 6 apples, you and your friend have 11 apples.  This is '''5 + 6 = 11''' using the signs of Math, and is read '''&quot;five plus six equals eleven&quot;'''.  

Order is not important when adding.  '''2 + 3'''  is the same as '''3 + 2'''.

===Subtracting===
Subtracting is a way of taking a number out from another number.  It is the opposite of adding.  You use the &quot;''' – '''&quot; sign for the subtracting operation.  If you have 5 apples and give 3 to a friend, you then have 2 apples.   This is '''5 – 3 = 2''' using the signs of Math. Read this '''&quot;five minus three equals two&quot;'''.

Order is important when subtracting.  '''3 – 2''' is not the same as '''2 – 3'''.

===Multiplying===
Multiplying is a way of adding a number many times.  You use the &quot;''' × '''&quot;, &quot;''' • '''&quot; or &quot;''' * '''&quot; sign for the multiplying operation. If you have 4 apple trees and every tree has 25 apples, you have 100 apples.  This is '''4 × 25 = 100''' or '''25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100''' in the signs of Math.  The first way is shorter and easier to use.  

Multiplying 25 by 4 is the same as adding 25, 4 times or adding 4, 25 times.

'''4 x 25 = 100''' should be read '''&quot;four times twenty-five equals one hundred&quot;'''. 

Order is not important when multiplying.  '''2 × 3''' is the same as '''3 × 2'''.

===Dividing===

Dividing is a way of subtracting a number many times.  It is the opposite of multiplying.  You use the &quot;''' ÷ '''&quot; or &quot;''' / '''&quot; sign for the dividing operation.  If 3 friends take an equal part of a bag of 12 apples, every friend gets 4 apples.  Or, you may take away (subtract) 3 apples from the bag of 12 apples, exactly 4 times until the bag is empty.  This is '''12 ÷ 3 = 4''' or '''12 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 = 0''' in the signs of Math.

'''12 ÷ 3 = 4''' should be read '''&quot;twelve divided by three equals 4&quot;'''.

Order is important when dividing.  '''3 ÷ 2''' is not the same as '''2 ÷ 3'''.

*Addition Property of Equality
*Subtraction Property of Equality

== Lesson ==

It is very important to show math in the simplest way. For example, &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{10}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is better because it is easier to understand. The simplest answer is usually the best.

'''Associative Properties''' mean that you can do the problem in any order, and the answer will always be the same.

'''Commutative Properties''' mean that you can change the order of numbers around, and the answers will always be the same.

'''Equality Properties''' state that if two numbers on either side of the equation are equal, and the operation processed is the same, as well having the same variables in the operations, the result will be the same for both sides of the equation.  Read the section devoted to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Equality for more information.

====Associative Property of Addition====

The associative property of addition shows us that when adding multiple values together, the outcome will always be the same.  You can group numbers together in parenthesis, and it will still end up having the same outcome.  For example, &lt;math&gt;3 + (4 + 5) = (3 + 4) + 5&lt;/math&gt;.  The order remains the same, but the grouping has changed.  The result, however, is consistent.

====Associative Property of Multiplication====

The associative properties work for both addition and multiplication.  Think of grouping &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; together.  You end up with 9.  What about &lt;math&gt;3 \times (3 \times 4)&lt;/math&gt;?  If we change the grouping here, the result will be the same.  Try to visualize why this is.  When multiplying, you're often building objects in rows and columns.

For example, a 2 inch &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 4 inch block will be 2 inches across, and 4 downward.  If you had a block 4 inches across and 2 inches downward, it would be the same size overall.  When you put objects in parenthesis, remember to do those operations first.  You may end up with certain &quot;sides&quot; of the operation or object being larger or smaller, but the total area will always have the same outcome.

====Commutative Property of Addition====

The commutative property of addition shows that no matter what order numbers are in when we add them, the result will always be the same.  For example, &lt;math&gt;x + y = y + x&lt;/math&gt;, just how &lt;math&gt;3 + 4 = 4 + 3&lt;/math&gt;.  Even though the order in which we added has shifted, the result doesn't change, and the statements on both sides of the equal sign remain true.

====Addition Property of Equality====

The addition property of equality states that if two variables or numbers are equal to each other on each side of the equation, and the operation they go through is alike, the resulting sum will be the same. If for example, both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and y are 6, and you add &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; to each of them, that is, 

if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x + z = y + z&lt;/math&gt;

or if &lt;math&gt;6 = 6&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;6 + z = 6 + z&lt;/math&gt;

====Subtraction Property of Equality====

The subtraction property of equality states that if two variables or numbers are equal to each other on each side of the equation, and the operation they go through is alike, the resulting difference will be the same.  If for example, both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and y are 6, and you subtract &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; from each of them, that is,

if &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x - z = y - z&lt;/math&gt;

or if &lt;math&gt;6 = 6&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;6 - z = 6 - z&lt;/math&gt;

== Example Problems ==
For examples 1, 2, and 3 find &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y=6&lt;/math&gt;. 

;Example 1:
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{x+y}{2}=14&lt;/math&gt;
*:Substituting 6 for y using the given y
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{x+6}{2}=14&lt;/math&gt;
*:By multiplying the denominator on either side simplifies it
* &lt;math&gt;2(\frac{x+6}{2})=2(14)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x+6=28&lt;/math&gt;
*:Subtracting 6 on both side does not affect the property of the given formula but again simplifies it
* &lt;math&gt;x+6-6=28-6&lt;/math&gt;
*:To arrive at the answer
'''Answer:''' &lt;math&gt;x=22&lt;/math&gt;

;Example 2:

* &lt;math&gt;(x-3y)+2x=15&lt;/math&gt;
*: Again taking the hints as given, y=6
* &lt;math&gt;(x-3 \times 6)+2x=15&lt;/math&gt;
*:Dealing with the parentheses
* &lt;math&gt;(x-18)+2x=15&lt;/math&gt;
*:Taking down the parentheses is the most natural next move using PEMDAS.
* &lt;math&gt;x-18+2x=15&lt;/math&gt;
*:Adding &lt;math&gt;x+2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;3x-18=15&lt;/math&gt;
*:Adding 18 to either side
* &lt;math&gt;3x-18+18=15+18&lt;/math&gt;
*:Taking down the parentheses
* &lt;math&gt;3x-18+18=33&lt;/math&gt;
*:Cancellation
* &lt;math&gt;3x=33&lt;/math&gt;
*:The property of the equation has not been changed but shifted like a tetris game to a desirable result 
*:One last step: Divide the multiplier to either side to emerge the solution 
*&lt;math&gt;3x/3=33/3&lt;/math&gt;

After dividing: 

'''Answer:''' &lt;math&gt;x=11&lt;/math&gt;

;Example 3:

*&lt;math&gt;\frac{15-y}{x}=y^2&lt;/math&gt;
*:Substitute &lt;math&gt;y=6&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{15-6}{x}=6^2&lt;/math&gt;
*:Parentheses
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{9}{x}=36&lt;/math&gt;
*:Multiply by the denominator (x) on either side 
*&lt;math&gt;9=36x&lt;/math&gt;
*:divide the multiplier on either side
*&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{9}{36}&lt;/math&gt;
*:Simplify or divide fraction

'''Answer:''' &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;0.25&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Algebra''' is a way of working with numbers and signs to answer a '''mathematics problem''' (a question using numbers).  You use Algebra in life.  

It answers, for example, questions like these:  

If I have 10 coins and need 25 coins to get a book, how many more coins do I need to get the book?  

If you have 6 bottles of milk and you drink 2 bottles in a day, how many days will your milk last?

If you start running a race at a speed of 10 kilometers an hour, and your friend starts running 10 minutes later at a speed of 15 kilometers an hour, when will your friend catch up to you?

Algebra helps answer questions when building houses, making food, and doing science work.

This book will help you learn how to do mathematics using Algebra.  It has '''chapters''' (parts of the book) with '''lessons''' (parts of the chapter about one idea).

A lesson has five parts:

#'''Vocabulary''' - gives special words you need for the lesson.
#'''Lesson''' - gives a new idea and how to use this idea.
#'''Example Problems''' - gives the steps to do problems using the new idea.
#'''Practice Games''' - gives places for amusement where you do problems. 
#'''Practice Problems''' - You do problems.

== Lesson ==
A '''variable''' is a letter or symbol that takes place of a number in Algebra.  Common symbols used are &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  The letters '''x''' and '''y''' are commonly used, but remember that any other symbols would work just as well.

Variables are used in algebra as placeholders for unknown numbers. If you see '''&quot;3 + ''x''&quot;''', don't panic! All this means is that we are adding a number who's value we don't yet know.

Some examples of variables in use:
* &lt;math&gt;3x&lt;/math&gt; -- three times of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;5 - y&lt;/math&gt; -- five minus &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2 \div s&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac {2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;-- 2 divided by &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;

A '''term''' is a number or a variable or a cluster of numbers and variables multiplied and or divided separated by addition and subtraction.

'''Examples of terms:'''
* &lt;math&gt;3 + 5&lt;/math&gt;  The terms are 3 and 5.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {6}{x}&lt;/math&gt;   The term is &lt;math&gt;6/x&lt;/math&gt;, 6 over &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one term, because the operation is division.
* &lt;math&gt;6x + 5&lt;/math&gt;   The terms are 6&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and 5, 6&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and 5 are separate terms because they are separated by a addition or subtraction.

An '''operation''' is a thing you do to numbers, like add, subtract, multiply, or divide.  You use signs like '''+''', '''–''', '''*''', or '''/''' for operations.

An '''expression''' is two or more terms, with operations between all terms.

'''Examples of expressions:'''

* &lt;math&gt;3 \div 6&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;8 \times x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x \times 6 + y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a \times b \times c \times d&lt;/math&gt;

To '''evaluate''' an expression, you do the operations to the terms of an expression.

'''Examples of evaluating expressions:'''

* &lt;math&gt;3 + 4&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to '''7'''.
* &lt;math&gt;18 \div 3&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to '''6'''.
* &lt;math&gt;4 \times 5 - 3&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to '''17'''.


To evaluate an expression with variables, you '''substitute''' (put a thing in the place of an other thing) numbers for the variables.

'''Examples of substituting:''' (Substitute 3 for x in these examples.)
* &lt;math&gt;x + 4&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;3 + 4&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;18 \div x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;18 \div 3&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;4 \times 5 - x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;4 \times 5 - 3&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example Problems ==
'''Evaluate &lt;math&gt;5 \times x&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is 2.'''

Substitute 2 for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;5 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Evaluate &lt;math&gt;5 \times 2&lt;/math&gt; to get the answer 10.


'''Evaluate &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{3} + y&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is 9 and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is 4.'''

Substitute 9 for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and substitute 4 for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is to get &lt;math&gt;\frac{9}{3} + 4&lt;/math&gt;.

Evaluate &lt;math&gt;\frac{9}{3} + 4&lt;/math&gt;  to get the answer 7.

== Practice Problems ==
'''Evaluate each expression if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = 1, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; = 2, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = 3, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = 5.''' 
remember order of operations
#&lt;math&gt;5 \times b=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;9 \times c=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;c-2=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d-5=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{2}=&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{36}{c}=&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;b \times c + 2=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;b \times c \times d - 5=&lt;/math&gt;

'''Evaluate each expression if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = 4, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = 2, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = 3.'''
#&lt;math&gt;x+y=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2z=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;xz=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;xy+z=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;yz-x=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{y}+z=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{2x}{2+y}=&lt;/math&gt;

More harder questions:

'''Evaluate each expression if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = 5, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = 8, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = 9.'''
#&lt;math&gt;(2+x) \times y=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y-9}{5}=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac {27}{x+4} - (y-5)=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac {z+12}{2x-3} + y=&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\frac {6x}{2+y} - z)+(x- \frac{z}{3})=&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's not use &quot;plugging in&quot; as a metaphor for substitution.  In a primitive environment, I don't know if it has the same familiarity.  Use &quot;put it in&quot; instead.

Heheh, ok, but in a primitive environment, they won't have a computer... unless you are imagining some school in the middle of the african bush which happens to have internet connection and jotters and pencils but no workbooks, which i suppose makes some kind of sense. &lt;br&gt;
Can I ask, don't you think we need some kind of video perhaps introducing the topic? --[[User:213.217.194.176|213.217.194.176]] 13:49, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

== Greek letters ==

I saw in the page that Greek letters are used as names of variables.
Maybe it's a good idea to give an overview of the Greek alphabet in appendix or something.
Here it is:
α alpha
β beta
γ gamma
δ delta
ε epsilon
ζ dzeta
η eta
θ theta
ι iota
κ kappa
λ lambda
μ mu
ν nu
ξ xi
ο omicron
π pi
ρ rho
ς sigma (end of a word, not used as a mathematical variable)
σ sigma
τ tau
υ upsilon
φ phi
χ chi
ψ psi
ω omega

:I don't think they're commonly introduced at an elementary level. They also aren't used so far in the examples for the first few lessons. I think it would be better to avoid their use altogether for this textbook. [[User:Zahlen|Zahlen]] 03:35, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Answers in parentheses ==

Would it not make sense to show the solution for the first couple of problems only, and then to LINK to the solutions? Ideally the link would automatically open a new window (provided the code for that is compatible with simple browsers and low bandwidth).

:I'm guessing this, or something similar will be implemented in the HSTutorial's static version. I don't think we need to worry too much about formatting for now. [[User:Zahlen|Zahlen]] 03:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Expressions with more than 1 operation and Precedence ==

Should we be introducing long expressions like 6 x 3 - 4 in this lesson before precedence is introduced in lesson 3? As a mathematician, I'd say no, but I don't have experience teaching such topics to young children. Presently, I've edited the examples and problems so that operators with higher precedence are on the left, i.e no ambiguity arises between evaluating left to right and evaluating in order of precendence.

If we do decide to keep long expressions in this lesson, I think it would be a good idea to break up the evaluation process into steps, e.g. first evaluating 6 x 3 - 4 to 18 - 4, then finally to 14. [[User:Zahlen|Zahlen]] 03:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Game ==

The lesson links to a game at http://www.quia.com/cm/29771.html. This game uses expressions like 7(9) to mean 7 * 9, which hasn't been taught (yet). We might still want to keep the link, if we can't find better games. (Will HSTutorials be making any games of their own?) [[User:Zahlen|Zahlen]] 04:16, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Problem with definitions ==

I was just reading through this material to brush up on my own algebra. I don't know the definition of an expression but the definition here seems flawed to me. First a term is defined and we see that 6/x is one term. Expressions are defined next: &quot;An expression is two or more terms, with operations between all terms.&quot;. Yet the list of example expressions starts with &quot;3/4&quot; and &quot;8*n&quot;. By the definition of expressions above they are not expressions because they only consist of one term. My belief is that the examples are correct and the definition of expressions is wrong. But on the other hand teaching mathematics is not my field. --Tobbe</text>

;Positive
;Negative

== Lesson ==

===Negative Numbers===
A '''positive''' number is a number more than zero. 

A '''negative''' number is a number less than zero.  You make a negative number by doing the negative operation on a positive number.  You use the '''&quot; – &quot;''' sign for the negative operation.  This sign is the same you use for subtracting.

===Adding and Subtracting===

Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number.
* &lt;math&gt;7 + (-4) = 7 - 4&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;  x + (-y) = x - y&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.
* &lt;math&gt;7 - (-4) = 7 + 4&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - (-y) = x + y&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplying and Dividing===

Multiplying a negative number by a positive number, or a positive number by a negative number makes the answer negative.
* &lt;math&gt; -2 \times 3 = -6&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; 2 \times -3 = -6&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying a negative number by a negative number makes the answer positive.
* &lt;math&gt; -2 \times -3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;

You do the same for dividing.
* &lt;math&gt;  -6 \div 3 = -2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;  6 \div -3 = -2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; -6 \div -3 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponentiating===

Exponentiating a negative number to an even (a number you can divide by two) power makes a positive answer.
* &lt;math&gt;(-3)^2 = 9&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(-x)^2 = x \times x = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiating a negative number to an odd (a number you can not divide by two) power makes a negative answer.
* &lt;math&gt;(-2)^3 = -8&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(-x)^3 = -x \times -x \times -x = x^2 \times -x = -x^3&lt;/math&gt;

===Order of Operations===

The negative operation has the same precedence as multiplying and dividing.
* &lt;math&gt;3 + 8 \div 4 = 3 + 2 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; -3^2 = -(3 \times 3) = -9&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; (-3)^2 = -3 \times -3 = 9&lt;/math&gt;

== Example Problems ==

# &lt;math&gt;4 + (-4) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;4 + (-7) = -3&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0 + (-2) = -2&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;-5 + 7 - 2 \times (-4) = 10&lt;/math&gt;

== Practice Problems ==
# &lt;math&gt;6 + (-3) =&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3 + (-9) =&lt;/math&gt; 
# &lt;math&gt;-4 \times 4 = &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; 4 \times (-9) = &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;-2 \times (-4) = &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{-25}{5^2} = &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;-4 \div 2= &lt;/math&gt;

;Order of Operations
: The order of oeprations is the rule at which you apply operations within a mathematical formula.  There are two common mnemonics.

In mathematics, we use BODMAS:

*Brackets
*Orders (e.g. exponents)
*Division
*Multiplication
*Addition
*Subtraction

In the United states, you may also see PEMDAS:

*Parenthesis
*Exponents
*Multiplication
*Division
*Addition
*Subtraction

Other variations exist, but the rules for order of operations remain the same.  

== Lesson ==

Evaluate the expression &lt;math&gt;3 + 4 \times 5&lt;/math&gt;.

If you '''add''' first, it is &lt;math&gt;7 \times 5&lt;/math&gt; and evaluates to '''35'''.

If you '''multiply''' first, it is &lt;math&gt;3+20&lt;/math&gt; and evaluates to '''23'''.

Is the first or second answer correct?

With no '''order of operations''', both answers would be expected, but if an expression evaluates to more than one answer, math becomes ambiguous and does not work.  For math to work there is only one order of operations to evaluate a mathematical expression.

The order of operations is Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).  This can be remembered in two ways: &quot;'''P'''lease '''E'''xcuse '''M'''y '''D'''ear '''A'''unt '''S'''ally&quot; or '''PEMDAS'''.  

The following list from top to bottom is the order of operations in Algebra.  Operations at the top of the list are completed first, operations on the same line are completed from left to right.  

*Parenthesis '''( )'''
*Exponent '''^'''
*Multiply &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;, Divide &lt;math&gt;\div&lt;/math&gt;
*Add &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;, Subtract &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;  

'''Parenthesis''' is a special operation that has the most precedence.  You use the '''(''' and ''')''' signs to make a separate expression from a group of terms.  You evaluate an expression in parenthesis first.  You use parenthesis if you need to do an operation with less precedence first. If the term in Parenthesis is juxtaposed to a variable with no multiplication, then the variable and Parenthesis is ONE TERM. (example: &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; is ONE TERM so if &lt;math&gt;x=(1+2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;2(1+2)&lt;/math&gt; is ONE TERM and takes precedence in the Order of Operations)

== Example Problems ==

Let's evaluate these expressions.

{|
|
* &lt;math&gt;5 + x^3&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=5 + 2^3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=5 + (2 \times 2 \times 2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=5 + 8&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=13&lt;/math&gt;
|
* &lt;math&gt;(5 + x)^3&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=(5 + 2)^3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=7^3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=343&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {6}{x} + 3&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=\frac {6}{3} + 3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=2 + 3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=5&lt;/math&gt;
|
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {6}{x+3}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=\frac {6}{3+3}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=\frac {6}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;=1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
* &lt;math&gt;8 - x + 2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;8 - 3 + 2&lt;/math&gt;
*: (evaluate the – operation first.  – and + have the same precedence but is left-to-right)
* &lt;math&gt;5 + 2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt;
|
* &lt;math&gt;8 - (x + 2)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;8 - (3 + 2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;8 - 5&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Back to the first problem: Evaluate the expression &lt;math&gt;3 + 4 \times 5&lt;/math&gt;.

There is only one answer, 23, because we multiply first.

If we want to add first, we can use parentheses.

If we write &lt;math&gt;(3 + 4) \times 5&lt;/math&gt;,  then we add first, and get 35.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]] '''mirepoix''' is a mixture of finely diced vegetables used as a base for stocks, soups and stews. Typically it consists of two parts [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], and one part each of [[Cookbook:celery|celery]] and [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]] gently fried in [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] until soft. [[Cookbook:Leek|Leek]]s, [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:herb|herb]]s can sometimes be added.

[[File:Bara Brith.jpg|thumb|250px|A loaf of bara brith.]]
'''Bara brith''', sometimes known as &quot;speckled bread&quot; (the literal meaning of the original Welsh-language name), is a fruit bread which originated in [[Cookbook:Welsh cuisine|Wales]]. It is traditionally made with [[Cookbook:raisin|raisins]], [[Cookbook:currant|Zante currants]] and [[w:candied peel|candied peel]].

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Argentina|Argentina]] bara brith, which was brought to the country by the Welsh settlers who started arriving in [[w:Chubut|Chubut]] province in 1865, is known as ''torta negra'' (&quot;black cake&quot;) and is a traditional food item there.

There are many different recipes for this bread, which is baked and sold commercially in some parts of Wales. The bread has a limited shelf life and is best eaten as soon as possible.

==Ingredients==
To make one loaf.

* 8 fl oz (225 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 oz (50 g) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], plus 1 teaspoon
* 4 level teaspoons dried [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]]
* 1 lb (450 g) strong plain [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 level teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 3 oz (75 g) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
* 1 level teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mixed Spice|mixed spice]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]], beaten
* 12 oz (350 g) mixed [[Cookbook:Dried Fruit|dried fruit]]
* clear [[Cookbook:honey|honey]], to [[Cookbook:Glazing|glaze]]
* 2 lb (900 g) [[Cookbook:loaf tin|loaf tin]], well greased

==Procedure==
# Warm the milk in a small pan until hand-hot. Put it into a bowl with 1 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Leave it in a warm place for about 15 minutes until a froth appears. 
# Sift the flour and place in a large bowl with 2 oz (50g)of sugar and the salt. Rub the fat into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs then stir in the mixed spice. Add the egg and frothed yeast. Mix to a dough in the bowl before turning it out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place back into a bowl and cover with plastic film or a damp cloth. Leave it to rise in a warm place for about 90 minutes.
# After it has been left to stand 'knock down' the dough and knead again, adding the fruit slowly. Place into a bread tin and put the tin into an oiled plastic bag. Leave to rise for about 35 to 40 minutes and pre-heat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|gas mark 5]], 190°C (375°F).
# When the dough has risen and springs back when pressed take the tin out of the bag and bake in the centre of the oven for about 30 minutes. Cover the top of the loaf tin with aluminium foil to stop it burning and bake for another 30 minutes. Take out of the oven and tap the bottom of the loaf, which should sound hollow, if not bake it for another 5 minutes. Brush the honey onto the top of the loaf and cool it on a wire rack. Slice it thinly and serve buttered.

This recipe is adapted from Delia Smith’s Complete Cookery Course and Delia Smith's Illustrated Complete Cookery Course.

In Wales the fruit is traditionally soaked overnight in cold tea.

==A simpler variant without yeast==
This variation is also popular - and uses baking powder and bicarbonate of soda as raising agents, rather than yeast. As above, soaking of the dried fruit in tea, for several hours, is essential to the taste and succulence of the loaf.

===Ingredients===
* 12-14oz brown or wholemeal flour
* 3-4oz brown sugar
* 4 oz dried fruit (soaked in [[Cookbook:Tea|black tea]])
* 1 teaspoon mixed spice
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|bicarbonate of soda]]
* 1 egg
* optional - glace cherries

===Procedure===
# Soak the fruit in tea for several hours. Retain the fruit and the tea. 
# Mix the flour, sugar, spice, baking powder and bicarb. 
# Strain the dried fruit and add to the dry ingredients then start to mix. 
# Add the egg, and continue to mix. 
# Add the black tea in small amounts mixing as you go. 
# Continue to add the tea until the mixture is thick, but runny - that is, it clings to a spoon, but any excess drops off easily (if you have used up all your tea, a drop of milk can be added instead to achieve this consistency). 
# The addition of chopped glace cherries will further increase the moisture of the bara brith.
# Pour into a greased baking tin, and bake at 190°C for approximately 90 mins. Loosely cover the top for the first hour, to avoid burning. Once cooked, turn out and cool.

Serve sliced with butter and a [[Cookbook:A Nice Cup of Tea|cup of tea]].

===Conclusion===
Other peoples believed in a Triad of Supreme Beings. Like the Daoists, Hindus, Norse and Hittites; and above all the Neo-Platonists, from whom the Christians shamelessly plagiarized their Trinity.

Our collective [[wikipedia:Racial memory|genetic memory]], imprinted on all beings in this planet is:

# Use the least mass, energy and time possible

'''Our cardinal sin is the sin of [[wikipedia:Pride|pride]], also named [[wikipedia:Hubris|hubris]]. The arrogance of believing ourselves to be better than others. It blinds us, deafens us and weakens us all. The human genetic code is similar.'''

== The Cardinal Sin of Man ==
''' The cardinal sin of mankind is to believe that the Supreme Being must be a liar or a weakling, or even perhaps an ogre'''. 
*'''Liar''': Christianity stakes the claim that either God the Son was a liar, pretending to be too weak to hinder humans from arresting him, etc.; or else  a
*'''Weakling''': Alternatively, for Christians, God the Son was such a weakling that he could be easily taken prisoner by humans, easily tortured to death by humans, etc.; and even an
*'''Ogre''': As Son of the Christian God who sought in a typically ogrish fashion to condemn humans just for being human, Jesus Christ as his Son is a member of a family of treacherous ogres; and is, therefore, completely untrustworthy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Cassini-science-br.jpg|thumb|right|250px|High-precision test of general relativity by the Cassini space probe (artist's impression): Radio signals sent between the Earth and the probe (green wave) are delayed by the warping of space and time (blue lines) due to the Sun's mass.]]

'''General relativity''' (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.

Before the advent of general relativity, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. Under Newton's model, gravity was the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was bothered by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.

However, experiments and observations show that Einstein's description accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in the orbits of Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment, while others are the subject of ongoing research. For example, although there is indirect evidence for gravitational waves, direct evidence of their existence is still being sought by several teams of scientists in experiments such as the LIGO and GEO 600 projects.

General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nucleus or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.

Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest such theory that is consistent with the experimental data. Nevertheless, a number of open questions remain: the most fundamental is how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.

In ordinary three-dimensional space the formula for distance in Cartesian
coordinates is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

Now one can change the coordinate systems if one wants. If one rotates
the coordinate system or stretches or shrinks it, the values for x, y, and
z may change, but the distances will not. We can even conceive of more
radical changes, like going into [[Wikipedia:spherical coordinates | spherical coordinates]] where

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2\sin^2{\theta}d\phi^2 + r^2d\theta^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

In special relativity we learned that physics is described by another
invariant in which 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

Again, we are free to change the coordinates of x, y, z and t to anything
we want, but the underlying geometry and distances don't change.

The next step is to incorporate gravity into this picture. While the
mathematical details can be complex, the basic idea is that the effects
of gravity are equivalent to the effects of acceleration on an observer. From this 
'''equivalence principle''', Einstein was able to show that what matter
does is to change the rules for distances. The formula we showed above
is strictly true only when matter is not present; when matter is
present, the rules for determining distances change, and the effect of
these changes is to produce the effects of gravity we all know. 

This picture of gravity is powerfully simple and elegant. However,
there is one problem with it; in order for it
to be usable, it is necessary to learn many new mathematical concepts
to understand how this picture works.

In our daily lives, we have become very familiar with the properties of three-dimensional Euclidean
space because that is the world we live in. In order to do anything such as walking, moving, or catching
balls, our brains have to deal with 3-space and so we have a great deal of intuitive knowledge
about how this sort of geometry works. Even when we are doing mathematics in three-dimensional space,
we are helped by the fact that our minds have this sort of knowledge built in. However when
we discuss other types of space, our normal intuition fails us, and we are forced to follow the much
more difficult path of trying to figure out what happens by describing the situation through
precise mathematical statements, and this involves learning several new mathematical concepts and
techniques.

To give an example of the mathematical techniques we will have to learn.
Imagine you are on the surface of a flat plane. One formula for distance is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

Another formula for distance in the plane in polar coordinates is 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2d\theta^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

Now these two formula look quite different, but they are really two different
descriptions of the same situation. 

On the surface of a cylinder

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dz^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we again have a formula which looks very similar to the distance in the plane expressed in polar coordinates: locally, the cylinder cannot be distinguished from the plane. Later on, we will give this a name: we call these ''flat'' surfaces.

However if we were on the surface of a
sphere, then the distance for small changes in φ and θ is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = r^2\sin^2{\phi}d\theta^2 + r^2d\phi^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

Now in this situation, the difference in the distance formula is ''not'' merely one
in which we are using different coordinates to talk about the same thing, the
thing that we are talking about ''is actually different''. So this brings up a lot
of questions. How do we know if the differences in distance formulas are
real or are just differences in coordinate systems? Can we talk about distance
formulas in a way that lets us naturally distinguish between real differences
rather than ones that are the result of our descriptions? How can we classify
different geometries? All of this may be intuitively obvious when we are talking
about three-dimensional spaces or two-dimensional objects such as spheres embedded in three
dimension space. However, in order to talk about the behavior of four-dimensional space-time
geometries, we need to rely on mathematical statements to get us answers.

Fortunately, mathematicians such as Riemann worked this all out in the
start of the 19th century. However to understand how to deal with weird
geometries, we will need to learn a few more concepts, such as the concept of a
tensor.

I started to update it last time. &lt;s&gt;Maybe table in every section? Maybe just one row but it could look better. Look [[User:Soeb/GIMP:NewToolbox|here]]&lt;/s&gt;. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] ([[User talk:Soeb|talk]]) 17:49, 27 March 2008 (UTC)
*Doesn't matter anymore. Should be as it is. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;(talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sub&gt;contrib&lt;/sub&gt;]] 17:52, 18 November 2008 (UTC)

Actually got a new idea. The page would be '''one''' table. You can see some concept in my first [[User:Soeb/Sandbox 1|sandbox]]. Notice that the links to images are wrong on purpose. If the moving would actually happen, new naming should be used. Also the page is not finished when I'm writing this. Although it will be soon.

: Great idea, Soeb. I didn't actually see this post until you notified me, I don't have many pages on watchlist. I think you should go ahead with your idea. '''Be bold.''' It is a wiki, after all. --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 17:03, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Thanks, I'll finish the page and update it here to the new design. And this was actually a drastic change to the overall look of the article, so I wanted to confirm if it is going to be accepted.

== Use tool names as links ==

The user interaction for getting more information is broken, when you see a title for information, you mark it as a link... when someone wants more information for the 'foreground select tool' they should select the text 'foreground select tool' NOT 'here' &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:StephenG|StephenG]] ([[User talk:StephenG|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StephenG|contribs]]) 2009-05-04T12:20:14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <comment>adding notes on gomme and rock candy syrup</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Simple syrup''' is a solution of sugar dissolved in water used to sweeten cocktails (to balance tart citrus or similar).  Many older cocktail recipes call for regular sugar to be added, but it is difficult to make sugar dissolve in a cold cocktail, often resulting in a grainy texture or unincorporated sugar resting at the bottom of the glass, both of which are usually undesirable.  Simple syrup incorporates much more easily, and thus is a useful ingredient to have on hand.

This can be made in many ways, but is most often made by heating a 1:1 ratio of standard refined sugar and water until it begins to simmer, then removing it from heat and continuing to stir until all the sugar has dissolved.  It is also possible to do the same with raw sugars such as demerara, which will result in a much more rich, caramel-like solution.  Also, if one continues to heat a simple syrup solution, the sugars will break down into component sugars, resulting in a different flavour.  Feel free to experiment with varieties and ratios to find the formula appropriate for your tastes and what cocktails you are making.

Regardless, it is an important ingredient to have on hand, as many cocktails call for it, and it can help greatly in rounding out and bringing together flavours.

'''Rock candy syrup''' and '''gomme''' are sugar syrups like simple syrup, though they are supersatured and thus have a much higher sugar content. Additionally, gomme contains gum arabic to help keep the sugar in solution. In practice, the three syrups can be used interchangeably with proper adjustment to the drink recipe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Very interesting topic. I wonder why is this under Macroeconomics? This is the point that is not clear for me yet and would be delighted to learn.
[[User:LJG59|Laz]] 12:18, 18 August 2007 (UTC)
:This is background for intertemporal utility maximization, which is the basis for much of the type of freshwater macro done by people like Prescott and Sargent et al. [[User:Smmurphy|Smmurphy]] ([[User talk:Smmurphy|talk]]) 16:26, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

This is quite absurd, in context. It is not in any way relevant to the introductory MacroEconomics presented.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

      <comment>/* Romanisation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The definite article (&quot;the&quot; in English) is &quot;al&quot; (spelled  ال alif, la'm). It is pronounced with the same sound as the name of the letter &quot;L&quot; (i.e. el). It basically does what the word &quot;the&quot; does; it goes before a definite noun. But it has two extra jobs, because in Arabic, small words like &quot;of&quot; and &quot;is&quot; are not used. To illustrate: the striked-out words in the following English sentences would not translate into an Arabic word once the sentence is translated.
    The boy &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; on the roof.
    The sky &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; blue.
    The girls &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; here.
    I &lt;s&gt;am&lt;/s&gt; going away.
    We &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; there.
    The book &lt;s&gt;of&lt;/s&gt; the boy &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; here.
Luckily, the definite article helps indicate where &quot;is/are/am&quot;, and &quot;of&quot; would be. Whenever there are two words, one definite (i.e. starts with &quot;L&quot;) and one indefinite (starts without &quot;L&quot;), if the first is definite then you know that &quot;is/are/am&quot; is implied between the two words. If the first is indefinite then you know that &quot;of&quot; is implied between the two words.

==Summary==
(Y) means some noun&lt;br&gt;
(Z) means some other noun&lt;br&gt;
 →  means &quot;translates to&quot;&lt;br&gt;
l- indicates the Arabic definite article &lt;br&gt;
 l-(Y)       →  the (Y)
 l-(Y) (Z)   →  the (Y) is (Z)
 (Y) l-(Z)   →  the (Y) of the (Z)

== [[The Practice of Learning Theories]] ==

Hello Cjbonk. I've seen you create two new pages recently: [[How can we end the POLT?]], and [[Introducing the POLT]]. Am I right in assuming that these pages are supposed to be part of [[The Practice of Learning Theories]]? If so, they are not properly named, and need to be moved. I can help, if this is the case. Please let me know. You can leave the answer here, I will read this page waiting for a reply.  --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:35, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

== Hi! ==

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Sorry I did not respond to your message earlier. I am very excited to at last have someone on board. I was feeling too lonely and have hardly made any contribution to this book in the last year. 

Good to know that you have some material to contribute. The best way to discuss about this project would be on the discussion page of a particular topic. The page on Orthopaedic surgery would suit me fine. Otherwise you could contact me at: bduttabaruah[at]gmail.com

Lets get something, anything for that matter, started on this project and I am sure we can gather more as we roll along.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

Arabic words ending in tâ' marbûTa (ـة/ة) are usually of feminine gender. It looks like a combination of hâ' (ه) and tâ' (ت). It always comes at the end of the word.

== Example ==

tâ' marbûTa has two ways of being pronounced:

1- When the word is said by itself, it is pronounced as an 'h': zawjah (زَوْجَة).

2- If you add on a grammatical suffix or [[iDâfa]] takes place, it is pronounced like tâ': zawjati (زَوْجَتيِ) = my wife; zawjat 'aHmad (زَوْجَة أَحْمَد) = wife of Ahmad

== Usage ==
Although it is incorrect, some people while writing informally may write Tied Ta' as Ha'ـه/ه. Also, in Egyptian Arabic and many other dialects of Today's spoken Arabic (I'm not sure but I can say all of the dialects excluding Standard Arabic), it is always pronounced as ha'هـ. (Called heh in Egyptian Arabic. Ta' marbutah is called teh marbutah in Egyptian Arabic.)

== Notes ==

1- You can make Tanween to a Tied Taa', but you can't make Tanween to a Haa'. Because of their sense of Arabic, this fact is sometimes used by students (or, at least, taught to them) to help them know whether a word ends in Taa' marbutah or Haa'.

I am [[Wikipedia:Bradley M. Kuhn|Bradley M. Kuhn]].

My general interest in Wikipedia (and Wikibooks, by extension) comes from, as Jimmy Wales puts it, inspiration from the [[Wikipedia:free software movement|Software Freedom Movement]].  I'm a movement guy, and I just love the idea of being able to contribute collaboratively to help make the world a better place by using technology.  So, every time I google for something and hit Wikipedia, I can't resist trying my best to make an entry a little bit better.   It's the Free Software [[Wikipedia:hacker|hacker]] in me.

I kind of like that I came to Wikipedia (and by extension, Wikibooks) way late; I only started ever editing pages a few years ago.  It's just beautiful to see such a wonderful community dedicated to helping people learn flourish in this way.  It makes me all the more proud to be a free software guy to see that community inspiring others to do amazing work of their own.

= My Contributions =

I have basically two passions in life, [[Wikipedia:free software|free software]] and [[poker]].  I try to contribute to books related to those things.

Years ago, I began writing a book called &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.ebb.org/PickingUpPerl Picking Up Perl]&lt;/cite&gt;, and has long been released under the FDL.  I am now working to merge it into the [[Programming:Perl]] book on this site.

* A unit on making Arabic statements (as opposed to questions) without verbs is being developed. The unit already has many exercises, all of them translation exercises (Arabic=&gt; English). The exercises all have keys, so the answers for all the even questions are available. The explanations are minimum. 

* The book has been reorganized. Many of the old pages were taken off the main page. The &quot;archive&quot; link underneath the &quot;Misc.&quot; heading leads to the old pages.

* A new romanisation system has been adopted. Only the first two lessons are fully romanised, so far.


==Goals==

* Get an audio file for each exercise, of someone speaking the questions of each lesson (in Arabic) and with pauses between each question.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}

==Landing==
'''Landing''' is one of the most important techniques to master in the practice of Parkour. Traceurs who do not land properly risk repeated damage to their legs, back and joints. 

The key to safely landing is bending the knees when toes make contact with ground. Never land flat footed; always land on toes and ball of your foot. Do not land with your feet (exaggeratedly) stretched! This &quot;technique&quot;, as often seen in videos, might slightly (if at all) reduce strain on the vertebral column on impact, but significantly increases the risk of ankle fracture. This is due to the specific anatomy of the ankle joint. Stability of the lower ankle joint is notably decreased in the plantarflexed condition (i.e. when the foot is &quot;stretched&quot;) increasing the risk of severe injuries. This is also the reason why most people twist their ankle when walking/running downhill.

==Note==
When landing from a move with a lot of momentum, it may be best to land using a [[Parkour/Basic Moves/Parkour Roll|Parkour Roll]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
An enumeration is a set of related constants defined by a value type. By default, an enumeration is set to integer and sets the first constant to 0 and the second to 1 and so forth. This is so when values have not been declared.

== Setting Enumerations ==
An enumeration that is set up with values 0, 1 and 2. (Values are set to integer as data type has not been declared):
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Enum Terms
      Net30Days
      Net60Days
      Net90Days
  End Enum
&lt;/source&gt;
An enumeration that sets the constants to 30, 60 and 90.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Enum TermValues As Short
      Net30Days = 30
      Net60Days = 60
      Net90Days = 90
  End Enum
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using Enumerations ==
To use an enumeration, you have to call up the enumeration collection name first. Then, like looking into the methods of a class, you then declare the enumeration that you want to use.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A huge list i can see - but i tried to search for a couple of very interresting protocols that i consider very important: FlexRay, CanBus and ProfiBus - there is probally a lot that is missing in this domain of protocols - but aint they supposed to be a part of the list? 

Canbus is a very old but very commonly used protocol where FlexRay is a new emerging protocol that seems to be the replacement of canbus as they in these years finds their place in car systems around the world.

I was actually looking for info on another well-used protocol, Gopher, which I don't see on this list either. It started about the time the Web did and is still active, although not as much as it's heyday.  The best list for all protocols I've seen to date is at http://graphcomp.com/info/rfc/.

      <comment>/* The Skin And Temperature Regulation */ heat lost occurs → heat loss occurs</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Anatomy and Physiology of Animals - 05 Skin.jpg|thumb|400px|right|original image by [http://flickr.com/photos/alosojos/318955761/ Fran-cis-ca] cc by]] 

The skin is the first of the eleven body systems to be described. Each chapter from now on will cover one body system.

The skin, sometimes known as the '''Integumentary System''' is, in fact, the largest organ of the body. It has a complex structure, being composed of many different tissues. It performs many functions that are important in maintaining homeostasis in the body. Probably the most important of these functions is the control of body temperature. The skin also protects the body from physical damage and bacterial invasion. The skin has an array of sense organs which sense the external environment, and also cells which can make '''vitamin D''' in sunlight.

The skin is one of the first systems affected when an animal becomes sick so it is important for anyone working with animals to have a sound knowledge of the structure and functioning of the skin so they can quickly recognise signs of disease.  

==Objectives==

After completing this section, you should know:
* the general structure of the skin
* the function of the keratin deposited in the epidermis

* the structure and function of keratin skin structures including calluses, scales, nails, claws, hoofs and horns
* that antlers are not made either of keratin or in the epidermis
* the structure of hairs
* the structure of the different types of feathers and the function of preening
* the general structure and function of sweat, scent, preen and mammary glands
* the basic functions of the skin in sensing stimuli, temperature control and production of vitamin D
* the mechanisms by which the skin regulates body temperature

==The Skin==
Skin comes in all kinds of textures and forms. There is the dry warty skin of toads and crocodiles, the wet slimy skin of fish and frogs, the hard shell of tortoises and the soft supple skin of snakes and humans. Mammalian skin is covered with hair, that of birds with feathers, and fish and reptiles have scales. Pigment in the skin, hairs or feathers can make the outer surface almost any colour of the rainbow.

As humans, it is often the skin of an animal that gives it its appeal to us or repels us. We love the soft feel of a cat’s coat but perhaps can’t bear to touch a snake. As the main part of an animal visible to us, the skin can often give us clues to the health of an animal. A healthy animal will have a clean, glowing, flexible skin, while ill health may show itself as an abnormal colour or texture.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Cross section skin.jpg]]

Diagram 5.1 - Cross section through the skin

Skin is one of the largest organs of the body, making up 6-8% of the total body weight. It consists of two distinct layers. The top layer is called the '''epidermis''' and under that is the '''dermis''' (see diagram 5.1).

The epidermis is the layer that bubbles up when we have a blister and as we know from this experience, it has no blood or nerves in it. The cells at the base of the epidermis continually divide and push the cells above them upwards. As these cells move up they die and become the dry flaky scales that fall off the skin surface. The cells in the epidermis die because a special protein called '''keratin''' is deposited in them. Keratin is an extremely important substance for it makes the skin waterproof. Without it land vertebrates like reptiles, birds and mammals would, like frogs, be able to survive only in damp places.

==Skin Structures Made Of Keratin==
===Claws, Nails and Hoofs===
Reptiles, birds and mammals all have nails or claws on the ends of their toes. They protect the
end of the toe and may be used for grasping, grooming, digging or in defense. They are continually
worn away and grow continuously from a growth layer at their base (see diagram 5.2).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Carnivors claw.jpg]]

Diagram 5.2 - A carnivore’s claw

'''Hoofs''' are found in sheep, cows, horses etc. otherwise known as '''ungulate mammals'''. These are
animals that have lost toes in the process of evolution and walk on the “nails” of the remaining toes. The hoof is a cylinder of horny material that surrounds and protects the tip of the toe (see diagram
5.3).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animal Horses hoof.jpg]]

Diagram 5.3 - A horse’s hoof

===Horns And Antlers===
True horns are made of keratin and are found in sheep, goats and cattle. They are never branched and, once grown, are never shed. They consist of a core of bone arising in the dermis of the skin and are fused with the skull. The horn itself forms as a hollow cone-shaped sheath around the bone (see diagram 5.4).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals A horn.jpg]]

Diagram 5.4 - A horn

The '''antlers''' of male deer have quite a different structure. They are not formed in the epidermis and do not consist of keratin but are entirely of bone. They are shed each year and are often branched, especially in older animals. When growing they are covered in skin called '''velvet''' that forms the bone. Later the velvet is shed to leave the bony antler. The velvet is often removed artificially to be sold in Asia as a traditional medicine (see diagram 5.5).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Deer antler.jpg]]

Diagram 5.5 - A deer antler

Other animals have projections on their heads that are not true horns either. The horns on the head of giraffes are made of bone covered with skin and hair, and the ‘horn’ of a rhinoceros is made of modified and fused hair-like structures.

===Hair===
Hair is also made of keratin and develops in the epidermis. It covers the body of most mammals
where it acts as an insulator and helps to regulate the temperature of the body (see below). The
colour in hairs is formed from the same pigment, '''melanin''' that colours the skin. Coat colour may
help camouflage animals and sometimes acts to attract the opposite sex.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals A hair.jpg]]

Diagram 5.6 - A hair

Hairs lie in a '''follicle''' and grow from a '''root''' that is well supplied with blood vessels. The hair itself consists of layers of dead keratin - containing cells and usually lies at a slant in the skin. A small bundle of smooth muscle fibres (the '''hair erector muscle''') is attached to the side of each hair and when this contracts the hair stands on end. This increases the insulating power of the coat and is also used by some animals to make them seem larger when confronted by a foe or a competitor(see diagram 5.6).

The whiskers of cats and the spines of hedgehogs are examples of special types of hairs.

===Feathers===
The lightness and stiffness of keratin is also a key to bird flight. In the form of feathers it provides
the large airfoils necessary for flapping and gliding flight. In another form, the light fluffy down feathers,also made of keratin, are some of the best natural insulators known. This superior insulation is necessary to help maintain the high body temperatures of birds.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Contour feather.jpg]]

Diagram 5.7 - A Contour Feather

Countour feathers are large feathers that cover the body, wings and tail. They have an expanded
'''vane''' that provides the smooth, continuous surface that is required for effective flight. This surface is formed by '''barbs''' that extend out from the central shaft. If you look carefully at a feather you can see that on either side of each barb are thousands of '''barbules''' that lock together by a complex system of hooks and notches. if this arrangement becomes disrupted, the bird uses its beak to draw the barbs and barbules together again in an action known as '''preening''' (see diagram 5.7).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Down feather.jpg]]

Diagram 5.8 - A Down Feather 

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Pin feather.jpg]]

Diagram 5.9 - A Pin Feather

Down feathers are the only feathers covering a chick and form the main insulation layer under the
contour feathers of the adult. They have no shaft but consist of a spray of simple, slender branches
(see diagram 5.8).

Pin feathers have a slender hair-like shaft often with a tiny tuft of barbs on the end. They are found
between the other feathers and help tell a bird how its feathers are lying (see diagram 5.9).

==Skin Glands==
Glands are organs that produce and secrete fluids. They are usually divided into two groups depending upon whether or not they have channels or ducts to carry their products away. Glands with ducts are called '''exocrine glands''' and include the glands found in the skin as well as the glands that produce digestive enzymes in the gut. '''Endocrine glands''' have no ducts and release their products (hormones) directly into the blood stream. The pituitary and adrenal glands are examples of endocrine glands.

Most vertebrates have exocrine glands in the skin that produce a variety of secretions. The slime on the skin of fish and frogs is '''mucus''' produced by skin glands and some fish and frogs also produce
poison from modified glands. In fact the skin glands of some frogs produce the most poisonous
chemicals known. Reptiles and birds have a dry skin with few glands. The '''preen gland''', situated
near the base of the bird’s tail, produces oil to help keep the feathers in good condition.
Mammals have an array of different skin glands. These include the wax producing, sweat, sebaceous
and mammary glands.

'''Wax producing glands''' are found in the ears.

'''Sebaceous glands''' secrete an oily secretion into the hair follicle. This secretion, known as '''sebum''', keeps the hair supple and helps prevent the growth of bacteria (see diagram 5.6).

'''Sweat glands''' consist of a coiled tube and a duct leading onto the skin surface. Their appearance when examined under the microscope inspired one of the first scientists to observe them to call them “fairies’ intestines” (see diagram 5.1). Sweat contains salt and waste products like urea and the evaporation of sweat on the skin surface is one of the major mechanisms for cooling the body of many mammals. Horses can sweat up to 30 litres of fluid a day during active exercise, but cats and dogs have few sweat glands and must cool themselves by panting. Scent in the sweat of many animals is used to mark territory or attract the opposite sex.

'''Mammary glands''' are only present in mammals. They are thought to be modified sebaceous glands and are present in both sexes but are rarely active in males (see diagram 5.10). The number
of glands varies from species to species. They open to the surface in well-developed nipples. Milk contains proteins, sugars, fats and salts, although the exact composition varies from one species
to another.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Mammary gland.jpg]]

Diagram 5.10 - A Mammary Gland

==The Skin And Sun==
A moderate amount of UV in sunlight is necessary for the skin to form '''vitamin D'''. This vitamin prevents bone disorders like rickets to which animals reared indoors are susceptible. Excessive exposure to the UV in sunlight can be damaging and the pigment '''melanin''', deposited in cells at the base of the epidermis, helps to protect the underlying layers of the skin from this damage. Melanin also colours the skin and variations in the amount of melanin produces colours from pale yellow to black.

===Sunburn And Skin Cancer===
Excess exposure to the sun can cause sunburn. This is common in humans, but light skinned
animals like cats and pigs can also be sunburned, especially on the ears.
Skin cancer can also result from excessive exposure to the sun. As holes in the ozone layer increase
exposure to the sun’s UV rays, so too does the rate of skin cancer in humans and animals.

==The Dermis==
The underlying layer of the skin, known as the dermis, is much thicker but much more uniform in structure than the epidermis (see diagram 5.1). It is composed of loose connective tissue with a felted mass of '''collagen''' and '''elastic fibres'''. It is this part of the skin of cattle and pigs etc. that becomes commercial leather when treated,. The dermis is well supplied with blood vessels, so cuts and burns that penetrate down into the dermis will bleed or cause serious fluid loss. There are also numerous nerve endings and touch receptors in the dermis because, of course, the skin is sensitive
to touch, pain and temperature.

When looking at a section of the skin under the microscope you can see hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands dipping down into the dermis. However, these structures do not originate in the dermis but are derived from the epidermis.

In the lower levels of the dermis is a layer of fat or '''adipose tissue''' (see diagram 5.1). This acts as an energy store and is an excellent insulator especially in mammals like whales with little hair.

==The Skin And Temperature Regulation==
Vertebrates can be divided into two groups depending on whether or not they control their internal temperature. Amphibia (frogs) and reptiles are said to be”'''cold blooded'''” ('''poikilothermic''') because their body temperature approximately follows that of the environment. Birds and mammals are said to be '''warm blooded (homoiothermic''') because they can maintain a roughly constant body temperature
despite changes in the temperature of the environment.

Heat is produced by the biochemical reactions of the body (especially in the liver) and by muscle contraction. Most of the heat loss from the body occurs via the skin. It is therefore not surprising that many of the mechanisms for controlling the temperature of the body operate here.

===Reduction Of Heat Loss===
When an animal is in a cold environment and needs to reduce heat loss the erector muscles contract causing the hair or feathers to rise up and increase the layer of insulating air trapped by them (see diagram 5.11a).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Hair muscle.jpg]]

Diagram 5.11a) Hair muscle relaxed...............Diagram 5.11b) Hair muscle contracted

Heat loss from the skin surface can also be reduced by the contraction of the abundant blood vessels
that lie in the dermis. This takes blood flow to deeper levels, so reducing heat loss and causing pale skin (see diagram 5.12a).

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Reduction of heat loss by skin.jpg]]

Diagram 5.12a) Reduction of heat loss by skin

Shivering caused by twitching muscles produces heat that also helps raise the body temperature.

===Increase Of Heat Loss===
There are two main mechanisms used by animals to increase the amount of heat lost from the skin when they are in a hot environment or high levels of activity are increasing internal heat production. The first is the expansion of the blood vessels in the dermis so blood flows near the skin surface and heat loss to the environment can take place. The second is by the production of sweat from the sweat glands (see diagram 5.12b). The evaporation of this liquid on the skin surface produces a cooling effect.

The mechanisms for regulating body temperature are under the control of a small region of the brain called the '''hypothalamus'''. This acts like a thermostat.

[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Increase heat loss by skin.jpg]]

Diagram 5.12b) - Increase of heat loss by skin

===Heat Loss And Body Size===
The amount of heat that can be lost from the surface of the body is related to the area of skin an animal has in relation to the total volume of its body.

Small animals like mice have a very large skin area compared to their total volume. This means they tend to loose large amounts of heat and have difficulty keeping warm in cold weather. They may need to keep active just to maintain their body temperature or may hibernate to avoid the problem.

Large animals like elephants have the opposite problem. They have only a relatively small skin area in relation to their total volume and may have trouble keeping cool. This is one reason that these large animals tend to have sparse coverings of hair.

==Summary==
* Skin consists of two layers: the thin '''epidermis''' and under it the thicker '''dermis.'''
* The '''Epidermis''' is formed by the division of base cells that push those above them towards the surface where they die and are shed.
* '''Keratin''', a protein, is deposited in the epidermal cells. It makes skin waterproof.
* Various skin structures formed in the epidermis are made of keratin. These include: claws, nails, hoofs, horn, hair and feathers.
* Various '''Exocrine Glands''' (with ducts) formed in the epidermis include sweat, sebaceous, and mammary glands.
* '''Melanin''' deposited in cells at the base of the epidermis protects deeper cells from the harmful effects of the sun.
* The '''Dermis''' is composed of loose connective tissue and is well supplied with blood. 
* Beneath the dermis is insulating '''adipose tissue'''.
* Body Temperature is controlled by: sweat, hair erection, dilation and contraction of dermal capillaries and shivering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Standard guitar terminology uses first to fourth to indicate the freting fingers, FOR GOOD REASON*.
I've made a start at fixing this but will let the original authors complete it. The diagrams will need to be redone too.[[User:R. Christie|R. Christie]] 22:43, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

The reason* is that the terms index, middle etc are used for the plucking hand. Although this article has presumedly borrowed from the German book it would be foolish for it not to use orthodox convention. [[User:R. Christie|R. Christie]] 00:40, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

== Chord construction ==

I've cleaned up some of the ambiguity here. However, in my opinion inclusion of these explanations is just asking for trouble. Beginners are not equiped to grasp concepts such as intervals and triads etc. Explanations are likely  to raise more questions than answers and only serve to confuse beginners. My preference and advice is to remove the explanations completely and just provide the hows. Send readers elsewhere for the whys. [[User:R. Christie|R. Christie]] 02:32, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

: On the German wikibooks, they have a page called [http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikibooks.org%2fwiki%2fGitarre%3a_Akkordtypen Chord Types (babelfish translation)], which is actually the first page in the &quot;Rhythm Guitar&quot; section. Perhaps this would be a more useful purpose for our [[Guitar/Chords]] page. I am beginning a discussion on the [[Talk:Guitar/Chords]] page about possible directions. --[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 02:46, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:: Actually on re-reading it there isn't too much to confuse here except the 7th chord stuff. The thing is, once you start on the explanations it snowballs, in order to explain one thing you need another term, which needs explanation etc. 
:: The page you refered to above seems to be explaining that barre chords can be found at various positions and with a few standard fingerings. It all very quickly becomes complicated to anyone who isn't familiar with the layout of the notes on the fingerboard. [[User:R. Christie|R. Christie]] 04:24, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

== Replacing German chord diagrams with English chord diagrams ==

If no one minds, I'm going to replace the images. They are good images but having the German fingering notated may be confusing to readers.

==Synopsis==
\ignorespaces

==Description==
Cause TeX to ignore spaces in the input that follows immediately.
This is most commonly used in macros that want to suppress spaces
immediately after an invocation,
as if it is a macro with no argument.
However, since macro and placeholder invocation acts as if
the input contains those text directly,
they are also affected.
See below for an example.

Randomly ignoring spaces in macros comprising a piece of running text
is in general not the expectation of the user.
On the other hand,
in circumstances that a macro is used in special places,
e.g., to define a figure
or to create a LaTeX list or its item,
it is sometimes useful to use \ignorespaces to allow more spaces
so that the input is more readable.

==Examples==
 \def\test#1{(#1)}
 \test{a} b  % Generate &quot;(a) b&quot; with space
 \def\test#1{(#1)\ignorespaces}
 \test{a} b  % Generate &quot;(a)b&quot; without space
 % Macro invocations
 \def\test{ a}
 (\test)b    % Generate &quot;( a)b&quot; with space
 (\ignorespaces \test)b % Generate &quot;(a)b&quot; without space
 % Placeholder invocations
 \def\test#1{(#1)}
 \test{ a}b  % Generate &quot;( a)b&quot; with space
 \def\test#1{(\ignorespaces #1)}
 \test{ a}b  % Generate &quot;(a)b&quot; without space

      <comment>/* Existing Persistence Products */  added JPA 2.1 column, updated EclipseLink version</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many persistence products to choose from.  Most persistence products now support a JPA interface, although there still are some exceptions.  Which product you use depends on your preference, but most people would recommend you use the JPA standard whichever product you choose.  This gives you the flexibility to switch persistence providers, or port your application to another server platform which may use a different persistence provider.

Determining which persistence product to use involves many criteria.  Valid things to consider include:
* Which persistence product does your server platform support and integrate with?
* What is the cost of the product, is it free and open source, can you purchase enterprise level support and services?
* Do you have an existing relationship with the company producing the product?
* Is the product active and does it have a large user base?
* How does the product perform and scale?
* Does the product integrate with your database platform?
* Does the product have active and open forums, do questions receive useful responses?
* Is the product JPA compliant, what functionality does the product offer beyond the JPA specification?

The 4011 is a member of the [[Practical_Electronics/IC/4000 Series|4000 Series]] [[Practical_Electronics/CMOS|CMOS]] range, and contains four independent  [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#NAND|NAND gates]], each with two inputs. The pinout diagram, given on the right, is the standard two-input CMOS logic gate IC layout:

*Pin 7 is the negative supply
*Pin 14 is the positive supply
*Pins 1&amp;2, 5&amp;6, 8&amp;9, 12&amp;13 are gate inputs
*Pins 3, 4, 10, 11 are gate outputs

The truth table for one of the four gates is shown to the right. For more infomation about the NAND gate in general, see this [[Practical Electronics/Logic#NAND|module]].

This chip is widely available, and usually comes in a [[Practical_Electronics/IC/DIL|DIL]]-14 or [[Practical_Electronics/IC/SOIC|SOIC]]-14 package.

This chip is different in pinout to the TTL [[Practical_Electronics/IC/7400|7400]], but can fulfill its function if the wiring is modified.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Please no animated pictures ==

Hi Darklama,

I'm not a huge fan of the barn star myself, but I think an animated smiley and the like has no place on wikibooks, much less on something like a featured books templates.  I feel that it is annoying (in the sense that browser pop-ups and flashy ads are annoying) and deeply unprofessional, not the kind of thing I would like to have associated with our best work.  Do you think we might be able to find something else?  Thanks! -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:48, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

: I'm with Kowey on this.  So much so, that I created [[Template:Featured book with star]] for use in my book. I will happily delete that template if something more acceptable comes along. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:36, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Me three. Moving flashing blinking things are for pizza parlours and the like. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:40, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

: As with the other commentors, I agree that the moving smiley face looks a little cheezy. At the very least the eyes could have been slowed down a bit, because that smiley was reading about a thousand words a minute! ;) But it is true, the barn star is a little unexciting. Perhaps a new image could created from the red, blue and green stack of books (seen on the [[Main Page]] as a link into the Feature Book page). [[Image:Featured_article_books_and_star.svg|100px]] Maybe something like this would be acceptable?--[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 04:28, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:: I have no objection to NickPenguin's star. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 12:53, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:: I am leaning slightly more towards the old star, as it is a little more sober, albeit boring.  But insofar as we are not using animations, I also feel this is not something that needs a lot of discussion ;-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:44, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I have no problem with using something else. I was looking at pictures on Commons and came across it and thought it looked like something that would be better then the barnstar, since it was at least book-related. I think we could use something book-related/book-themed. Someone reading a book seemed appropriate for featured books. Maybe a static image of someone reading a book instead? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:17, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

==Featured Book Seal==
:I like the new image, and the bronze type colour is appropriate. --[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 01:26, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

== Print Versions ==

I have edited the template to include an inline version of the PDF and Print version floating boxes - as otherwise title pages become very cluttered. I hope that I haven't changed anything - only added stuff, so it shouldn't make any difference, but if there are problems I am sorry.
This can now be used
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{featured book|print=Print Version|PDF=NameWithNoFileExt}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
As with the PDF_version template, the name of the PDF file should be passed without Namespace of file Extension, and as with the Print_version template, this will look either for a subpage with the given argument or for the complete page with this name. (sadly I dont know how to get it to have a guess at these things like the other templates do.)
See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special_Relativity&amp;oldid=988461] versus [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special_Relativity&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=988461] for why.

The goal of Wikibooks is to create quality books. Books with similar content, scope and audience should be developed as a single wikibook in order to reduce the duplication of efforts. '''Forking books''' within the Wikibooks project, for whatever reasons, '''harms the project''' and is not an acceptable alternative to improving existing content or resolving disputes.

Separate books on a single topic increases the breadth of subject coverage ''if'' it appeals to different audiences or takes an significantly different, yet equally valid, approach. Note that an alternative viewpoint on the content does not qualify as a different approach since the [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy requires that all viewpoints be covered.

Wikibooks covers a wide range of subjects, and many books on Wikibooks are stubs or incomplete. Wikibookians are encouraged to contribute to existing books instead of creating new ones. If the existing book is in poor condition, Wikibookians should add, rewrite and refactor existing text before requesting that redundant modules be [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|deleted]]. Contact the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects|projects reading room]] for comments on your project ideas.</text>

== '''Brief Description''' ==


Upma is a popular South Indian dish made from [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]] (coarsely ground wheat). Several variations of the dish exist including the use of different varieties of ground wheat, rice and even bread. A simple Upma or Uppittu is made from semolina and takes just about 10 minutes to prepare. It uses very little oil/butter, making it one of the most popular, healthy and filling breakfasts in South India. 

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Semolina|Semolina]] 1 cup
* Veggies such as onion, carrots, Lima beans, potatoes, capsicum, tomatoes finely chopped, peas etc. to make 1 cup
* Chopped green chillies - 2 or 3 small sized
* Chopped Ginger - 1/4 inch
* Finely chopped Coriander - 1 sprig
* Fresh grated coconut - 2 tbsp
* Salt to taste
* Sugar - 1/2 tsp

===For Seasoning===

* Oil/[[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] - 1 tbsp
* [[Cookbook:Mustard Seed|Mustard seeds]] 1 tsp
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]] 1 tsp
* [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|Asafoetida]]1 pinch
* [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|Urad bean]] 1 tsp
* [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry leaves]] - 4-5 leaves
* Cashews halved - 1 tbsp
* Peanuts - 1 tbsp

==Procedure==

# In a heated sauce pan, lightly roast Semolina until it changes to a light brown color and gives out a roasted smell. Pour it out onto a dry plate and allow to cool.
# To the same pan add 1/2 tbsp oil/ghee and allow it to heat up (about 1 min). Now add all the seasoning ingredients starting first with mustard seeds, cumin, black gram, peanuts, cashews in that order. Wait for the mustard seeds to crackle and then add Asafoetida and curry leaves.
# Add the chopped ginger, green chillies followed by onions. Saute for 1 minute and add the remaining veggies and 1 tbsp coconut. Saute again for about 1 minute and add 1 and a 1/2 cups of water and salt. Bring to a boil, simmer it to medium heat and then cover to let the veggies cook for a few minutes.
# After the veggies are cooked, remove cover and stir in the sugar. Now lower the heat further and start folding in the roasted and cooled semolina slowly while stirring constantly.
# Cover and let it cook for a few minutes.
# Garnish with the remaining coconut and chopped coriander leaves.

==Tips==

* Coat the serving spoon with a little bit of the remaining oil/ghee before serving to prevent the dish from sticking to the spoon and also give the dish a lustre!
* To save time, try using the pre-roasted semolina from any Indian grocery store.
* Cooking veggies like carrots, lima beans, peas, potatoes etc separately in the microwave saves time!
* General rule of thumb on how much veggies to add is 1:1 ratio of semolina : veggies
* Try making Upma with just one vegetable to bring out the taste of each veggie.
* Goes well with Coconut chutney and Sambhar

      <text xml:space="preserve">A thread is really just a process without certain rights. Threads only have access to the stack and registers, and use a program counter. The program counter gives the program instructions to the CPU when time. Threads are useful because they hold variables, and are a good way of keeping track of instructions. The Thread actually has the same address as its process, therefore the thread runs &quot;inside the process&quot;. If a program uses one process, and the process has one thread, the the thread could be doing one function while the process another. Having more that one thread sharing process address space is called '''multithreading'''. Multithreading increases the CPU efficiency due to the possible fact of having more than one process running in User space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Interrupt}}

Many pieces of hardware send interrupt signals to the CPU. When the CPU notices that signal, it does a hardware interrupt ‒ the CPU performs a context switch, saving some information about what it was doing, then jumps to execute the &quot;interrupt handler&quot; associated with that particular hardware interrupt.
For example, when a user type into a keyboard, the keyboard sends a key interrupt.
The CPU then executes code for a key interrupt, which typically displays a character on a screen or performs a task.

Perhaps the most important interrupt for operating system design is the &quot;timer interrupt&quot;, which is emitted at regular intervals by a timer chip.

A software interrupt, also called a processor generated interrupt, is generated by the processor executing a specific instruction.
Common processor-generated-interrupts are the divide-by-zero exception and the general-fault or page-fault exception.
Software interrupts cause a context switch to an interrupt handler similar to a hardware interrupt.

Some interrupt handler software might reset the machine, or just display the error, but most interrupt handlers do one of 3 things:
* The hardware (such as a video display) signals it is ready for the next piece of data, the interrupt handler sends out the next piece of data, then returns to the process that was interrupted.
* The hardware (such as a keyboard) signals that it has a piece of data available, the interrupt handler reads in that piece of data, then returns to the process that was interrupted.
* The timer interrupt handler runs the OS [[Operating System Design/Processes/Scheduling|scheduler]]. If the process that was just interrupted has used up its time quantum, and there is some other runnable process, then the scheduler &quot;returns&quot; to that other process. (Later, when the timer interrupts some other process, the scheduler will &quot;return&quot; to this process).

Signals are sent to the current process telling it what it needs to do, such as, shutdown, or that it has committed an exception. A process has several signal-handlers which execute code when a relevant signal is encountered. The ANSI header for these tasks is &lt;signal.h&gt;, which includes routines to allow signals to be raised and read.

Signals are essentially software interrupts. It is possible for a process to ignore most signals, but some cannot be blocked. Some of the common signals are Segmentation Violation (reading or writing memory that does not belong to this process), Illegal Instruction (trying to execute something that is not a proper instruction to the CPU), Halt (stop processing for the moment), Continue (used after a Halt), Terminate (clean up and quit), and Kill (quit now without cleaning up).

      <comment>/* Segmented memory */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Memory Management is a term used to describe how the operating system handles the available RAM. It is managed at multiple levels.

== Physical memory ==
At the most basic level, there is the physical memory. The physical memory's size is the sum of the capacities of all RAM-modules (such as DDR SDRAM) installed in the system. For example, when you have two 512 MiB DDR SDRAM modules installed in your system, the OS will have 1 GiB of physical memory at its disposal.

== Segmented memory ==
On top of the physical memory is the segmented memory. It uses the Memory Management Unit (MMU) to translate a logical address (specifying a segment and an offset) into a physical address (or linear address). This allowed early computers to address more than 64 KiB of memory. Most operating systems today don't use a segmented memory model, preferring to use paging.

== Paged memory ==
A paged memory model uses the MMU to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses. With paging, one can map multiple 4 KiB-sized chunks (called pages) to any virtual address. For example, data at offset 0x1000 in physical memory might be mapped to address 0xC0000000 (at offset 3 GiB) in virtual memory, even though the system may have only 32 MiB of physical RAM available. Accessing the data at address 0xC0000000 internally accesses the data at physical address 0x1000. This provides processes with their own virtual address space which contains only the code and data required by that single process, and everything else is hidden. This way, a process can't corrupt another process' code or data, improving security and reliability.

== Allocated memory ==
With paging, memory is managed in 4 KiB-sized chunks. Most applications require the ability to be able to get only a fraction of that size, to store data. The memory allocator gets a big chunk of memory (say, 4 pages, or 4 * 4 KiB) and divides this into much smaller chunks (e.g. a chunk of 16 bytes and another chunk of 6 bytes.) which it gives to the applications when requested.

== The Heap ==

Many Languages and some operating systems use a form of allocated memory called a HEAP, essentially one large space where memory can be used and re-used. Associated with the heap, is the need to do a process called garbage collection, where now allocated space is consolidated to form larger spaces, and the heap recovers from the eventual fragmentation that happens when the sizes of records using the same space at different times are not congruent and are guarded by other allocated spaces that remain active. The fragmentation effect results in lots of small unusable spaces spread throughout the heap. Garbage collection may for instance involve the movement of an allocated memory from one location to another in order to free up more space. To achieve this transparently to the memory, the allocation unit address must not be the same as the public address, but the public address must be a reference to a look-up table that contains the allocation unit address. The garbage collector can then write a copy of the data to a new address, and then change the look-up table address before removing the original data and allowing the consolidation process to recover the space. Another technique is to reference the start and end point of each allocated memory unit, and when a memory unit is released, test to see if the unit before and after it are either free, and if so reallocate a larger block that contains all the free sections that are contiguous. During allocation the allocation utility will start at the top of the list of free sections and look to see if any are exactly the size requested, if so, the first that fits will be selected, then the next largest one if none are found the exact size. Garbage collection can be done continuously or at low use times, with the eventual caveat that if no low use times are found, the garbage collection will cause the whole computer to slow down temporarily when fragmentation becomes unwieldy.

So before you get tired of all the yada-yada about what different things are and how they work, let's do some action. The best way to learn something is usually learning by doing, and that's no different when it comes to mapping, but, because we're still in the beginning of this book, we should start out simple, let's just do a simple room to start with, we will then continue on this room in the next chapters, so let's get started.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Skiving Snackboxes''''', a creation of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]], are a portable way of escaping from (&quot;skiving off&quot;) classes or other duties.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As would be expected of Fred and George, one of the first things they invent for their joke shop, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], is a way of escaping from classes. Skiving Snackboxes, which are under development throughout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], is that escape. Typically, a Skiving Snackbox is a candy with two colored ends; eating from the one end will bring on some sickness, eating from the other end will cure it. In order to secure the fastest escape from class, illnesses caused by Skiving Snackboxes are designed to be dramatic.

Several different Snackboxes are mentioned in passing:

===Puking Pastilles===

Puking Pastilles cause repeated projectile vomiting; they are the first of the Snackboxes to be mentioned and also the first to be perfected. We see Fred and George demonstrating these in the Gryffindor common room in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''..

In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses one of these to incapacitate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] employee Reg Cattermole, as part of the preparations for invading the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].

===Fever Fudge===
Fever Fudge causes a very high fever; a prototype, tested by Fred and George, has a side effect of giving them large, pus-filled boils in a very private place. A later version which makes use of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Murtlap|Murtlap]] tentacles seems to resolve this problem.

===Nosebleed Nougat===
Nosebleed Nougat results in a sudden and dramatic nosebleed.

&lt;!--Note to editors: See Discussion before changing this --&gt;When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] is hit in the face with a Quaffle during Quidditch practice and gets a nosebleed, Fred accidentally gives her a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood Blisterpod|Blood Blisterpod]], one of the raw ingredients, and as a result Katie nearly falls off her broom from blood loss and has to be taken to the Hospital Wing.

They are eventually perfected and are mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' as being the most popular of the Skiving Snackboxes; at the time of Harry's visit, &quot;only one battered box&quot; remained on the shelves.

In ''Deathly Hallows'', Ron uses one of these to incapacitate Ministry employee Runcorn, allowing Harry to impersonate him.

===Fainting Fancies===
Fainting Fancies cause the person taking them to pass out.  Hermione stops Fred and George from testing these on first years only by threatening to write to their mother.

'''''Romeo and Juliet''''' is an early tragedy by William Shakespeare about two teenage star-crossed lovers. It ends with their suicides, uniting rival households of a long-running family feud. The play has been highly praised by literary critics for its language and dramatic effect. Along with ''Hamlet'', it is one of Shakespeare's most frequently performed plays and is considered by many to be the world's most iconic love story. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime.

''Romeo and Juliet'' belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to Ancient Greece. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as ''Romeus and Juliet'' by Arthur Brooke in 1562, and retold in prose in ''Palace of Pleasure'' by William Painter in 1582. Brooke and Painter are Shakespeare's chief sources for ''Romeo and Juliet''. He borrowed heavily from both, but developed minor characters, particularly Mercutio and Count Paris, in order to expand the plot. The play was probably written around 1595-6, and first published as a first quarto in 1597. The text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original text.

Shakespeare's use of dramatic structure, especially his expansion of minor characters, and the use of subplots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet form as the play progresses. Characters frequently compare love and death and allude to the role of fate.

Since its publication, ''Romeo and Juliet'' has been adapted numerous times in stage, film, musical and operatic forms. During the English restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th century version, which continued to be performed into the Victorian period, also changed several scenes, removing material then considered indecent. Nineteenth century performers, including Charlotte Cushman, restored the original text, and focused on performing the story with greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text, and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. More recent versions, including those on film, have adapted the play for a modern audience, often placing the action in a familiar context.

===Synopsis===
{{quote|&quot;Two Households, both alike in dignity ...&quot;|Chorus}}
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 053.jpg|thumb|right|''Romeo and Juliet'' by Francesco Hayez]]

The play begins with a street-battle between two families, the Montagues and the Capulets. The Prince of Verona, Escalus, intervenes with his men and declares that the heads of the two families will be held personally accountable for any further breach of the peace.

Later, Count Paris, a young nobleman, talks to Lord Capulet about marrying his thirteen-year-old daughter, Juliet Capulet. Capulet demurs, citing the girl's tender age, and invites him to attract the attention of Juliet during a masquerade ball that the family is to hold that night. Juliet's mother tries to persuade her daughter to accept Paris' courtship during this ball; and Juliet says that although she will make an effort to love him, she will not express love that is not there. In this scene Juliet's nurse is introduced as a talkative and humorous character who has raised Juliet from infancy.

Meantime, Benvolio queries his cousin Romeo Montague, Lord Montague's son, to find out the source of his melancholy. He discovers that it stems from an unrequited love for a girl named Rosaline, Capulet's niece. Upon the insistence of Benvolio and another friend, Mercutio, Romeo decides to attend the masquerade ball at the Capulet house, in hope of meeting Rosaline. Alongside his masked friends, Romeo attends the ball as planned, but falls in love with Juliet, and she with him. Despite the danger brought on by their feuding families, Romeo sneaks into the Capulet courtyard and overhears Juliet on her balcony vowing her love to him. He makes himself known to her, and the two declare their love for each other and agree to be married. With the help of the Franciscan Friar Lawrence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, the two are married secretly the next day.

All seems well until Tybalt, Juliet's hot-blooded cousin, challenges Romeo to a duel for appearing at the Capulets' ball in disguise. Though no one is aware of the marriage yet, Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt since they are now kinsmen.  Mercutio is incensed by Tybalt's insolence, and accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf. In the ensuing scuffle, Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo tries to separate them. Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt, then flees.

[[Image:Leighton - Reconciliation watercolor.jpg|thumb|left|''The Reconciliation of the Montagues and Capulets'' (1854) by Frederic Leighton]]
Despite his promise to call for the head of the wrong-doers, the Prince merely exiles Romeo from Verona, reasoning that Tybalt first killed Mercutio, and that Romeo merely carried out a just punishment of death to Tybalt, although without legal authority. Juliet grieves at the news, and Lord Capulet, misinterpreting her grief, agrees to engage her to marry Paris in three days' time, threatening to disown her if she does not. The Nurse, once Juliet's confidante, now tells her she should discard the exiled Romeo and comply. Juliet desperately visits Friar Lawrence for help. He offers her a drug which will put her into a death-like coma for forty-two hours. She is to take it, and, when discovered apparently dead, she will be laid in the family crypt. While in her sleep, the Friar will send a messenger to inform Romeo, so that she can rejoin him when she awakes.

The messenger, however, does not reach Romeo. Romeo instead learns of Juliet's &quot;death&quot; from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, he buys poison from an apothecary, returns to Verona in secret, and visits the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris, who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Paris confronts Romeo, believing him to be a vandal, and in the ensuing battle Romeo kills Paris. He then says his final words to the comatose Juliet and drinks the poison to commit suicide. Juliet then awakes. Friar Lawrence arrives and, aware of the cause of the tragedy, begs Juliet to leave, but she refuses. At the side of Romeo's dead body, she stabs herself with her lover's dagger.

The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find the three dead. In explanation, Friar Lawrence recounts the story of the two lovers. Montague reveals that his wife has died of grief after hearing of her son's exile. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud.  The play ends with the Prince's brief elegy for the lovers: &quot;For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.&quot;

===Sources===
[[Image:Arthur Brooke Tragicall His.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Frontispiece of Brooke's poem, ''Romeus and Juliet''.]]
''Romeo and Juliet'' is a dramatisation of Arthur Brooke's narrative poem ''The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet'' (1562). Shakespeare follows the poem closely but adds extra detail to both major and minor characters, in particular the Nurse and Mercutio. ''&quot;The goodly History of the true and constant love of Rhomeo and Julietta&quot;'' retells in prose a story by William Painter, with which Shakespeare may have been familiar. It was published in a collection of Italian tales entitled ''Palace of Pleasure'' in 1582. Painter's version was part of a trend among writers and playwrights of the time to publish works based on Italian ''novelles''. At the time of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', Italian tales were very popular among theater patrons.  Critics of the day even complained of how often Italian tales were borrowed to please crowds. Shakespeare took advantage of their popularity, as seen in his writing of both ''All's Well That Ends Well'' and ''Measure for Measure'' (from Italian tales) and ''Romeo and Juliet''. Arthur Brooke's poem belonged to this trend, being a translation and adaptation of the Italian ''Giuletta e Romeo'', by Matteo Bandello, included in his ''Novelle'' of 1554. Bandello's story was translated into French and was adapted by Italian theatrical troupes, some of whom performed in London at the time Shakespeare was writing his plays. Although nothing is known of the repertory of these troupes, it is possible that they performed some version of the story.

Bandello's version was an adaptation of Luigi da Porto's ''Giulietta e Romeo'', included in his ''Istoria novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti'' (c. 1530). The latter gave the story much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in Verona, in the Veneto. Da Porto is probably also the source of the tradition that ''Romeo and Juliet'' is based on a true story. The names of the families (in Italian, the Montecchi and Capelletti) were actual political factions of the thirteenth century. The tomb and balcony of Guilietta are still popular tourist spots in Verona, although scholars have disputed that the story actually took place. Before Da Porto, the earliest known version of the tale is the 1476 story of Mariotto and Gianozza of Siena by Masuccio Salernitano, in ''Il Novellino'' (Novella XXXIII).

''Romeo and Juliet'' borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these, Pyramus and Thisbe, is thought by many scholars to have influenced da Porto's version. The former contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus' falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead. Brooke adjusted the Italian translation to reflect parts of Chaucer's ''Troilus and Criseyde''. The ''Ephesian Tale|Ephisiaca'' of Xenophon of Ephesus, written in the third century, also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion which induces a deathlike sleep. Christopher Marlowe's ''Hero and Leander'' and ''Dido, Queen of Carthage'', both similar stories written in Shakespeare's day, are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have created an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.

===Date and text===
[[Image:Romeo and juliet title page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the Second Quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (published 1599)]]
It is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wrote ''Romeo and Juliet''. Juliet's nurse refers to an earthquake which she says occurred eleven years ago. An earthquake did occur in England in 1580, possibly dating that particular line to 1591. But the play's stylistic similarities with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', as well as evidence of performances at the time (the play was becoming popular at around 1595), place the writing between 1595 and 1596. One widely-accepted conjecture has that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595-6.

Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' was published in two distinct quarto editions prior to the publication of the First Folio of 1623. These are referred to as Q1 and Q2. Q1, the first printed edition, appeared in 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labeled a 'bad quarto'; the twentieth century editor T. J .B. Spencer described it as &quot;a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors.&quot;, suggesting that it had been pirated for publication. An alternative explanation for Q1's shortcomings is that the play (like many others of the time) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company.

The superior Q2 called the play ''The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet''. It was printed in 1599 by Thomas Creede and published by Cuthbert Burby. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1. Its title page describes it as &quot;Newly corrected, augmented and amended&quot;. Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft, (called his foul papers), since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and &quot;false starts&quot; for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5). In effect, all later Quartos and Folios of ''Romeo and Juliet'' are based on Q2, as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions (whether good or bad) are likely to arise from editors or compositors, not from Shakespeare.

The First Folio text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook or Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions considering several of the Folios and Quartos began printing with Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope's 1723 version.  Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1.  This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions first appeared in the Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.

====Dramatic structure====
Shakespeare shows his dramatic skill freely in ''Romeo and Juliet'', providing intense moments of shift between comedy and tragedy. Before Mercutio's death in Act three, the play is largely a comedy. After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes very serious and takes on more of a tragic tone.  Still, the fact that Romeo is banished, rather than executed, offers a hope that things will work out. When Friar Lawrence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo the audience still has a reason to believe that all will end well. They are in a &quot;breathless state of suspense&quot; by the opening of the last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved. This only makes it all the more tragic when everything falls apart in the end.

Shakespeare also uses subplots to offer a clearer view of the actions of the main characters, and provide an axis around which the main plot turns.  For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances.  Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the subplot of the Montague-Capulet feud over-arches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.

====Language====
Shakespeare uses a large variety of poetic forms throughout the play. He begins with a 14-line prologue by a Chorus in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet. Like this sonnet much of ''Romeo and Juliet'' is written in iambic pentameter, with ten syllables of alternating stress in each line. However, the most common form used is blank verse, a more fluid, nonstructured approach, although Shakespeare uses this form less often in this play than in his later plays. In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses sermon and sententiae forms, and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech. Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies.  For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he uses the Petrarchan sonnet form.  Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men at the time to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo's situation with Rosaline. This sonnet form is also used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man.  When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare's day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using &quot;pilgrims&quot; and &quot;saints&quot; as metaphors. Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying &quot;Dost thou love me?&quot; By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love. Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo, but uses formal language with Paris. Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet, a rhapsody in Mercutio's Queen Mab speech, and an elegy by Paris. Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times for other characters, such as Mercutio.

====Themes and motifs====
Scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, over-arching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate.  None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small, thematic elements which intertwine in complex ways. Several of those which are most often debated by scholars are discussed below.

=====Love=====
''Romeo and Juliet'' is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love. In fact, the characters in it have become emblems of all who die young for their lovers. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.

On their first meeting, Romeo and Juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare's day: metaphor.  By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo can test Juliet's feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by Baldassare Castiglione (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand the man, and the man could take the hint and back away without losing his honour. Juliet, however, makes it clear that she is interested in Romeo by playing along with his metaphor. Later, in the balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet's declaration of love for him.  In Brooke's version of the story, her declaration is done in her bedroom, alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually, a woman was required to play hard to get, to be sure that her suitor was sincere. Breaking this rule, however, serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip a lengthy part of wooing, and move on to plain talk about their relationship—developing into an agreement to be married after knowing each other for only one night. In the final suicide scene, there is a contradiction in the message - in Christianity, suiciders are condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the &quot;Religion of Love&quot; are joined with their loves in paradise.  Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the &quot;Religion of Love&quot; view rather than the Christian view.  Another point is that although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which prevents them from losing the audience's sympathy.

The play arguably equates love and sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, along with the other characters, fantasize about death as a dark being, often equating him with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet's (faked) death, describes it as having deflowered his daughter. Juliet later even compares Romeo to death in an erotic way.  One of the strongest examples of this in the play is in Juliet's suicide, when she says, grabbing Romeo's dagger, &quot;O happy dagger! / ...This is thy sheath / there rust, and let me die.&quot; The dagger here can be a sort of phallus of Romeo, with Juliet being its sheath in death, a strong sexual symbol.

=====Fate and chance=====
Scholars are divided on the role of fate in the play.  No consensus exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together no matter what, or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favour of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as &quot;star-crossed&quot;. This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers' future. Another scholar of the fate persuasion, Draper, points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in humorism and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt as a choleric). Interpreting the text in the light of the Elizabethan science of humorism reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences. Still, other scholars see the play as a mere series of unlucky chances—many to such a degree that they do not see it as a tragedy at all, but an emotional melodrama. Nevo believes the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative makes Romeo and Juliet a &quot;lesser tragedy&quot; of happenstance, not of character.  For example, Romeo's challenging Tybalt is not impulsive, it is, after Mercutio's death, the expected action to take.  In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting social norms, identity and commitments. He makes the choice to kill, not because of a tragic flaw, but because of circumstance.

=====Light and dark=====
Scholars have long noted Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play. The light theme was initially taken to be &quot;symbolic of the natural beauty of young love&quot;, an idea beginning in Caroline Spurgeon's work ''Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us,'' although the perceived meaning has since its publication branched in several directions. For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her &quot;beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light.&quot; Juliet describes Romeo as &quot;day in night&quot; and &quot;Whiter than snow upon a raven's back.&quot; This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony.  For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness, while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers.  All characters now recognize their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love of Romeo and Juliet. The &quot;light&quot; theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time, since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.

=====Time=====
Time plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain as imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh realities that surround them. For instance, when Romeo attempts to swear his love to Juliet by the moon, Juliet tells him not to, as it is known to be inconstant over time, and she does not desire this of him. From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as &quot;star-crossed&quot; referring to an astrological belief which is heavily connected to time. Stars were thought to control the fates of men, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars movements' early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet's death, he defies the stars' course for him.

A &quot;haste theme&quot; can be considered as fundamental to the play. For example, the action of ''Romeo and Juliet'' spans a period of four to six days, in contrast to Brooke's poem's spanning nine months. Scholars such as Tanselle believe that time was &quot;especially important to Shakespeare&quot; in this play, as he used references to &quot;short-time&quot; for the young lovers as opposed to references to &quot;long-time&quot; for the &quot;older generation&quot; to highlight &quot;a headlong rush towards doom&quot;. Romeo and Juliet fight time to make their love to last forever. In the end, the only way they see to defeat time is through a noteworthy death which makes them immortal through art.

Time is heavily connected to the theme of light and dark as well. The play is said in the Prologue to be about two hours long, creating a problem for any playwright wishing to express longer amounts of time. In Shakespeare's day, plays were often performed at noon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion.  He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to this illusion of its passage.

====Other approaches====

=====Psychoanalytic=====
Psychoanalytic critics focus largely on Romeo's relationships with Rosaline and Juliet, as well as the looming image of inevitable death. ''Romeo and Juliet'' is not considered to be extremely psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses. The first line of criticism argues that Shakespeare is in love with Rosaline and Juliet because she is the all-present, all-powerful mother which fills a void. According to this theory, this void was caused by the negligence of his mother. Another theory argues that the feud between the families provides a source of phallic expression for the male Capulets and Montagues. This sets up a system where patriarchal order is in power. When the sons are married, rather than focusing on the wife, they are still owed an obligation to their father through the feud.  This conflict between obligation to the father (the family name) and the wife (the feminine), determines the course of the play. Some critics argue this hatred is the sole cause of Romeo and Juliet's passion for each other. The fear of death and the knowledge of the danger of their relationship is in this view channelled into a romantic passion.
[[Image:Romeo and Juliet with Friar Laurence - Henry William Bunbury.jpg|thumb|Feminist literary critics have pointed out Juliet's dependence on male characters, such as Friar Laurence and Romeo.]]

=====Feminist=====
Feminist critics argue that the blame for the family feud lies in Verona's patriarchal society. In this view, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end.  When Tybalt kills Mercutio, for example, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so &quot;effeminate&quot;. In this view, the younger males &quot;become men&quot; by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, or in the case of the servants, their masters.  The feud is also linked to male virility, as the joke about the maid's heads shows. Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play's feminism from a more historicist angle.  They take into account the fact that the play is written during a time when the patriarchal order was being challenged by several forces, most notably the rise of Puritanism. When Juliet dodges her father's attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for, she is successfully challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.

=====Gender studies=====
Gender studies critics largely question the sexuality of two characters, Mercutio and Romeo. From the perspective of this form of criticism, the difference between the two character's friendship and sexual love is discussed heavily in the play. Mercutio's friendship with Romeo, for example, leads to several friendly conversations, including ones on the subject of Romeo's phallus. This would seem to suggest traces of homoeroticism. Romeo, as well, admits traces of the same in the manner of his love for Rosaline and Juliet. Rosaline, for example, is distant and unavailable, bringing no hope of offspring.  As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who is homosexual. Gender critics believe that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says &quot;...that which we call a rose [or Rosaline] / By any other name would smell as sweet&quot;, she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.

===Influences===
''Romeo and Juliet'' has had a strong influence on subsequent literature. For example, until this play romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. The play directly influenced several literary works, both in Shakespeare's own day through the works of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, and later works such as those of Charles Dickens.

The play has also influenced world culture, specifically with regard to romance and relationships. For example, the word &quot;Romeo&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;male lover&quot; in English. The juliet cap, worn either close to the scalp as a small headpiece or as a wedding headband to hold the bridal veil, was so named because of the actresses who wore it on stage in performances of the play. It has inspired the name of a psychological problem between couples, called &quot;The Romeo and Juliet Effect&quot;. This title is used to describe relationships which suffer divisions because of hatred between partners' parents. More recently, scholars have described the play as having a unique adaptive and iconic ability, causing its characters to transcend the original texts and project themselves into the modern world. For example, Romeo and Juliet are mentioned in a song by Sublime titled ''Romeo'', which portrays the Montague as a modern character pining for love in a modern way. Both characters have become symbols of love, teenage struggles, resistance to authority, and doers of the forbidden. Songs such as sublime take advantage of the influence these characters have had by communicating through  them to achieve their ends.

===Performances and adaptations===

====Stage history====

=====Shakespeare's day=====
''Romeo and Juliet'' ranks with ''Hamlet'' as one of Shakespeare's most-performed plays. Its many adaptations have made it today one of his more popular and famous stories. Even in Shakespeare's lifetime it was a popular play. Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare's plays, in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London's dominant playwright. The exact date of the first performance of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', however, is unknown. The First Quarto, printed in 1597, says that &quot;it hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely&quot;, setting the first performance prior to that date. The Lord Chamberlain's Men were certainly the first to perform it. Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare, the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors, William Kempe, instead of Peter in a line in Act five. Thus, Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo, being the company's leading actor, and Master Robert Goffe (a male) the first Juliet.

=====The Restoration=====
After the theaters reopened in the English Restoration, Sir William Davenant staged a 1662 production in which Henry Harris played Romeo, Thomas Betterton was Mercutio, and Betterton's wife Mary Saunderson played Juliet (Mrs. Saunderson was probably the first female to play Juliet professionally). This play was criticized by Samuel Pepys as the worst he had ever heard. Versions immediately following this were changed to tragicomedies, where the two lovers did not die in the end. Thomas Otway's adaptation ''The History and Fall of Caius Marius'', one of the more extreme of the Restoration versions of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavina wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. It altered the sexual language of the play as well, toning down the Queen Mab speech, for example. Theophilus Cibber mounted his own adaptation in 1744, followed by David Garrick's in 1748. Both Cibber and Garrick used variations on Otway's innovation in the tomb scene. These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate for the time. For example, Garrick's version transferred all language describing Rosaline to Juliet, in order to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the love-at-first-sight theme. In 1750 a &quot;Battle of the Romeos&quot; began, with Spranger Barry and Susannah Maria Arne (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at Covent Garden versus David Garrick and George Anne Bellamy at Drury Lane.

=====19th century=====
Garrick's altered version of the play was very popular, and ran for nearly a century. Not until 1845 did Shakespeare's original returned to the stage in the United States (with the sisters Charlotte and Susan Cushman as Romeo and Juliet), and in 1847 in Britain (Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells Theater). Saunders actively reverted Garrick's additions and changes to the original, and adhered to Shakespeare's version, beginning a string of eighty-four performances. Her portrayal of Romeo was considered genius by many, as she called more attention to Romeo's character than others, making the play largely his tragedy. Cushman's success broke the Garrick tradition and paved the way for later plays. Henry Irving's 1882 production at the Lyceum Theater is considered an archetype of his &quot;pictorial&quot; style, placing the action on elaborate sets. Irving himself played Romeo, and Ellen Terry played Juliet. In 1895, actor Forbes-Robertson took over for Irving, and laid the groundwork for a more natural portrayal of Shakespeare that remains popular today. Forbes-Robertson avoided the showiness of Irving and instead portrayed a down-to-earth Romeo, expressing the poetic dialogue as realistic prose and avoiding melodramatic flourish. Meanwhile,, American theaters began performing the play, eventually rivalling their British counterparts with the likes of Edwin Booth (brother to John Wilkes Booth) and Mary McVicker as Romeo and Juliet. The play found popularity throughout continental Europe, as well.

=====20th century=====
[[Image:Gielgud.jpeg|thumb|John Gielgud among the more famous actors of the twentieth century to play Romeo and Mercutio on stage]]
In one of the most notable twentieth century performances, staged by John Gielgud at the Noël Coward Theater in 1935, Gielgud and Laurence Olivier played the roles of Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts, omitting only minor portions of the originals, such as the second Chorus.  He also organized the set and costumes to match as closely as possible to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later plays. Meanwhile, Peter Brook's 1947 version was the beginning of a different style of ''Romeo and Juliet'' performances. Brook was less concerned with realism, and more concerned with translating the play into a form that could communicate with the more modern world. He argued, &quot;A production is only correct at the moment of its correctness, and only good at the moment of its success.&quot; Other notable twentieth century productions include Guthrie McClintic's 1934 Broadway staging in which Katharine Cornell had a triumph as Juliet opposite Basil Rathbone as Romeo and Edith Evans (who also played the role in John Gielgud's production) as the Nurse. Cornell later revived the production with Maurice Evans as Romeo and Ralph Richardson as Mercutio, both making their Broadway theater debuts. Franco Zeffirelli mounted a legendary staging for the Old Vic in 1960 with John Stride and Judi Dench that served as the basis for his 1968 film &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Zefferalli borrowed from Brook's ideas, altogether removing nearly a third of the play's text in order to make it more accessible to a contemporary audience. He also paid close attention to detail, making sure that nothing which would add to the realism of the performance was neglected. Zefferelli's performances were so successful worldwide that he made a film of the play in 1968.

More recent professional performances have grown more and more adaptive to the contemporary world. For example, the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company developed a 1986 version of the play set in present-day Verona, Italy. Switchblades replace swords, feasts and balls become drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo commits suicide by hypodermic needle. Later, in 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theater produced another modern version, this time set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death  while in class at school. Other contemporary performances give the play a well-known historical setting, enabling audiences to understand, and perhaps to reflect upon, the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], in South Africa's apartheid era, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Among the most famous of such adaptations is Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War.

====Music====
Roméo et Juliette by Hector Berlioz is a &quot;symphonie dramatique&quot;, a large scale work in three parts for mixed voices, chorus and orchestra, premiered in 1839. The Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture (1869, revised 1870 and 1880), by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is a long symphonic poem, containing the famous melody known as the &quot;love theme&quot;.

At least 24 operas and plays have been based on Romeo and Juliet, the best known being Charles Gounod's ''Roméo et Juliette'' (1867) and Vincenzo Bellini's opera ''I Capuleti e i Montecchi''. The libretto in Gounod's play was by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré. Bellini's opera has rarely been judged favorably, in part because of its perceived liberties with Shakespeare; however, Bellini and his librettist, Felice Romani, worked from Italian sources, with no intention to adapt Shakespeare's play. In 2004 American composer Lee Hoiby also adapted ''Romeo and Juliet'' to write an opera of the same name. Several ballet versions have also been composed; among the better-known is Sergei Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet'', first performed in 1938.

The play led to a number of musical theater adaptations, the most famous of which was ''West Side Story'' with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. It debuted on Broadway in 1957 and in London's West End in 1958, and became a popular film in 1961. This version updated the setting to mid-20th century New York City, and the warring families to ethnic gangs. Other musical adaptations include Terrence Mann's 1999 rock musical ''William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'', co-written with Jerome Korman, Gérard Presgurvic's 2001 ''Roméo et Juliette, de la Haine à l'Amour'' and Riccardo Cocciante's 2007 ''Giulietta &amp; Romeo''.

====Screen====
Shakespeare's play has been filmed numerous times. In putting Romeo and Juliet on screen, the director must set the action in a social context that illuminates the characters, and mediates between the Renaissance play and modern audiences. George Cukor, in 1970, commented on why his &quot;stately&quot; and &quot;stodgy&quot; 1936 film &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; had not stood the test of time, saying that if he had the opportunity to make it again he would &quot;get the garlic and the mediterranean into it&quot;. Yet that performance (featuring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, with a combined age over 75, as the teenage lovers) had garnered no fewer than four Oscar Academy Award nominations.

The films' openings highlight each director's care to establish authenticity: Cukor introduces his characters in a shot of a scene played on a proscenium stage; Renato Castellani's 1954 version &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; opens with John Gielgud, famous as a stage Romeo, as the Prologue in Elizabethan doublet and hose; Zeffirelli sets his scene with an overview of Verona, and his Prologue, in voiceover, was another famous stage Romeo: Laurence Olivier. In contrast, &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot; in 1996 was targeted at a young audience, and opens with images of television and print journalism.

A particular difficulty for the screen-writer arises towards the end of the fourth act, where Shakespeare's play requires considerable compression to be effective on the big screen, without giving the impression of &quot;cutting to the chase&quot;. In Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Juliet's return home from the Friar's cell, her submission to her father and the preparation for the wedding are drastically abbreviated, and similarly the tomb scene is cut short: Paris does not appear at all, and Benvolio (in the Balthazar role) is sent away but is not threatened. In Baz Luhrmann's &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot;, the screenplay allows Juliet to witness Romeo's death, and the role of the watch is cut, permitting Friar Lawrence to remain with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.

In addition, several reworkings of the story have also been filmed. ''Shakespeare in Love'' (1998) attempts tell the story of how Shakespeare came up with the play, placing him in the midst of his own tragic romance as he writes it. The movie creates other parallels to the play as well, such as a quarrel between two playhouses, ''The Curtain'' and ''The Rose'', and an antagonist with similarities to both Count Paris and Tybalt. ''Romeo Must Die'' (2000) uses elements of the plot to introduce Jet Li to an American audience, with Asian Americans as Montagues and African Americans as Capulets. The most recent screen adaptation to garner worldwide attention is Disney's ''High School Musical'' (2006), which began as a made-for-tv Disney movie and was subsequently turned into a live stage musical and touring concert. According to executive producer Bill Borden, &quot;Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean,&quot; said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. &quot;We took from the best.&quot; In the show, the two young love interests, Troy and Gabriella, are from rival cliques, not rival gangs. They resist the wishes of their families and their peers to be together, and try-out for the spring musical that is dividing the school. In David Simpatico's stage version, the title of the musical (unnamed in the movie), was changed to ''Juliet and Romeo''.

What is B2B e-commerce?
B2B e-commerce is simply defined as e-commerce between companies. This is the type of e-commerce that deals with relationships between and among businesses. About 80% of e-commerce is of this type, and most experts predict that B2B e-commerce will continue to grow faster than the B2C segment. The B2B market has two primary components: e-frastructure and e-markets. E-frastructure is the architecture of B2B, primarily consisting of the following:'''9 spell ur name,look the meaning of each letter in ur name and then write it in comment A = Gifted B = Less Patience C =Innocent D =Talented E =Good Heart F =Feel 4 Others G =Logical Thinking H =Calm I =Respected J =Enjoy Life K =Loved by All L =Arrogant M =Great Person N =Smiling O =Sportive P =Intelligent Q =Cool R =Unpredictable S =Romantic T =Proud U =Genuine V =Angry W =Practical X =Crazy Y =Caring Z =Pretty'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The diplomatic history of the United States is older than the American Government.  Prior to the creation of a true national government, the Continental Congress appointed and dispatched ministers (calling them Commissioners) to France and other European powers.  With the outbreak of hostilities between the Colony of Massachusetts and Britain, the rebels were in dire need of powerful friends.  As Virginia and the other colonies joined Massachusetts, it was clear that overseas allies would be critical. Specifically, supplies, money, and naval support were the greatest needs.  Britain was the mightiest military power in the world.  Her Royal Navy was the envy of all the great powers.  Each of the thirteen colonies had militias, but they lacked funds and were nearly without a navy. They lacked the considerable amount of cash required to outfit and fight a continental army.  Since, they lacked any legal or financial standing, it was nearly impossible to borrow money in the normal way.  During the very first miliary engagement, the Battle of Lexington and Concord, the &quot;Red Coats&quot; seized precious gunpowder and ammunition.

After appointing Washington Commander-in-Chief, the General pledged his own funds to recruit and supply a significant number of troops.  But Washington's offer, and the contributions of the thirteen militias was a small fraction of what was needed.  So, the appointment of skilled and respected ministers was an urgent task.  

France was the obvious prospective ally.  She had been frequently at war with Britain, and was at that moment in time fighting the &quot;Brits&quot; in the Seven Years War.  Her military power was nearly as great as that of England.  Further, France had access to high quality gunpowder and a very capable navy to ship it.  Although, the French Monarchy was already in debt, some loans to the fledgling nation were possible.

Three of the first ministers to France were: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams.  Franklin and Jefferson were especially effective in France.  Eventually, the King would send army troops including field artillery, impressive naval forces, and massive amounts of powder and ammunition.  

Franklin was so popular in Paris his likeness showed up on fine china and art.  He was especially popular with the younger beautiful women of French high society.  Jefferson also developed a personal popularity with his broad intellect and people skills. A very deep affection between America and France was born.  The French nobleman La Fayette personified this relationship.  La Fayette quickly became very close to Washington. General Washington describes the relationship almost like that of father and son.  In his last years, La Fayette makes arrangements to be buried near Paris, but with American soil, shipped in to cover the coffin.  

Other capitals in Europe receive American envoys during the War of Independence.  The new diplomats must somehow refine very delicate political skills quickly.  Most of their European counterparts have been polishing these skills since the mid-seventeenth century. Many of these Americans were faced with dangerous Atlantic crossings, linguistic disadvantages, and poor financial backing.  Jefferson and Adams spent a considerable amount of their own money during their time in France. 

In 1779, John Adams was sent to London to try to negotiate an acceptable peace (Encyclopædia Britannica, 1959, vol. 1, pg. 148). Obviously, the apple was not yet ripe.  In the summer of 1780, he traveled to the Netherlands and worked vigorously securing diplomatic recognition for the rebel government, and a badly needed Dutch loan.  Never one to give up easily, he resumed negotioans with London, competing a commercial agreement and temporary peace treaty following the ultimate American victory at Yorktown, Virginia in October 1781.  The temporary treaty with Britain was signed by Adams, November 30, 1782(Ency. Britannica, 1959, vol. 1, pg. 148).

The permanent treaty with London, was primarily the work of John Jay.  It followed extensive, tense negotiations.  Old Mother England may have signed an armistice, but she was still a powerful and determined foe.  It took many more years to secure the complete evacuation of British troops from the American side of the Canadian border.  Other contentious issues such as freedom of shipping on the high seas, and repayment of loans from British merchants to former colonists, lingered unresolved. American diplomacy was born in a cloud of black powder and poverty.  In the ensuing years, true peace and security would be elusive.

This template adds pages to [[:Category:{{{book|User:Whiteknight}}}]].

[[Category:Exclude in print]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

{{User:Whiteknight/Esoteric}}

== Creating This Template ==
To create a page header template using this design, go to the template page and type:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Page List Nav|book=&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|list=&lt;&lt;PAGELIST&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Where &lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt; is the title of your book. &lt;&lt;PAGELIST&gt;&gt; is a listing of pages in your book, typically separated by a dash, and mdash, or some other symbol. Click &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; to create the template. This will substitute in all the necessary code and text. 

=== Options ===

You can customize the CSS style of the template by adding a style argument:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Page List Nav|book=&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|list=&lt;&lt;PAGELIST&gt;&gt;|style=&lt;&lt;STYLE&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you add this style parameter, it will override all the default styles from the template. The default style, which you may want to duplicate in whole or in part, is:

 width:90%; clear:both; padding:5px; margin:5px auto;

== Using This Template ==

To use this template in your book, use regular template syntax to include it at the top of every page. This template takes two arguments, both of which are unnamed. The first argument is the name of the previous subpage, and the second argument is the name of the next subpage. page names are automatically prepended with the name of the book. This means that you cannot use this template to navigate to pages in other books.

== Notes ==

There does not seem to be any difference in here between step-family and in-laws. How do you tell the difference in French between my wife's mother (my mother-in-law) and my father's new wife (my step-mother)? Less significantly, the same problem could arise between my half-sister who is my blood relative, my step-sister (my step-mother's daughter from a previous relationship) and my sister-in-law (my wife's sister) who are not my blood relatives. Correct identification of 'la belle-mère' appears the most important though. [[User:Peter R Runes|Peter R Runes]] 15:00, 21 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* The Past Tense */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Past Tense==

The past tense is strikingly similar to that of Russian and Ukrainian. Like the two aforementioned languages, the conjugations is simpler than the present tense. But, as a reminder, instead of six endings as in the present and future, we have only four in the past. There is a reason: the past tense changes according to the gender (Masculine, femenine, and neutral) and number (singular and plural). The past tense is used for verbs of both aspects. The imperfective past tense tends to show an action done that used to be done in the past (as in a routine or reppetitive, sequential action), while the perfective tense is one in which an action was done in one stroke.

The past tenses of the verbs are as follows:

'''чыта́ць''' 

'''Я/Ты/Ён чыта́ў''': I/you/he (man) used to read, have read (but not finished) 

'''Я/Ты/Янá чыта́ла''': I/you/she (woman) used to read, have read  

'''Янó чыта́лo''' (sometimes written with an a, as the 'o' is rarely stressed in past endings)= It used to read

'''Mы/Bы/Яны чыта́лi''': We/You (formal and plural)/They used to read, have read--but not finished  


Now comes the perfective verb '''прачыта́ць''' (to finish reading, to read in one stroke)


'''Я/Ты/Ён прачыта́ў''': I/you/he have read (and finished the book, etc...)

'''Я/Ты/Янá прачыта́ла''': I/you/she (woman) read (done and finished reading in one stroke)

'''Янó прачыта́лo''' (sometimes written with an a, as the 'o' is rarely stressed in past endings)= It read

'''Mы/Bы/Яны прачыта́лi''': We/You (plural and formal)/They read-- done or completed just once.


There is really no trick to it; you just replace the infinitive -ць with -'''ў''' for masculine nouns; -'''ла''' for feminine(and sometimes unstressed neuter) nouns, -'''лo''' for most neuter forms and -'''лi''' for all plural nouns, very similar to the Russian past tense endings -л, -ла, -лo, ли and Ukrainian -в, -ла, -лo, ли. 

However, there are a few verbs that end in -цi  and these have different endings:

== The Future Tense==

Like all other Balto-Slavic languages, the future tense has two forms in Belorussian. For Imperfective verbs, we use the conjugated form of Быць (to be) plus the infinitive of the verb. This tense is very similar to that of the English future tense. Imperfective future is used to show an action will be done but it is not known when it shall be done, or it can also show a reppetive action waiting to be fulfilled again. 

'''чыта́ць''' /'''прачыта́ць'''


'''Я'''              '''бýдy чыта́ць'''                                              
                     
'''Ты '''            '''бýдзеш чыта́ць'''                                         

'''Ён/Янá/Янó'''     '''бýдзе чыта́ць'''                                         

'''Mы '''            '''бýдзем чыта́ць'''                                       

'''Bы'''             '''бýдзецe чыта́ць '''                                     

'''Яны'''           '''бýдyць чыта́ць'''                                       


Perfective verbs, on the other hand, form a simple future with the very same verb endings as their present-tense counterparts and these show an action that will be done with the utmost certainty, and one that will be short or done only one time. Again, like the present tense, pronouns can be ommitted due to context in both future tenses:


'''Я'''                 '''прачыта́ю''' 

'''Ты '''               '''прачыта́еш'''  

'''Ён/Янá/Янó'''        '''прачыта́е''' 

'''Mы '''               '''прачыта́ем'''

'''Bы'''                '''прачыта́ецe'''

'''Яны''' '''прачыта́юць'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Morality''' is a system of beliefs about ethics, about what is right and good compared to what is wrong or bad. Moral development refers to the changes in moral beliefs as a person grows older and gains maturity. Moral ''beliefs'' are related to, but not identical with, moral ''behavior:''  it is possible to know the right thing to do, yet not actually do what is right. Morality is also not the same as knowledge of social conventions, which are arbitrary customs needed for the smooth operation of society. Even though conventions may have a moral element, they have a primarily practical purpose. Conventionally, for example, motor vehicles all keep to the same side of the street (to the right in the United States, to the left in Great Britain). This convention allows for smooth flow of traffic and prevents accidents. But following the convention also has a moral element, because any individual who chooses to drive on the wrong side of the street can cause injuries or even death. Choosing the wrong side of the street is therefore morally wrong, and choosing the conventional side is morally right.

When it comes to teaching, moral choices are not restricted to occasional dramatic incidents, but are woven into almost every aspect of classroom life. Imagine this simple example. Suppose that you are teaching reading to a small group of second-graders, and the students are taking turns reading a story out loud. Should you give every student the same amount of time to read, even though some might benefit from additional opportunity to read? Or should you give more time to the students that seem to need extra help, even if doing so bores others or deprives them of an equal share of “floor time”? Which option is more fair, and which is more considerate? Parallel dilemmas happen every day at all grade levels simply because students are diverse and class time and a teacher’s energy level are finite.

Embedded in this rather ordinary classroom incident are two moral issues, one about fairness or justice and the other about consideration or care. It is important to keep both in mind when thinking about how students develop their own beliefs about right or wrong. A morality of justice is a system of beliefs about human rights—or more specifically, about respect for fairness, impartiality, equality, and individuals’ independence. A morality of care, on the other hand, is a system of beliefs about human responsibilities—more specifically, about caring for others, showing consideration for individuals’ needs, and interdependence among individuals. Students and teachers need to develop both forms of morality. In the next sections therefore I explain one major theory about each type of developmental change, beginning with the morality of justice.

===Kohlberg’s Morality of Justice===

One of the best-known explanations of how the morality of justice develops was developed by Lawrence Kohlberg and his associates  (Kohlberg, Levine, &amp; Hewer, 1983; Power, Higgins, &amp; Kohlberg, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, L., Levine, C.,  &amp; Hewer, A. (1983). Moral stages: A current formulation and a response to critics. Basel: S. Karger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Power, F., Higgins, A., &amp; Kohlberg, L. (1991). Lawrence Kohlberg’s approach to moral education. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Using a stage model similar to Piaget’s, Kohlberg proposed six stages of development, grouped into three levels, which individuals experience universally and in sequence as they form beliefs about justice. He named the levels simply preconventional, conventional, and (you guessed it) postconventional. The levels and stages are summarized in [[Table 3-3]].
 
====Preconventional Justice: Obedience and Mutual Advantage====
The preconventional level of moral development coincides approximately with the preschool period of life and with Piaget’s preoperational period of thinking. At this age the child is still relatively self-centered and consequently insensitive to the moral effects of actions on others. The result is a somewhat short-sighted set of moral beliefs. Initially (Kohlberg’s ''Stage 1''), the child adopts an ethics of obedience and punishment—a sort of “morality of keeping out of trouble.” The moral rightness and wrongness of actions are determined by whether actions are rewarded or punished by authorities, such as parents or teachers. If helping yourself to a cookie brings affectionate smiles from adults, then taking the cookie is considered morally “good.” If it brings scolding instead, then it is morally “bad.” The child does not think about why an action might be praised or scolded; in fact, says Kohlberg, he would be incapable at Stage 1 of considering the reasons even if adults offered them.

Eventually the child learns not only to respond to positive consequences, but also learns how to produce them by exchanging favors with others. The new ability creates ''Stage 2'', an ethics of market exchange. At this stage the morally “good” action is one that favors not only the child, but another person directly involved, and a “bad” action is one that lacks this reciprocity. If trading the sandwich from your lunch for the cookies in your friend’s lunch is mutually agreeable, then the trade is morally good; otherwise it is not. This perspective introduces a type of fairness into the child’s thinking, but still ignores the larger context of actions—the effects on people not present or directly involved. In Stage 2, for example, it would also be considered morally “good” to pay a classmate $5.00 per week to do your homework—or even to avoid bullying or to provide sexual favors—provided that both parties find the arrangement fair.

====Conventional Justice: Conformity to Peers and Society====
As children move into the school years, their lives expand to include a larger number and range of peers and (eventually) of the community as a whole. The change leads to conventional morality, which are beliefs about right and wrong based on what this larger array of people agree on—hence Kohlberg’s use of the term “conventional.” At first, in ''Stage 3'', the child’s reference group are immediate peers, so Stage 3 is called the ethics of peer opinion. If peers say, for example, that it is morally good to behave politely with as many people as possible, then the child is likely to agree with the group and to regard politeness as not merely an arbitrary social convention, but a moral “good.” This approach to moral belief is a bit more stable, but not necessarily more profound, than the approach in Stage 2, because the child is taking into account the reactions not just of one other person, but of an entire group. But it can still lead a child astray if the group settles on beliefs that adults consider morally wrong, like “Be nice to everyone except Rachel” or “Shop lifting for candy bars is fun and desirable.”

Eventually, as the child becomes a youth and the social world expands even more, he or she acquires even larger numbers of peers and friends, many of whom may disagree about ethical issues and beliefs. Resolving the complexities lead to ''Stage 4'', the ethics of law and order, in which the young person increasingly frames moral beliefs in terms of what society as a whole seems to believe. Now an action is morally good if it is legal or at least customarily approved by most people, including people whom the youth does not know personally. This attitude leads to an even more stable set of principles than in the previous stage, though it is still not immune from “wrongheaded” ethics completely. A community or society may sometimes agree, for example, that people of a certain race should be treated with deliberate disrespect, or that a factory owner is entitled to dump wastewater into a commonly shared lake or river. To develop ethical principles that reliably avoid mistakes like these, therefore, requires further stages of moral development.

====Postconventional Justice: Social Contract and Universal Principles====
As a person becomes able to think more abstractly (or “formally,” in Piaget’s sense), ethical beliefs shift from mere acceptance of what community and society do believe to the process by which community beliefs are formed. This new focus constitutes ''Stage 5'', the ethics of social contract. Now an action, belief, or practice is morally good if it has been created through fair, democratic processes that have respected the rights of the people affected. Consider, for example, the No Child Left Behind legislation—the current law in the United States requiring that all students be given standardized tests in order to decide whether schools and teachers are teaching adequately (United States Government Printing Office, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Printing Office. (2002). No Child Left Behind Act: A desktop reference. Washington, D.C.: Author&lt;/ref&gt;. This law is certainly legal, but is it ethical? Was it created by consulting with and gaining the consent of the relevant people? How well, for example, were educational leaders consulted? Or how about students and families of color, or teachers in schools lacking crucial resources? Reasonable, thoughtful individuals disagree about how thoroughly and fairly these consultation processes have occurred. Their focus on the process means that they are thinking according to Stage 5, the ethics of social contract, regardless of what they may also think about the content of the legislation. In this sense beliefs on both sides of a debate about No Child Left Behind can be morally sound, even if they contradict each other.

Paying attention to due process certainly seems like it might avoid help to avoid following conventional moral beliefs mindlessly. As an ethical strategy, though, it too can sometimes fail. The problem is that an ethics of social contract places more faith in democratic process than the process sometimes deserves, and does not pay enough attention to what may be decided through democratic due process. In principle (and unfortunately in practice), a society could decide democratically to kill off every member of a racial minority, for example, but would the due process make it ethical? The possibility of ethical means serving unethical ends leads some individuals toward ''Stage 6'', the ethics of self-chosen, universal principles. At this final stage, the morally good action is based on personally held principles that apply both to the person’s immediate life as well as to the larger community and society. The universal principles may include a belief in democratic due process (Stage 5 ethics), incidentally, but others may also be involved, such as a belief in the dignity of all human life or of the natural environment. At Stage 6 the universal principles will from a person’s beliefs even if the principles occasionally mean disagreeing with what is customary (Stage 4) or even with what is legal (Stage 5).

===Gilligan’s Morality of Care===
As logical as it sounds, Kohlberg’s stages of moral justice are not sufficient for understanding moral development either of students or of teachers. To see why, suppose that you have a student who asks for the extension of the deadline for an assignment. The justice orientation of Kohlberg’s theory would prompt you to consider issues of fairness and individual rights. Would the extension be fair to others, since the late student might be able to put more work into the assignment than can other students? And would the extension be fair to you, since you may need to mark the assignments as promptly as possible, so that you can move on to other teaching tasks. These are important considerations, but not the only ethical ones. Another set has to do with the responsibilities that you and the student have for each other. Does the student have valid personal reasons (illness, death in the family, etc.) for why the assignment has to be late? And will the assignment lose its educational value if you force the student to turn it in prematurely? These latter questions have less to do with fairness and rights, and more to do with taking care and responsibility for students. They require a framework different from Kohlberg’s to be understood fully.
 
One such framework has been developed by Carol Gilligan, a former student of Kohlberg’s, whose ideas center on a morality of care, or system of beliefs about human responsibilities, care and consideration for others. Gilligan proposed three moral positions that represent different extents or breadth of ethical care. Unlike Kohlberg (or Piaget or Erikson), she does not claim that the positions form a developmental sequence, but only that they can be ranked hierarchically according to their dept or subtlety. In this respect her theory is only “semi-developmental,” in a way similar to Maslow’s hierarchy of motives (Brown &amp; Gilligan, 1992; Taylor, Gilligan, &amp; Sullivan, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. &amp; Gilligan, C. (1992). Meeting at the crossroads: Women’s psychology and girls’ development. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. &amp; Gilligan, C., &amp; Sullivan, A.  (1995). Between voice and silence: Women and girls, race and relationship. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Table 3-3]] summarizes the three moral positions from Gilligan’s theory.

====Position 1: Caring as Survival====
The most basic kind of caring is a survival orientation, in which a person is concerned exclusively with his or her own welfare. If a teenage girl with this ethical position is wondering whether to get an abortion, for example, she will be concerned entirely with the effects of the abortion on herself. The morally good choice will be whatever creates the least stress and disrupts her life the least. Responsibilities to others (like the baby, the father, or her family) play little or no part in her thinking.
 
As a moral position, a survival orientation is obviously not satisfactory for classrooms on a widespread scale. If every student only looked out for himself or herself alone, classroom life might become rather unpleasant! Nonetheless, there are situations in which caring primarily about yourself is both a sign of good mental health and also relevant to teachers. For a child who has been bullied at school or sexually abused at home, for example, it is both healthy and morally desirable to speak out about the bullying or abuse—essentially looking out for the victim’s own needs at the expense of others’, including the bully’s or abuser’s. Speaking out requires a survival orientation and is healthy because in this case, the child is at lest caring about herself.

====Position 2: Conventional Caring====
A more sophisticated or subtle moral position is caring for others, in which a person is concerned about others’ happiness and welfare, and about reconciling or integrating others’ needs where they conflict. In considering an abortion, for example, the teenager might think primarily about what others in her life prefer her to do—whether the father, her parents, or her doctor want to keep the child. The morally good choice becomes whatever will please others the best. This position is more demanding than Position 1, both ethically and intellectually, because it requires coordinating several persons’ needs and values at the same time. But ultimately it is morally insufficient because it does not consider one crucial person: the self.
 
In classrooms, students who operate from Position 2 can be very desirable in some ways; they can be kind, considerate, and good fitting in and at working cooperatively with others. Because these qualities are very welcome in a busy classroom, it can be tempting for teachers to reward students for developing and using them for much of their school careers. The problem with rewarding Position 2 ethics, however, is that doing so neglects the student’s identity—his or her own academic and personal goals or values. Sooner or later, personal goals, values and identity need attention, and educators have a responsibility for assisting students to discover and clarify them. Unfortunately for teachers, students who know what they want may sometimes be more assertive and less automatically compliant than those who do not.

====Position 3: Integrated Caring====
The most developed form of moral caring in Gilligan’s model is integrated caring, the coordination of personal needs and values with those of others. Now the morally good choice takes account of everyone including yourself, not everyone except yourself. In considering an abortion, the woman at Position 3 would think not only about the consequences for the father, the unborn child, and her family, but also about the consequences for herself—her own needs, values, and plans. This perspective leads to moral beliefs that are more comprehensive, but ironically also more prone to moral dilemmas because the widest range of individuals are being considered.

In classrooms, integrated caring is most likely to surface whenever teachers give students wide, sustained freedom to make choices. If students have little flexibility about their actions, there is little room for considering anyone’s needs or values, whether their own or others’. If the teacher says simply, “Do the homework on page 50 and turn it in tomorrow morning,” then compliance becomes the main issue, not moral choice. But suppose instead that she says something like this: “Over the next two months, figure out an inquiry project about the use of water resources in our town. Organize it any way you want—talk to people, read widely about it, and share it with the class in a way that all of us, including yourself, will find meaningful.” Although an assignment this general or abstract may not suit some teachers or students, it does pose moral challenges for those who do use it. Why? For one thing, students cannot simply carry out specific instructions, but must decide what aspect of the topic really matters to them. The choice is partly a matter of personal values. For another thing, students have to consider how the topic might be meaningful or important to others in the class. Third, because the time line for completion is relatively far in the future, students may have to weigh personal priorities (like spending time with family on the weekend) against educational priorities (working on the assignment a bit more on the weekend). As you might suspect, some students might have trouble making good choices when given this sort of freedom—and their teachers might therefore be cautious about giving such an assignment. But in a way these hesitations are part of Gilligan’s point: integrated caring is indeed more demanding than the caring based on survival or orientation to others, and not all students may be ready for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thank you ==

Im learning haskell for some weeks now and I am very impressed how fast I can setup a reliable build-system. In Java something like this is soo complicated (integrating: ant, mvn, make, cvs, svn, junit). This page was absolutly to the point for me: We have an evolving project, and I setup everything according to this guide in 1,5 hours. Great!!

-- bastl (delete the comment when you read it.)

== Nonroot installs ==
A small tip to add to this page :

if you want to install your project on a simple user account, you should do :

runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user

this way, installation won't try to edit a system file.


thanks for this great wikibook by the way, it is of great help !

:Happy to hear that.  I've tacked on the --user flag to each of our configure options -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 04:09, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

== Handling GHC extensions ==

Another missing information (actually I didn't find this information anywhere else yet) :

When your code is using GHC extensions (-fglasgow-exts), how do you handle this ? Is is in the cabal file ? Is it some kind of header at the beginning of the sources ?

-- Thomas

PS : I found my answer ... {-# OPTIONS -fglasgow-exts #-} at the beginning of the code. Is this information appearing anywhere in this wikibook ?

:I don't think so, but I suppose it could be mentioned in this module -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:10, 24 August 2007 (UTC)

:That would work anon, but it'd be even better to use &lt;code&gt;{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fglasgow-exts #-}&lt;/code&gt;, so in the (unlikely :) case someone wants to use the code with Hugs/NHC/YHC/JHC/EHC, they don't try to use it. 
:There's a better way to do it with the LANGUAGE pragmas, but I'll just add that to the page. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]]

:I think there's another way you could do it, by adding the 'ghc-options:' field to the cabal file and then --fglasgow-exts. (Probably.) --[[User:24.184.131.16|24.184.131.16]] 00:02, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

::Yes, that'd work, except it'd be '-fglasgow-exts', not '--fglasgow-exts' - the only '--' option is '--make'. --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]]

== Testing script problems ==

The main function in Tests.hs doesn't work so well for me when invoked from darcs. The problem is that it doesn't return a non-zero exit code in case of failure so darcs will think that everything is alright even though the tests failed. The way I solved this was to use the alternate testing function quickCheck' for all my tests. It returns a boolean which reports if the test when through. Beware though that I'm using QuickCheck 2 so the function might not exist in QuickCheck 1, I haven't checked. Then I used System.Exit.exitFailure in case a test failed. Looks like this:

  main = mapM_ runTest tests
    where runTest (s,a) = do printf &quot;%-25s :&quot; s
                             b &lt;- a
                             if b 
                               then return ()
                               else exitFailure

      <comment>[[Talk:XQuery/Word Count]] moved to [[Talk:XQuery/Tag Cloud]]: more accurate name</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I hope this is the way to discuss coding practices ;-)

In the keyword counting function we have:

     let $term-count := count(for $word in $wordlist where $word = string($term) return $word)

The explicit atomisation with string() isn't needed here - so .. 

     let $term-count := count(for $word in $wordlist where $word = $term return $word) 

Also generalised = is not needed here since neither operands is a  sequence

     let $term-count := count(for $word in $wordlist where $word eq $term return $word)

In general I think its good to encourage the use of XPath predicates where possible - they are generally faster than FLWOR expressions and clearer.

So finally I would suggest

     let $term-count := count($wordlist[. eq $term]) 

Although this formulation does require an explanation of . but XQuery presumes a knowledge of XPath
[[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] 06:06, 23 August 2007 (UTC)


I've also reduced the functionality of the word-count function - ordering the items by the count is an additional task unrelated to the counting, and when the map is generated, the ordering needs to be different (alphabetical).  I've also chanced the input to the whole list because that seems more consistent with the return and changed the term format itself so that the count is added to the term as an attribute.

Maybe I'm being a bit too enthusistic here ??

== General Overview ==

'''''Shell Cottage''''' is the cottage on the oceanside where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] reside after their marriage. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] stays at Shell Cottage over Christmas of Harry's seventh year, when he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparates]] away from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] after their fight. This is also where Harry, Ron, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Olivander]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] take shelter after the fight at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], and is the place where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] is laid to rest. With all of these people, the cottage is quite crowded, particularly as Griphook requires a room of his own, and Harry will, at least initially, not let Bill send Griphook or Mr. Ollivander to a different safe-house. We hear at one point that Harry, Ron, and Dean are sleeping in the living room. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] visits while Harry is there, to announce the birth of his son Teddy. And Ron, Harry, Hermione, and Griphook depart from there on their mission to enter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange's]] vault at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]].

The location of the cottage is protected by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius charm]]; the secret-keeper is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]].

In post-publication interviews, the author has suggested that Shell Cottage is located on the outskirts of Tinworth, in Cornwall.

== Analysis ==

We know very little about Shell Cottage; its appearance in the series is fleeting, and all we ever learn about it is that it is a safe house, inaccessible to those who have not had the secret of its location revealed to them by the secret-keeper, Bill Weasley. This actually leads us to one unresolved issue: how is Harry able to find it? It is possible, given that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] magic is distinct from Human magic, that Dobby may be able to find Shell Cottage despite the workings of the Fidelius charm, and Ron has stayed there for a while and so knows about it, but Mr. Ollivander, Dean, Hermione, and Harry, according to our understanding of the charm, should not even be able to see Shell Cottage until Bill tells them where it is. (Griphook may suffer the same effect, but as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblins]] likely use a non-Human mode of magic, we cannot be sure.) It may be enough for Bill to greet them, saying something as mundane as &quot;Welcome to Shell Cottage,&quot; but as far as we can tell, that does not happen; Harry arrives with the dying Dobby, and is able to see Shell Cottage immediately when he lands. No explanation for this is ever offered. 

It is not immediately obvious why Harry does not want Griphook or Mr. Ollivander moved, despite the crowding in the cottage. Of course, immediately after their arrival, Harry does need to talk to Ollivander about wandlore, specifically to determine how much of a threat the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] will pose if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] retrieves it; but having had that conversation, Harry presumably can release Ollivander to another safe house. Eventually, of course, Ollivander is transferred to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]]'s house, once it is believed that he is sufficiently recovered. The need for Griphook to stay at the cottage becomes clear very shortly as well. Bellatrix' reaction on seeing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] convinces Harry that something Voldemort values very highly is in Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, almost certainly a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], so Harry must break in to Gringotts to recover it. A source of inside knowledge about Gringotts is vital to that endeavour, and Griphook is that source.

It should also be noted that, despite being called &quot;safe houses,&quot; no house in England at this point can be considered completely safe. The Tonks' house, which was a safe house when Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] visited there on their way to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] as Harry escaped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']], was not safe enough to protect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], who is on the run from Snatchers when we see him last. The Burrow, also a safe house, falls to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] immediately after Bill and Fleur's wedding. The only three safe houses which we believe have not seen Death Eater incursions to date are Shell Cottage, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel's]] home, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]... and we are not completely sure about the last.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Place for detailed information on deploying WebObjects applications in Tomcat.

==Assumptions==

*Tomcat installation location: '''/usr/local/tomcat'''
*Apache configuration location: '''/etc/httpd'''
*Applications location: '''/usr/local/myapps'''
*Java installation location: '''/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06'''

==Tomcat==

===Common Libraries===

Install all common libraries into '''/usr/local/tomcat/shared/lib''', e.g.:

  activation.jar
  commons-logging-1.1.jar
  httpunit-1.6.2.jar
  java-diff-1.0.5.jar
  mail.jar
  mysql-connector-java-5.0.6-bin.jar
  servlet-api.jar
  wsdl4j.jar

===War file===

Install: 

 /usr/local/myapps/deploy/myapp.war

===Hosts===

For each set of applications, here in sets of 10, create these files and directory structures. See the next section for the contents of '''ROOT.xml''' files.

Notice that each application has its own host directory, e.g. '''myapp01.mydomain.com''', '''myapp02.mydomain.com''', '''myapp03.mydomain.com''', etc.


Place these under:

  /usr/local/myapps

Group01

  group01/catalina/conf/web.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/tomcat-users.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/context.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp01.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp02.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp03.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp04.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp05.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp06.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp07.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp08.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp09.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp10.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group01/catalina/conf/server.xml
  group01/catalina/logs/

Group02

  group02/catalina/conf/web.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/tomcat-users.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/context.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp11.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp12.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp13.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp14.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp15.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp16.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp17.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp18.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp19.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/Catalina/myapp20.mydomain.com/ROOT.xml
  group02/catalina/conf/server.xml
  group02/catalina/logs/

===ROOT.xml===

For each host/application, use this template, changing the &quot;myapp01&quot; string, wherever it occurs below, to match the host's name, e.g. '''myapp01, myapp02'''.

  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;Context path=&quot;/&quot; docBase=&quot;/usr/local/myapps/deploy/myapp.war&quot; reloadable=&quot;true&quot; antiJARLocking=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Environment name=&quot;wo/NSLog4jLoggerName&quot; value=&quot;myapp04&quot; type=&quot;java.lang.String&quot; override=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;Environment name=&quot;wo/myParameter&quot; value=&quot;myValue&quot; type=&quot;java.lang.String&quot; override=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/Context&gt;

The '''wo/NSLog4jLoggerName''' parameter is used for log4j logging, see below. Have it match the application's name.

Setup your own variables here as well for application specific configuration.

===server.xml===

For each group above, install host definitions as such, matching the previous naming scheme, into that group's '''server.xml'''. Here are the entries for '''group02''':

  &lt;Server port=&quot;8502&quot; shutdown=&quot;SHUTDOWN&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Service name=&quot;group02&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Connector port=&quot;8902&quot; enableLookups=&quot;false&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; protocol=&quot;AJP/1.3&quot; /&gt; 
      &lt;Engine name=&quot;Catalina&quot; defaultHost=&quot;myapp11.mydomain.com&quot;&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp11.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp12.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp13.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp14.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp15.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp16.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp17.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp18.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp19.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;Host name=&quot;myapp20.mydomain.com&quot; debug=&quot;0&quot; unpackWARs=&quot;false&quot; autoDeploy=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/Engine&gt;
    &lt;/Service&gt;
  &lt;/Server&gt;

*the '''Connector''' port must be unique for each '''Service''' used on a single physical machine, and must match up with the corresponding '''modjk''' worker port used in the Apache '''worker.properties''' configuration file, covered below.

NOTE: per application deployment files and classes can be found in the applications '''work''' directory, but need not be altered at any time by the administrator.

===Logging===

====Log4j debug mode====

Add this to your start of Tomcat to get explicit debug information from log4j. Log4j can be very frustrating, so this is key in debugging the steps it is taking:

  log4j.debug=true

See the below Tomcat startup command for details.

====Getting started====

Install the '''log4j''' properties file into Tomcat's common/clases directory:

  /usr/local/tomcat/common/classes/log4j.properties

If this location does not seem effective, try:

  /usr/local/myapps/group01/catalina/common/classes/log4j.properties

changing the path to the appropriate group for your application, e.g. from group01 to group02.

Commented lines can be uncommented, and the application's corresponding Tomcat server restarted, to output logging for a particular application. Here the example is for application named &quot;myapp01&quot;; this name is defined in the ROOT.xml file above by the '''wo/NSLog4jLoggerName''' parameter:

  #log4j.logger.myapp01=DEBUG, A2 
  #log4j.appender.A2=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender 
  #log4j.appender.A2.File=${catalina.base}/logs/myapp01.log 
  #log4j.appender.A2.MaxFileSize=100MB 
  #log4j.appender.A2.MaxBackupIndex=2 
  #log4j.appender.A2.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout 
  #log4j.appender.A2.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %c [%t] %r - %m%n
  #log4j.appender.A2.Threshold=DEBUG
  
  log4j.rootLogger=INFO, Tomcat
  log4j.appender.Tomcat=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
  log4j.appender.Tomcat.File=${catalina.base}/logs/tomcat.log
  log4j.appender.Tomcat.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout 
  log4j.appender.Tomcat.layout.ConversionPattern=%p %t %c - %m%n
  log4j.logger.myapp01=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp02=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp03=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp04=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp05=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp06=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp07=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp08=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp09=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp10=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp11=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp12=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp13=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp14=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp15=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp16=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp17=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp18=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp19=FATAL
  log4j.logger.myapp20=FATAL

Another method to view an application's logging information is, e.g, to comment the appropriate line and restart the server:

 #   log4j.logger.myapp16=FATAL

This will output logging information for the '''myapp16''' application to '''/usr/local/tomcat/logs/tomcat.log'''.

==Server Startup==

Start each server up separtely. Environmental variables may be exported beforehand, or passed like so on the command line, before the executable is called:

  JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xms256m -Xmx256m&quot; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06 CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group01/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
  JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xms256m -Xmx256m&quot; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06 CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group02/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
  JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xms256m -Xmx256m&quot; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06 CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group03/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
  JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xms256m -Xmx256m&quot; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06 CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group04/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
  JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xms256m -Xmx256m&quot; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06 CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group05/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh


Or start a Tomcat instance with log4j debugging on to determine what steps log4j is using in determining log settings and output:

  JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Dlog4j.debug=true -Xms256m -Xmx256m&quot; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06 CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group01/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

==Server Shutdown==

On Linux, this command will shutdown all java processes on the server, be careful:

  pkill java

or a particular process may be stipulated, e.g. 12203:

  pkill -P 10203

And sometimes Tomcat gets hung, be careful though, this will kill every single last java process on your system, no questions asked:

  pkill -9 java

This will also work, in this case for the '''group01''' server:

  CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/myapps/group01/catalina /usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh

==Apache==

===Core modjk Settings===

Add to httpd.conf

  JkLogFile &quot;/usr/local/tomcat/logs/mod_jk.log&quot;
  JkLogLevel info
  JkOptions +ForwardURICompat
  JkWorkersFile /etc/httpd/workers.properties

And add '''/etc/httpd/worker.properties''', containing:

  worker.list=worker01,worker02,worker03,worker04,worker05
  
  worker.worker01.type=ajp13
  worker.worker01.host=localhost
  worker.worker01.port=8901
  worker.worker02.type=ajp13
  worker.worker02.host=localhost
  worker.worker02.port=8902
  worker.worker03.type=ajp13
  worker.worker03.host=localhost
  worker.worker03.port=8903
  worker.worker04.type=ajp13
  worker.worker04.host=localhost
  worker.worker04.port=8904
  worker.worker05.type=ajp13
  worker.worker05.host=localhost
  worker.worker05.port=8905

===Virtual Hosts===

Each virtual host contains such an entry, with specifics modified appropriately, e.g. change '''myapp02''' to match your application's name:

  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
          ServerName myapp02.mydomain.com
          DocumentRoot &quot;/Library/WebServer/WebSites/myapp02&quot;
  
          JkMount  /WebObjects/* worker01
  
          &lt;Location &quot;/MyApp/WEB-INF/*&quot;&gt;
              AllowOverride None
              deny from all
          &lt;/Location&gt;
  
          &lt;Location &quot;/MyApp/META-INF/*&quot;&gt;
              AllowOverride None
              deny from all
          &lt;/Location&gt;
  
          &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
                  Include &quot;/etc/httpd/mods/mod_rewrite_tomcat.conf&quot;
                  RewriteRule     (.*)/cgi-bin/(.*)/___AppNamePlaceHolder___(\.woa(/.*)?)?        $1/$2/MyApp$3       [L,PT]
          &lt;/IfModule&gt;
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

===Rewrite Rules===

Assure that apache has been built and/or installed to use mod_rewrite.

Then install '''/etc/httpd/mod_rewrite.conf''':

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule     ^/WebObjects/.*$                        - [L,PT]
  
This is just an example, you will have to figure this out for yourself in detail. Or figure it out and update this wiki with universal rules.

===Testing===

Once the Tomcat servers are up and Apache running, hit a website:

  http://myapp04.mydomain.com

==Auto Deployment==

Touching the WAR file will redeploy all the applications. Replacing the WAR file with an updated version of your application, will auto deploy the new version systematically, one application per Tomcat server at a time. This can be followed by tailing '''/usr/local/tomcat/logs/tomcat.log'''.

Touching or updating of the ROOT.xml application files will reload/redeploy the application, and if any changes have been made, they will be picked up by the new deployment.

==Troubleshooting==

===Rewrite Debugging===

To get rewrite rule logging, add the following to the top of your rewrite fils:

  RewriteLog              /tmp/mod_rewrite.log
  RewriteLogLevel         9

Restart Apache and tail '''/tmp/mod_rewrite.log''' while hitting the website.

= Common Errors =

== javax.servlet.UnavailableException: Error initializing servlet adaptor: access denied ==

Waiting on more information.

==javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name jdbc is not bound in this Context==

See above comment. At present, not stopping the app from running fine. Looks like an unused entry in the web.xml file.

==javax.servlet.UnavailableException: Error initializing servlet adaptor: null==

Unknown, but probably just a result of a previous complete failure of the app to start.

==java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException==

Get rid of duplicate copy of jar file in the class path, most likely in /usr/local/tomcat/common/lib:

 Caused by: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
 Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException
 There is already a unique instance for Bundle named 'JavaXML'.

like so:

  mv /usr/local/tomcat/common/lib/JavaXML.jar /var/tmp

==javax.servlet.UnavailableException==

Unknown, misconfiguration.

  - Servlet  threw load() exception
  javax.servlet.UnavailableException: Can't find application bundle. 
  You can either define WOROOT, LOCALROOT and WOAINSTALLROOT as Java system properties 
  (e.g. in your application server's launch script as command line arguments) or in the application Deployment Descriptor file (web.xml).

Travel trailers are not cheap.  They can present a large investment both in terms of money, towing vehicles and fuel.  In addition, with gas prices high, there is a desire by many to own smaller vehicles.  So what does one do if you like to camp?

A teardrop trailer is a small lightweight camping trailer that can easily be towed behind any car.  Conceived more than 60 years ago, this trailer is designed for 2 people with storage and a kitchen galley under a rear hatch.  The nice thing is that it doesn't '''have''' to be configured this way.  Since you build it yourself you can create and install just about any option you want.  From extra bunk space to entertainment centers; its your trailer.  Have it your way.

This book will show you how simple building a teardrop trailer can be.  The focus will be upon a low cost design (&lt;$1500) but we will also introduce the reader to some of the other, more complex and more expensive ways of construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Before you start ==

This book is not a set of plans in the sense of &quot;paint by the numbers&quot;.  It will not give you any measured drawings or dimensions and will it will not provide any absolute way of doing things.   There are many ways to build a teardrop trailer, from simple to elaborate.  This book focuses on a simple trailer design which can be built for around $1500 or less.   Ideas for more elaborate construction will be presented; which you may or may not want to pursue. 


[[Image:Important-3.svg|15px|left]]
The reader is also expected to be familiar with the tools needed to build the trailer, including power tools.  Safety should be paramount when working on the project. Defend yourself against the unexpected.  Wear safety goggles and always know where your fingers are and where the path of the tool is.  Be aware that if you are holding on to a piece of material, a power tool can ''pull'' the material, along with your fingers, into the blade ''before'' you have time to let go.  Power tools can also ''grab'' the material and throw it or spin it.  Use pliers and pushsticks when necessary to control the material.  Safety is the responsibility of the reader.


[[Image:Important-3.svg|15px|left]]
The other safety responsibility the reader has is in the construction of the trailer itself.  You are building a trailer that will be pulled down a public roadway.  You don't want it to fall apart and injure you or occupants of another vehicle.  There are some common ideas and information out on the web which may or may not be safe.  This book will point out a few of them so '''you''' can decide.  For example, building a trailer without a steel frame (only a wood frame) is a risky thing to do and would probably be considered negligent in any court of law.    The main safety guideline is common sense and it is your responsibility to decide if you have common sense or not.


[[Image:Info icon.svg|40px|left]]
The structure of this book is to proceed through the steps of building a simple teardrop trailer.  Special notes and subsections along the way are included for more complex methods.  Reference pages for each chapter exist to list web resources that are directly related to obtaining the parts needed for construction. In this way the book itself will remain free of hyperlinks and maintain a book ''form''.

==Displaying Tibetan==

About the wikibooks function to make PDFs I know nothimg. I always use the font 'Tibetan Machine Unicode' because the built in ones like Ariel MS Unicode don't combine ligatures correctly. If I were you I would try just cutting and pasting the content of the homepage into a word processor and then making that document into a pdf. I have done that before and it has worked. [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]])

: If you can give me an email address I will send you some grammars. No particular grammar is very good. Better to read several and form your own opinion. Traditional descriptions must be used with some care, they rely a lot on Sanskrit and the Karakas, which are not quite the same as what we mean when tallking about case. [[User:Tibetologist|Tibetologist]] ([[User talk:Tibetologist|talk]]) 19:20, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

::If you get really desperate you can always resort to screen shots and saved TIFF's, EPS's or even .png/.jpg/gif files.

==Small writing in Tibetan==
This sort of thing is very normal. Sometimes these are corrections made by a second hand. (in which case they will be very short) Sometimes they are notes and commentary, e.g. in philosophical writings you often get identifications of cited sources in smaller writing. There is some Tibetan name for this, but I can't remember it, ends in -yig of course. Some people just transliterate this sort of thing in a smaller font, other people use xml like notation &lt;small writing&gt;&lt;/small writing&gt; or something like that.

== Done ==

Hi wikiwerks, I have deleted all revisions of the file, just upload the one you want. Let me know if you need any more help, or the administrator noticeboard is also a good place to look for help with things like that :). Regards.

== Are you sure? ==

Are you sure you want to delete all your work? Just because you're not going to finish it doesn't mean someone else won't - that's the whole point of wiki. Collaboration is the strength of the way we do things here. We're happy to keep the content unless you don't want us to. This is significantly more content than most of our texts, so it'd be a shame to lose it all. You can have it deleted, but I just wanted to double-check. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

:G'day, I've just listed this page on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#How To Build A Teardrop Trailer]], because I don't believe it should be deleted. Somebody else might want to finish it off, you never know! It might even be merged into another book.

      <comment>/* Dipping */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The tremolo bar was originally only found on Fender guitars, but now they are on many types of electric guitar. Unfortunately, it has an inappropriate name, because &quot;tremolo&quot; means a fast succession of two different tones. A more accurate but less common name is the '''vibrato bar''', and they are also known as '''whammy bars'''.

There are several different types of tremolo bars, details of which can be found in the [[Guitar/Anatomy of a Guitar|Anatomy of the Guitar]] section, but certain types can only perform certain techniques. Thus, you should make sure the tremolo bar you have can do what you want it to do, before you buy it.

In general, it is good to learn to hold the tremolo bar between your third and fourth fingers, so you can use the bar and hold a pick at the same time.

This section will provide a description of how to accomplish various techniques, but it will be up to the guitarist to discover how to perform them.

==Dive Bomb==
A Dive Bomb may be achieved by striking a natural harmonic then lowering the tone. An &quot;explosion&quot; may added by keeping the bar pressed down and flicking the low E string repeatedly.

Also, there is an alternative way to do a dive bomb, by flicking a string, dipping the bar down, tapping a harmonic, then manipulating the resulting note however you want. This technique is also known as a &quot;Squeal&quot;, or &quot;Dime Squeal&quot; named after Pantera guitarist, Dimebag Darrel.

==Dipping==

Dipping is a technique that allows you to make note changes a little more interesting. Before you change to a higher note, use the bar to quickly lower and then raise the pitch.

==Cat Purr==

With this technique, a pitch is held for a beat, and then raised up a tone. The lever is moved slowly, and once you reach the upper or lower tone, you immediately hold, and then reverse direction. This results in a sound that can sounds remarkably like a cat.

==Ruler Sound==

If you press the tremolo bar down, and then suddenly release it upwards and quickly alternate between high ups and down, it makes a snap-away sounds, like a ruler vibrating off the edge of a table. The principle behind this is similar to the cat purr.

==Windmill==

The &quot;windmill&quot; develops if you just keep turning the tremolo bar in a circle. Naturally, the tone moves up and down at a regular pace. However, this can sound very &quot;outer space&quot; and can easily be over done, and you should use this sparingly.

==String Choke==

If the strings are really slack, you can quickly whip the tremolo bar back up until it clicks, making a string choke. Sometimes overtones will remain, and you can get some interesting sounds and harmonies. However, these tend to disappear quickly as it is drowned out by the harmonics of the new string pitch.

      <comment>/* Simple Present tense */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The verb is the most important part of speech in Bengali sentences. The Bengali verb takes the form of a verb root followed by person, tense and aspect markers. There's no gender or number marker for the verb in Bengali, which makes learning the language easier.

'''Verb root + (Person+Tense+Aspect) Marker = Verb'''

So when we discuss verbs in Bengali, we usually discuss:
(a) whether the verb root undergoes any change in different grammatical conditions.
(b) what the person, tense and aspect markers are in different grammatical conditions.

Once you have mastered the knowledge of the above two issues, you have mastered the Bengali verb.

==Case study of the verb &quot;to eat&quot;==
Let's start with a simple example, taking the Bengali verb &quot;to eat&quot;. The root for this verb is &quot;kha&quot;. The following discussion of the verb is arranged according to tense. The person and aspect features are discussed within each tense.

There are three grammatical tenses in Bangla: Present, Past and Future. 

===Present tense===
In the present tense, there are three aspects: Simple, Perfect, and Continuous.

====Simple Present tense====
For the first person (singular or plural) in simple present tense, the verb is marked null for tense, null for aspect and marked &quot;i&quot; for person. So, the form of the verb &quot;to eat&quot; in first person will be:

kha + 0 + 0 + i = khai

Used in a sentence with the singular first person personal pronoun &quot;ami&quot; (I), it reads:

ami khai. (I eat.) (1st person, singular, simple present)

Similarly, in a sentence with the plural first person personal pronoun &quot;amra&quot; (We), it reads:

amra khai. (We eat.) (1st person, plural, simple present)

Note that the verb form is the same regardless of number. 

For the second and third persons in the simple present tense, the tense and aspect markers are again null, but the person markers are &quot;o&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, respectively. Therefore we have:

tumi khao. (You eat.) (2nd person, singular, simple present)
tomra khao. (You eat.) (2nd person, plural, simple present)

she khay. (He/She eats.) (3rd person, singular, simple present)
tara khay. (They eat.) (3rd person, plural, simple present)

===Past tense===
Similarly in the simple past, the verb conjugation doesn't change irrespective of the number

for first person its : verb+e+chchhilam (pronounce the 'chchh' as in Bachchhan)
for second person its: verb+e+chchhiley
for third person its: verb+e+chchhilo

Used in a sentence with the singular first person personal pronoun &quot;ami&quot; (I), it reads:

ami khae-chchhilam. (I ate.) (1st person, singular, simple past)

Similarly, in a sentence with the plural first person personal pronoun &quot;amra&quot; (We), it reads:

amra khaechchhilam. (We ate.) (1st person, plural, simple past)

Second person
tumi khaechchhiley. (You ate.) (2nd person, singular, simple past) tomra khaechchhiley. (You(all) ate.) (2nd person, plural, simple past)

she khaechchhilo. (He/She ate.) (3rd person, singular, simple past) tara khaechchhilo. (They ate.) (3rd person, plural, simple past)

===Future tense===

===Thank You For Updating Me===

I originally started a WikiBook back in 2004 while still in graduate school; now, many years later, I have decided to get back to work on it since I have a stable teaching position.  A lot has changed since 2004; thank you for the updates and tutorials.  Let me see if I can sign my name correctly at least, lol:

OK, I have that down, it seems.  One question if you have the time (I doubt you do, but I will ask anyway).  You say &quot;I watch discussion pages where I have recently left messages. Please reply in the same section to make the discussion easier to follow.&quot;  

My question is...same section as what?  Same section as in my user page or same section as in the textbook page?  I am sorry if that is a stupid question...

:Actually I copied that notice from somebody else's user page, but I understood it as meaning any replies should be as near as possible to my original comments. That could be on the discussion page of a book page or a user's talk page. The section is just the text under the heading for the discussion point, e.g. the &quot;Thank You For Updating Me&quot; section we are in at the moment. I have improved the wording of the notice now, hopefully to make it less ambiguous. Thanks for your comments.

== Please weigh in ==

Hi Recent Runes,

Last month I [[WB:RFP|nominated Adrignola]] to be a check user here on WB.  For that to happen, he needs 25 votes, and he has thus far garnered 24.  I would greatly appreciate it if you would weigh in on this. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 10:12, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

== Just Rollbacker? ==

Hi RR,

For the past couple of days I've been thinking you should be an admin here.  And then I saw that you requested Rollbacker rights, and I thought... why not admin rights instead?  I'd make the nomination if you like, but if you'd rather not, then I won't.  Think about it! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:33, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:Thanks for the compliment JWT, but actually it was Adrignola who proposed me on his own initiative. I'm not even sure what Rollbacker rights are anyway. Though I suppose if I had admin rights I could delete obviously junk new pages while I was patrolling Recent changes.

== Languages Project ==

Hey.  I've not been around for a couple of years but it seems like in my absence not much has happened to antyhing.  So I'm trying to get some kind of languages project going.  I'm mostly gonna have a go at sorting out the French book myself.  Saw your French for football book and thought you might be close to interested.

== Field Guide ==

Hi RR,

I know I'm late getting to this, but... I've been intending to move all the Field Guide pages so that they are named using binomial nomenclature.  I had started a field guide to birds as part of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]], but then decided that it really should be part of the FG's instead.  I meant to move them, but real life got in the way. I guess I should have gotten on the ball sooner (not that I'm exactly on the ball now).  

IMO, using binomial nomenclature will avoid a lot of problems.  There are many species with several regionally-specific names, and in some cases, a name used in one region is applied to a different species in another region.  What do you think? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:26, 12 October 2010 (UTC)

:I only renamed the page in order to have another page link in to it - I don't really have a particular view on the naming convention used. I guess the Latin names are more universal and technically correct, but probably you should use whatever convention would be best for the book's target audience.  [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:53, 12 October 2010 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:Featured_books/Nominations|Featured_books/Nominations]] odd edits==
The reason why I removed {{user|David L Davis}}'s comment was because the content in it was outdated.

However I have been editing the book more recently and chapters have now been written for all the topics.

::If pages have been correctly labelled as copyright violations then they should be deleted after 7 days if they are not fixed according to our policies. But administrators can reverse a deletion, so I think we should be able to agree a work-flow between us so that pages can be undeleted progressively as you find the time to fix them. e.g. You let us know which pages you think you can fix over the next 7 days and we provisionally undelete just those pages, while still tagging them as copyright violations. When one batch is fixed you could then request the next batch to work on.

== WCI 2011 Proposal :Accelerating Wikibooks. Help Needed! ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

You really must be bored by now ;-) I have a bot for adding book categories but even it would be bored after adding as many as you have! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:20, 20 March 2012 (UTC)
:Yes, it is rather boring - though sometimes I have spotted other problems which might otherwise have been missed; e.g. pages floating ouside the book structure they should be part of. There are also some odd pages like [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Observation]], which I don't quite understand. I suppose there must be some drawbacks or limitations to the bot, or you would be running it on a regular basis already. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:42, 20 March 2012 (UTC)
::There are a number of pages in that book that are odd, like self referencing redirects. The bot &quot;problem&quot; is that about 50% of the book's it identifies for edits have some other problem, much as you've probably seen. The other thing the bot does - adding a reference section where one is missing - also turns up lots of errors of unclosed ref tags. Still, it beats doing all the work by hand. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:54, 20 March 2012 (UTC)

Thanks, but it's not part of the book, it's a draft of an article for a local magazine, which will be deleted when it is sent to the editors. We just put it there as a collaborative place to edit, since it is based on a translation of the Introduction. It will disappear in time.

== [[Introduction to Philosophical Logic/Arguments#Sound Arguments]] ==

You presently have the most current revision of the Introduction to Philosophical Logic/Arguments page found [[Introduction_to_Philosophical_Logic/Arguments|here]].&lt;/br&gt;
I would like your input on what looks like a mistake:&lt;/br&gt;
Under the &quot;Sound Arguments&quot; section, a sound argument by definition must satisfy all of three conditions, one of which is that it must contain valid logic, and another it must have true premises.&lt;/br&gt;
Also under the &quot;Valid Arguments&quot; section a valid argument is an argument for which the following implication holds: true premises ⇒ true conclusion.&lt;/br&gt;
Then a sound argument which by definition must be valid, and which has true premises, must have a true conclusion.&lt;/br&gt;
Yet conflicting information follows with examples of &quot;sound&quot; arguments which have true premises and a false conclusion (e.g. &quot;Grass is green ... ⇒ Pigs can fly&quot;).&lt;/br&gt;
I believe this confusion follows from a faulty definition for an argument on the same page, that is, an argument must have premises, a conclusion and a turnstile.  I believe an argument should be defined as a set of statements of which there are premises, a conclusion and an ''inference'' (i.e. support for the conclusion based on the premises) - a turnstile being ''indicative only'' of an inference rather than definitive evidence of such.&lt;/br&gt;
Under such a definition, the set of statements asserting that pigs can fly is just such, but not an argument because it contains no inference.
I believe my position is justified based on the wiki page for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness soundness].&lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a similar recipe which came from OSU Magazine.  Everywhere I bring buckeyes or see them for sale people marvel at how nice these look, not lumpy and ugly like the recipe they use.

  3 cups creamy peanut butter
  1 cup butter (2 sticks), soft (room temperature)
  2 pounds powdered sugar
  2 teaspoons vanilla
  milk chocolate for dipping (not semi-sweet), about 2.5 to 3 of the 11.5 oz bags
  plus small amount crisco for thinning chocolate if desired
  baking sheet, wax paper, toothpick, double broiler

Mix first four by hand.  Use a large bowl (I use 8 qt.) for ease of mixing.  Also recommend mixing with one hand until powdered sugar is basically in butters then switch to two hands to get it creamy.  Roll into small balls in hands and place on wax paper on baking sheet.  Typically makes eighty to ninety.  Refrigerate to cool (important).  This helps the chocolate stop running when dipping.  Melt the chocolate in a double broiler.  A larger bottom pan allows the water temperature to be more easily controlled.  Use toothpick to stick into ball and dip into chocolate leaving some peanut butter exposed as in the classic buckeye shape.  Place back on wax paper to cool.  Refrigerate, or even better is freezing.</text>

      <comment>/* Mapping */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Mapping =
The first thing that you need to do to persist something in Java is define how it is to be persisted.  This is called the mapping process ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_impedance_mismatch details]).  There have been many different solutions to the mapping process over the years, including some object databases that didn't require you map anything but let you persist anything directly.  Object-relational mapping tools that would generate an object model for a data model that included the mapping and persistence logic in it.  ORM products that provided mapping tools to allow the mapping of an existing object model to an existing data model and stored this mapping meta-data in flat files, database tables, XML and finally annotations.

In JPA, mappings can either be stored through Java annotations, or in XML files.  One significant aspect of JPA is that only the minimal amount of mapping is required.  JPA implementations are required to provide defaults for almost all aspects of mapping an object.

The minimum requirement to mapping an object in JPA is to define which objects can be persisted.  This is done through either marking the class with the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Entity.html @Entity]&lt;/code&gt; annotation, or adding an &lt;code&gt;&lt;entity&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for the class in the persistence unit's ORM XML file.  Also the primary key, or unique identifier attribute(s) must be defined for the class.  This is done through marking one of the class' fields or properties (get method) with the &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; annotation, or adding an &lt;code&gt;&lt;id&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for the class' attribute in the [http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm_1_0.xsd ORM XML] file.

The JPA implementation will default all other mapping information, including defaulting the table name, column names for all defined fields or properties, cardinality and mapping of relationships, all SQL and persistence logic for accessing the objects.  Most JPA implementations also provide the option of generating the database tables at runtime, so very little work is required by the developer to rapidly develop a persistent JPA application.

=== Example object model ===
[[Image:Employee-model.PNG]]

=== Example data model ===
[[Image:Employee-schema.PNG]]

=== Example of a persistent entity mapping in annotations ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import javax.persistence.*;
...
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Address address;
    private List&lt;Phone&gt; phones;
    private Employee manager;
    private List&lt;Employee&gt; managedEmployees;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example of a persistent entity mapping in XML ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;entity-mappings version=&quot;1.0&quot;
        xmlns=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm&quot;
        xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
        xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm orm_1_0.xsd&quot;&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;The minimal mappings for a persistent entity in XML.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attributes&gt;
            &lt;id name=&quot;id&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/attributes&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/entity-mappings&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Access Type ==
JPA allows annotations to be placed on either the class field, or on the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method for the property.  This defines the &lt;i&gt;access type&lt;/i&gt; of the class, which is either &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PROPERTY&lt;/code&gt;.  Either all annotations must be on the fields, or all annotations on the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; methods, but not both (unless the &lt;code&gt;@AccessType&lt;/code&gt; annotation is used).  JPA does not define a default access type (oddly enough), so the default may depend on the JPA provider.  The default is assumed to occur based on where the &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; annotation is placed, if placed on a field, then the class is using &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt; access, if placed on a &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method, then the class is using &lt;code&gt;PROPERTY&lt;/code&gt; access.  The access type can also be defined through XML on the &lt;code&gt;&lt;entity&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.  The access type can be configured using the [https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/AccessType.html &lt;code&gt;@AccessType&lt;/code&gt;] annotation or &lt;code&gt;access-type&lt;/code&gt; XML attribute.

For &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt; access the class field value will be accessed directly to store and load the value from the database.  This is normally done either through reflection, or through generated byte code, but depends on the JPA provider and configuration.  The field can be &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; or any other access type.  &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt; is normally safer, as it avoids any unwanted side-affect code that may occur in the application &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; methods.

For &lt;code&gt;PROPERTY&lt;/code&gt; access the class &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; methods will be used to store and load the value from the database.  This is normally done either through reflection, or through generated byte code, but depends on the JPA provider and configuration.  &lt;code&gt;PROPERTY&lt;/code&gt; has the advantage of allowing the application to perform conversion of the database value when storing it in the object.  The user should be careful to not put any side-affects in the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; methods that could interfere with persistence.

JPA 2.0 allows the access type to also be set on a specific field or &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method.  This allows for the class to use one default access mechanism, but for one attribute to use a different access type.  This can be used for attributes that need to be converted through a set of database specific &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;, or allow a specific attribute to avoid side-affects in its &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; methods.  This is done through specifying the &lt;code&gt;@AccessType&lt;/code&gt; annotation or XML attribute on the mapped attribute.  You may also need to mark the field/property as &lt;code&gt;@Transient&lt;/code&gt; if it has a different attribute name than the mapped attribute.

JPA allows for a persistence unit default &lt;code&gt;&lt;access-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to be set in &lt;code&gt;persistence-unit-defaults&lt;/code&gt; or entity default in &lt;code&gt;entity-mappings&lt;/code&gt;.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Default to using &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt; access.  If weaving is enabled, and field access is used the fields are accessed directly using generated byte-code.  If not using weaving, or using property access, reflection is used.  EclipseLink also supports a third access type &lt;code&gt;VIRTUAL&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used from the ORM XML to map dynamic properties stored in a properties Map.

=== Access type example ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@Entity
@Access(AccessType.FIELD)
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    @Transient
    private Money salary;
    @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
    private Employee manager;

    @Access(AccessType.PROPERTY)
    private BigDecimal getBDSalary() {
        return this.salary.toNumber();
    }
    private void setBDSalary(BigDecimal salary) {
        this.salary = new Money(salary);
    }

    private Money getSalary() {
        return this.salary;
    }
    private void setSalary(Money salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Common Problems ==
==== &lt;i&gt;My annotations are ignored&lt;/i&gt; ====
:This typically occurs when you annotate both the fields and methods (properties) of the class.  You must choose either field or property access, and be consistent.  Also when annotating properties you must put the annotation on the get method, not the set method.  Also ensure that you have not defined the same mappings in XML, which may be overriding the annotations.  You may also have a classpath issue, such as having an old version of the class on the classpath. 

==== &lt;i&gt;Odd behavior&lt;/i&gt; ====
:There are many reasons that odd behavior can occur with persistence.  One common issue that can cause odd behavior is using property access and putting &lt;i&gt;side effects&lt;/i&gt; in your get or set methods.  For this reason it is generally recommended to use field access in mapping, i.e. putting your annotations on your variables not your get methods.

:For example consider:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public void setPhones(List&lt;Phone&gt; phones) {
  for (Phone phone : phones) {
    phone.setOwner(this);
  }
  this.phones = phones;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

:This may look innocent, but these side effects can have unexpected consequences.  For example if the relationship was &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; this would have the effect of always instantiating the collection when set from the database.  It could also have consequences with certain JPA implementations for persisting, merging and other operations, causing duplicate inserts, missed updates, or a corrupt object model.

:I have also seen simply incorrect property methods, such as a get method that always returns a new object, or a copy, or set methods that don't actually set the value.

:In general if you are going to use property access, ensure your property methods are free of side effects.  Perhaps even use different property methods than your application uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Our Simple Teardrop ==
For the simple teardrop we will discuss the trailer from Harbor Freight as it is the cheapest on the market and even cheaper with the store's periodic sales.  The Harbor Freight item number is 90154-7VGA.

The Harbor Freight trailer in particular is a 1175 pound capacity &quot;folding&quot; trailer.  It generally runs for about $250 on sale.  It has 12 inch 4 lug spoked wheels and leaf spring suspension.  The bed is 4 foot by 8 foot which is what the dimensions of the teardrop trailer will be.  The trailer comes in a box and you have to assemble it - which is a good thing since it will not be assembled exactly according to its plans.  The teardrop needs a non-folding trailer with the axle 40% of the distance from the  rear of the trailer bed to the front of the trailer bed.  The reason for making it non-folding is because the trailer will become a solid unit with the teardrop body.  The reason for moving the axle is 2 fold. First, there needs to be clearance for the side doors and second, the weight of a full galley and storage area in the back will be over the axle.  40% is not absolute.  You may want to change this based upon how much weight you plan to put on the front and rear of the trailer (via what you are going to build into the trailer).


[[Image:Teardrop siderail.jpg|thumb|Siderails with crossmember slipped inside to join together.]]To make the Harbor Freight folding 4x8 trailer a non-folding trailer, simply take the 2 crossmembers originally used in the middle (where the trailer folds) and place them '''inside''' the side members (which will be end-butted) to join the side members together.  All the steel frame parts are &quot;C&quot; channels and the cross members '''will''' slide right into the inside of the side member as they are dimensionally smaller.  Of course, there will now be an area in the middle of the frame will no cross members.  Some people make a wooden cross member for floor support but its really not necessary.

[[Image:Teardrop trailerframe.jpg|thumb|HF trailer frame in a non-folding configuration with axle mounted.]]
The other deviation from the normal assembly is moving the axle back from the center of the trailer bed to around 40% from the rear.  The good news is that the HF trailer has its leaf spring mounts on one piece of angle iron.  So you can just slide the axle anywhere you want. The bad news is that you will still have to drill new holes for mounting it.  You may be able to find one or two holes that line up with other holes in the frame rails to reduce the number of holes you have to drill.  I can tell you that having the axle 36 inches from the rear of the trailer will give you about 120 pound tongue weight fully loaded with camping gear stored '''behind''' the axle in the galley.  I would recommend mounting the axle a little farther forward than 36&quot;, however, if you want a tongue box and are going to have significant weighted gear laying on the bed while traveling.

Now would also be a good time to take a hacksaw and cut off the dolly caster mounts.  They are the 6 inch pieces of angle iron perpendicularly welded to the leaf spring mounts.  This is optional.

The other issue to consider is that the 2 crossmembers you used to join the side rails are now probably over-lapping the side rails where you want to drill so you'll have 2 layers of steel to drill through.  You may consider cutting one of the cross members in half and use the half pieces for joining the side rails. This may avoid the overlap.

In any case no one can really tell you how and where to drill the holes as it will be unique for your trailer.

The rest of the trailer frame assembles as per the directions. You don't need to install the fenders, fender mounts, tail lights or wiring yet.

[[Image:Bulbgraph.png|left]] One look ahead issue you should decide at this point is whether you want frame bolts sticking through the top of the frame.  The next step is making the wooden trailer bed.  If you have bolts sticking up on top of the rails, you will need to make reliefs in your wooden trailer bed.  The other option is to put all the frame bolts through the sides and bottom of the rails so that you have no interference on the top of the rails.

[[Image:Important-3.svg|10px|left]] There have been cases where the trailer hubs have been shipped with little bearing grease and/or metal filings in the grease.  Now would be a good time to remove the hubs, clean and repack the bearings for your own piece of mind.

== Other Trailer Options ==

=== Lowering the trailer  ===
Some builders of teardrops desire a more ''lowered'' look reminiscent of trailers build in the 40's and 50's.  In order to achieve this they will move the axle from its attachment points on the bottom of the leaf springs to '''on top of''' the leaf springs.  The axle is held on to the leaf springs with U bolts. 

[[Image:Important-3.svg|10px|left]] Axles may have a preset camber to them so it is important to keep the axle in the same orientation when it is re-mounted. In other words, the top of the axle should still be the top.

[[Image:Important-3.svg|10px|left]] This is also a safety issue as you are stressing the U bolts in a manner that was not intended. Suspension parts have been selected by the manufacturer based on loads and strengths for the given application.  Changing the application could cause a the part to fail (the U bolts in this case).

=== Classic custom teardrop trailer ===
[[Image:Info icon.svg|30px|left]]If you really want the classic teardrop trailer look then you really need to make or buy a trailer frame and use torsion axles. Torsion axles are simple to install with only four bolts, and are available in stock sizes from outlets such as Northen Tool and Tractor Supply, however these axles lightest load is 2000 pounds. If you are building your own Teardrop, you will probably end up wanting a custom size which is available for the same price, around $200. You can designate the width of you own trailer frame, the hub face to hub face distance you desire, and set the start angle for the trailing arm to your specification for a lower or higher stance, and de-rate the axle load to as you desire.

=== Warning ===
[[Image:Important-3.svg|10px|left]] One option you should '''never''' consider is to build a &quot;frameless&quot; trailer (i.e. wooden frame).  This is a dangerous practice luckily only attempted by a few (usually to be pulled only by antique cars that don't travel at highway speeds).  You are making a home-made trailer for the public roadways. You don't want any chance that your trailer will fall apart on the road and injure another person.

This page is going to serve as an outline for a generalized curriculum for an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering.

== Prerequisites ==

Students should have a basic understanding of differential calculus before starting. Students are expected to maintain a regular progression of mathematics concurrently with their engineering studies. 

== By Semester ==

This curriculum, presented by-semester, is designed for a 4 year degree program. In addition the courses here, many universities will also require several &quot;general education&quot; courses to be taken. Also, many courses here will benefit strongly from the inclusion of lab work, which will likely be counted as additional courses.

This curriculum attempts to build from simple foundations to very complicated subjects in a natural way. Subjects are spread out so each semester will have a good sampling of various different topics with minimal subject overlap. This curriculum will present many subjects without focusing too much on any one particular discipline. Students will be prepared for graduate studies in a wide variety of areas.

Many books here contain more then 1 semesters worth of information. It is up to the individual instructors to decide how much information to cover and to what depth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gender Differences in the Classroom==
Gender roles are the patterns of behaviors, attitudes, and expectations associated with a particular sex—with being either male or female. For clarity, psychologists sometimes distinguish '''gender differences,''' which are related to social roles, from '''sex differences,''' which are related only to physiology and anatomy. Using this terminology, gender matters more than sex when teaching (in spite of any jokes to the contrary!).

Although there are many exceptions, boys and girls do differ on average in ways that parallel conventional gender stereotypes and that affect how the sexes behave at school and in class. The differences have to do with physical behaviors, styles of social 
interaction, academic motivations, behaviors, and choices. They have a variety of sources—primarily parents, peers, and the media. Teachers are certainly not the primary cause of gender role differences, but sometimes teachers influence them by their responses to and choices made on behalf of students.

===Physical Differences in Gender Roles ===
Physically, boys tend to be more active than girls, and by the same token more restless if they have to sit for long periods. They are also more prone than girls to rely on physical aggression if they are frustrated (Espelage &amp; Swearer, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Espelage, D. &amp; Swearer, S. (2004). ''Bullying in American schools: A socio-ecological perspective on prevention and intervention.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;. Both tendencies are inconsistent with the usual demands of classroom life, of course, and make it a little more likely that school will be a difficult experience for boys, even for boys who never actually get in trouble for being restless or aggressive.

During the first two or three years of elementary school, gross motor skills develop at almost the same average rate for boys and girls. As a group, both sexes can run, jump, throw a ball, and the like with about equal ease, though there are of course wide significant differences among individuals of both sexes. Toward the end of elementary school, however, boys pull ahead of girls at these skills even though neither sex has begun yet to experience puberty. The most likely reason is that boys participate more actively in formal and informal sports because of expectations and support from 
parents, peers, and society (Braddock, Sokol-Katz, Greene, &amp; Basinger-Fleischman, 2005; Messner, Duncan, &amp; Cooky, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, J., Sokol-Katz, J., Greene, A., &amp; Basinger-Fleischman, L. (2005). Uneven playing fields: State variations in boys’ and girls’ access to and participation in high school interscholastic sports. ''Sociological Spectrum, 25''(2), 231-250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messner, M., Dunca, M., &amp; Cooky, C. (2003). Silence, sports bras, and wrestling porn. ''Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 27''(1), 38-51&lt;/ref&gt;. Puberty eventually adds to this advantage by making boys taller and stronger than girls, on average, and therefore more suited at least for sports that rely on height and strength.

In thinking about these differences, keep in mind that they refer to average trends and that there are numerous individual exceptions. Every teacher knows of individual boys who are not athletic, for example, or of particular girls who are especially restless in class. The individual differences mean, among other things, that it is hard to justify providing different levels of support or resources to boys than to girls for sports, athletics, or physical education. The differences also suggest, though, that individual students who contradict gender stereotypes about physical abilities may benefit from emotional support or affirmation from teachers, simply because they may be less likely than usual to get such affirmation from elsewhere.

===Social Differences in Gender Roles===
When relaxing socially, boys more often gravitate to large groups. Whether on the playground, in a school hallway, or on the street, boys’ social groups tend literally to fill up a lot of space, and often include significant amounts of roughhousing as well as 
organized and “semi-organized” competitive games or sports (Maccoby, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Maccoby, E. (2002). ''Gender and social exchange: A developmental perspective.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass&lt;/ref&gt;. Girls, for their part, are more likely to seek and maintain one or two close friends and to share more intimate information and feelings with these individuals. To the extent that these gender 
differences occur, they can make girls less visible or noticeable than boys, at least in leisure play situations where children or youth choose their companions freely. As with physical differences, however, keep in mind that differences in social interactions do not 
occur uniformly for all boys and girls. There are boys with close friends, contradicting the general trend, and girls who play primarily in large groups.

Differences in social interaction styles happen in the classroom as well. Boys, on average, are more likely to speak up during a class discussion—sometimes even if not called on, or even if they do not know as much about the topic as others in the class (Sadker, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Sadker, D. (2002). An educator’s primer on the gender wars. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 84''(3), 235-240&lt;/ref&gt;. When working on a project in a small co-ed group, furthermore they have a tendency to ignore girls’ comments and contributions to the group. In this respect co-ed student groups parallel interaction patterns in many parts of society, where men also have a tendency to ignore women’s comments and contributions (Tannen, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, D. (2001). ''You just don’t understand: Men and women in conversation.'' New York: Quill&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Academic and Cognitive Differences in the Genders===
On average, girls are more motivated than boys to perform well in school, at least during elementary school. By the time girls reach high school, however, some may try to down play their own academic ability in order make themselves more likeable by both sexes (Davies, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. (2005). Expressions of gender: An analysis of pupils’ gendered discourse styles in small group classroom discussions. ''Discourse and Society, 14''(2), 115-1&lt;/ref&gt;. Even if this occurs, though, it does not affect their grades: from kindergarten through twelfth grade, girls earn slightly higher average grades than boys (Freeman, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, D. (2004). ''Trends in educational equity of girls and women.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Department of Education, National Center for Educational Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;. This fact does not lead to similar achievement, however, because as youngsters move into high school, they tend to choose courses or subjects conventionally 
associated with their gender—math and science for boys, in particular, and literature and the arts for girls. By the end of high school, this difference in course selection makes a measurable difference in boys’ and girls’ academic performance in these subjects.

But again, consider my caution about stereotyping: there are individuals of both sexes whose behaviors and choices run counter to the group trends. Differences within each gender group generally are far larger than any differences between the groups. A good example is the “difference” in cognitive ability of boys and girls. Many studies have found none at all. A few others have found small differences, with boys slightly better at math and girls slightly better at reading and literature. Still other studies have found the 
differences not only to be small, but to be getting smaller in recent years than compared to earlier studies. Collectively the findings about cognitive abilities are virtually “non-findings,” and it is worth asking why gender differences have therefore been studied and discussed so much for so many years (Hyde, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, J. (2005). The gender similarities hypothesis. ''American Psychologist, 60''(6), 581-59&lt;/ref&gt;.
        
===How Teachers Influence Gender Roles===
Teachers often intend to interact with both sexes equally, and frequently succeed at doing so. Research has found, though, that they do sometimes respond to boys and girls differently, perhaps without realizing it. Three kinds of differences have been noticed. One is the overall amount of attention paid to each sex; the second is the visibility or “publicity” of conversations; and the third is the type of behavior that prompts teachers to support or criticize students.

====Attention Paid====
In general teachers interact with boys more often than with girls 
by a margin of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the grade level of the students and the personality of the teacher (Measor &amp; Sykes, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Measor, L. &amp; Sykes, P. (1992). Gender and schools. New York: Cassell.
Mehan, H. (1979). ''Learning lessons: social organization in the classroom.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. One possible reason for the difference is related to the greater assertiveness of boys that I already noted; if boys are speaking up 
more frequently in discussions or at other times, then a teacher may be “forced” to pay more attention to them. Another possibility is that some teachers may feel that boys are especially prone to getting into mischief, so they may interact with them more frequently to keep them focused on the task at hand (Erden &amp; Wolfgang, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Erden, F. &amp; Wolfgang, C. (2004). An exploration of the differences in teachers’ beliefs related to discipline when dealing with male and female students. ''Early Child Development and Care, 174''(1), 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;. Still another possibility is that boys, compared to girls, may interact in a wider variety of styles and 
situations, so there may simply be richer opportunities to interact with them. This last possibility is partially supported by another gender difference in classroom interaction, the amount of public versus private talk.

====Public Talk versus Private Talk====
Teachers have a tendency to talk to boys from a greater physical distance than when they talk to girls (Wilkinson &amp; Marrett, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, L. &amp; Marrett, C. (Eds.). (1985). ''Gender influences in classroom interaction.'' Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The 
difference may be both a cause and an effect of general gender expectations expressive nurturing is expected more often of girls and women, and a businesslike task orientation is expected more often of boys and men, particularly in mixed-sex groups (Basow &amp; 
Rubenfeld, 2003; Myaskovsky, Unikel, &amp; Dew, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Basow, S. &amp; Rubenfeld, K. (2003). “Troubles talk”: Effects of gender and gender-typing. ''Sex Roles, 48''(3/4), 183-188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myaskovsky, L, Unikel, E., &amp; Dew, M. (2005). Effects of gender diversity on 
performance and interpersonal behavior in small work groups. ''Sex Roles, 52''(9/10), 645-657&lt;/ref&gt;. Whatever the reason, the effect is 
to give interactions with boys more “publicity.” When two people converse with each other from across the classroom, many others can overhear them; when they are at each other’s elbows, though, few others can overhear.

====Distributing Praise and Criticism====
In spite of most teachers’ desire to be fair to all students, it turns out that they sometimes distribute praise and criticism differently to boys and girls. The differences are summarized in [[Table 4-2]]. The tendency is to praise boys more than girls for displaying knowledge correctly, but to criticize girls more than 
boys for displaying knowledge incorrectly (Delamont, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Delamont, S. (1996). ''Women’s place in education.'' Brookfield, MA: Avebury Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;. Another way of stating this difference is by what teachers tend to overlook: with boys, they tend to overlook wrong answers, but with girls, they tend to overlook right answers. The result (which is probably unintended) is a tendency to make boys’ knowledge seem more important and boys themselves more competent. A second result is the other side of this coin: a tendency to make girls’ knowledge less visible and girls themselves less competent.

Gender differences also occur in the realm of classroom behavior. Teachers tend to praise girls for “good” behavior, regardless of its relevance to content or to the lesson at hand, and tend to criticize boys for “bad” or inappropriate behavior (Golombok &amp; Fivush, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Golombok, S. &amp; Fivush, R. (1994). ''Gender development.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. This difference can also be stated in terms of what teachers overlook: with girls, they tend to overlook behavior that is not appropriate, but with boys they tend to overlook behavior that is appropriate. The net result in this case is to make girls’ seem more good than they may really be, and also to make their “goodness” seem more important than their academic competence. By the same token, the teacher’s patterns of 
response imply that boys are more “bad” than they may really be.

At first glance, the gender differences in interaction can seem discouraging and critical of teachers because they imply that teachers as a group are biased about gender. But this conclusion is too simplistic for a couple of reasons. One is that like all 
differences between groups, interaction patterns are trends, and as such they hide a lot of variation within them. The other is that the trends suggest what often tends in fact to happen, not what can in fact happen if a teacher consciously sets about to avoid interaction patterns like the ones I have described. Fortunately for us all, teaching does not need to be unthinking; we have choices that we can make, even during a busy class!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is This Book About? ==

This book is about electrical communications networks, including both analog, digital, and hybrid networks. We will look at both broadcast and bi-directional data networks. This book will focus attention on existing technology, and will not be concerned particularly with too much mathematical theory.

== What Will This Book Cover? == 

This book is an example-driven book. We will use examples of real world communication technologies and communication networks to teach and demonstrate some of the principals behind communication theory. We will discuss examples of communication networks, and introduce the various mathematical principals that those networks rely on.

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book is intended for an advanced undergraduate in electrical engineering or a related field.

== What are the Prerequisites? ==

The reader of this book should have a solid background knowledge of the subjects discussed in [[Signals and Systems]] and [[Communication Systems]]. The reader should also be familiar with [[Algebra]] and [[Calculus]], although they are not strictly required.

== What are Networks? ==

The idea of networking is an old one. A network can be defined as ''&quot;A collection of two or more  devices which are interconnected using common protocols to exchange data.&quot;''

=== &quot;A collection of two or more devices..&quot; ===

A network can be of practically any size. The only practical limitations are those imposed by the protocols which it implements. A small home based network may be comprised of simply 2 computers which share a common connection to the internet. A larger example would be a corporate network where every employee in each department of the corporation has their own workstation, which they use to access not only the internet, but also the servers deployed throughout the network, and the workstations of other employees.
Furthermore, a network device is not constrained to just a PC workstation. There are many devices which may be connected to a network, including routers, switches, bridges, access points, firewalls, and the like.

=== &quot;..which are interconnected using common protocols..&quot; ===

The fundamental requirement for two devices is to use the same protocol for exchanging information. This is no different than human communication, for instance. In this analogy, the language used can be considered the protocol. If I want to initiate communication with someone else, the fundamental requirement is that we both know how to speak the same language, regardless of what that language is. In the same way, in order for two devices to exchange information, they must be aware of a common set of rules or specifications to communicate with each other.
The primary purpose of a network is to exchange data. The devices connected to a network may have one (or more) of several roles in accomplishing that purpose. The most common would be your PC workstation or a server where data is originated and stored. Other devices, such as a router, help in getting that data from one point on a network to another.
In order to satisfy the requirements of a network, the original developers recognized the need for open standards so that any entity can contribute to, and use network technology. The [http://www.iso.org/ International Organization for Standards (ISO)] developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference 7-layer model which defines the standards for how networks operate.

      <comment>/* Spectrum of HD Radio */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Networks/Page}}

== HD Radio ==

In the United States, analog radio broadcasts has been operating for many years in two distinct service bands: AM and FM. AM signals were relatively low frequency, measured in Kilohertz, and used amplitude modulation. FM radio stations were higher frequencies, measured in megahertz, and used frequency modulation.

Recently, however, a new type of radio broadcast was introduced, a digital type known as '''High-Definition''' (HD) radio. 

== What is HD Radio? ==

== Spectrum of HD Radio ==

HD radio stations, because they are digital and therefore suffer fewer of the nonlinearity effects of analog modulation occupy a smaller bandwidth then traditional radio stations. To save space in the spectrum, HD radio stations are broadcast in the buffer regions between analog radio stations. Originally, these buffer regions were created because there was bleed-through between radio stations because of nonlinearities in the transmitters. Modern transmitters, in an effort to save energy, have mostly reduced these errors. Because of this, the buffer regions between stations are mostly unused and free from noise and interference. 

Existing radio receivers can detect these HD channels, but an addition of a digital demodulator and signal reader is necessary to read them.</text>

== Encoders/Decoders ==

Devices that take an input data sequence, and output a transmission code are called '''encoders'''. Devices that receive a coded transmission, and output the original data are called '''decoders'''. Encoders and decoders can vary widely depending on what particular specification they are designed to meet.

Codes are designed for various reasons. Some of the reasons for using a code are:
*'''Error Detection and Correction'''. The ability to find and correct errors that have been introduced by a noisy communication medium.
*'''Data Compression'''. Some coding techniques allow large data to be reduced in size for faster communication.
*'''Spectrum Spreading'''. Some codes allow a signal to be spread across many frequencies for many benefits, including resistance to jamming and interference, and allowing multiple users to send data simultaneously over the same frequency range.
*'''Encryption'''. Some codes can be used to obscure information from all except the intended recipient. 

This book cannot possibly cover all the topics associated with data compression, encryption, or long-distance communications. For that topics, the reader is referred instead to various other Wikibooks and other resources. This book will discuss data coding, but will not necessarily be able to discuss all the uses or implementations of those codes.

== Entropy ==

Let's say, hypothetically, that we have a particular code that contains bits that don't actually carry any information, but instead only serve to help out with the transmission. For instance, these could be start- and stop- bits to denote the beginning and end of an asynchronous transmission, CRC bits to provide error checking, or any number of different bits. These extra bits, then, are combined with the data bits to form a '''packet''' or a '''symbol'''. It is important to know what the average amount of information per symbol is, in a transmission system. We call this parameter '''entropy''', and is measured in &quot;bits per symbol&quot;. Note that this is not the same kind of entropy used in physics to describe energy dissipation. We will lable entropy with the variable H(S).

Let's say that our transmission alphabet contains K different symbols in the set S:

:&lt;math&gt;S = (S_0, S_1, S_2 ..., S_{K-1})&lt;/math&gt;

These different symbols can represent anything: bits, dibits, long sequences, etc. On a given transmission scheme, these different symbols will have different probabilities, Pk, depending on how likely each symbol is to be transmitted. We can define the entropy of our communication system with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;H(S) = \sum_{k = 0}^{K-1} P_k \log_2 \left(\frac{1}{Pk}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation, we can set some general bounds on H(S):

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; H(S) &lt; \log_2(K) &lt;/math&gt;

We can see that H(S) approaches the lower bound in a completely deterministic system, i.e. a system where the probability of a certain transmission is Pk = 1. We can also see that H(S) approaches the upper bound in the case when all the different symbols are equiprobable.

== Code Length ==

We have an encoder that is receiving data input, and is outputting a particular code. This output code, by virtue of containing extra, non-data bits, is longer than the input data sequence. We can define the average output code length, using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{L} = \sum_{k = 0}^{K-1} P_k L_k&lt;/math&gt;

Where Pk is the probability of outputting each different transmission code, and Lk is the length of each code. For instance, let's say that we have an alphabet with 2 symbols:

 S = {S0, S1}
 S0 = 101010, P0 = .5, L0 = 6
 S1 = 1100,   P1 = .5, L1 = 4

We can use the above equation to find the average code length: 5.

== Efficiency ==

The efficiency of a coding system is the ratio of the average information per symbol to the average code length. The maximum efficiency possible is 1, and can theoretically be obtained using a prefix code (discussed below).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differences in Cultural Expectations and Styles==
A '''culture''' is the system of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that constitute the distinctive way of life of a people. Although sometimes the term is also used to refer specifically to the artistic, intellectual and other “high-brow” aspects of life, I use it here more broadly to refer to everything that characterizes a way of life—baseball games as well as symphony concerts, and McDonald’s as well as expensive restaurants. In this broad sense culture is nearly synonymous with ethnicity, which refers to the common language, history, and future experienced by a group within society. Culture has elements that are obvious, like unique holidays or customs, but also features that are subtle or easy for outsiders to overlook, like beliefs about the nature of intelligence or about the proper way to tell a story. When a classroom draws students from many cultures or ethnic groups, therefore, the students bring to it considerable diversity. Teachers need to understand that diversity—understand how students’ habitual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors differ from each other, and especially how they differ from the teacher’s.

But this kind of understanding can get complicated. To organize the topic, therefore, I will discuss among aspects of cultural diversity according to how directly that relate to language differences compared to differences in other social and psychological features of culture. The distinction is convenient, but it is also a bit arbitrary because, as you will see, the features of a culture overlap and influence each other.

===Bilingualism: Language Differences in the Classroom===
Although monolingual speakers often do not realize it, the majority of children around the world are bilingual, meaning that they understand and use two languages (Meyers-Scotton, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Meyers-Sutton, C. (2005). ''Multiple voices: An introduction to bilingualism.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;. Even in the United States, which is a relatively monolingual society, more than 47 million people speak a language other than English at home, and about 10 million of these people were children or youth in public schools (United States Department of Commerce, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. (2003). ''American community survey.'' Washington, D.C.: Author&lt;/ref&gt;. The large majority of bilingual students (75%) are Hispanic, but the rest represent more than a hundred different language groups from around the world. In larger communities throughout the United States, it is therefore common for a single classroom to contain students from several language backgrounds at once.

In classrooms as in other social settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees. At one extreme are students who speak both English and another language fluently; at the other extreme are those who speak only limited versions of both languages. In between are students who speak their home (or heritage) language much better than English, as well as others who have partially lost their heritage language in the process of learning English (Tse, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Tse, L. (2001). Why don’t they learn English? New York: Teachers’ College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Commonly, too, a student may speak a language satisfactorily, but be challenged by reading or writing it—though even this pattern has individual exceptions. Whatever the case, each bilingual student poses unique challenges to teachers.

====Balanced or Fluent Bilingualism====
The student who speaks both languages fluently has a definite cognitive advantage. As you might suspect and as research has confirmed, a fully fluent bilingual student is in a better position than usual to express concepts or ideas in more than one way, and to be aware of doing so (Jimenez, et al. 1995; Francis, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jimenez, R., Garcia, G., &amp; Pearson. D. (1995). Three children, two languages, and strategic reading: Case studies in bilingual/monolingual reading. ''American Educational Research Journal, 32''(1), 67-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis, N. (2006). The development of secondary discourse ability and metalinguistic awareness in second language learners. ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 16,'' 37-47&lt;/ref&gt;. A question like “What if a dog were called a cat?” is less likely to confuse even a very young bilingual child. Nor will follow-up questions like “Could the ‘cat’ meow?” Such skill in reflecting on language is a form of metacognition, which I discussed in Chapter 2 and defined as using language as an object of thought. Metacognition can be helpful for a variety of academic purposes, such as writing stories and essays, or interpreting complex text materials.

====Unbalanced Bilingualism====
Unfortunately, the bilingualism of many students is “unbalanced” in the sense that they are either still learning English, or else they have lost some earlier ability to use their original, heritage language—or occasionally a bit of both. The first sort of student—sometimes called an English language learner (ELL) or limited English learner (LEL)--have received the greatest attention and concern from educators, since English is the dominant language of instruction and skill with it obviously helps prepare a student for life in American society. ELL students essentially present teachers with this dilemma: how to respect the original language and culture of the student while also helping the student to join more fully in the mainstream—i.e. English-speaking—culture? Programs to address this question have ranged from total immersion in English from a young age (the “sink or swim” approach) to phasing in English over a period of several years (sometimes called an additive approach to bilingual education). In general, evaluations of bilingual programs have favored the more additive approaches (Beykont, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Beykont, Z. (Ed.). (2002). ''The power of culture: Teaching across language difference.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Both languages are developed and supported, and students ideally become able to use either language permanently, though often for different situations or purposes. A student may end up using English in the classroom or at work, for example, but continue using Spanish at home or with friends, even though he or she is perfectly capable of speaking English with them.

====Language Loss====
What about the other kind of imbalance, in which a student is acquiring English but losing ability with the student’s home or heritage language? This sort of bilingualism is quite common in the United States and other nations with immigrant populations. Imagine this situation. First-generation immigrants arrive, and they soon learn just enough English to manage their work and daily needs, but continue using their original language at home with family and friends from their former country. Their children, however, experience strong expectations and pressure to learn and use English, and this circumstance dilutes the children’s experience with the heritage language. By the time the children become adults, they are likely to speak and write English better than their heritage language, and may even be unable or unwilling to use the heritage language with their own children (the grandchildren of the original immigrants).

This situation might not at first seem like a problem for which we, as teachers, need to take responsibility, since the children immigrants, as students, are acquiring the dominant language of instruction. In fact, however, things are not that simple. Research finds that language loss limits students’ ability to learn English as well or as quickly as they otherwise can do. Having a large vocabulary in a first language, for example, has been shown to save time in learning vocabulary in a second language (Hansen, Umeda &amp; McKinney, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L., Umeda, Y., &amp; McKinney, M. (2002). Savings in the relearning of second language vocabulary: The effects of time and proficiency. ''Language Learning, 52,'' 653-663.&lt;/ref&gt;. But students can only realize the savings if their first language is preserved. Preserving the first language is also important if a student has impaired skill in all languages and therefore needs intervention or help from a speech-language specialist. Research has found, in such cases, that the specialist can be more effective if the specialist speaks and uses the first language as well as English (Kohnert, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Kohnert, K., Yim, D., Nett, K., Kan, P., &amp; Duran, L. (2005). Intervention with linguistically diverse preschool children. ''Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools, 36,'' 251-263&lt;/ref&gt;. More generally, though also more indirectly, minimizing language loss helps all bilingual students’ education because preservation tends to enrich students’ and parents’ ability to communicate with each other. With two languages to work with, parents can stay “in the loop” better about their children’s educations and support the teacher’s work—for example, by assisting more effectively with homework (Ebert, 2005).

Note that in the early years of schooling, language loss can be minimized to some extent by the additive or parallel-track bilingual programs that I mentioned above. For a few years, though not forever, young students are encouraged to use both of their languages. In high school, in addition, some conventional foreign language classes—notably in Spanish—can be adjusted to include and support students who are already native speakers of the language alongside students who are learning it for the first time). But for heritage languages not normally offered as “foreign” languages in school, of course, this approach will not work. Such languages are especially at risk for being lost.

===Cultural Differences in Language Use===
Cultures and ethnic groups differ not only in languages, but also in how languages are used. Since some of the patterns differ from those typical of modern classrooms, they can create misunderstandings between teachers and students (Cazden, 2001; Rogers, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Cazden, C. (2001). ''Classroom discourse, 2nd edition.'' Portsmouth, NH: Heineman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, R., Malancharuvil-Berkes, E., Mosely, M., Hui, D., &amp; O’Garro, G. (2005). Critical discourse analysis in education: A review of the literature. ''Review of Educational Research, 75''(3), 365-416.&lt;/ref&gt;. Consider these examples:

*In some cultures, it is considered ''polite or even intelligent not to speak'' unless you have something truly important to say. “Chitchat,” or talk that simply affirms a personal tie between people, is considered immature or intrusive (Minami, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Minami, M. (2002). ''Culture-specific language styles: The development of oral narrative and literacy.'' Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;. In a classroom, this habit can make it easier for a child to learn not to interrupt others, but it can also make the child seem unfriendly.

*''Eye contact varies by culture.'' In many African American and Latin American communities, it is considered appropriate and respectful for a child not to look directly at an adult who is speaking to them (Torres-Guzman, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Torres-Guzman, M. (1998). Language culture, and literacy in Puerto Rican communities. In B. PPerez (Ed.), ''Sociocultural contexts of language and literacy.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. In classrooms, however, teachers often expect a lot of eye contact (as in “I want all eyes on me!”) and may be tempted to construe lack of eye contact as a sign of indifference or disrespect.

* ''Social distance varies by culture.'' In some cultures, it is common to stand relatively close when having a conversation; in others, it is more customary to stand relatively far apart (Beaulieu, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Beaulieu, C. (2004).  Intercultural study of personal space: A case study. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 34''(4), 794-805.&lt;/ref&gt;. Problems may happen a teacher and a student prefer different social distances. A student who expects a closer distance than does the teacher may seem overly familiar or intrusive, whereas one who expects a longer distance may seem overly formal or hesitant.

*''Wait time varies by culture.'' '''Wait time''' is the gap between the end of one person’s comment or question and the next person’s reply or answer. In some cultures wait time is relatively long—as long as three or four seconds (Tharp &amp; Gallimore, 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Tharp, R. &amp; Gallimore, R. (1989). ''Rousing minds to life.'' New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. In others it is a “negative” gap, meaning that it is acceptable, even expected, for a person to interrupt before the end of the previous comment. In classrooms the wait time is customarily about one second; after that, the teacher is likely to move on to another question or to another student. A student who habitually expects a wait time long than one second may seem hesitant, and not be given many chances to speak. A student who expects a “negative” wait time, on the other hand, may seem overeager or even rude.

*''In most non-Anglo cultures, questions are intended to gain information,'' and it is assumed that a person asking the question truly does not have the information requested (Rogoff, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B. (2003). ''The culture of human development.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In most classrooms, however, teachers regularly ask test questions, which are questions to which the teacher already knows the answer and that simply assess whether a student knows the answer as well (Macbeth, 2003). The question “How much is 2 + 2?” for example, is a test question. If the student is not aware of this purpose, he or she may become confused, or think that the teacher is surprisingly ignorant! Worse yet, the student may feel that the teacher is trying deliberately to shame the student by revealing the student’s ignorance or incompetence to others.

===Cultural Differences in Attitudes and Beliefs===
In addition to differences in language and in practices related to language, cultural groups differ in a variety of other attitudes and beliefs. Complete descriptions of the details of the differences have filled entire books of encyclopedias (see, for example, Birx, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Birx, H. J. (2005). ''Encyclopedia of human anthropology.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;. For teachers, however, the most important ones center on beliefs about identity, or the sense of self or of “who you are.” A number of other cultural beliefs and practices can be understood as resulting from how members of a culture think about personal identity.

In white, middle-class American culture, the self is usually thought of as unique and independent—a unitary, living source of decisions, choices, and actions that stands (or should eventually stand) by itself (Greenfield, et al., 2003; Rogoff, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, P., Keller, H., Fuligni, A., &amp; Maynard, A. (2003). Cultural pathways through universal development. ''Annual Review of Psychology, 54,'' 461-490.&lt;/ref&gt;. This view of the self is well entrenched in schools, as for example when students are expected to take responsibility for their own successes or failures and when they are tested and evaluated individually rather than as a group or team. As teachers, furthermore, most of us subscribe to the idea that all students are unique, even if we cannot implement this idea fully in teaching because of the constraints of large classes. Whatever the circumstances, teachers tend to believe in an independent self.
 
To a greater or lesser extent, however, the majority of non-white cultures and ethnic groups believe in something closer to an interdependent self, or a belief that it is your relationships and responsibilities, and not uniqueness and autonomy, that defines a person (Greenfield, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, P. (1994). Independence and interdependence as cultural scripts. In P. Greenfield &amp; R. Cocking (Eds.), ''Cross-cultural roots of minority child development,'' pp. 1-40. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cultures, the most worthy person is not the one is unusual or who stands out in a crowd. Such a person might actually be regarded as lonely or isolated. The worthy person is instead the one who gets along well with family and friends, and who meets obligations to them reliably and skillfully. At some level, of course, we all value interpersonal skill and to this extent think of ourselves as interdependent. The difference between individual and interdependent self is one of emphasis, with many non-white cultures emphasizing interdependence significantly more than white middle-class society in general and more than schools in particular.

There can be consequences of the difference in how the students respond to school. Here are some of the possibilities—though keep in mind that there are also differences among students as individuals, whatever their cultural background. I am talking about tendencies, not straightforward predictions.

*''Preference for activities that are cooperative'' rather than competitive:  Many activities in school are competitive, even when teachers try to de-emphasize the competition. Once past the first year or two of school, students often become attentive to who receives the highest marks on an assignment, for example, or who is the best athlete at various sports or whose contributions to class discussion the most verbal recognition from the teacher (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. &amp; Johnson, R. (1998). ''Learning together and alone: Cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning, 5th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. Suppose, in addition, that a teacher deliberately organizes important activities or assignments competitively (as in “Let’s see who finishes the math sheet first”). Classroom life can then become explicitly competitive, and the competitive atmosphere can interfere with cultivating supportive relationships among students or between students and the teacher (Cohen, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, E. (2004). ''Teaching cooperative learning: The challenge for teacher education.'' Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. For students who give priority to these relationships, competition can seem confusing at best and threatening at worst. What sort of sharing or help with answers, the student may ask, is truly legitimate? If the teacher answers this question more narrowly than does the student, then what the student views as cooperative sharing may be seen by the teacher as laziness, “freeloading”, or even cheating.

*''Avoidance of standing out publicly:''  Even when we, as teachers, avoid obvious forms of competition, we may still interact frequently with students one at a time while allowing or inviting many others to observe the conversation. An especially common pattern for such conversations is sometimes called the IRE cycle, an abbreviation for the teacher initiating, a student responding, and the teacher then evaluating the response (Mehan, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;Mehan, H. (1979). ''Learning lessons: social organization in the classroom.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. What is sometimes taken for granted is how often IRE cycles are witnessed publicly, and how much the publicity can be stressful or embarrassing for students who do not value standing out in a group but who do value belonging to the group. The embarrassment can be especially acute if they feel unsure about whether they have correct knowledge or skill to display. To keep such students from “clamming up” completely, therefore, teachers should consider limiting IRE cycles to times when they are truly productive. IRE conversations may often work best when talking with a student privately, or when confirming knowledge that the student is likely to be able to display competently already, or when “choral” speaking (responding together in unison) is appropriate.

*''Interpersonal time versus clock time:'' In order to function all schools rely on fairly precise units of time as measured on clocks. Teachers typically allot a fixed number of minutes to one lesson or class, another fixed number of minutes for the next, another for recess or lunch time, and so on. In more ways than one, therefore, being on time becomes especially valued in schools, as it is in many parts of society. Punctuality is not always conducive, however, to strong personal relationships, which develop best when individuals do not end joint activities unilaterally or arbitrarily, but allow activities to “finish themselves,” so to speak—to finish naturally. If personal relationships are a broad, important priority for a student, therefore, it may take effort and practice by the student to learn the extent to which schools and teachers expect punctuality. Punctuality includes the obvious, like showing up for school when school is actually scheduled to begin. But it also includes subtleties, like starting and finishing tasks when the teacher tells students to do so, or answering a question promptly at the time it is asked rather than sometime later when discussion has already moved on.

#Date handling example
#Finish and Document the DVD hire case study
#better organization and indexing of these examples using tagging to increase findability
#Document the Periodic table application  - needs re-thinking to get more generic but its a small example of using update (mostly done but for editing)
#implement and document the family history case - with timelines
#new section on design patterns



== Other To do items ==
#Explain doc() function as well as poorly implemented collection() function
#Show examples of querying multiple documents using string manipulation -- doc($string)-- see: http://www.advocatehope.org/tech-tidbits/xquery
#Explain how to store an xquery on the server a) in the database, b) in the filesystem

== Done list ==

#Content-Disposition to set the filename for saving  ( done in the table to csv example)
#Better Ajax example - zipcode is a bit slow (done as an Emp search)
#Page scraping as RSS feed  - done with the Yahoo weather ID decoder and feed

== Standards issues ==

=== file suffix ===
I stored the initial scripts with our default xql suffix but I see xq is used in these examples so I guess that's the suffix to use.

=== serialization ===
Should the exist:serialise option always be set in the example?  There's a problem of compatibility between eXist versions if we rely on the defaults since the media type has changed during 1.1.2dev.  Also one example (output plain text) requires a different serialization option, so I think for constancy we should include it in all scripts. - maybe not - default is xml.=I think we should only set serialize on special cases. Yes, especially if the results are not well-formed XML files

=== indexing ===
Use form of Category XQuery|subcategory to structure a better index

=== Default eXist module declarations ===
Should all exist modules be declared even though they are declared by default in eXist?

yes - declaration makes their use explicit

=== Functions with Type Definitions ===
Should all function parameters have type definitions for arguments and return - yes 

=== Use Source Element to wrap Source Code ===
We can now use the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; for source code (rather than pre).  We really need an &quot;xquery&quot; pretty printer. 

I will fix them as I go if that is OK --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 23:25, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

=== Common XQuery format ===

Common layout format to be agreed and documented. 

=== Use XQuery Comment ===
All examples should include documentation as comments 

   '''(: Explain the next line  :)'''

I'd prefer a literate programming approach where the code examples and the executable code are derived from a common source.  I personally find that heavy commenting interferes with reading the code - with generated pages you could switch the comments in or out as required. [[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] ([[User talk:ChrisWallace|talk]]) 07:02, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

=== declare variable / let style ===
I have tended to use let rather than declare variable. I believe there is a performance issue favouring let, presumably because these are local to the FLWOR context rather than global, and I am not sure that the declaration of a long list of global variables is a good idea. However the former style seems to be prefered by some programmers and I'm not sure which is the best style for these examples.  One guideline might be that declare variable should be restricted to variables which are global to a module of functions, so they warn of global variables.  This meaning is lost if all variables are declared.


[[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] ([[User talk:ChrisWallace|talk]]) 21:40, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

=== Example Template ===
Should we move these to an example template for coding style?

== Additional Ideas for XQuery ==
Look at XQuery as the query language for the Web (What I call the Theory of the Web as One Big Database: see http://www.advocatehope.org/tech-tidbits/theory-of-the-web-as-one-big-database ). Essentially based on ReST (or ReSTful Web services), XQuery becomes an integral part of how the web functions. Much like AJAX and JSON, there should be an acronym that encompasses the Web, XQuery, XPath and ReSTful Web Services to help convey a new way of thinking about the web. In this way, XQuery is viewed as a prerequisite for understanding how the Web works, rather than an esoteric standard which it is now often viewed.

=== Detailed basics ===
I think a lot could be elaborated on for basic cases like simple joining, grouping, sorting, and aggregating. Node positions can cause a lot of confusion, an explanation of document order, the unordered{} expression / declaration and use of the &quot;at&quot; keyword in a for loop may be of value.

Some more advanced topics could be the union, intersect, and except expressions.

== Release 1.3dev issues ==
* RDF/xml2rdf failing with 
  err:XPTY0004 in function 'fr:expand'. Type error: expected type: xs:string; got: xdt:untypedAtomic [at line 79, column 27]
  In call to function:	fr:map-to-schema(element()) [27:10]

== Comments ==
I'm surprised to see the reference to the GMane mapping for the XQuery Talk mailing list, without mentioning the authoritative source for it: http://x-query.com/mailman/listinfo/talk (and http://markmail.org/search/list:com.x-query.talk for the archives).  I guess that should be changed (link to the mailing list, then add &quot;it is available on GMane too&quot;).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the discussion you mention an improvement to contains() but I wouldn't have used that in the first place here - simpler is 
   if ($stopwords/word = $word)

In general the stoplist would be in the database and then indexing would speed the search.  

I've written another version where the input is entered in a text box (stoplist_1.xq)

Also the links to the CSS didnt work - these could be added to the server.

      <comment>/* Order of topics */ fix another typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm thinking that maybe line integrals and integrals that concern the summing of a function in an area or volume ( ie, distinct from integrals that calculate an area or volume ) should be included under applications?

to illustrate, say a metal plate ( of arbitrary length and width, with its lower left corner on 0,0 )  is electrostatically charged with a distribution governed by P= x^2 + Y^2 . An area integral ( of the sort I am proposing be included ) could be used to sum the total charge present on the plate.

If agreement is reached I would be happy to write a brief explanation for the text.

:Line integrals should not be introduced until the multivariable part of the book.  It involves parametric representation and that comes after integration techniques so it should not go here.  And, they are already introduced in that portion of the book in a section that is way too long. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 03:26, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

== Order of topics ==

I changed the order of topics from
# [[Calculus/Indefinite integral|Indefinite integral]]
# [[Calculus/Definite integral|Definite integral]]
# [[Calculus/Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]
to 
# [[Calculus/Definite integral|Definite integral]]
# [[Calculus/Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]
# [[Calculus/Indefinite integral|Indefinite integral]]
I think the new order motivates the discussion of indefinite integrals better.  We start out with a practical problem, finding the area under a given function.  Then we introduce the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which tells us that we can use antiderivatives to easily compute definite integrals.  This gives us a reason to want to study how to find antiderivatives.  The remaining topics in the Integration section deal with how to find increasingly complex antiderivatives.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 17:20, 3 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

Please make sure you sign your messages on talk pages. To do this, add four tildes (~) to the end of your messages like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This will automatically add a signature with a time and date stamp.

I added a definition to Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.[[User:Murphyangus|Murphyangus]] 03:51, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

I added a part on species gradient but the title of this chapter does not correspond. If this does not work let me know. I went back to chapter 3 to see why my journal reference is showing in the paragraph. I can't find anything different than the last time I tried to site a website or journal. I will keep working on this.[[User:Murphyangus|Murphyangus]] 05:44, 9 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hi Chris - this is re the online resources section of the book.  I pruned some of these out then had to go do something else before I got a chance to give my rationale.

The problem with this sort of page is that the links need maintaining.  The ones to personal websites are particularly an issue.  A few days ago I look maybe a third to a half of this links off a similar page as they mostly gave 404s or similar.  Such areas a blogs will be particularly challenging to ensure they are up to date.  Maybe look at dmoz/google or whatever type pointers?  Equally I have removed the &quot;commercial links&quot; one as that really is an open invite for spammers to wander along a place links.

I hope at least some of this does make sense to you.  The book is good - that page worries me looking longer term?  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:48, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

Hi Herb

I'm using this as a resource for a workshop I'm running this weekend.  The idea of the workshop has broadened to explore the ways in which software people update their skills so this resource list is just a check list (with examples for the field I'm currently learning - the semantic web).  I would be grateful if you would let it run till my workshop is over, then we can see if any useful material comes out to work into a more generally useful book. 
I'm sorry if you think perhaps this is not a legitimate use of wikibooks - I deid ask on the technical discussion board and got no answer so I went ahead.

:Fair enough - I certainly won't edit it for now.  However bear in mind that Wikibooks is intended to provide &quot;stand alone&quot; content for readers as so external links to any real content are not good practice.  Equally specific links pages really are very inappropriate usually - there are far easier ways for people to find things via search engines &amp; they are very hard to maintain &amp; ensure they are up to date.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:23, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

==images==
Jared, a couple of notes about images.  1)  images need a caption explaining their relevance to the topic at hand.  2)  Can you make the image smaller.  The size can be modified.  Look at the code (under edit this page) for other images to see how to do this. If you have problems let me know.  Thanks. --[[User:PaulWLepp|PaulWLepp]] 16:55, 6 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Teardrop bed1.jpg|thumb|Using a ladder as a straight edge]]
[[Image:Bulbgraph.png|left]] At this point you need to make some decisions about how you are going to attach the walls to the trailer.  You need to make a choice because it will affect the width of the wooden bed you are about to make.

Just a brief aside: Keeping with the main theme of building a simple trailer we are going to be using 3/4 inch thick plywood sidewalls.  Another factor is that the Harbor Freight trailer frame is actually 48.25 inches wide.

=== A few options ===
Two of these are common and the last one is what the author did.

==== 1. Sidewalls sit on top of the trailer frame ====
If you decide to use this method then the Sidewalls sit directly on top of the trailer frame with the outside of the wall flush with the side rails.  This means that the wall thickness infringes on available interior width.  So for the 48.25&quot; wide trailer, you have only 46.25 inches of interior width.  On the plus side, you have the sidewalls fully vertically supported by the trailer frame.

==== 2. Sidewalls are bolted to the side of the trailer frame ====
In this configuration, the sidewalls are attached to the side of the trailer frame's side rails.  This provides a full 48.25 inch interior width.  On the downside, it will reduce the interior height by 4 inches and the sidewalls are only supported by the bolts through to the trailer and the glue attached to the trailer bed.  Also you'll have to create reliefs in the sidewalls for all the bolt heads on the side rail and have the wooden frame of the bed compensate for the .25 inch gap you'll have.

==== 3. Sidewalls are half sitting on the trailer frame ====
The problem with option 1 is that you can't use the existing holes in the trailer frame to bolt down the bed because the bed will be too narrow. The problem with option 2 is the lack of sidewall support and creating reliefs for side rail bolt heads.

Therefore the author opt'd for making the bed 47.25 inches wide. This allows 0.5 inches of sidewall support and is wide enough to finesse bolts through the bed into the existing holes in the trailer frame.

===Constructing the Bed===
[[Image:Teardrop bed2.jpg|thumb|right|Framed Wooden Trailer Bed]]
After the decision is made, the task is fairly simple.  Cut a 4x8 5/8&quot; thick sheet of plywood to the correct width and build a 2x2 pine frame to support it.  The 2x2s that go across for support should be placed to align with the trailer cross members. You can place extra cross member near the front half where your weight will be when inside the trailer. Use &quot;Polyurethane Glue&quot; to glue it all together. 

[[Image:Teardrop bed3.jpg|thumb|Wooden Trailer Bed with roofing tar applied.]]
Next you'll need to buy a gallon of Black Roof Coating (roofing tar) and coat the entire underside to protect the wood from the elements.  Do not coat the sides as you will be gluing them.   After it's dry you can flip it over onto the trailer, line and center it up and drill holes down into the existing trailer frame holes.  And finally bolt it down. Have washers on hand to space out any gaps between the cross members and the bed.

You should feel pretty good at this point.  You've completed the boring work on the trailer.  Next comes the fun part - putting up the side walls.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The easiest way to keep your thousand dollar guitar worth a thousand dollars is to take proper care of it. Guitars take a lot of abuse, especially if you play live shows and tour, and even if it pretty much &quot;sounds the same&quot;, you may one day discover a serious problem that makes the instrument unplayable. You don't need to carefully examine your guitar every day, but occasional check ups on the condition of your instrument are never a bad idea.

=Storage=

The easiest way to take care of your guitar is to store it properly. The more expensive the guitar, the better your storage should be. It is generally accepted that the air humidity should be neither too high nor too low, thus somewhere in the 45-55% range, and the temperature of the area should be about 65-75 °F. These two factors are the biggest threat to an instrument, because changes in moisture and temperature can cause permanent warping of the neck and other critical parts. For guitars made out of solid wood, it is advised to use a humidifier to prevent cracks and damage from weather change. 

On the other hand, guitars made out of multi-layered(plywood) wood, typically in budget guitars, can withstand relatively more humidity  and temperature changes. Keeping the guitar in a case away from direct sunlight can help with increasing the life of the guitar.


==Storing Environment==

The surest way to keep your guitar in good shape is to remember this simple rule: '''Do not expose the guitar to any climate conditions that you would not want to be exposed to.''' If you always keep this in mind, then your instrument will likely last years and years.

You should avoid large changes in humidity. Like your body, the guitar gets used to the climate it is in, and suddenly changing it causes stress. Humidity is the most dangerous thing that attacks an instrument, because when wood gets wet, the cell walls become softer and it is more easily bent. Often, the strings themselves are enough to bend the neck. Also, if the humidity stays way too low, then the wood will crack and the structure will weaken.

Temperature on its own is less damaging to the guitar. Wood is generally tolerant to changes in temperature, and for the most part it expands and contracts together. Extreme temperatures, however, can cause serious damage, especially when combined with extreme humidity. Changes in temperature also affects the strings, especially nylon strings, and going into a different environment will almost always automatically detune the strings. Other areas to watch for temperature related damage are any glued joins, like where the neck meets the body, or the fretboard is attached to the neck.

Never expose your instrument to extreme temperatures for a long time. For instance, leaving your guitar in a car in the summer all day, or leaving it outside for the whole night are sure ways to completely destroy your instrument. Also keep the guitar out of direct sunlight as much as possible, because it makes the wood more brittle and it can destroy the color of the instrument.

Keeping your instrument in tune is another good way to make sure that you don't harm your instrument. Strings put certain amounts of tension on the neck which can cause it to bow if the guitar isn't kept in tune. It is also a good idea to make sure that you have a full set of strings on the guitar.

==Methods of Storage==

First, a simple tip: If one is playing the guitar and wishes to put it briefly aside to look for songs or notes or the like, then the best repository is the couch, the bed, or the floor (with carpet or with the guitar bag as a cushion). The basic rule reads: What lies down, cannot fall down. A guitar gets most of its scrapes because one leans it against a wall, or against a table edge, and then it is knocked over from the slightest contact or draft of air. If one would have put it down, this would not have happened.

===Wall Hooks===

These are most often seen on the walls of guitar stores, where there are dozens of instruments to be displayed. These are good, because the guitar can be placed in an out of the way spot, like over a table or in a corner, and also be openly displayed. These are just a U-shaped piece of metal, covered in some sort of rubber or soft plastic.

The piece is screwed to the wall, and the headstock rests snugly between the two pieces of metal. In regards to plasterboard walls be sure to drill into the timber studs. The weight of the guitar will not damage itself, and nothing will break as a direct result of being stored in this way. Considering the stress put on the instrument by the strings, the additional impact of gravity would be minimal.

When you are selecting a spot to hang your guitar, you should not hang it on an outside wall. These are subject to more temperature changes, and in the long term can damage the instrument.

===Guitar Stands===

For the most part, guitar stands look similar to a wall hook, except instead of all the weight being on the headstock, most is on the bottom of the body and the neck is mostly supported to keep the guitar standing straight.

Each type of guitar has a specialized type of stand. For example, an Ovation guitar, which has a rounded plastic back, requires a differently shaped stand than a Fender Stratocaster or a regular acoustic guitar. Regardless of what type of stand you get, you should always make sure that it holds your guitar firmly. Some stands also have a locking device, which adds an extra level of security.

One problem you might encounter (although it is rare) is that the lacquer used on your guitar has a reaction with the rubber used to coat the stand. When you buy a new stand, you should examine the guitar every few days and look for discolorations or weak spots. As is often the case, serious guitar damage is easiest to stop before it starts.

===Cases===

[[Image:Les Paul in Case.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A Les Paul style guitar in a hard case]]

There are two main kinds of guitar case, gig bags and hard cases. Gig bags are a favorable kind of keeping, because they give a good amount of protection, and they are also light to carry. Some often have backpack style shoulder straps. Gig bags do not protect against temperature changes very well. Hard cases, in contrast, provide excellent protection against temperature, humidity and physical damage. Hard cases are also essential for taking a guitar on an air plane, or for long journeys.

Compared to other methods of storing, cases are by far the most secure, and this is especially true of hard cases. If the guitar is secured properly in the case (almost) nothing can happen to it.

The biggest (and perhaps only) disadvantage of a case is that you cannot openly display your instrument the way you can on a wall hook or stand. Price is also a disadvantage, because although gig bags can be bought relatively cheaply, hard cases are expensive. Still, a cheap bag for an expensive guitar is a poor investment. 

When you buy a case, you absolutely ''have to'' make sure that the guitar fits in the case. Gig bags are a little more forgiving, but you will not get a guitar to fit properly in a hard case that is too small. When you pick up the case, give it a little bit of a shake, and you should not feel or hear the guitar moving around very much.

=Maintenance=
==Body==

The body is likely the part of the guitar that takes the most abuse, simply because it is the &quot;biggest target&quot;.  To ensure that your instrument stays in like new condition you should always wipe down your guitar with a soft cloth after playing.  Never use furniture sprays.  You can buy specially treated cloths and sprays for guitars at almost any music store.  Dirt, sweat, and often small nicks and scrapes can just be cleaned up with a cloth, little bit of warm water and Murphy's Oil Soap which 
can be used to clean the whole guitar.  The strings should be wiped with just some warm water.  Remember you should wipe your guitar strings off every time you play your guitar.  The the oils and dirt that get left on your strings make them wear out a bit faster.  So if you make it a habit to wipe then down with each use they'll last you a bit longer.  You should use a soft cloth, a micro fiber works the best.  Otherwise you might risk scratching the instrument and making it worse.  Cleaning the frets: you should care for them just as the rest of the guitar.  But if necessary use some 0.001 steel wool to get the grime off next to the frets.  You can also gently go over the frets to take off any minor nicks that might be on them.  Remember take care of your investment and it will last you a lifetime.

If you have a stained or lacquered body, you can also give it some shine with a little bit of furniture polish. However, if you have a guitar with an untreated body, you have to be extremely careful with polish. For these types, it would be better to find some sort of cleaning oil or wax, since they help prevent hair-line cracks from developing. After cleaning, the body must be absolutely dry, because if the wood gets over-moistened, the tone of the guitar will begin to degrade.

==Neck and Fretboard==

The neck is probably the most important part of the guitar, especially if you want to play it for a long time. Unless the guitar is stored for extended periods of time, the tension of the strings will always be pulling against the neck and stretching it away from the body. If stored for a long period of time, strings should be loosened, to reduce the tension on the neck.  If the guitar gets moist, this neck warping happens even faster. Sometimes warping can be fixed by adjusting the truss rod, but this only prolongs the death of the instrument, and can't really fix the problem.

You can also oil or wax the fretboard, but you should first determine whether the fretboard is stained or painted, and use the appropriate protection. Always remember that using too much cleaner is always worse than using no cleaner at all, and always rub it in slowly.

Another drastic way to repair a warped neck on acoustic guitars is take all the strings off, and place a small glass of water into the body. Then, keep the body in place and put a small amount of weight (1 or 2 pounds) on the neck and let it bend back into the proper shape. When it has been corrected, remove the water, keep the weight on and let the guitar dry. Hopefully the neck will remain in the correct position, however it will be much more prone to warping from that point on. Since this procedure is somewhat accident prone, some manufacturers offer special instrument air moisturizers, which you can put in a case, or on a specific area of the neck. These generally allow for a higher rate of success.

The fretboard is usually made from untreated wood, and it should be cleaned regularly, before dirt begins to build up. Usually a good time to do this is when you change your strings, which should be every month or two. You need to clean the wood between the frets, and the simplest way is using a clean damp cloth or some very fine steel wool. Use some water with a little bit of detergent to make cleaning easier. If you use steel wool, you can also clean up the edges of worn frets, which is important because smooth frets improve the life of your strings. If the frets are really worn down, they can be replaced, but this is generally not a good project to undertake yourself.

It is very important that the neck is not wet after cleaning, because water damages the structure of the neck. Your cleaning cloth should be damp, not soaking wet. After cleaning, you can also apply a coat of furniture polish to seal the wood.

==Strings==

A set of strings wear down slowly, if you maintain them properly. Since regular playing does some amount of damage to the strings, it's a good idea to change regularly.  Full sets of strings should be replaced at the same time. If you only replace one string, the others are likely to break soon, the strings will have different tones, and the opened pack of strings will begin to corrode.  When changing a set of strings, some guitarists recommend replacing them one at a time, rather than removing all strings at once, to maintain tension on the neck (i.e., remove and replace the first string, then the second, then the third, etc.).

If you do not clean your strings, then they will quickly become dull, and even begin to rust. Dirty strings also damage the frets themselves, because the grime and rust makes the strings more coarse. There are many types of string cleaners, and for the most part, they are intended to be used after each playing session.

If you clean your strings on an irregular basis, you can just as easily use glass cleaner to release the sweat from the strings. It's easiest to soak a cloth in window cleaner, and then slip the cloth behind, and clean the whole length of each string individually. You can tell when a string is cleaned when you rub the string and the cloth is still clean. Also, you shouldn't let the cleaner remain on the strings, because residue might damage the string too. When finished, wipe the strings with a damp cloth.

==Tuning Mechanisms==

The tuning mechanisms are usually chromed, anodized or burnished steel. Since steel rusts, especially when it makes contact with sweat, these pieces should be cleaned every now and then to prevent unnecessary wear on your strings. Properly oiled mechanisms work smoothly, and they also help keep the strings in tune.

To prevent rust, you should clean and oil the parts regularly. You can use commercial machine oils, available cheap from any hardware store, but baby oil or vaseline does the trick too. It is always better to use too little than too much, and you can always add more, but you can't take it back off. Two drops is often enough. Avoid making contact with the wood parts of the guitar because the oil could stain or discolor. Electrical components (switches, sockets, potentiometers, etc.) can also go bad if the oil gets in them.

Many tuning machines have a screw in the knob that controls how easily they turn. The knobs should be snug, with no free play,  but they should not be so tight that they are difficult to turn. Care should be taken not to over-tighten, as they may strip, requiring repair or replacement. It should be mentioned that this adjustment affects the operation of the tuner, but not its ability to hold string tension.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to call a transform with a set of parameters.  You want to be able to set these parameters from a build file.

== Build File Target ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Learning Disabilities===
A '''learning disability''' (or '''LD''') is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes with a specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student’s academic performance significantly. An LD shows itself as a major discrepancy between a student’s ability and some feature of achievement: the student may be delayed in reading, writing, listening, speaking, or doing mathematics, but not in all of these at once. A learning problem is not considered a learning disability if it stems from physical, sensory, or motor handicaps, or from generalized intellectual impairment (or mental retardation). It is also not an LD if the learning problem really reflects the challenges of learning English as a second language. Genuine LDs are the learning problems left over after these other possibilities are accounted for or excluded. Typically a student with an LD has not been helped by teachers’ ordinary efforts to assist the student when he or she falls behind academically—though what counts as an “ordinary effort,” of course, differs among teachers, schools, and students. Most importantly, though, an LD relates to a fairly specific area of academic learning. A student may be able to read and compute well enough, for example, but not be able to write.

LDs are by far the most common form of special educational need, accounting for half of all students with special needs in the United States and anywhere from 5 to 20 percent of all students, depending on how the numbers are estimated (United States Department of Education, 2005; Ysseldyke &amp; Bielinski, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Education. (2005). ''27th Annual Report to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' Washington, D.C.: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ysseldyke, J. &amp; Bielinski, J. (2002). Effect of different methods of reporting and reclassification on trends in test scores for students with disabilities. ''Exceptional Children, 68''(2), 189-201.&lt;/ref&gt;. Students with LDs are so common, in fact, that most teachers regularly encounter at least one per class in any given school year, regardless of the grade level they teach.

==== Defining Learning Disabilities Clearly ====
With so many students defined as having learning disabilities, it is not surprising that the term itself becomes ambiguous in the truest sense of “having many meanings.” Specific features of LDs vary considerably. Any of the following students, for example, qualify as having a learning disability, assuming that they have no other disease, condition, or circumstance to account for their behavior:
* Albert, an eighth-grader, has trouble solving word problems that he reads, but can solve them easily if he hears them orally.
* Bill, also in eighth grade, has the reverse problem: he can solve word problems only when he can read them, not when he hears them.
* Carole, a fifth-grader, constantly makes errors when she reads textual material aloud, either leaving out words, adding words, or substituting her own words for the printed text.
* Emily, in seventh grade, has terrible handwriting; her letters vary in size and wobble all over the page, much like a first- or second-grader.
* Denny reads very slowly, even though he is in fourth grade. His comprehension suffers as a result, because he sometimes forgets what he read at the beginning of a sentence by the time he reaches the end.
* Garnet’s spelling would have to be called “inventive,” even though he has practiced conventionally correct spelling more than other students. Garnet is in sixth grade.
* Harmin, a night-grader, has particular trouble decoding individual words and letters if they are unfamiliar; he reads conceal as “concol” and alternate as “alfoonite.”
* Irma, a tenth-grader, adds multiple-digit numbers as if they were single-digit numbers stuck together: 42 + 59 equals 911 rather than 101, though 23 + 54 correctly equals 77. 

With so many expressions of LDs, it is not surprising that educators sometimes disagree about their nature and about the kind of help students need as a consequence. Such controversy may be inevitable because LDs by definition are learning problems with no obvious origin. There is good news, however, from this state of affairs, in that it opens the way to try a variety of solutions for helping students with learning disabilities.

==== Assisting Students with Learning Disabilities ====
There are various ways to assist students with learning disabilities, depending not only on the nature of the disability, of course, but also on the concepts or theory of learning guiding you. Take Irma, the girl mentioned above who adds two-digit numbers as if they were one-digit numbers. Stated more formally, Irma adds two-digit numbers without carrying digits forward from the ones column to the tens column, or from the tens to the hundreds column. [[Figure 5-2]] shows the effect that her strategy has on one of her homework papers. What is going on here and how could a teacher help Irma?
        
===== Behaviorism: Reinforcement for Wrong Strategies =====
One possible approach comes from the behaviorist theory discussed in Chapter 2. Irma may persist with the single-digit strategy because it has been reinforced a lot in the past. Maybe she was rewarded so much for adding single-digit numbers (3+5, 7+8, etc.) correctly that she generalized this skill to two-digit problems—in fact overgeneralized it. This explanation is plausible because she would still get many two-digit problems right, as you can confirm by looking at [[Figure 5-2.]] In behaviorist terms, her incorrect strategy would still be reinforced, but now only on a “partial schedule of reinforcement.” As I pointed out in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]], partial schedules are especially slow to extinguish, so Irma persist seemingly indefinitely with treating two-digit problems as if they were single-digit problems.

From the point of view of behaviorism, changing Irma’s behavior is tricky since the desired behavior (borrowing correctly) rarely happens and therefore cannot be reinforced very often. It might therefore help for the teacher to reward behaviors that compete directly with Irma’s inappropriate strategy. The teacher might reduce credit for simply finding the correct answer, for example, and increase credit for a student showing her work—including the work of carrying digits forward correctly. Or the teacher might make a point of discussing Irma’s math work with Irma frequently, so as to create more occasions when she can praise Irma for working problems correctly.

===== Metacognition and Responding Reflectively =====
Part of Irma’s problem may be that she is thoughtless about doing her math: the minute she sees numbers on a worksheet, she stuffs them into the first arithmetic procedure that comes to mind. Her learning style, that is, seems too impulsive and not reflective enough, in sense discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 4: Student Diversity|Chapter 4]]. Her style also suggests a failure of metacognition (remember that idea from [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development|Chapter 3]]?), which is her self-monitoring of her own thinking and its effectiveness. As a solution, the teacher could encourage Irma to think out loud when she completes two-digit problems—literally get her to “talk her way through” each problem. If participating in these conversations was sometimes impractical, the teacher might also arrange for a skilled classmate to take her place some of the time. Cooperation between Irma and the classmate might help the classmate as well, or even improve overall social relationships in the classroom.

===== Constructivism, Mentoring, and the Zone of Proximal Development =====
Perhaps Irma has in fact learned how to carry digits forward, but not learned the procedure well enough to use it reliably on her own; so she constantly falls back on the earlier, better-learned strategy of single-digit addition. In that case her problem can be seen in the constructivist terms, like those that I discussed in Chapter 2. In essence, Irma has lacked appropriate mentoring from someone more expert than herself, someone who can create a “zone of proximal development” in which she can display and consolidate her skills more successfully. She still needs mentoring or “assisted coaching” more than independent practice. The teacher can arrange some of this in much the way she encourages to be more reflective, either by working with Irma herself or by arranging for a classmate or even a parent volunteer to do so. In this case, however, whoever serves as mentor should not only listen, but also actively offer Irma help. The help has to be just enough to insure that Irma completes two-digit problems correctly—neither more nor less. Too much help may prevent Irma from taking responsibility for learning the new strategy, but too little may cause her to take the responsibility prematurely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder===
'''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''' (or '''ADHD''') is a problem with sustaining attention and controlling impulses. As students, almost all of us have these problems at one time or another, but a student with ADHD shows them much more frequently than usual, and often at home as well as at school. In the classroom, the student with ADHD may fidget and squirm a lot, or have trouble remaining seated, or continually get distracted and off task, or have trouble waiting for a turn, or blurt out answers and comments. The student may shift continually from one activity to another, or have trouble playing quietly, or talk excessively without listening to others. Or the student may misplace things and seem generally disorganized, or be inclined to try risky activities without enough thought to the consequences. Although the list of problem behaviors is obviously quite extensive, keep in mind that the student won’t do all of these things. It is just that over time, the student with ADHD is likely to several of them chronically or repeatedly, and in more than one setting (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, DSM-IV-TR'' (text revision). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the classroom , of course, the behaviors may annoy classmates and frustrate teachers.

====Differences in Perceptions: ADHD versus High Activity====
It’s important to note that classrooms are places that make heavy demands on not showing ADHD-like behaviors: students are often supposed to sit for long periods, avoid interrupting others, finish tasks after beginning them, and keep their minds (and materials) organized. Ironically, therefore, classroom life may sometimes aggravate ADHD without the teacher intending for it to do so. A student with only a mild or occasional tendency  to be restless, for example, may fit in well outdoors playing soccer, but feel unusually restless indoor during class. It also should not be surprising that teachers sometimes mistake a student who is merely rather active for a student with ADHD, since any tendency to be physically active may contribute to problems with classroom management. The tendency to “overdiagnose” is more likely for boys than for girls, presumably because gender role expectations cause teachers to be especially alert to high activity in boys.  Overdiagnosis is also especially likely for students who are culturally or linguistically non-Anglo (Chamberlain, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, S. (2005). Recognizing and responding to cultural differences in the education of culturally and linguistically diverse learners. ''Intervention in School and Clinic, 40''(4), 195-211.&lt;/ref&gt;, presumably because cultural and language differences may sometimes lead teachers to misinterpret students’ behavior. To avoid misapplying making such mistakes, it is important to keep in mind that in true ADHD, restlessness, activity, and distractibility are widespread and sustained. A student who shows such problems at school but never at home, for example, may not have ADHD; he may simply not be getting along with his teacher or classmates.

====Causes of ADHD====
Most psychologists and medical specialists agree that true ADHD, as opposed to “mere” intermittent distractibility or high activity, reflects a problem in how the nervous system functions, but they do not know the exact nature or causes of the problem (Rutter, 2004, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, M. (2004). Pathways of genetic influences in psychopathology. ''European Review, 12,'' 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, M. (2005). Multiple meanings of a developmental perspective on psychopathology. ''European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2''(3), 221-252. &lt;/ref&gt;. Research shows that ADHD tends to run in families, with children—especially boys—of parents who had ADHD somewhat more likely than usual to experience the condition themselves. The association does not necessarily mean, though, that ADHD is inborn or genetic. Why? Because it is possible that parents who formerly had ADHD may raise their children more strictly in an effort to prevent their own condition in their children; yet their strictness, ironically, may trigger a bit more tendency, rather than less, toward the restless distractibility characteristic of ADHD. On the other hand (or is it “on the third hand”?), the parents’ strictness may also be a result, as well as a cause of, a child’s restlessness. The bottom line for teachers: sorting out causes from effects is confusing, if not impossible, and in any case may not help much to determine actual teaching strategies to help the students learn more effectively.

====Teaching Students with ADHD====
Research also shows that ADHD can be reduced for many students if they take certain medications, of which the most common is methylphenidate, commonly known by the name Ritalin (Wilens, 2005; Olfson, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilens, T., McBurnett, K., Stein, M., Lerner, M., Spencer, T., &amp; Wolraich, M. (2005). ADHD treatment with once-daily methylphenidate. ''Journal of American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 44''(10), 1015-1023.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olfson, M., Gameroff, M., Marcus, S., &amp; Jensen, P. (2003). National trends in the treatment of ADHD. ''American Journal of Psychiatry, 160,'' 1071-1077.&lt;/ref&gt;. This drug and others like it act by stimulating the nervous system, which reduces symptoms by helping a student pay better attention to the choices he or she makes and to the impact of actions on others. Unfortunately the medications do not work on all students with ADHD, especially after they reach adolescence, and in any case has certain practical problems. Drugs cost money, for one thing, which is a problem for a family without much money to begin with, or for a family lacking medical insurance that pays for medications—a particularly common situation in the United States. For another thing, drugs must be taken regularly in order to be effective, including on weekends. Keeping a regular schedule can be difficult if parents’ own schedules are irregular or simply differ from the child’s, for example because of night shifts at work or because parents are separated and share custody of the child.

In any case, since teachers are not doctors and medications are not under teachers’ control, it may be more important simply to provide an environment where a student with ADHD can organize choices and actions easily and successfully. Clear rules and procedures, for example, can reduce the “noise” or chaotic quality in the child’s classroom life significantly. The rules and procedures can be generated jointly with the child; they do not have to be imposed arbitrarily, as if the student were incapable of thinking about them reasonably. Sometimes a classmate can be enlisted to model slower, more reflective styles of working, but in ways that do not imply undue criticism of the student with ADHD. The more reflective student can complete a set of math problems, for example, while explaining what he or she is thinking about while doing the work. Sometimes the teacher can help by making lists of tasks or of steps in long tasks. And it can help to divide focused work into small, short sessions rather than grouping it into single, longer sessions. Whatever the strategies that you use, they should be consistent, predictable, and generated by the student as much as possible. By having these qualities, the strategies can strengthen the student’s self-direction and ability to screen out the distractions of classroom life. The goal for teachers, in essence, is to build the student’s metacognitive capacity, while at the same time, of course, treating the student with respect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intellectual Disabilities==
An intellectual disability is a significant limitation in a student’s cognitive functioning and daily adaptive behaviors (Schalock &amp; Luckasson, 2004; American Association on Mental Retardation, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Schalock, R. &amp; Luckasson, R. (2004). American Association on Mental Retardation’s Definition, Classification, &amp; System of Supports, 10th edition. ''Journal of Policy and Practice in Intellectual Disabilities, 1''(3/4), 136-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Association on Mental Retardation. (2002). ''Definition, classification, and system of supports, 10th edition.'' Washington, D.C.: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;. The student may have limited language or impaired speech and may not perform well academically. Compared to students with learning disabilities discussed earlier, students with intellectual disabilities have impairments to learning that are broader and more significant. They score poorly on standardized tests of intelligence. Everyday tasks that most people take granted, like getting dressed or eating a meal, may be possible, but they may also take more time and effort than usual. Health and safety can sometimes be a concern (for example, knowing whether it is safe to cross a street). For older individuals, finding and keeping a job may require help from supportive others. The exact combination of challenges varies from one person to another, but it always (by definition) involves limitations in both intellectual and daily functioning.

As a teacher, you may hear more than one term for describing students with intellectual disabilities. If the disability is mild, teachers sometimes refer to a student with the disability simply as a slow learner, particularly if the student has no formal, special supports for the disability, such as a teaching assistant hired specifically to assist the student. If the disability is more marked, then the student is more likely to be referred to either as having an intellectual disability or as having mental retardation. In this chapter I primarily use the term intellectual disability, because it has fewer negative connotations while still describing one key educational aspect of the disability, cognitive impairment. Keep in mind, however, that actual intellectual disabilities are always more than cognitive: they also involve challenges about adapting to everyday living.

====Levels of Support for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities====
Intellectual disabilities happen in different degrees or amounts, though most often are relatively mild. Traditionally the intensity or “amount” of the disability was defined by scores on a standardized test of scholastic aptitude (or “IQ test”), with lower scores indicating more severe disability. (More about these tests in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-made Assessment Strategies|Chapter 10]].) Because of the insensitivity of such tests to individuals’ daily social functioning, however, current trends are toward defining intensities by the amount of support needed by the individual. [[Table 5-1]] summarizes the most commonly used scheme for this purpose, one created by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAMR, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;American Association on Mental Retardation. (2002). ''Definition, classification, and system of supports, 10th edition.'' Washington, D.C.: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;. Levels of support range from intermittent (just occasional or “as needed” for specific activities) to pervasive (continuous in all realms of living).
        
As a classroom teacher, the intellectual disabilities that you are most likely to see are the ones requiring the least support in your classroom. A student requiring only intermittent support may require special help with some learning activities or classroom routines, but not others; he or she might need help with reading or putting on winter clothes, for example, but primarily on occasions when there is pressure to do these things relatively quickly. Students requiring somewhat more support are likely to spend somewhat less time in your classroom and more time receiving special help from other professionals, such as a special education teacher, speech and language specialist, or an assistant to these professionals. These circumstances have distinct implications for ways of teaching these students.

====Teaching Students with Intellectual Disabilities====
There are many specific techniques that can help in teaching students with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities, but most can be summarized into three more general strategies. The first is to give more time and practice than usual; the second is to embed activities into the context of daily life or functioning where possible; and the third is to include the child both in social and in academic activities, rather than just one or the other. Let’s look briefly at each of these ideas.

=====Giving More Time and Practice Than Usual=====
If a student has only a mild intellectual disability, he or she can probably learn important fundamentals of the academic curriculum—basic arithmetic, for example, and basic reading. Because of the disability, though, the student may need more time or practice than most other students. He or she may be able to read many words by sight (day, night, morning, afternoon, etc.), but need longer than other students to recognize and say them. Or the student may know that 2 + 3 = 5, but need help applying this math fact to real objects; you (or a helper) might need to show the student that two pencils plus three pencils make five pencils.

Giving extra help takes time and perseverance, and can try the patience of the student (and of you, too). To deal with this problem, it may help to reward the student frequently for effort and successes with well-timed praise, especially if it is focused on specific, actual achievements; “You added that one correctly,” may be more helpful than “You’re a hard worker,” even if both comments are true. Giving appropriate praise is in turn easier if you set reasonable, “do-able” goals by breaking skills or tasks into steps that the student is likely to learn without becoming overly discouraged. At the same time, it is important not to insult the student with goals or activities that are too easy or by using curriculum materials clearly intended for children who are much younger. Setting expectations too low actually deprives a student with an intellectual disability of rightful opportunities to learn—a serious ethical and professional mistake (Bogdan, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, D. (2006). Who may be literate? Disability and resistance to the cultural denial of competence. ''American Educational Research Journal, 43''(2), 163-192&lt;/ref&gt;. In many curriculum areas, fortunately, there already exist materials that are simplified, yet also appropriate for older students (Snell, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M., Janney, R., Elliott, J., Beck, M., Colley, K., &amp; Burton, C. (2005). ''Collaborative teaming: Teachers’ guide to inclusive practices.'' Baltimore, MD: Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;.Special education teacher-specialists can often help in finding them and in devising effective ways of using them.

=====Adaptive and Functional Skills=====
Students with intellectual disabilities present especially clear examples of a university dilemma of teaching: since there is not enough time to teach everything, how do we choose what to teach? One basis for selecting activities is to relate learning goals to students’ everyday lives and activities, just as you would with all students. This strategy addresses the other defining feature of mental retardation, the student’s difficulties with adapting to and functioning in everyday living. In teaching addition and subtraction, for example, you can create examples about the purchasing of common familiar objects (e.g., food) and about the need to make or receive change for the purchases. Similar considerations apply to learning new reading or oral language vocabulary. Instead of simply learning words in a “basal reading” series (or reading textbook), try encouraging the student to learn words that are especially useful to the student’s own life. Often the student, not you yourself, is the best person to decide what these words actually are.

An adaptive, functional approach can help in nonacademic areas as well. In learning to read or “tell time” on a clock, for example, try focusing initially on telling the times important to the student, such as when he or she gets up in the morning or when schools starts. As you add additional times that are personally meaningful to the student, he or she works gradually toward full knowledge of how to read the hands on a clock. Even if the full knowledge proves slow to develop, however, the student will at least have learned the most useful clock knowledge first.

=====Include the Student Deliberately in Group Activities=====
The key word here is inclusion: the student should participate in and contribute to the life of the class as much as possible. This means that wherever possible, the student attends special events (assemblies, field days) with the class; that if the class plays a group game, then the student with the disability is part of the game; that if classmates do an assignment as a group, then if at all possible the student is assigned to one of the groups. The changes resulting from these inclusions are real, but can be positive for everyone. On the one hand, they foster acceptance and helpfulness toward the child with the disability; classmates learn that school is partly about providing opportunities for everyone, and not just about evaluating or comparing individuals’ skills. On the other hand, the changes caused by inclusion stimulate the student with the disability to learn as much as possible from classmates, socially and academically. Among other benefits, group activities can give the student chances to practice how to “belonging” skills—how to greet classmates appropriately, or when and how to ask the teacher a question. These are skills, I might add, that are beneficial for everyone to learn, disabled or not. (I discuss group work more thoroughly in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8,“Instructional Strategies.”]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Behavioral Disorders==
Behavioral disorders are a diverse group of conditions in which a student chronically performs highly inappropriate behaviors. A student with this condition might seek attention, for example, by acting out disruptively in class. Other students with the condition might behave aggressively, be distractible and overly active, seem anxious or withdrawn, or seem disconnected from everyday reality. As with learning disabilities, the sheer range of signs and symptoms defies concise description. But the problem behaviors do have several general features in common (Kauffman, 2005; Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, J. (2005). ''Characteristics of children with emotional and behavioral disorders, 8th edition.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Merrill Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallahan, D. &amp; Kauffman, J. (2006). ''Exceptional learners: Introduction to special education, 10th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* they tend to be extreme
* they persist for extended periods of time
* they tend to be socially unacceptable (e.g. unwanted sexual advances or vandalism against school property)
* they affect school work
* they have no other obvious explanation (e.g. a health problem or temporary disruption in the family)
The variety among behavioral disorders means that estimates of their frequency also tend to vary among states, cities, and provinces. It also means that in some cases, a student with a behavioral disorder may be classified as having a different condition, such as ADHD or a learning disability. In other cases, a behavioral problem shown in one school setting may seem serious enough to be labeled as a behavioral disorder, even though a similar problem occurring in another school may be perceived as serious, but not serious enough to deserve the label. In any case, available statistics suggest that only about 1-2 percent of students, or perhaps less, have true behavioral disorders—a figure that is only about one half or one third of the frequency for intellectual disabilities (Kauffman, 2005). Because of the potentially disruptive effects of behavioral disorders, however, students with this condition are of special concern to teachers. Just one student who is highly aggressive or disruptive can interfere with the functioning of an entire class, and challenge even the best teacher’s management skills and patience.
 
====Strategies for Teaching Students with Behavioral Disorders====
The most common challenges of teaching students with behavioral disorders have to do with classroom management—a topic discussed more thoroughly in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 7: Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|Chapter 7, &quot;Classroom Management and the Learning Environment&quot;.]] Three important ideas discussed there, however, also deserve special emphasis here: # identifying circumstances that trigger inappropriate behaviors, # teaching of interpersonal skills explicitly, and # disciplining a student fairly.

=====Identifying Circumstances That Trigger Inappropriate Behaviors=====
Dealing with a disruption is more effective if you can identify the specific circumstances or event that triggers it, rather than focusing on the personality of the student doing the disrupting. A wide variety of factors can trigger inappropriate behavior (Heineman, Dunlap, &amp; Kincaid, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Heineman, M., Dunlap, G., &amp; Kincaid, D. (2005). Positive support strategies for students with behavioral disorders in regular classrooms. ''Psychology in the Schools, 42''(8), 779-794.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* physiological effects—including illness, fatigue, hunger, or side-effects from medications;
* physical features of the classroom—such as the classroom being too warm or too cold, the chairs being exceptionally uncomfortable for sitting, or seating patterns that interfere with hearing or seeing;
* instructional choices or strategies that frustrate learning—including restricting students’ choices unduly, giving instructions that are unclear, choosing activities that are too difficult or too long, or preventing students from asking questions when they need help
By identifying the specific variables often associated with disruptive behaviors, it is easier to devise ways to prevent the behaviors, either by avoiding the triggers if this is possible, or by teaching the student alternative, but quite specific, ways of responding to the triggering circumstance.

=====Teaching Interpersonal Skills Explicitly=====
Because of their history and behavior, some students with behavior disorders have had little opportunity to learn appropriate social skills. Simple courtesies (like remembering to say please or thanks) may not be totally unknown, but may unpracticed and seem unimportant to the student, as might body language (like eye contact or sitting up to listen to a teacher rather than slouching and looking away). These skills can be taught in ways that do not make them part of punishment, make them seem “preachy,” or put a student to shame in front of classmates. Depending on the age or grade-level of the class, one way is by reading or assigning books and stories in which the characters model good social skills. Another is through games that require courteous language to succeed; one that I recall from my own school days, for example, was called “Mother, May I?” (Sullivan &amp; Strang, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A. K. &amp; Strang, H. R. (2002/2003). Bibliotherapy in the Classroom: Using Literature to Promote the Development of Emotional Intelligence. ''Childhood Education 79''(2), 74-80. &lt;/ref&gt;. Still another is through programs that link an older student or adult from the community as a partner to the student at risk for behavior problems; a prominent example of such a program in the United States is Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, which arranges for older individuals to act as mentors for younger boys or girls (Tierney, Grossman, &amp; Resch, 1995; Newburn &amp; Shiner, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Tierney, J., Grossman, J., &amp; Resch, N. (1995).  Making a difference: An impact study of big brothers big sisters. Philadelphia: Public/Private Ventures.
United States Department of Education. (2005). ''27th Annual Report to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' Washington, D.C.: Author.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newburn, T. &amp; Shiner, M. (2006). Young people, mentoring and social inclusion. ''Youth Justice, 6''(1), 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, strategies based on behaviorist theory have proved effective for many students, especially if the student needs opportunities simply to practice social skills that he has learned only recently and may still feel awkward or self-conscious in using (Algozzine &amp; Ysseldyke, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Algozzine, R. &amp; Ysseldyke, J. (2006). ''Teaching students with emotional disturbance: A practical guide for every teacher.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Several behaviorist techniques were discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]], including the use of positive reinforcement, extinction, generalization, and the like. In addition to these, teachers can arrange for contingency contracts, which are agreements between the teacher and a student about exactly what work the student will do, how it will be rewarded, and what the consequences will be if the agreement is not fulfilled (Wilkinson, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, L. (2003). Using behavioral consultation to reduce challenging behavior in the classroom. ''Psychology in the schools, 47''(3), 100-105.&lt;/ref&gt;. An advantage of all such behaviorist techniques is their precision and clarity: there is little room for misunderstanding about just what your expectations are as the teacher. The precision and clarity in turn makes it less tempting or necessary for you, as teacher, to become angry about infractions of rules or a student’s failure to fulfill contracts or agreements, since the consequences tend already to be relatively obvious and clear. “Keeping your cool” can be especially helpful when dealing with behavior that is by nature annoying or disrupting.

=====Fairness in Disciplining=====
Many strategies for helping a student with a behavior disorder may be spelled out in the student’s individual educational plan, such as discussed earlier in this chapter. The plan can (and indeed is supposed to) serve as a guide in devising daily activities and approaches with the student. Keep in mind, however, that since an IEP is akin to a legal agreement among a teacher, other professionals, a student and the student’s parents, departures from it should be made only cautiously and carefully, if ever. Although such departures may seem unlikely,  a student with a behavior disorder may sometimes be exasperating enough to make it tempting to use stronger or more sweeping punishments than usual (for example, isolating a student for extended times). In case you are tempted in this direction, remember that every IEP also guarantees the student and the student’s parents due process before an IEP can be changed. In practice this means consulting with everyone involved in the case—especially parents, other specialists, and the student himself—and reaching agreement before adopting new strategies that differ significantly from the past.

Instead of “increasing the volume” of punishments, a better approach is to keep careful records of the student’s behavior and of your own responses to it, documenting the reasonableness of your rules or responses to any major disruptions. By having the records, collaboration with parents and other professionals can be more productive and fair-minded, and increase others’ confidence in your judgments about what the student needs in order to fit in more comfortably with the class. In the long term, more effective collaboration leads both to better support and to more learning for the student (as well as to better support for you as teacher!).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a book about Computer Systems Engineering. A frequent occurrence in the design of computer systems is the challenge of building a system containing hardware and software components, possibly as part of a larger system.  The development of computer systems themselves falls within this scope as does the development of a vast array of devices such as digital cameras, hand-held computers, location aware systems, robots and other types of embedded systems, and even such applications as web sites on spacecraft.

In all of these cases decisions have to be made about how to design the system to have the maximum impact and effect.  Decisions have to be made about alternative approaches, trade-offs need to be addressed, and decisions on all the many facets of design must be justified through technical and economic insight and judgment.  Systems engineering is the discipline within which these matters are addressed in a carefully considered fashion.  

The IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the two principle computer related professional associations, include a computer systems engineering requirement in their model computer engineering body of knowledge described in [http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_ieeecs/ieeecs/education/cc2001/CCCE-FinalReport-2004Dec12-Final.pdf Computer Curriculum 2001].  This book addresses that requirement; the Table of Contents closely follows the coverage of material in the computer systems engineering body of knowledge.  It is intended primarily as a textbook for students in computer science and computer engineering, but it may also serve as a useful reference for professionals as they design and build computer based systems.  

The text assumes that students have a background including integral and differential calculus, basic probability, and are familiar with basic computer architecture.  A third-year student in computer science or computer engineering would typically have this background and this book would be appropriate for a computer systems engineering course at that level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Physical Disabilities and Sensory Impairments==
A few students have serious physical, medical or sensory challenges that interfere with their learning. Usually, the physical and medical challenges are medical conditions or diseases that requiring ongoing medical care. The sensory challenges are usually a loss either in hearing or in vision, or more rarely in both. Whatever the specific problem, it is serious enough to interfere with activities in regular classroom programs and to qualify the student for special educational services or programs.

Physical challenges that are this serious are relatively infrequent compared to some of the other special needs discussed in this chapter, though they are of course important in the lives of the students and their families, as well as important for teachers to accommodate. Only about one per cent of students have a hearing loss serious enough to be served by special programs for such students (United States Department of Education, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Education. (2005). ''27th Annual Report to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' Washington, D.C.: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;. Only about half that number have visual impairments the lead them to be served by special programs. For two reasons, though, these figures are a bit misleading. One reason is that many more students have vision or hearing problems that are too mild (such as wearing eyeglasses for “ordinary” nearsightedness). Another is that some students with serious sensory impairments may also have other disabilities and therefore not be counted in statistics about sensory impairments.

====Hearing Loss====
A child can acquire a hearing loss for a variety of reasons, ranging from disease early in childhood, to difficulties during childbirth, to reactions to toxic drugs. In the classroom, however, the cause of the loss is virtually irrelevant because it makes little difference in how to accommodate a student’s educational needs. More important than the cause of the loss is its extent. Students with only mild or moderate loss of hearing are sometimes called hearing impaired or hard of hearing; only those with nearly complete loss are called deaf. As with other sorts of disabilities, the milder the hearing loss, the more likely you are to encounter the student in a regular classroom, at least for part of the day.

=====Signs of Hearing Loss=====
Although determining whether a student has a hearing loss may seem straightforward (“Just give a hearing test!”), the assessment is often not clearcut if its takes the student’s daily experiences into account. A serious or profound hearing loss tends to be noticed relatively quickly and therefore often receive special help (or at least receives additional diagnosis) sooner. Mild or moderate hearing loss is much more common, however, and is more likely to be overlooked or mistaken for some other sort of learning problem (Sherer, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Sherer, M. (2004). ''Connecting to learn: Educational and assistive technology for people with disabilities.'' Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;. Students with a mild hearing loss sometimes have somewhat depressed (or lowered) language and literacy skills—though not always, and in any case so do some students without any loss. They may also seem not to listen or attend to a speaker because of trouble in locating the source of sounds—but then again, sometimes students without loss also fail to listen, though for entirely different reasons. Students with hearing loss may frequently give incorrect answers to questions—but so do certain other students with normal hearing. In addition, partial hearing loss can be hidden if the student teaches himself or herself to lip read, for example, or is careful in choosing which questions to answer in a class discussion. And so on. Systematic hearing tests given by medical or hearing specialists can resolve some of these ambiguities. But even they can give a misleading impression, since students’ true ability to manage in class depends on how well they combine cues and information from the entire context of classroom life.

In identifying a student who may have a hearing loss, therefore, teachers need to observe the student over an extended period of time and in as many situations as possible. In particular, look for a persistent combination of some of the following, but look for them over repeated or numerous occasions (Luckner &amp; Carter, 2001):
* delayed language or literacy skills, both written and oral
* some ability (usually partial) to read lips
* less worldly knowledge than usual because of lack of involvement with oral dialogue and/or delayed literacy
* occasionally, tendency to social isolation because of awkwardness in communication

=====Teaching Students with Hearing Loss=====
In principle, adjustments in teaching students with hearing loss are relatively easy to make though they do require deliberate actions or choices by the teacher and by fellow students. Interestingly, many of the strategies make good advice for teaching all students!
* Take advantage of the student’s residual hearing. Seat the student close to you if you are doing the talking, or close to key classmates if the students are in a workgroup. Keep competing noise, such as unnecessary talking or whispering, to a minimum (because such noise is especially distracting to someone with a hearing loss). Keep instructions concise and to-the-point. Ask the student occasionally whether he or she is understanding.
* Use visual cues liberally. Make charts and diagrams wherever appropriate to illustrate what you are saying. Look directly at the student when you are speaking to him or her (to facilitate lip reading). Gesture and point to key words or objects—but within reason, not excessively. Provide handouts or readings to review visually the points that you make orally.
* Include the student in the community of the classroom. Recruit one or more classmates to assist in “translating” oral comments that the student may have missed. If the student uses American Sign Language (ASL) at home or elsewhere, then learn a few basic, important signs of ASL yourself (“Hello,” “thank you,” “How are you?”). Teach them to classmates as well.

====Visual Impairment====
Students with visual impairments have difficulty seeing even with corrective lenses. Most commonly the difficulty has to do with refraction (the ability to focus), but some students may also experience a limited field of view (called tunnel vision) or be overly sensitive to light in general. As with hearing loss, labels for visual impairment depend somewhat on the extent and nature of the problem. Legal blindness means that the person has significant tunnel vision or else visual acuity (sharpness of vision) of 20/200 or less, which means that he or she must be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal eyesight can see at 200 feet. Low vision means that a person has some vision usable for reading, but often needs a special optical device such as a magnifying lens for doing so. As with hearing loss, the milder the impairment, the more likely that a student with a vision problem will spend some or even all the time in a regular class.

=====Signs of Visual Impairment=====
Students with visual impairments often show some of the same signs as students with simple, common nearsightedness. The students may rub their eyes a lot, for example, blink more than usual, or hold books very close to read them. They may complain of itchiness in their eyes, or of headaches, dizziness, or even nausea after doing a lot of close eye work. The difference between the students with visual impairment and those with “ordinary” nearsightedness is primarily a matter of degree: the ones with impairment show the signs more often and more obviously. If the impairment is serious enough or has roots in certain physical conditions or disease, they may also have additional symptoms, such as crossed eyes or swollen eyelids. As with hearing loss, the milder forms ironically can be the most subtle to observe and therefore the most prone to being overlooked at first. For classroom teachers, the best strategy may be to keep track of a student whose physical signs happen in combination with learning difficulties, and for whom the combination persists for many weeks.

=====Teaching Students with Visual Impairment=====
In general, advice for teaching students with mild or moderate visual impairment parallels the advice for teaching students with hearing loss, though with obvious differences because of the nature of the students’ disabilities.
* Take advantage of the student’s residual vision. If the student still has some useful vision, place him or her where he can easily see the most important parts of the classroom—whether that is you, the chalkboard, a video screen, or particular fellow students. Make sure that the classroom, or at least the student’s part of it, is well lit (because good lighting makes reading easier with low vision). Make sure that handouts, books and other reading materials have good, sharp contrast (also helpful with a visual impairment).
* Use non-visual information liberally. Remember not to expect a student with visual impairment to learn information that is by nature only visual, such as the layout of the classroom, the appearance of photographs in a textbook or of story lines in a video. Explain these to the student somehow. Use hands-on materials wherever they will work, such as maps printed in three-dimensional relief or with different textures. If the student knows how to read Braille (an alphabet for the blind using patterns of small bumps on a page), allow him to do so.
* Include the student in the community of the classroom. Make sure that the student is accepted as well as possible into the social life of the class. Recruit classmates to help explain visual material when necessary. Learn a bit of basic Braille and encourage classmates to do the same, even if none of you ever become as skilled with it as the student himself or herself.

== What are Networks? ==

Networks are large distributed systems designed to send information from one location to another. An '''end point''' is a place in a network where data transmission either originates or terminates. A '''node''' is a point in the network where data travels through without stopping. Nodes are connected by '''channels''', paths that data flows down. Channels can be physical linear objects such as a wire or a fiber optic cable, or it can be less tangible, like a wireless connection at a particular frequency.

== Providers and Consumers ==

An end point that produces information is known as a &quot;producer&quot; or a &quot;server&quot;. An endpoint that receives information is known as a &quot;consumer&quot; or a &quot;client&quot;. In many networks, such as bi-directional networks, an endpoint can be both a client and a server.

== Bi-directional Communications ==

Bi-directional communications means that data is flowing both to and from an end point. An end point can be both a client and a server. 

== point-to-point communication ==

Some channels are point-to-point -- they have only a single producer (at one end), and a single consumer (at the far end).

Many networks have &quot;full duplex&quot; communication between nodes, meaning they have 2 separate point-to-point channels (one in each direction) between the nodes (on separate wires or allocated to separate frequencies).

Some &quot;mesh&quot; networks are built from point-to-point channels. Since wiring every node to every other node is prohibitively expensive, when one node needs to communicate with a distant node, the &quot;intermediate&quot; nodes must pass through the information.

== Multiple Access ==

Multiple access networks are networks where multiple clients, multiple servers, or both are attempting to access the network simultaneously. Networks with one server and multiple clients are called &quot;broadcast networks&quot;, &quot;multicast networks&quot;, or &quot;SIMO networks&quot;. &quot;SIMO&quot; stands for &quot;Single Input Multiple Output&quot;. Networks with multiple clients and servers are known as &quot;MIMO&quot; or &quot;Multiple Input Multiple Output&quot; networks.

== Data Collisions ==

In a MIMO network, when multiple servers attempt to send data on a single channel at the same time, a '''data collision''' occurs. Because data typically consists of electric or electromagnetic radiation, a data collision causes both pieces of information to become unreadable. Clients on the network will either read meaningless data ('''garbage data''') or will read no data at all. MIMO networks therefore will use some sort of collision avoidance or collision detection mechanisms to prevent data collision problems from affecting the network.

Networks with only one fixed sender per channel (point-to-point channels and SIMO channels) never have data collisions on the channel.</text>

== Topologies ==

The shape of a network, and the relationship between the nodes in that network is known as the '''network topology'''. The network topology determines, in large part, what kinds of functions the network can perform, and what the quality of the communication will be between nodes. 

== Common Topologies ==

[[Image:NetworkTopologies.png|center]]

=== Star Topology ===

A star topology creates a network by arranging 2 or more host machines around a central hub. A variation of this topology, the 'star ring' topology, is in common use today.
The star topology is still regarded as one of the major network topologies of the networking world.
A star topology is typically used in a broadcast or SIMO network, where a single information source communicates directly with multiple clients. An example of this is a radio station, where a single antenna transmits data directly to many radios.

=== Tree Topology ===

A  tree topology is so named because it resembles a binary tree structure from computer science. The tree has a &quot;root&quot; node, which forms the base of the network. The root node then communicates with a number of smaller nodes, and those in turn communicate with an even greater number of smaller nodes. An example of a tree topology network is the DNS system. DNS root servers connect to DNS regional servers, which connect to local DNS servers which then connect with individual networks and computers. For your personal computer to talk to the root DNS server, it needs to send a request through the local DNS server, through the regional DNS server, and then to the root server.this is the best example for tree topology.

=== Ring Topology ===

A ring topology ( commonly known as a token ring topology) creates a network by arranging 2 or more hosts in a circle.  Data is passed between hosts through a 'token.'  This token moves rapidly at all times throughout the ring in one direction.  If a host desires to send data to another host, it will attach that data as well as a piece of data saying who the message is for to the token as it passes by.  The other host will then see that the token has a message for it by scanning for destination MAC addresses that match its own.  If the MAC addresses do match, the host will take the data and the message will be delivered.  A variation of this topology, the 'star ring' topology, is in common use today.

=== Mesh Network ===

'''Mesh topology''' - A mesh topology creates a network by ensuring that every host machine is connected to more than one other host machine on the local area network.  This topology's main purpose is for fault tolerance - as opposed to a bus topology, where the entire LAN will go down if one host fails.  In a mesh topology, as long as 2 machines with a working connection are still functioning, a LAN will still exist.

The mesh topology is still regarded as one of the major network topologies of the networking world.

=== Line Topology ===

'''Line topology''' - This rare topology works by connecting every host to the host located to the right of it.  Most networking professionals do not even regard this as an actual topology, as it is very expensive (due to its cabling requirements) and due to the fact that it is much more practical to connect the hosts on either end to form a ring topology, which is much cheaper and more efficient.

=== Tree Topology ===

''''''[[w:Tree topology|Tree topology]]'''''' - A tree topology, similar to a line topology in that it is extremely rare and is generally not regarded as one of the main network topologies, forms a network by arranging hosts in a hierarchal fashion.  A host that is a branch off from the main tree is called a 'leaf.'  This topology in this respect becomes very similar to a partial mesh topology - if a 'leaf' fails, its connection is isolated and the rest of the LAN can continue onwards.

=== Bus Topology ===

'''[[w:Bus topology|Bus topology]]''' - A bus topology creates a network by connecting 2 or more hosts to a length of coaxial backbone cabling.  In this topology, a terminator must be placed on the end of the backbone coaxial cabling - in Michael Meyer's Network+ textbook, he commonly compares a network to a series of pipes that water travels through.  Think of the data as water; in this respect, the terminator must be placed in order to prevent the water from flowing out of the network.

The bus topology is still regarded as one of the major network topologies of the networking world.

=== Hybrid Topologies ===


'''Hybrid topology''' -  A hybrid topology, which is what most networks implement today, uses a combination of multiple basic network topologies, usually by functioning as one topology logically while appearing as another physically.  The most common hybrid topologies include Star Bus, and Star Ring.

== Network Areas ==

Wireless networks do not have fixed topologies, so it doesn't make sense to talk about &quot;shape&quot; of these networks. Instead, other characteristics such as network size and node mobility are of primary importance.

Wireless networks and networking protocols can be divided up based on their intended range. Networks with smaller ranges have smaller power requirements and often have less noise to deal with. However, small networks are only able to communicate with small numbers of clients, compared with larger nodes. Increasing the number of clients in a network is often more useful, but more aggressive techniques need to be employed to prevent data collisions among multiple users in a large network. 

=== Network Size Designations ===

;Personal Area Network (PAN):Extremely small networks, often referred to as &quot;piconets&quot; that encompass an area around a single person. These networks, such as Bluetooth, have a range of only 1-5 meters, and tend to have very low power requirements, but also very low datarates. personal area network (PAN) - wireless PAN
;Local Area Network (LAN): LAN networks can encompass a building such as a house or an office, or a single floor in a multi-level building. Common LAN networks are IEEE 802.11x networks, such as 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n. local area network (LAN) - wireless LAN
;Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):These networks are designed to cover large municipal areas. Data protocols such as WiMAX (802.16) and Cellular 3G networks are MAN networks. metropolitan area network (MAN)
;Wide Area Network (WAN): Wide-Area Networks are very similar to MAN, and the two are often used interchangeably. WiMAX is also considered a WAN protocol. Television and Radio broadcasts are frequently also considered MAN and WAN systems. wide area network (WAN)
;Regional Area Network (RAN): Large regional area networks are used to communicate with nodes over very large areas. Examples of RAN are satellite broadcast media, and IEEE 802.22.
;Sensor Area Networks: These networks are low-datarate networks primarily used for embedded computer systems and wireless sensor systems. Protocols such as Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) and RFID fall into this category.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Networks/Page}}

== Signal Overlapping ==

Signals need to be separated in either time, space, or frequency to prevent multiple transmissions from overlapping and interferring with one another. FDMA and TDMA techniques attempt to separate transmissions into different frequency bands and time slices, respectively. These systems allow multiple users in a single area to communicate without data collisions.

However, networks can also be physically separated by space to prevent data collisions. In such cases, users can communicate at the same time on the same channel, so long as they are in different networks in different places.

Cellular networks are a method for breaking large networks into smaller groups called &quot;cells&quot;. Each cell has different frequency characteristics. This means that frequencies can be reused by non-adjacent cells without causing interference. 

=== Example: Cellular Phones ===

{{TextBox|1=
Cellular phones, or mobile phones, are a very common sight today. Cellular phones connect wirelessly to a local base station, which receives the phone signal and transmits it into the phone network. 

Roaming occurs when the mobile phone is moving from one cell to another. Cellular phones, in addition to transmitting voice data, also transmit and receive control data. The control data tells the phone how far it is from the base station. If a phone is moving from one cell to another, the distance from the new base station becomes smaller than the distance to the old base station. In this case, the new base station begins to handle the call and the old base station stops communicating with the phone.
}}

== Modeling Cells ==

Cells are typically modeled as regular hexagons.

[[Image:Frequency reuse.svg|center]]

In these hexagons, only three frequency bands are required to provide non-overlapping service to the entire network.

== Network Expansion ==

As the demand increases, there are multiple ways in which the capacity of the network can be expanded.

=== Sub-Cells ===

Sub-cell techniques involve dividing an existing hexagonal cell into 7 smaller sub-cells. Smaller cells means that smaller base stations can be used, less transmit power is required, and more frequencies can be reused in a smaller area. Additionally, giving an entire frequency range to a smaller geographical area means that more people can be serviced in that area, and data throughput for the entire network can be increased.

=== Sectoring ===

Sectoring is similar to the sub-cell concept, except that instead of breaking a cell into smaller cells, a cell is broken up radially into &quot;pie slices&quot; called sectors. Each sector in a cell can reuse frequency ranges. Cells can be broken into 3 sector (120&amp;deg; divisions) and 6 sector (60&amp;deg; divisions) architectures.

== Implementations ==

The reality of cellular networks is far different from the theoretical conception of them. In reality, base stations are not equidistant, and cells are not uniform size or shape. Because of the irregular size, shape, and placement of these cells, frequency orthogonality is more important, and networks often need to make use of many frequency ranges, instead of the theoretical minimum of three.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PROBABILITY REVIEW==

===1.0 BASICS===
An experiment, real or imagined, can be characterized by three properties. These are:

*1.		A set of outcomes
*2.		A grouping of these outcomes into classes
*3.		The relative frequency with which these classes occur.


For example, coin tossing is an experiment, the outcome of which is either heads or tails. One grouping of outcomes would be as heads (H) or tails (T). The relative frequency of heads would then be the number of heads in a large number of tosses:

 										(1)

If pairs of tosses are taken as the outcome of the experiment the set of outcomes would be HH, HT, TH and TT. These could be grouped into the three classes: 2 heads, 2 tails and 1 head and 1 tail. Assuming that the coin is fair the relative frequency of the class 1 head and 1 tail would be twice the other two.

In probability theory the “sample space”, denoted by S, corresponds to the set of outcomes, with each possible outcome being an element of S. An “event” corresponds to a class of outcomes and the “probability” is a measure of the relative frequency of the event. This can be interpreted as the fractional number of times the event occurs if the experiment is repeated many times:

 										(2)

Formally, the probability measure satisfies the properties:

 *1.    For any event A, 0≤P(A)≤1
 *2.	P(S) = 1
 *3.	If A and B are mutually exclusive events then P(A+B)=P(A)+P(B). (3)

A + B is the set of elements in the sample space that are included in either the event A or B or both. An event A can be described as

 	A = {ω: ω satisfies membership property for A}				(4)

where ω is a member of the sample space, ωєS. This is read: “A is the set ω such that ω satisfies membership property for A.” Similarly, introducing the set theoretic notation for the complement, union and intersection of events, let

 		A&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;	= {ω: ω not in A}
 		= complement of A
 
 	A + B	= {ω: ω in A or B or both}
 		= union of A and B*					(5)
 
 	A,B	= {ω: ω in both A and B}
 		= intersection of A and B*
 
 	Ø = S&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;	= null event = no sample points since all sample points are in S

*	In set theoretic notation both of the symbols “+” and “U” are used to denote the union of 2 sets. Similarly, the intersection is denoted by “,”, “∩”, “∙” or, sometimes by writing the symbols adjacent to each other. The symbols “+” and “∙” are suggestive of the arithmetic opera¬tions of addition and multiplication with which the set operations of union and intersection are analogous. However, they should not be confused. One applies to sets, the other to numbers.

These are illustrated using the Venn diagrams below. The points in the
square represent the sample space, S and those in an enclosed loop an event.

[[Image:Compsyseng00_01.jpg]] 

In I note that

 S = A + AC									(6)

and that points in AC and A are mutually exclusive. Hence using (3)

 P(S)= P(AC + A) 								(7)
     = P(AC)+P(A)

But P(S) = 1, hence

 	P(AC) = 1 - P(A)							(8)

In IV points in A and B are not mutually exclusive. In this case

 	 									(9)

The last term in (9) is necessary since both of the first 2 terms include the points in A,B but we only want to count these points once in A+B,


'''Conditional Probabilities'''

If the event B happens the “conditional probability” that A also happens, P(A|B), (read: “probabiljty of A given B”) is defined as
	
 										(10)

This gives the fraction of the points in B that are also in A. In effect, with knowledge of B we can create a new sample space containing only the points in B and then look for the relative frequency of the points in A that are in B,

[[Image:Compsyseng00_02.jpg]] 

A and B are said to be independent if

 	P(A,B)	= P(A) P(B)							(11)


Note that if A and B are independent then

 					 					(12)

implying that knowledge of B tells nothing about how often A occurs. As we noted in (5) and (6), A and AC cover S and are mutually exclusive:

 	A + AC = S								(13)
 	A, AC = Ø

Thus

 	B = B,A + B, AC								(14)


which simply states that every point in B is also in either A or AC. Then by (3)

 	P(B) 	= P(B,A + B, AC)						(15)
 		= P(B,A) + P(B, AC)

By (10)

 	P(B,A) = P(B|A) P(A)							(16)

and

 	P(B,AC) = P(B|AC) P(AC)							(17)

Hence

 	P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|AC) P(AC)					(18)

If the events Ai, i = 1,2…n are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e.

 	A1 + A2 +… An = S							(19)
 	Ai,Aj = Ø for all i ≠ j

then (15) and (18) can be written more generally as

 		 								(20)

and

 			 							(21)

This is the “law of total probability.” Another useful relation which follows from (10) is “Baye’s Law”:

 						 				(22)

However, by (18)

 	P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|AC)P(AC)					(23)

and thus

 						 				(24)

Thus if we know the probability of event A, P(A), and the effect of A on the probability of B, P(B|A), the effect of B on the probability of A, P(A|B), can be calculated.

'''An Example'''

Baye’s Law can have some nonintuitive consequences in component testing.

Suppose that we have a way of testing memory chips. If the chip is bad (B) the test indicates bad (T) 95% of the time:

 	P(T|B) = .95								(25)

If the chips is good (BC) the test indicates good (TC) 95% of the time

 	P(TC|BC) = .95								(26)

Also assume that 1% of the chips are bad:

 	P(B) = .01								(27)


What percent of the chips which test bad really are bad? i.e., What is P(B|T)? Applying (24) we have

 					 					(28)

By (8)

 	P(BC) = 1 – P(B) = .99
 	P(T| BC) = 1 – P(TC|BC) = .05	 					(29)

Thus
	
 					 					(30)

Also the probability that a chip which tests good, is good is
	
 						  				(31)

and by (8)

 	P(T&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;|B) = 1 - P(T|B) = .05					(32)

Thus

 					 					(33)

Thus almost all of the chips that test good, are good, but only 16% of the chips that test bad are really defective. The test is not as discriminating as we might wish.

'''Combinations and Permutations'''

N distinguishable objects can be ordered (permuted) in N! different ways. This is easily shown by observing that any of the N objects can be put in the first position; any the remaining n-1 objects in the second position; and so on until only 1 object can be put in the last position.

More generally, a set of r objects can be selected from the set of N objects in N(N—1) (N—2) ... (N—r+1) = N! / (N—r)! different ways. This is sampling without replacement. If r =N, there are N! sets and each set is simply an ordering of the N objects.

Once selected, the r objects in the set can be ordered in r! different ways without changing the composition of the set. Each ordering corresponds to another of the N! / (N—r)! samplings. Thus, if only the objects selected and not their order is important, there are

 
	 
different ways to select r objects from the set of N objects. This is called the combination of N objects taken r at a time and given the special notation
	
 

Note that for r = N,
	
 

and for r = 1,

 

The combination can also be thought of as the number of ways objects can be partitioned into groups of r objects and (N—r) objects respectively. This naturally leads to the extension that N objects can be Partitioned into k groups with ni objects in group i, i = 1,2,…k and N = Σn&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in

 

different ways.

===2.0 RANDOM VARIABLES===

A random variable is a variable whose value depends upon the outcome of the experiment. Thus a random variable is, in effect, a function assigning a numeric value to each event in the sample space, S. In practice the values assigned by the random variable to the events are chosen to have some physical meaning. For example, if we bet on the coin tossing experiment and win $l.00 for a head and lose $.50 for a tail the random variable X could be assigned the values
			
 			 							(34)
			
where ω is the outcome of the experiment.

Usually we are interested in the probability with which a random variable takes on a particular value:

 	P(X = x)								(35)

This is the sum of the relative frequency with which the members, ω, of the sample space for which X(ω) = x occurs. That is

 	P(X = x) = relative frequency for which X(ω) = x.			(36)

If the coin is fair (i.e. heads and tails are equally likely) in (34) then

 	P(X = 1) = 1/2
 	P(X = -.5) = 1/2							(37)

Another useful representation of a probability is the 'probability distribution function,'

 			 							(38)

This is also called the 'cumulative distribution function.' It is shown below for (34)

[[Image:Compsyseng00_03.jpg]]
 
Note that since each point in S is mapped by the random variable onto the real line

 	P ( X ≤ -∞ ) = 0
 	P ( X ≤ ∞ ) = 1
 	P ( X ≤ x ) ≥ 0, for all x on the real line				(39)

Also for two points a and b on the real line

 	P ( X ≤ b) – P (X ≤ a ) = P ( a &lt; X ≤ b ), for a &lt; b			(40)

and

 	P ( X ≤ b) ≥ P (X ≤ a ), for a ≤ b					(41)

The random variable used to describe the coin tossing experiment can take on only a finite number of values ( 2 in this case: +1 and -0.5 ). This is called a discrete random variable. The random variable used to describe other experiments (e.g. the time between when two things happen) may, more appropriately, have a continuous range of values. This ‘continuous random variable’ has a continuous distribution function which we denote by 
	
 	F ( x ) = P ( X ≤ x )							(42)


As in the discrete case, F(x) is a non-decreasing function, and

 	0 ≤ F(x) ≤ 1	, for all x.						(43)

A commonly encountered example of such a random variable is the exponentially distributed random variable

 			 							(44)

where λ &lt; 0. This is shown below

[[Image:Compsyseng00_04.jpg]]

For purposes of calculation, another function, the ‘probability density function,’ is often more convenient than the distribution function. Assuming that the derivative exists, this is defined as the derivative of the distribution function.

 										(45)

Since F(x) is non-decreasing, f(x) ≥ 0. Also by (45)

 		 								(46)

and

 	1 = F(∞) =								(47)

and

 	P ( a ≤ x ≤ b ) = F ( b ) – F ( a ) = 
 										(48)


Thus f ( x ) is a function which, when integrated over an interval, gives the probability that the random variable X lies in that interval.

Note that by (47) the area under the curve defined by f ( x ) is 1. Thus letting Δx be a small interval

 		f ( x ) Δx

is a rectangle of height f ( x ) and width Δx. Then f ( x ) Δx is approximately the amount of area under the curve of f ( x ) in the range of x to x + Δx

[[Image:Compsyseng00_05.jpg]]

In the limit as Δx goes to zero ( denoted by dx: lim Δx  0 Δx = dx ) this approximation becomes exact. Thus it is often useful to think of f ( x ) dx as being the probability that X ‘equals’ x:
	
 		f(x)dx = P(X ‘=’ x)						(49)

Strictly speaking it is the probability that X lies in a very small interval about the point x.

In modeling computer systems we are often interested in things such as the number of jobs in the system, waiting times and service requirements which can have only non-negative values. The random variables used to describe these quantities can have only non-negative values: 

 	F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = 0, for x &lt; 0						(50)

and this often makes the mathematics for dealing with them slightly simpler. In what follows we will assume that the random variables are non-negative but this can be easily extended to the more general case.

The exponentially distributed random variable (44) is a non-negative random variable. Its derivative is defined everywhere for x ≥ 0 as 

 	= λe-λx									(51)

'''Expected Value'''

Although the probability distribution function describes the composite behavior of a large number of experiments it is generally too complex to be useful for comparing the results of alternative experiments. What is needed is a single number, a ‘figure of merit,’ which represents the outcome of the experiment. This is provided by the ‘expected value,’ ‘average value,’ or ‘mean’ (the three terms are synonymous) of the random variable. If X is a random variable then the notations E(X) and 

are both used to represent its expected value. It is defined as the sum of the products of the value of the random variable and how often the experiment gives this result. For the discrete case this is

 		 								(52)

and in the continuous case

 			 							(53)	

In the important case where the random variable is integer valued, (52) becomes

 					 					(54)

Note that this can be rewritten as 

 								 		(55)

The sum of the terms in each column is kP(N = k), where k = 1, 2, … is the column. But the first row of (55) is simply the probability that N &gt; 0, the second row that N &gt; 1, and so on. Thus we can also write

 					 					(56)

Putting this in terms of the distribution function (38) we have 

 	P ( N &gt; k ) = 1 – P ( N ≤ k )						(57)

giving

 				 						(58)

Since the distribution function P ( N ≤ k ) can often be measured or estimated more easily than the density P ( N = k ), (58) gives a convenient way of calculating the average value of a random variable.

A similar result holds in the continuous case 

 			 							(59)

This is easily shown by integrating (59) by parts:

 								 		(60)

Recalling that F ( ∞ ) = 1 and that 

 					 					(61)

this reduces to

 					 					(62)

Since every random variable is associated with a number they can be operated on numerically (added, multiplied, etc.) and have arbitrary functions defined on them just like ordinary numbers. Let g(X) be a function defined on the random variable X. The definition of expected value (52, 53) can be extended to give the expected value of g(X): E(g(X))

 	E(g(X)) =  								(63)

if X is discrete or 

 	E(g(X)) =  								(64)

in the continuous case.

The expected value of the sum of two random variables X and Y is

 	E ( X + Y ) = 								(65)			 	

Using (16) we note that

 	P ( X=x, Y=y ) = P ( X=x / Y=y ) P ( Y=y )				(66)

and also

 	P (X=x, Y=y ) = P ( Y=y, X=x ) = P (Y=y / X=x ) P ( X=x )		(67)

Hence
	
 	E ( X + Y ) = 								(68)

Now

 				 						(69a)

and

 				 						(69b)

hence

 	E ( X+Y ) = E ( X ) + E ( Y )						(70)

Also, if X and Y are independent

 	E( X,Y ) =  								(71)

since X and Y are independent. Thus

 	E ( X,Y ) = 	=  E ( X ) E ( Y )					(72)

The results, ( 70 and 72 ), also apply when X and Y are continuous random variables.

Recall from (21) that

 	P (X=xi) = 								(73)

and by definition, (52)

 	E(X) = 									(74)

Hence

 	E (X) = 								(75)

By analogy with (52) the second sum in (75) is defined as the conditional expected value of X given Y=yj. This is usually written as E(X/Y):

 	E(X/Y) = E(X/ Y=yj) =  							(76)

Thus (75) is

 	E(X) =									(77)

but this is just the expected value of E(X/Y).

Hence

 	E(X) = E( E(X/Y) )							(78)

Again, this is also true if X is a continuous random variable.

'''Variance'''

As we noted earlier, the area under the density function is 1. If this “area” were cut out and placed on a pivot the expected value is the point at which it would balance.

[[Image:Compsyseng00_06.jpg]]

Because of this relation with mechanics the expected value is often called the first moment of the random variable.

A second figure of merit which is also useful in describing a random variable is its “second moment” defined as

 	E (X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) =  							(79)

for the discrete case and

 	E (X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) =  							(80)

for the continuous case. Note that it is the expected value of the square of the random variable.

Instead of using the second moment directly, we usually are more interested in finding the “second moment about the mean” or “second central moment.” For the discrete case this is
	 		
 								 		(81)

Recalling that the first sum is the second moment, (79), the second is the mean, (52), and the third by definition, (3), must be 1 this becomes

 				 						(82)

Similarly, for the continuous case
	 
 										(83)

The second central moment provides a measure of how closely the values of the random variable are grouped about the mean. For example, if the random variable can have only one value, α then

 	P(X=x) =	1 for x= α						(84)
 			0 for x≠ α

and

 				 						(85)

and

 				 						(86)

From which we see that, by (82),

 				 						(87)

For the exponentially distributed random variable mentioned earlier, (44, 51)

 								 		(88)

and

 					 					(89)

Hence

 						 				(90)

The second central moment in effect tells how much variation there is in the random variable. Appropriately enough, it is usually called the “variance” of the random variable, Var(X), and given by the symbol σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:

 				 						(91)

Note that since σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the expected value of the square of a random variable it is always positive.

Also, the standard deviation of the random variable, represented by the symbol σ, is defined as the square root of the variance:

 						 				(92)

Note that this has the same units of measure as both the random variable and the mean.

Although the variance and standard deviation provide a measure of the amount of variation to expect in the values of a random variable, a given amount of variation is usually less important if the random variable has a large mean than if it is small. The “coefficient of variation,” C, gives a way of expressing the amount of variation in relation to the mean value of the random variable. It is defined as

 			 							(93)

Note that for the deterministic random variable (84, 87) σ = σ2 = 0 and thus
	
 	C = 0									(94)

For the exponential random variable (44, 90)

 		 								(95)

and hence using (88) and (89) in (93)

 		 								(96)

'''The Third Central Moment'''

The third central moment, M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as 

 
	
and

 		
 
for the discrete and continuous cases respectively. This gives a measure of the symmetry of the distribution.

For M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 the distribution is symmetrical. For M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 it is positively skewed, and for M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 it is negatively skewed. This is illustrated below.

[[Image:Compsyseng00_07.jpg]] 	

'''The Fourth Central Moment'''

The fourth central moment, M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as

 	
 
and

 		 

for the discrete and continuous case respectively, measures the flatness or peakedness of the distribution. It is a somewhat more sensitive measure of the spread of the distribution than the Variance.

The figure below shows distributions having the same Variance, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, and M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 3, M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, and M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3. For M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 3 the distribution is “tall and thin;” for M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3 it is “flat” and for M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 it is “medium.”

Transit is the integrated computer assisted translation environment developed by the [http://www.star-group.net STAR Group]. Its beginnings date back to the year 1986. In 1991, Transit 1.0 (a 32 bit DOS version) is one of the first translator-dedicated workstations to appear. It already featured the modules that most of today's CAT tools have incorporated: A proprietary translation editor with separate but synchronized windows for source and target language and tag protection, a translation memory engine, a terminology management component and project management features. Transit 2.0, the first version for MS Windows appeared in 1994. Further features were added, network compatibility, enhanced usability and stability and more source file filters. In 1996, with version 2.6, the fuzzy match engine was introduced. The last 16 bit Windows version was the 2.7. The previous version, Transit XV, was launched in 2001.

The current version of Transit, 'Transit NXT', has been on the market since 2008. It is the second most popular CAT tool in many countries in Europe but less well known outside Europe. A key difference between Transit and most other CAT tools is that it does not generate one database full of disjointed reference segments but retains the documents in its own format from which translations are created. Thus, it is always possible in Transit to call up the exact context of a reference segment &quot;hit&quot;. Because it does not use databases for its reference segments, it is possible to switch the direction of translation &quot;live&quot; at any time without having to export an existing translation memory (TM) and reimport it in the oppositre direction. Thus, the source and target languages are always at the same level of revision. A further key feature of Transit is the integrated dictionary window. Unlike some CAT tolls, this is not a feature that is relegated to the bottom of the priorities list but is a core feature, offering quick and easy term entry and the option of displaying graphics to illustrate terms as one works on a translation. 

A number of CAT tools of the latest generation, including Transit, offer a formatted PDF or HTML view of the source text so a translator can see instantly whether a segment is body text, a heading, table header etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to dynamically display a list of items that match an input field as you type.  This is character-by-character incremental filtering of possible options.  The difference between this and other &quot;suggest&quot; options is that the list of possible options can be stored in an instance.

== Method ==
We will put all of the possible choices inside of a '''xf:repeat''' statement.  When the user types in the input field we will narrow down the choices using an XPath expression in the repeat '''xf:nodeset''' attribute.  The XPath expression will only match items that begin with specific characters in the xf:input field.

         &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;instance('selected-data')/item&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Selected: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:output&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

The most challenging part of this example is the value attribute of the setvalue element:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:setvalue
    ref=&quot;instance('selected-data')/item&quot; 
    value=&quot;instance('data')/item[title[starts-with(.,instance('search')/filter)]][index('data-list')]/title&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We are setting the item of the selected-data instance:
&lt;code&gt;ref=instance('selected-data')/item&lt;/code&gt;

We need to set it to the selected value - but the 2nd part - &lt;code&gt;[index('data-list')]&lt;/code&gt; - is the numeric index of the selected item in the '''filtered''' list. This is why we 1st have to filter the list and 2nd choose the right index out of the filtered list.

Just like in the restriction of the nodeset attribute of the repeat we are re-running the XPath expression and getting all of the items
that start with the text in the filter.

&lt;code&gt;instance('data')item[title[starts-with(.,instance('search')/filter)]]&lt;/code&gt;

Note that this is exactly the same expression as in the repeat nodeset attribute.

This list is additionally constrained with the postion of the selected item on the data-list:

&lt;code&gt;[index('data-list')]&lt;/code&gt;

We are really doing consecutive filters on two sets of data.  The first generates the same list as the search.  The second uses the item selected to select the correct item.

Hi guys,

I saw this: &quot;Goes over the dos and don'ts of administrator actions regarding the deletion of content. These are mainly guidelines to administrator behavior, but can be useful to point at when having a serious dispute with administrators or going before stewards and an arbitration board.&quot;. Could someone please explain why the stewards are mentioned here? Stewards do not provide arbitration. Stewards are elected by the wikimedia community to perform ''administrative'' tasks which have been decided by the community first. They may have a few buttons, but certainly no mandate to be an arbitration committee of any kind. Thanks for clearifying this in your policy/guideline. [[User:Effeietsanders|Effeietsanders]] 19:18, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

:Stewards aren't mentioned in the actual policy. This is an old vote page that was meant to summarize the page's goals and is most likely quite out of date. This is not an issue. Please respond on my talk page if you have any other questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we best teach children with autism?}}
{{Rquote|right|If a child cannot learn in the way we teach…we must teach in a way the child can learn.|Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas, Developer of the Lovaas Model of Applied Behavior Analysis}}

This quote from Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas is especially suitable when discussing the treatment of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). His opinion is an expert one. Lovaas is known as one of the fathers of Applied Behavior Analysis, a treatment that demonstrates how teaching can modify the behavior of children on the autism spectrum. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), “Many people with ASDs … have unusual ways of learning, paying attention, or reacting to different sensations. The thinking and learning abilities of people with ASDs can vary – from gifted to severely challenged.” [http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.htm] How do we teach children with such a wide array of learning abilities? This currently serves as something of an obstacle for educators of children with a disorder on the Autism Spectrum... one that they are striving to overcome.

==What exactly is an Autism Spectrum Disorder?==
===The Idea of a Spectrum===
Autism, a disorder that affects thought, perception, and attention, can encompass a continuum of symptoms. Because the lines between the symptoms can often become blurred, it is necessary to place the disorders that vary in severity onto a spectrum. The Autistic Spectrum Disorders Fact Sheet on www.autism-help.org states that the “idea of a spectrum is that instead of trying to 'box' individuals into a specific disorder, they are seen as part of a spectrum: from the severe end where a child may have a profound intellectual disability, never communicate, and need full-time care, to a child who will experience some difficulties but be able to attend regular schooling and go on to employment, relationships, and the hallmarks of a typical lifestyle.” [http://www.autism-help.org/classification-diagnosis-autistic.htm]

===Symptoms of a Disorder on the Spectrum===
The DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual used to classify disabilities, categorizes autistic disorder under the Pervasive Developmental Disorders. Autism Spectrum Disorders are developmental disabilities that emerge before the age of three. In a child on the autism spectrum, deficits will be noticeable in their social interactions and their communication skills. The flawed social interactions could range from poor eye contact to aversion to human contact. Some examples of communication deficits are speech delay and echolalia, which is the repetition of words previously heard (ie television commercials). The children also exhibit repetitive behaviors or interests, like obsessions with certain objects and rocking or hand-flapping. Unusual reactions to certain sensory experiences, like loud noises or different textures, is another symptom of disorders on the spectrum. [http://www.autism-pdd.net/autism-symptoms.html]   

;Autistic Disorder
Characterized by a pattern of impairments of varied severity in: 
# social impairment,
# language and communication, AND
# repetitive interests and activities.	

;Asperger’s Syndrome
Characterized by: 
# average intelligence without a history of a delay in language development, 
# noticeable impairment in social skills, and
# restrictive and repetitive interests.	

'''Pervasive Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)'''
Often termed “a diagnosis of exclusion,” a diagnosis of PDD-NOS may be applied when a child “does not show all the symptoms required for a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder or if his or her symptoms are milder in nature (Stone 9).” 


Source: ''Does My Child have Autism?'' Wendy L. Stone, Ph.D. with Theresa Foy DiGeronimo, M.Ed.

===What are the Different Autism Spectrum Disorders?===
The spectrum of Autistic disorders includes: Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism), and Asperger syndrome. Although they are characterized by similar symptoms, these disorders vary in severity, age of onset, and the exact nature of the symptoms.  A diagnosis of a condition on this spectrum can, arguably, remain valid throughout a person’s lifetime.

===What Causes ASDs, and Is There a Cure?===
“What we know about the causes of autism, at this point, is all correlational, and many of the correlations are rather weak (Siegel 18).” As of the creation of this article, the exact causes of autism are still unknown. There have been inquiries into whether vaccinations have caused this massive upsurge in cases of autism, but there a lack of sufficient evidence to confirm or refute this claim. ASDs do not affect any one group in particular; race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status does not adjust the chance of acquiring an autism spectrum disorder. However, it has been established that ASDs ''are'' four times more common in boys than in girls. There is also an increased prevalence in rates of autism for families with previously diagnosed autistic children, suggesting some genetic correlation.[http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.htm]

Although there is no precise “cure” for an individual on the spectrum, various methods are being implemented in homes and schools to address the specific treatments of those with ASDs. These include alternative behavioral methods, speech/occupational/physical therapies, and dietary modifications. The gluten-casein free, or GCF, diet is the most popular. It consists of elimination of wheat and dairy products from the diet of individuals on the spectrum. The National Institute of Medical Health is currently performing a clinical trial that will determine the effects of the gluten-casein free diet on children with autism. [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/trials/autism-spectrum-disorders-pervasive-developmental-disorders.shtml]

==The Rise in Children with ASDs==
{{Rquote|right|Children with special needs are our gift. They make us think outside the box and when we do, we realize these same strategies work with many other children in the classroom.|Dayle Timmons}}

The CDC, together with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), issued an Autism A.L.A.R.M. and concluded that as many as 1 in 166 children have an ASD.  In 2007, CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network published data indicating that 1 in 150 8-year-old children throughout America were on the autism spectrum.[http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/faq_prevalence.htm#whatdo]

The public schools in America are under pressure to implement innovative teaching methods to address the scope of challenging behaviors and learning difficulties, as more children are being diagnosed with autism. The amount of children with an autism classification in special education is rising at near-epidemic proportions. According to the CDC, the number of 6 to 17-year-old children classified as having an ASD in public special education programs escalated from 22,664 to 193,637 between the years of 1994 and 2004. They received this information from IDEA accounts. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) decides how states and public agencies will provide early intervention, special education and related services to American children with disabilities. Their records from 2005 show that 6,109,569 children ages 6–21 received services through 13 of the categories in public special education programs. About 3% (193,637) of these were autistic children. [http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/faq_prevalence.htm#howdoASDrates]

==Overcoming the Obstacles in the Education of Children with ASDs==
===Definition of Education===
Presently, education is the fundamental treatment for people with autism. The definition of education is &quot;the fostering of acquisition of skills or knowledge-- including not only academic learning, but also socialization, language and communication, and reduction of behavior problems-- to assist a child to develop independence and personal responsibility (Lord, McGee 12).&quot; The Surgeon General maintains that immediate, rigorous behavioral and educational intervention can actually help autistic children become capable of learning and develop their social skills. [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter3/sec6.html#autism]

===Effective Instructional Programs===
Common Elements of an Effective Treatment Program for Children with an ASD (Stone 113) 
*Early intervention, involving families in each phase of the assessment and educational processes
*Customized goals based on information received from assessments
*Concentration on the &quot;core deficits&quot; of autism: social skills, language and communication, imitation, and age-appropriate play
*Structured, supportive teaching approach and predictable environment
*Consistent monitoring and reevaluation of goals
*Encourages students to take a broad view of skills learned, that they may apply them in alternative settings (generalization)
*Takes initiative and uses positive approach, pertaining to behavior management
*Offers students &quot;opportunities for structured interactions with typically developing peers&quot;
*Prepares students for possible mainstreaming into regular ed classrooms, and/or transitioning to new learning environments 

====''Individualized'' Education Plan====
When a child who has been diagnosed with an ASD enters the school system, their parents should contact the local special education department and meet with an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) team. The IDEA has determined that this team should consist of: the child's parents or caregivers; at least 1 of the child's regular education teachers; at least 1 special education teacher; a representative of the local educational agency; someone capable of interpreting the results of the evaluations, and how they affect the child's education; other individuals the parent or agency believe have valuable input regarding the child; and &quot;whenever appropriate, the child with a disability.&quot; [http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cstatute%2CI%2CB%2C614%2Cd%2C1%2CB%2C]  The goal of this meeting is to determine the individual educational needs of the ASD student. This should be done by distinguishing the child's areas of strength and determining his or her areas of challenge. The IEP should exist as the means &quot;for planning and implementing [a]ppropriate educational objectives for children with autistic spectrum disorders [that] should be observable, measurable behaviors and skills ... [These goals] should be able to be accomplished within 1 year... Progress should be monitored frequently and objectives adjusted accordingly (Lord, McGee 218).&quot;

====Structured Teaching====
{{Rquote|right|Good teachers helped me to achieve success. I was able to overcome autism because I had good teachers... Children with autism need to have a structured day, and teachers who know how to be firm but gentle.|Temple Grandin, Ph.D.}}

Because individuals with autism process visual information more effortlessly than verbal information, the use of visual cues is a sensible method of instructing in the autism classroom. Autism consultant Susan Stokes' article ''Structured Teaching: Strategies for Supporting Students with Autism'', addresses the primary components of Structured Teaching: 1) the physical structure of the classroom; 2) the use of visual schedules; and 3) the structured teaching method.  She defines Structured Teaching as: &quot;a system for organizing their environments, developing appropriate activities, and helping people with autism understand what is expected of them.&quot; It is imperative that the arrangement and subsequent organization of the students' physical environment is taken into account. According to Susan Stokes, &quot;Physical structure provides environmental organization for people with autism. Clear physical and visual boundaries help the person to understand here each area begins and ends. The physical structure minimizes visual and auditory distractions.&quot; [http://www.specialed.us/autism/structure/str11.htm]

'''Physical Structure''': The classroom should be painted a muted color, and there should be minimal visual distractions (ie walls cluttered with posters). The designated areas in a classroom should have clear, definite boundaries. This can be achieved with furniture placement. The children should attain a better perception of their environment and allow them to become less dependent on adult direction.

'''Visual Schedules''': Visual schedules focus on the ability of many children with ASDs to process visual information. It sequentially organizes the student's schedule in a visual timetable. This gives the student an idea of what is expected of them. For children with anxiety about transitions, the visual cues will allow them to predict what will come next. There should be a general class schedule, as well as an individual schedule for each student. This allows the student with alternative scheduling (ie: Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Behavioral Counseling, etc.) a chance to visualize his or her personal schedule.

'''Teaching Method''': Because all of the details that go into completing their work can overstimulate a child on the spectrum, it is best to isolate only those with significance to the task at hand. The use of '''''visual instructions''''' to organize the steps of the task, '''''visual organization''''' to present only the necessary materials in an organized fashion, and '''''visual clarity''''' to emphasize the details and minimize the distractions are critical components of the structured teaching method. These fundamental building blocks can potentially allow for an increase in the child's independence not only in school, but also at home and/or work (Stokes).

====Curriculum Management====
Keeping your curriculum varied to cover those students suffering from any form of Autism is a very challenging but very important part of teaching. Making your lesson plans varied allows for you, as a teacher, to incorporate more students into your classroom.There are a few tips that teachers can be sure to follow that will make any lesson plan more varied to help Autistic children learn in mainstream classrooms. For starters, using a whiteboard for organization helps Autistic children to see the information displayed clearly. Keeping the information on the board to a minimum and color coding the information helps the students greatly. Another way for helping students battling with Autism is with picture cards. Adding the visual aspect to learning helps the students to learn faster and better.

==Physical Education with Autism==
Research has shown that vigorous exercise decreases stereotypic behaviors, hyperactivity, aggression, self injury and destructiveness in individuals with Autism and those who are mentally disabled.  Stereotypic behaviors and hyperactivity interfere with the educational process in the classroom.  Parents, Teachers and Schools should include a rigorous exercise program in students Individualized Educational Plan (IEP).  A vigorous workout typically consists of 20-30 minutes of aerobic exercise; a mild workout has little effect on behavior.  Therefore, students do not get an adequate amount of exercise during recess to have an effect on behavior.  To reduce stereotypic behavior problems in the classroom and at home, try an inexpensive and safe exercise program rather than expensive and harmful drugs.

==Conclusion==
When it comes to educating children with ASDs, the fundamental rule appears to be that there is no best method. There are several measures that can be taken, however, to ensure that a child gets the best treatment they can receive. This begins with instituting a team that will set a plan for the child, an IEP complete with educational and personal goals that should be able to be achieved within a school year. It continues with implementing an educational plan tailored for that particular student. Individualizing the plan by considering the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods for the specific child seems to be the conscientious decision. The amount of energy and perseverance that must go into teaching children on the autism spectrum can seem overwhelming. However, the benefits of tailoring a child's education to suit their individuality are remarkable. The potential for attaining their goals and developing the capability to learn self-sufficiency is &quot;there for the teaching.&quot;

{{question-answer|question=Because there is currently no &quot;conventional&quot; method for teaching students on the autism spectrum, many teachers are often obliged to implement innovative and often unproven techniques in their special education classrooms. The issue with this practice is that there is no ''standard'' Autistic classroom. Should public schools adopt a uniform method to educate children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder? 

Construct your own response or select one of the following positions and build upon it: 

A) This inconsistency among teachers is not the best practice for children who thrive on structure and stability.

B) Each child on the autism spectrum has individual needs. They should be addressed separately and not based on a standardization in public schools.
|answer=Because each child with an autism spectrum disorder is different, their needs are also diverse. What works best for one child may have adverse effects on another. It would be most beneficial for a child with an ASD to receive a treatment program customized to his or her individual requirements. For instance, some autistic children are non-verbal. If a teacher had a classroom with 5 verbal children and 1 non-verbal child, she will have to alter her teaching style. As another 
example, the same teacher may have 4 children that are able to feed themselves, a daily-living skill, and 2 that need assistance to eat their meals. Needless to say, the teacher will have to devise a plan that will accommodate both sets of students accordingly. 

On the other hand, implementation of unconfirmed methods of teaching children on the autism spectrum can be nonconstructive and potentially harmful. In this case, 
homogeny could be essential. Standardization could be advantageous in regards to training special education teachers. It would be beneficial for teachers to have a 
guideline on which they can build their teaching style. Since it is known that children on the spectrum respond better to visual cues, teachers should be supplied with strategies that will aid them in organizing their classroom and creating their lesson plans to establish a more structured environment. &amp;mdash;Lakesha Pickering

Every wave in the ocean is different from the next. This also applies to children, and especially to children with Autism and learning disabilities.  I have worked in the Youth based field of learning disabilities and mental retardation for a couple of years, and cannot begin to tell you how much truth is in differentiation.  To mandate a curriculum for autistic children would prove to yield more harmful than effective.  A task that may create exhilaration and excitement from the child today, may seem dull and unexciting tomorrow.  Tasks that some teachers may view as wasteful (Ex: stacking animal crackers), may result in hours of captivation for a child with special needs.  I have also found that repetition is a favorite method for many L.D. children, and with a mandated schedule, this would not work well. So, basically I feel as though a mandated curriculum is not a proper choice for children with autism. &amp;mdash;Jessica Parnell

Each child on the autism spectrum has individual needs. They should be addressed separately and not based on a standardization in public schools. Teachers of students with ASD need to have the freedom to discover the techniques that work best for each individual ASD student. This disorder is called a spectrum for a reason. Not every child diagnosed with autism is the same. Some are nonverbal with severe developmental delays while others simply suffer from some language and socialization problems. If a standard cookie cutter curriculum were applied to all autistic students, then we as educators would not have the ability to uncover an individual autistic child's strengths and weaknesses. A standard curriculum for all autistic students would also defeat the purpose of the child's individualized education plan or IEP. The goals written into an IEP are unique to the student and help to build on the child's weak areas based on strategies proven to work for that individual student. All students, especially those with ASD deserve to be in a classroom that is able to utilize their unique strengths, build on their weaknesses, and have the flexibility to adapt and try new methods when needed. &amp;mdash;Kristen Hamilton
----
When I was in high school I babysat for an autistic child.  It took massive patience to even get him to look at me, he was extremely afraid of strangers.  Even though he had known me from church for years, when I came into his home, he felt out of sorts.  Today my neighbor has an autistic child who is almost the opposite of the little boy I babysat.  He is almost vulgar to strangers instead of cowering in a corner; he will sometimes lash out and throw a tantrum.  Because I have recognized the differences in these two children with this disorder, I realize how important individual planning is for children with autism.  All autistic children do not behave the same or learn the same; therefore, it is important for every child to be evaluated before a plan can be enacted.  All of our students are different, just because a label has been attached to these students, they should not be all treated the same.  They are individuals, same as those without learning disabilities, and should be treated as such.  Once we start teaching and have come in contact with autistic children, we should not assume that the next one will react in the same way.  One may, out of complete fear of strangers, cower in a corner and rock back and forth; while another student may throw themselves into a temper tantrum.  These are just a few examples that I have encountered, there are many other aspects of this disorder to consider in planning for these children. &amp;mdash;April K. Smith}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the ideal amount of homework to assign?}}

A typical school day in the United States is six to six and half hours long. During this time, teachers are required to teach four to five core subjects, including math, English, science, and history. In addition, they must find time to include the fundamental supplementary subjects. These supplementary subjects include, but are not limited to, physical education, health, art, music, and foreign language. In these six hours, lunch and recess must also take place. Because of the large curriculum and the limited time, many teachers assign homework. 

==What is Homework?==
Homework is work assigned to students, by teachers, to be completed outside of the school. “It is used as an instructional supplement to classroom teaching.” (6) Although it is not required, homework is typically counted as part of the students’ grade. “The U.S. is one of the few nations where teachers include homework scores as an element of course grades.” (2) Forms, objectives, and lengths of homework vary. A large debate surrounds the importance of homework and the time restraints it places on today’s students. 

==History of the Homework Debate==
The debate over the importance of homework is not a new one. It has been debated since the late 1800s. Between the late 1800s and the mid 1900s some cities in the United States banned homework on the account that it was affecting the health of children; “many thought (homework) was an overemphasis on at-home drill and memorization”.(2)  Children were spending so much time on schoolwork and homework that they were mentally and physically exhausted. However, in the 1950s and '60s homework loads began to increase. The government felt that the “United States was becoming less economically competitive” (2). A major event that sparked these notions was the Russians' launch of the Sputnik satellite (7). This increase of homework lasted until the 1970s, in which it once again made a drastic decline. In the 1980s the load once again begins to increase (2). This time it is due to the incompetence on international tests. In 2002, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act under President George W. Bush. Under this act, teachers and administrators are required to submit their school's achievements on state standardized test to the federal government. Failure to comply or to reach the goals set forth by the state leads to a range of consequences. The most severe consequence is the replacement of staff in those failing schools. According to the NCLB Act, all students must be proficient in math and reading by 2014 (2).

==Types of Homework==
Homework is assigned in a multitude of varieties. Some assignments include reading specific content, problems at the end of a chapter, worksheets, research papers, and creative projects. Teachers may assign daily homework in which the assignment is to be completed and turned in on the following school day. Alternatively, teachers may assign long-term assignments; giving the students a week or more to complete the assignment. Homework assignments can be used to reinforce lessons taught in class, or elaborate on briefly introduced material (2). In addition, homework assignments may be used to prepare the students for an upcoming lesson (5).

==Purpose of Homework==
“Different homework assignments serve different purposes, so it is important to consider the goal of each exercise.” (5)  Some valid purposes of homework assignments include knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. (5) Homework assigned to reinforce lessons gives students the opportunity to practice newly acquired skills. They also help teachers assess the students’ understanding and comprehension of the lessons. Homework assigned to elaborate on newly introduced material requires students to take initiative and learn independently. This type of assignments also allows teachers to introduce more material throughout the school year. Homework assignments designed as preparation for upcoming lessons introduces the lesson to the students beforehand and therefore increases their ability to comprehend it. All of these reasons are intended to have a direct effect on students’ learning and academic performances. In addition to these academic lessons, homework results in positive non-academic lessons. Homework teaches the values of responsibility, good work-study habits, time management, initiative, and motivation. “Perhaps the most important advantage of homework is that it can enhance achievement by extending learning beyond the school day.” (8)

==The Effects of Homework==
Does the amount of homework assigned have an impact on the academic success of students? Unfortunately, there is no straightforward concrete answer. Research shows that homework affects students differently depending on their age and grade level. The effect of homework on academic success increases as age and grade levels increase. The National Education Association and the National Teacher Association endorse a 10 minute per grade rule of thumb (2). This rule of thumb suggests that first graders should be assigned approximately ten minutes of homework, second graders about twenty, and twelfth graders about two hours. 

===Elementary School===
Although homework has the least effect on elementary aged students, research shows that the homework loads have increased in the elementary schools over the last decade (2). “Research shows little evidence that homework improves learning or school achievement for children in the early grades.” (2) Students at this age have a limited attention span and grasp of study skills. A vast amount of homework may actually inhibit their academic achievement; “it can be counter productive, children will show signs of fatigue and frustration”. (7) Homework, in moderation, is more important at this age level to foster good work-study habits and teach self-motivation and responsibility.
	
===Middle School===
Research is inconclusive on regards to the effects of homework on middle school students. However, research does show that middle school is the stage of school that our students began falling behind on an international level; “by middle school U.S. scores begin to fall (on international achievement tests)” (2).

===High School===
Homework has the most effect on the academic success of high school students. There is a correlation between homework and scores on achievement tests and overall grades. (6) Following the ten-minute rule of thumb, the optimal amount of homework for high school students is approximately two hours. The more the better does not apply after two hours. Each added hour doing homework shows a smaller pay off in achievement (6). 

==Too Much or Too Little==
A major debate surrounds the effect and time restriction that homework has on school-aged children. Should homework be required? How much is too much? Critics against required homework argue that if students are assigned too much homework it leaves no time for family, extra curricular activities, and play. “Research shows (these activities) are more highly correlated with cognitive development and achievement than is homework.”(2) Too much homework can lead to stress, sleep deprivation and even depression. An unreasonable amount of homework dims children’s love of learning and too much may “diminish its effectiveness or become counter productive”. (2) 
On the other side, critics that are for required homework argue that the schools are not assigning enough homework. “Mastering a subject or skill takes practice, and homework can provide that practice.” (5) Students have the weekends, holidays, and summer to play. The amount of time spent on academics, to include the length of school days and school years as well as time spent on homework, does not compare with other industrialized countries, such as Asia and Europe. (2) Supporters of homework argue that homework adds to study time, and study time is the chief determinant of how much students learn. (2)

==Importance of the Type of Homework Assigned==
The type of homework that a teacher assigns can have a lot to do with its effectiveness. “Even more important than how much homework is what kind.” (2) If students are required to complete repetitive, long, ill thought out assignments, the knowledge they gain by doing so is minimal (8). For example, if there are 40 math problems assigned focusing on the same material, a student that knows the material may feel that it is repetitive and pointless. On the other hand, a student that is having a hard time with the material may get frustrated and disengaged. An approach taken by many teachers to avoid these issues is to use the five-problem rule recommended by the U.S. Department of Education (2). This rule suggests that teachers should not assign more than five problems of any given content. Five problems are enough to assess weather a student comprehends the material or not. Furthermore, “if a child who did not get the right idea in class slogs through thirty problems, she is just cementing the wrong method in her brain” (2). 

Teachers must carefully plan and assign homework in a way that maximizes the potential for student success (2). Not all students learn the same way. Students may be visual, verbal, or logical learners. Teachers need to be aware of the different learning strengths of their students and vary the types of homework they assign to include all types of learning styles. In addition, assignments must be realistic in length and difficulty (8). First graders should not be expected to learn twenty-five seven-letter words for a spelling test. Teachers need to take in to account their students logical and mental capabilities. Teachers should limit assignments to important and thoughtful ones (2). They should not assign homework just because it is expected by the parents and/or students. Generally, students complete their assignments because of expectations, as opposed to the educational gain they will receive by doing so. Keeping this in mind, teachers should assign homework that will keep the students interested while expanding their knowledge.

==Conclusion==
Homework is a hot-button topic in education. Some view homework as a needless waste of time and effort, and source of tremendous stress for students; while, others view it as an excellent study and review tool. As a middle school teacher, I see it as a way for my students to hone the information they learned in class and also continually spiral back to retain information learned previously. Also, it can be used as a way to introduce new topics and peak interest in a student. It is a valuable resource one can use to their advantage. However, it should not be a determining factor in a student’s grade point or average, as it is merely a tool and not a fundamental aspect of any course; the heart of the material should be assessed and covered in class. In fact, many teachers refuse to even assign homework as it is understood that students rarely complete it or put great effort into it. Whatever one’s feeling regarding homework, there is a definite ‘best’ method one can employ to reap the full benefits of homework. As pointed out by the National Education Association, “ensuring students’ success is a shared responsibility” (NEA, 2006, p. 2). That is, as parents and educators, we should be utilizing every avenue available to us to assist our students in their journey for academic success. As the achievement gap becomes a gorge the world grows ever more competitive and unforgiving. So, what can we do to make homework work? First, we can be prepared. Secondly, be on the same page as the instructor or teacher—understand their policy. Thirdly, be accessible and willing to model your expectations. Also, utilize all of your resources and stay in touch. Finally, foster learning even outside of school. (NEA, 2006, p. 1-3).

{{question-answer|question=If you  were a teacher of any grade, what would your homework policies be, and why?
|answer=In having the opportunity to teach high school students, I have also had the chance to develop homework policies for my students.   Homework is considered a tool to reinforce new and existing material that has been learned within the classroom. My class used computers for 90% of their class assignments. Homework consists of work that can be completed outside of class, without using a computer. By completing the assignments this allows students to become independent learners, as they work on self discipline and prepare themselves for higher academia.  Students receive points for completing homework; however, they do not receive a grade for homework.  The points that the students receive are incentive points and are translated into extra credit points for taking time to complete assignments outside of class.  Students are assigned long-term projects.  The long-term projects can be completed outside of class; however, students have enough time within class to complete the assigned project. The purpose for allowing students to complete long-term projects in class is to be able to support the student's questions, concerns and or ideas.  

Students who do not take the opportunity to complete assignments outside of class do not receive any points. The points are not averaged into grades; but, by completing homework assignments students will have additional points to add to their original grade. The points that are added to the original grade can make a difference between a B or an A, or a D or a C.  Students do not have any other opportunities to receive extra credit; therefore, all students make an effort to complete the homework assignments that are assigned to them.

I plan to teach Kindergarten and I don't think that I will be giving them homework unless it is something that isn't too time consuming such as reading a story to a parent. I feel that students work hard enough at school and they need time to relax and be kids. Students are in school for six or six and a half hours five days a week. That's a lot of time to be learning new things. I think that homework should be different at different grade levels. For example if I was teaching sixth grade then they would definitely have to have homework. Subjects such as math require homework because you need to make sure you understand the material. Some teachers take the homework overboard though, because some teachers forget that the students have other classes and want to give them tons of work to do. When this happens the students are doing homework all night and don't get much of a break; especially if they are involved in extra-curricular activates. That is why I think that homework should only be given if necessary. &amp;mdash;Katherine Owen

If I was a teacher for school I would give my students homework but I would not collect it. A lot of teachers give out homework and then they collect it for part of the student’s grade. Homework should always be offered but it should not be graded because homework is suppose to help students learn the information better so if a student does not do their homework and gets a bad grade on the test then that would be their fault. Students would then realize that even though homework is not collected you should still do it so you will be able to do well on your test. Another reason why I would not collect it for a grade is so the student can have more time studying for a class that he needs help in, because if a student knows the information and gets homework on that information then its a waste of time and that would take time from him studying for a class maybe he is struggling on. When I was a teacher I hated teachers that gave out a lot of homework and collected it for a grade because it takes all of your time. I feel like a student has been in school for 8 hours of the day, so they should get some free time and enjoy being a kid, not going straight home and cracking down on the books for another couple hours. &amp;mdash;Kurt Johnson

I believe that homework is a crucial part of the learning process.  It gives children a chance to attempt problems on their own.  This allows them to discover their weaknesses and strengths before a test is given.  It will also helps the children to learn valuable study skills.  In addition, assigning homework gives parents a chance to become involved in what their children are learning. Parents’ support is crucial to the education of  younger children.  When I become a teacher, I definitely plan on assigning homework.  However, I will do it in moderation.  I believe that the 10 minutes per grade level rule is an excellent amount.  Younger children should not be expected to spend as much time as older children on homework. 

I would not assign homework over the weekends or during holiday breaks.  Everyone needs a break now and then so that they do not become “burned out”.  Also, with this break and rest from school work, the children will return feeling refreshed and ready to start learning again.  I also think that long term assignments are a great learning tool.  Children can begin these assignments and work on them little by little as they learn new skills.  This would help the children see the progress of their knowledge and help them to realize how their lessons are related. &amp;mdash;Kristy Currin

As a future fourth grade teacher, I plan to assign a minimal amount of homework.  I intend to allow class time to complete assignments.  If the student does not use his or her time wisely, then the work will have to be completed as homework.  However, I realize that there will be occasions when assignments will have to be completed at home due to disruptions in the school day, such as assemblies.  Also, due to extracurricular activities, many students have to rush to complete homework in order to get to participate in the activity or parents do the work for them just to get it done.  If students have to rush through their work, they will not learn the necessary material, which will create problems for the student later.  When students do their homework during class, I know whose work I will be grading.  Another reason I plan to assign a minimal amount of homework is because I believe children need time to be children.  If they have to go home and complete two hour’s worth of homework, when will they have time to play?  In addition to getting their exercise, children learn when they are able to play and explore outdoors, which creates a happy, healthy child and a successful student. &amp;mdash;Amanda Hughes

I plan on teaching 3rd grade and I think homework is a great opportunity to do some work on their own time. This can also teach the students good time management and how not to procrastinate. I do not plan on assigning a lot of homework but I believe it’s an important learning skill. Homework also gives the parents an idea of what their children are learning in class and what their children’s learning level is at. I also intend on giving students time in class to do their assignments and if they do not finish them in class they will have to finish at home. This also gives the students the opportunity to ask me questions if they have any.  I think that homework is a good idea and I intend on giving some, but maybe not on the weekends. &amp;mdash;Diane Berry

I plan to be a third grade teacher.  At that age, I think it's important to not give an overload of homework.  Some homework is inevitable.  It is a great opportunity to see how the students work without the teacher's help, and their parents get to see how and what they are learning in school.  However, I think children do enough work during the school day.  When they go home at the end of the day, they should be able to play and enjoy their time away from school.  Family time is also important for the development of small children.  There is plenty of time in the school day for them to complete all their work and stay on track with the students from other classrooms that are given homework every night.  If the student doesn't complete the given classwork in school, then it school be completed at home, but as a teacher I would try to my best to not give homework. &amp;mdash;Whitney Medeiros

As a future high school or middle school history and government teacher, homework will be an important part of my class.  I believe that at those ages, students should be serious about their education and willing to do outside of the classroom work in order to enhance their learning.  Teachers do not give homework just to give it.  Homework is given to supplement the present lesson or to get students to think about the next lesson they will be going over.  I believe that some homework assignments can also help students because some people learn better on their own and it also helps reinforce what they have already learned.  In my class, there will most likely be a lot of essay questions, reading and paper writing.  I not only want my students to learn about history and government, but also use the tools they have learned in other classes such as English.  Most likely I will have my students read a section in the book before we go over it, just so they have a basic understanding of the material.  After we cover the material, they will complete worksheets that correspond.  Any assignments that are not finished in class will be considered homework.  I will also have my students complete long term assignments, such as a term paper.  I do not want to assign my class loads of homework each night because I know that there will be some students who will not complete the work, but students who do complete homework assignments will be rewarded. Homework grades will be a small portion of the final grades for students, so they need to take it seriously. &amp;mdash;Tara Saylor

I plan to be a kindergarten teacher. I will probably not assign that much homework to them. Children are in school for a long enough period during the day that at such a young age I don’t think that it is necessary for them to be assigned work to do at home. I plan on giving them a few activities to complete at home though, but I will make sure it is all things that they would enjoy. By working with young children, I have observed that when they are in kindergarten they actually think it’s kind of &quot;cool&quot; to have homework.  It makes them feel older and gives them a sense of accomplishment. I also feel that if they have some homework it will give the children a chance to ask their parents questions.  By doing so parents (or guardians) and children can have a chance to spend time together and talk about what the child is learning in school.  Although I feel that homework can be very essential to students at higher grade levels, I feel that in elementary school homework should be used to reinforce what was learned during the school day and give a chance for parents and children to spend time together at home. I do not believe that children (especially in elementary schools) should have so much work to take home that it makes going home a stressful event. &amp;mdash;Marinda Gregory

Some people dislike the idea of homework and they say that it’s a waste of time and it is not an effective way to reinforce material. I believe that homework can be a really useful tool in the classroom and I think that it will benefit my students in the long run. I plan to become a Spanish teacher, and learning a language other than one’s own can be difficult, so I will give my students homework so they can get a grasp of the concepts presented to them. It is easy for kids to forget what they are taught, especially when a plethora of new ideas are thrown at them over the course of six hours a day, so my homework assignments will help them retain information and practice using the language outside of the classroom.  I will not, however, make homework a major part of my student’s grades. Homework will only be mandatory if students fail to show mastery of a skill on tests or quizzes. If they maintain at least a “B” and aren’t showing any problems, then they do not have to do the assignment if they don’t want to. I don’t think it is a good idea to make students do homework if it doesn’t help them learn anything new. If their grades are not up to par then they will have required homework assignments until their quiz or test grades are adequate. This will keep them on task and then they will be rewarded in the end for making progress. &amp;mdash;Lauren Spindle

First and foremost, I am not a big fan of long, drawn out homework assignments.  I do not believe they enhance learning or lead to better comprehension of material (in agreement with this article).  For my classrooms, I will only assign homework as needed.  When we are working on math problems, which require practice, I will assign a few (no more than five) for my students to practice after school.  Spelling words or simple papers will be the maximum for my language arts classes.  All other topics will have assignments on an as needed basis.  I hope to be able to cover all material and reach my students in class, without the need for after school work.  The higher grade levels will require more homework, due to the amount of material that must be covered.  For example, fifth graders are required to learn many more difficult topics than first graders, but their attention span and cognitive abilities are also greater.  I had many friends who became “burnt out” from large homework loads and will make it a goal of mine to limit the amount of homework I assign.  If I were to teach high school, obviously the workload would be higher.  These students are preparing for college and must learn how to properly manage time and complete multiple assignments on time.  The length of time we are given with our students is adequate, but reinforcement of skills will still be necessary.  Therefore, it will be necessary to assign some homework, but it is still my job to teach the material and I intend to do so in class and without the need of learning skills at home.  There is no way to get around studying for tests, but if the material is presented properly study time should be minimal.  Homework will be solely for reinforcement of skills and practice. &amp;mdash;April K. Smith

I would like the opportunity to teach second grade. I would assign homework to my students but only work that is manageable and acceptable.  Personally, I believe homework should be a review and work that can be done. Too often homework has been work that takes hours or discourages students. I can remember doing homework in elementary school and feeling hopeless. The homework was overwhelming and took hours, when it should not have. Throughout middle and high school homework was the same. I spent way too long doing it and it became draining. Homework should be a review from that day’s lesson and not teach something new. My policy would be homework would be nightly and work from that day could help with the assignments. I know now, I would ask students to read every night but I would never ask them to read something out of the ordinary knowing they cannot read it. I believe in homework but it should be used when needed and necessary. &amp;mdash;Meryl Cox

I am currently teaching twelfth grade honors English at Menchville High School in Newport News.  This is my second year teaching this class and, with the help of the other honors English teacher, I have adopted very specific homework policies that I think are very effective.  I spent last year perfecting these policies, and this year, I have found it even easier to enforce.  My seniors have reading homework almost every night.  It usually is not an excessive amount, but at the same time, it is difficult reading that requires a certain degree of effort and hard work.  When they complain, I remind them that the point of this class is to prepare them for life after high school.  Because it is an honors class, it is expected that the majority of these students will go on to college next year.  Those who don’t will be entering the work force or the military, and like in college, they will have certain duties they will be expected to complete.  The homework assignments are designed to make them think on their own and prepare them for life after high school.  With every reading assignment, they know there is a possibility for a quiz the following class period.  Failing several quizzes in a row as a result of not doing homework, will significantly lower a student’s grade.  Therefore, they are much more likely to do the reading because they don’t want their grades to drop. &amp;mdash;Erin Eudy

I am going to be a music teacher which will not require assigning homework, but I would also like to teach music theory which would. This would be a high school class. This subject is one that is very methodical and can only be learned through working out written examples. While taking music theory in high school about twenty minutes of homework was a sufficient amount for the class to master the material, generally. I would try to assign only that much, especially since I know the core classes would be assigning more and I wouldn't want my students to get stressed out. However, if I didn't feel enough material was covered during class, I would assign more. Homework is something to aid in the learning process, in my opinion, and it should not be assigned just for homework's sake, so I would keep that in mind as well. Also, I would check the homework to see whether or not the students made an attempt and that would determine their grade, not how well they did it. However, I would edit them for mistakes to make sure they understand the material. Homework is a learning experience and the student should not be faulted if they don't understand something. &amp;mdash;Brittany Cannon

As a high school Spanish teacher, I think that it would be necessary to have homework for the students on a regular basis so that they get time to practice the language that they are learning. There is no way they will be able to learn the language if they only ever use it or think about it just in class, so I know that I would have homework for my kids every week. That said, I also think that I would be lenient in the homework that I give. It would follow the ten minute rule for the most part and be a review of the things that we learned in class that day, either some sort of grammar or vocabulary assignment. I would work with the children who were having trouble with the activity and use the homework in class as a review so that they get the opportunity to learn from each other and from me. I would also make sure that I know my kids well and know their backgrounds and stories so that I can work with children who do not have time or maybe a place at home to complete their homework, or have to work to help support their family. I think it is important to be firm in making students do homework as a review, but there will always be exceptions to that rule, there will always be students with special needs that you will have to work with so that they are able to succeed in the class and I think it is important to remember that when assigning homework especially. &amp;mdash;Jessie Neumann

I am going to teach math at the high school level.  Math is a subject that must be practiced at home to make sure the student can solve a problem on their own.  I am also a mother of two children who are both in elementary school.  I feel homework is very important for students no matter what the grade.  Homework should be a review of what is taught in the class and just a way for students to test their understanding of the daily lessons taught.  I do not feel that giving students more tougher homework will help our students to become smarter.  The above article talks about how “by middle school U.S. scores begin to fall (on international achievement tests)”.  I do not believe more homework will solve this problem.  I think the approach to teaching needs to change so students are learning the most up to date information possible.  Technology today allows for many new and entertaining ways to teach students.  I feel we need to focus more on the what and how we are teaching our kids rather than the amount of homework time.  In my opinion too hard of homework or overloaded homework will many times only be completed by the students who have a strong support system at home.  Sadly many times students do not have a strong support system at home.   Many students do not have help on the hard homework assignments and become discouraged when they are unable to complete the assignment.  Many students live for today and easily become unmotivated when they are given too much homework deciding not to do any of the homework because they feel they were given an unreasonable amount.  I also feel that as important as homework is, exercise is just as important.  Kids need to have time to go outside for at least an hour so they keep their bodies healthy.  Students go to school for about 6 hours five days a week and even though they get holidays and summers off, it is very important that students are happy with as little stress as possible because that is how the brain learns best, according to Dr. Allen’s lecture on “The Brain”.  When I teach I will only use homework as practice to ensure the students understand the material taught. &amp;mdash;Victoria Monaghan}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Should school be held year-round?}}

The school system was established when the United States was mostly an agrarian nation, basing it on a ten-month system.  The reason for this system was because children were often needed at home to work in the fields during the summer months.  Times changed and many people felt the need to do away with the ‘antiquated’ system and move toward year-round education.  In 1904, the year-round educational system was implemented for the purpose of solving the problem of overcrowded schools.  The trend ended with the advent of World War II, beginning again in 1967. Today, the system is used to solve many other problems the educational system has been faced with.  There are 3,181 schools involving 1,118,608 students using alternative calendars.

With the mounting dissatisfaction of U.S. elementary and secondary education, there is much interest in year-round schooling.  Repeated studies show that American high school students’ scores are well below students from other advanced countries, especially on core academic subjects, such as mathematics and history.  These students typically have longer and more instructional days than most American schools.  For example, German, French, and Japanese children spend more than double the time studying basic subjects such as math, reading, history, and science than do American children (Gregory, 1994).  Although only a small percentage of school-age children attend year-round schools, the numbers are steadily growing; however, there is still much controversy over the positive aspects of year-round education versus the traditional school year.  The term “year-round” is actually misleading, with other more descriptive terms being “continuous learning,” “all-seasons learning” and “four-seasons school.”  The purpose of the year-round school is not to be used as an alternative curriculum for learning but as “a reorganization of the school calendar into instructional blocks and vacations distributed across the calendar year to ensure continuous learning” as defined by Quinlan, George and Emmett (1987).    

Both traditional and year-round students attend school approximately 180 days per calendar year.  The difference between traditional and year-round students is that traditional students attend for approximately nine and one-half months with a two and one-half months vacation, while year-round students attend school for twelve months, with shorter breaks during the school year.  There are different options that schools can use for the year-round schedule, such as the single-track and multi-track pattern.  The most common pattern for year-round student vacations/breaks is called the “60/20 calendar,” meaning that the students attend school for 60 days followed by a 20-day break, occurring three times during the school year.  According to Eric Stone, Principal of Merrimack Elementary School, “Hampton City Schools have tweaked its balanced calendar (which is how he referred to the year-round schedule) to include two 9-day intersessions, one in the fall and the other in the spring, each followed by a 7-day vacation.”  Mr. Stone expressed that he felt other schools have adopted a year-round calendar strictly as a way to address the need for physical space.  He gave me the example of some year-round schools in California where students and teachers pack up their supplies at the end of the school year and a whole new group of students and teachers occupy the same classroom the next day.

==“Summer Brain Drain” and the Achievement Gap==
According to Duke University psychology professor, Dr. Harris Cooper, the average student test score in a traditional school is one month lower when they return in the fall than before their summer break.  The lack of retention is most evident in math and reading skills.  Information that is memorized such as math computations and spelling words carry the lowest level of retention and are therefore most likely to be damaged by the “summer brain drain.” 

This summer retention problem is more pronounced in students with lower socio-economic status.  Math retention suffers across the board because parents are less-likely to review math skills over the summer break.  Students in higher socio-economic classes are more likely to retain their reading level over the summer month and in some cases improve a few levels.  This is due to the likelihood that their parents are more likely to see reading as an important skill and encourage their children to read over the long summer break. According to Ron Fairchild, Executive Director of the Center for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University, by the fifth grade the reading level of low-income students at traditional schools are on average two years behind that of their high-income peers.

==Pros==
The issue of year-round education has many advantages, with information retention at the top of the list.  Long summer breaks encourage students to forget knowledge they have learned the previous year, forcing teachers to spend weeks reviewing what was taught the previous year, which is time that could be used teaching students new information.  A less interrupted flow of instruction, along with remedial reviews offered during breaks, is advantageous even to the slowest learner.  For instance, Brenda Teeter, a science teacher who is participating in year-round schooling made the observation that “the year-round program is particularly good for at-risk students because they don’t have that long summer to forget what they struggled so hard to learn” (Gregory, 1994).  With better information retention, reducing the number of students retained in grade and allowing more students to excel in their studies, more students are obtaining a high school diploma rather than the traditional student drop-outs due to the frustration of not being able to retain information throughout the summer and getting further behind in school work the following year.  A great way that the education system has been able to measure the success of year-round schooling is by looking at test scores of which many of the results have been positive.  One school district in Texas, Socorro, was known to have “some of the lowest test scores in the county” when they were using the traditional school calendar (Gregory).  After Socorro schools switched to the year-round schooling schedule, however, the students ‘outscored the state average on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills’ (Gregory).Another factor in less school drop outs is that fact that with more breaks, students tend to be absent less often, aiding in better grades.  Students with learning disabilities that are worked with year round are aided by this program because shorter breaks makes going back to school for them less of an ordeal and also allows them to progress increasingly faster than they would on a traditional schedule.  Another advantage is cost-effectiveness, to both the school system and the parents.  By using the single- or multi-track system, schools do not lay empty for three months, but are being put to use all year, accommodating more students instead of having to build more schools.  With the schools being in use all the time, there is less school vandalism.  Studies show that most of school vandalism is caused by students with too much free time during summer break who get bored, turning to vandalism and other crimes.  Since the majority of American families have both parents working outside the home, students in year-round schools are not left by themselves as often.  Another positive factor for parents is that they have less child-care expenses with the children in school year round, with many have the option of putting younger children in programs during intersessions at a cost less than day care.  Year-round education also benefits teachers’ attitude because they are less likely to be stressed or burned out with more frequent breaks.  They can also use the time available in between sessions to plan new and interesting lesson plans.  One teacher stated that she was sold on it because she was able to catch her breath and “come back and hit it hard again.”

==Cons==
In addition to the perceived benefits of year-round education, research also shows perceived drawbacks.  Such concerns include issues such as the cost of utility bills due to the constant use of school buildings, especially during the summer months when air conditioning can be very costly.  Not to mention older schools that do not even have air conditioning.  Many parents are concerned that without the traditional summer breaks, family vacations will become a thing of the past.  Also, students are unable to attend summer camp or work summer jobs earning extra money.  In an interview with Mrs. Michelle Koontz, a teacher at Woodside High School, she expressed that she feels “…in High School it is good for the students to be off all summer so that they can get jobs and learn skills.”  She feels that summer jobs help them learn the responsibility of holding a job and paying for their own things.  Teachers also encounter such challenges as organizational issues, especially those in multi-track YRE because four different teachers might be required to share three classrooms throughout the year.  Thus, packing up their materials and moving out of their classrooms for the 3-week break and into a different classroom upon their return.  In the overall scenario, moving day would include rolling carts, storage space and available custodial assistance (Worthen &amp; Zsiray, 1994).  There is a unanimous concern by teachers in multi-track schools regarding moving and lost materials (Quinlan, George &amp; Emmett, 1978).  Having students in school year round doesn't keep them from forgetting what they have learned.  &quot;Students are going to forget information whether they are out of school for three weeks or 10. Therefore, teachers will be performing four beginning of the year reviews instead of just one&quot; (Kelly, Melissa).

==Cons to Pros==
The No Child Left Behind’s costs are not only reflecting the funding but also on the instructional time, staff time, administrative time as well as human resources time. Several school divisions refer to opportunity costs as time that could have been used for other sources within the curriculum. Although, instead of the available time for opportunities of enhancing a child, the time was spent on some form of testing which can be distinguished into three categories: preparation, test administration, and loss of services and instructional time.

The preparation of testing is complex and often consists of multiple school staff employees to complete the tedious tasks. For example, the testing material arrives at a school district in October and before any testing begins, each test booklet must have the accurate number of data labels as well as test booklets. Prior to and after the testing, the three versions of the test for each grade level must be stored in a confined and secured area. When all testing has been completed, the testing materials are to be returned to the school board office (central office), properly packed, and shipped to be scored. Among the entire staff, guidance counselors along with secretaries spend the majority of their time in preparation for the logistics. The average amount of time spent to complete the tasks range between ninety and ninety five hours.

Test administration has lead to difficulties with the scheduling. “Paraprofessionals spent a per-district average of one hundred and two hours assisting teachers with testing. Teachers spent a per-district average of nine hundred and seventy six hours administering tests. Administrators’ spent a per-district average of sixty two hours in various testing tasks” (Chmelynski, 2006, p. 44).The testing criteria is at times so demanding and intense in that substitutes are often required to administer the students during testing. Often school divisions have to adjust the schedules in order to accommodate the testing.There is a loss of services for the disadvantaged students. For example, the special needs students in actuality need the instruction more so than the advantaged students. “One huge consequence is that the testing shifts the focus, for at least a month, from learning to testing. This plays out in many ways from the time actually  testing to loss of guidance and reading specialist support to loss of administrative support”( Chmelynski, 2006, p. 45).

==Single and Multi-tracking==
Single Track provides a balanced calendar for a more continuous period of instruction.  Students and all school personnel follow the same instructional and vacation schedule.  Single-track does not reduce class size, nor does it allow a school to accommodate more students.  The long summer vacation is shortened with additional vacation days distributed throughout the school year into periods called &quot;intersessions.&quot; Intersessions allow time for remediation and enrichment throughout the school year.  The most common types of single-track calendars are 45-15, 60-20 and 90-30.

Multi-Track is used primarily to alleviate overcrowding, although it also incorporates the educational values of single-track YRE, including intersessions. It was designed specifically for schools with a shortage of classroom space. Multi-track is used to avoid double sessions, building new schools and temporary structures. It not only saves on capital construction costs, but on the ongoing costs that are part of operating a new school. Multi-track divides students and teachers into groups, or tracks of approximately the same size. Each track is assigned its own schedule. Teachers and students assigned to a particular track follow the same schedule and are in school and on vacation at the same time. Multi-track creates a &quot;school-within-a-school&quot; concept Multi-track divides students and teachers into groups, or tracks of approximately the same size. Each track is assigned its own schedule. Example: implementing a four-track year-round calendar extends the capacity of a school by 33%. A school with the capacity of 750 students can accommodate 1,000 students, as only three tracks of 250 would be in school at the same time; there would always be one track on vacation or intersession every day of the school year. A five track model (60-15) allows for a 25% gain in capacity.

==Teacher Benefits==
Many year-round schools provide extra classes during their intersession breaks that students are offered but not required to attend.  Timber Lane Elementary School in Fairfax County, Virginia provides classes in “diverse offerings ranging from academic topics as math to such hobbies and sports as gardening, photography, and soccer”(Haser 2003).  Teachers are given the option to work during these periods.  This part-time work provides some extra income as well as gives the teacher a chance to pursue something else that they are interested in.  
	
The flexible schedule that is provided by these intersessions also provides the accommodations to allow teachers who are on maternity leave to slowly enter back into the work force.  A teacher was quoted saying  “ I teach three intersessions a year and find the experience rewarding.  I’m able to earn money, be with children, and use my skills as an ESL specialist. When I was pregnant, I thought about changing to a career in real estate while I stayed home, but the intersession teaching option has changed that. In another year, I think I’ll be ready to go back to teaching full-time.”(Haser 2003).
	
On top of all these benefits teachers are also given the opportunity to take vacations during the off seasons, “Such as visiting Italy in October” when it is much cheaper.  Also most teachers feel that this schedule makes our career one that is viewed as much more professional then the way in which people view the traditional scheduling (Haser 2003).  

==Student Benefits==
Along with the teachers, the students also endure great benefits from year round schooling; even if though they might not agree.  Studies have shown that when students attend school year round that they have a more continuous learning pattern.  This helps the students remember things easier and it makes the need for review less necessary.  By having a shorter vacation period students will not have to worry about forgetting lessons they were taught right before the break.  Another great benefit is that during the break periods students are given the option to take classes over they might have failed.  With this students are given the chance to retake a class with out having to wait until the next school year and falling behind all the other students.  Now they are given the chance to keep up with their classmates if they are struggling in certain areas.  Many people have also noticed an improvement in students overall school performance.  By having shorter periods in school and out of school, it helps the students to stay motivated and excited about school.  They are less stressed out and enjoy it more.

==Conclusion==
Year-round schools are clustered in certain regions and states according to Charles Ballinger, National Association for Year-Round Education’s (NAYRE) executive director, who notes that “83 percent of our year-round schools currently are west of the Mississippi,” and that Eastern schools have been “far more resistant to change.”  One explanation as to why year-round education is occupying only a tiny niche in American primary and secondary education is the negative attitude shared by many parents and educators.  The fact is that 76 percent of year-round schools are in California, Florida and Texas, probably because these three states have experienced robust population growth in recent decades, causing severe school overcrowding.  In today’s world where there is constant change, year-round education seems to be a change in which many parents and educators are not willing to accept.  Is this resistance justifiable or is fear of change a primary factor in the resistance of year-round education?  Mr. Stone believes it is.  He stated that “When families first come to register [for school], many panic and students cringe when they hear ‘Merrimack is a year-round school’.”  Does it make sense to use an outdated schedule when we want the newest and the best in every other aspect of our lives?  Although the year-round schedule may not be the answer to all educational problems, it certainly is an option to consider!

{{question-answer|question=Will year round-education improve student achievement?
|answer=Unfortunately studies that compare year-round to traditional school schedules are inconclusive because it is difficult to determine if the year round calendar is the reason for any positive or negative results in student learning.   Gains have been seen in schools that were truly trying to improve the overall quality of education. Two studies indicated lowered achievement, but research has also revealed no significant differences between the two types of schedules.  Implementing the year round schedule is usually just one of many efforts to achieve improved student learning.  Student, teacher, and parent support is required for year-round schools to succeed.   Research revealed that California year-round schools have improved but consistently score below traditional schools.  The data showed that single-track schools perform better than traditional, while multi-track schools perform worse.  Even though there is a lack of success with the 180-day school calendar, it appears that an improvement will not be seen in education until improving education is the primary concern.  Until then effects of year-round education on student achievement will remain an area of concern for school administrators and educators.  And as long as America continues to require a regular school calendar, little progress in the quality of education will be seen. When this is recognized by the majority, year-round education may be the next tradition in public education.
----
Personally, I believe that year-round education could improve student achievement in many different aspects.  First of all, it would eliminate the 10 week summer vacation.  Instead, students would have several two and three week vacations throughout the school year.  This would lessen the amount of information that is forgotten throughout the nearly three month vacation.  Teachers often spend the majority of the month of September reviewing information taught throughout the previous school year.  By reducing the length of the break, teachers could ultimately reduce the amount of time spent reviewing.  This will increase the amount of time that could be spent learning new information.  Furthermore, during the first few months of the school year, there are no days off of school.  The first break of the year does not come until Thanksgiving.  By then, the students are burned out, and they are having trouble focusing in school.  With year-round education programs, there is a vacation from school in October and another in December.  These mini vacations help the students get through the school year because they have several opportunities to rest before the next grading period.
How does having year round-education effect the students?
Having a child in classes year round can cause the student to get burnt out with school.  Not to mention that it affects their home lives in major ways.  If children are not off for the Summer than families can not arrange vacations without having to pull their child out of school.  Causing them to miss important information and defeating the purpose of having them in school in the first place.  It also prevents students from participating in summer camps that are beneficial to their social skills as well as their self-esteem.  By having to attend school year round, it also prevents students from being able to get Summer jobs.  Having a Summer Job teaches them how to be responsible and helps to ready them for life after school.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motives as Goals==
One way motives vary is by the kind of goals that students set for themselves, and by how the goals support students’ academic achievement. As you might suspect, some goals encourage academic achievement more than others, but even motives that do not concern academics explicitly tend to affect learning indirectly.

===Goals That Contribute to Achievement===
What kinds of achievement goals do students hold? Imagine three individuals, Maria, Sara, and Lindsay, who are taking algebra together. Maria’s main concern is to learn the material as well as possible because she finds it interesting and because she believes it will be useful to her in later courses, perhaps at university. Hers is a mastery goal because she wants primarily to learn or master the material. Sara, however, is concerned less about algebra as such than about getting top marks on the exams and in the course. Hers is a performance goal because she is focused primarily on looking successful; learning algebra is merely a vehicle for performing well in the eyes of peers and teachers. Lindsay, for her part, is primarily concerned about avoiding a poor or failing mark. Hers is a performance-avoidance goal or failure-avoidance goal because she not really as concerned about learning algebra, as Maria is, or about competitive success, as Sara is; she is simply intending to avoid failure.

As you might imagine, mastery, performance, and performance-avoidance goals often not experienced in pure form, but in combinations. If you play the clarinet in the school band, you might want to improve your technique simply because you enjoy playing as well as possible—essentially a mastery orientation. But you might also want to look talented in the eyes of classmates—a performance orientation. And another part of you may wish, at least privately, to avoid looking like a complete failure at playing the clarinet. One of these motives may predominate over the others, but they all may be present.

'''Mastery goals''' tend to be associated with enjoyment of learning the material at hand, and in this sense represent an outcome that teachers often seek for students. By definition therefore they are a form of intrinsic motivation. As such mastery goals have been found to be better than performance goals at sustaining students’ interest in a subject. In one review of research about learning goals, for example, students with primarily mastery orientations toward a course they were taking not only tended to express greater interest in the course, but also continued to express interest well beyond the official end of the course, and to enroll in further courses in the same subject (Harackiewicz, et al., 2002; Wolters, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Harzckiewicz, J., Barron, K., Tauer, J., &amp; Elliot, A. (2002). Short-term and long-term consequences of achievement goals. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 92,'' 316-320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolters, C. (2004). Advancing achievement goal theory: Using goal structures and goal orientations to predict students’ motivation, cognition, and achievement. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 96,'' 236-250.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Performance goals,''' on the other hand, imply extrinsic motivation, and tend to show the mixed effects of this orientation. A positive effect is that students with a performance orientation do tend to get higher grades than those who express primarily a mastery orientation. The advantage in grades occurs both in the short term (with individual assignments) and in the long term (with overall GPA when graduating). But there is evidence that performance oriented students do not actually learn material as deeply or permanently as students who are more mastery oriented (Midgley, Kaplan, &amp; Middleton, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, C., Kaplan, A., &amp; Middleton, M. (2001). Performance-approach goals: Good for what, for whom, and under what conditions, and at what cost? ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 93,'' 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt;. A possible reason is that measures of performance—such as test scores—often reward relatively shallow memorization of information and therefore guide performance-oriented students away from processing the information thoughtfully or deeply. Another possible reason is that a performance orientation, by focusing on gaining recognition as the best among peers, encourages competition among peers. Giving and receiving help from classmates is thus not in the self-interest of a performance-oriented student, and the resulting isolation limits the student’s learning.

===Goals That Affect Achievement Indirectly===
====Failure-avoidant Goals====
As we mentioned, '''failure-avoidant goals''' by nature undermine academic achievement. Often they are a negative byproduct of the competitiveness of performance goals (Urdan, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Urdan, T. (2004). Predictors of self-handicapping and achievement: Examining achievement goals, classroom goal structures, and culture. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 96,'' 251-254.&lt;/ref&gt;. If a teacher (and sometimes also fellow students) put too much emphasis on being the best in the class, and if interest in learning the material as such therefore suffers, then some students may decide that success is beyond their reach or may not be desirable in any case. The alternative—simply avoiding failure—may seem wiser as well as more feasible. Once a student adopts this attitude, he or she may underachieve more or less deliberately, doing only the minimum work necessary to avoid looking foolish or to avoid serious conflict with the teacher. Avoiding failure in this way is an example of self-handicapping—deliberate actions and choices that the reduce chances of success. Students may self-handicap in a number of ways; in addition to not working hard, they may procrastinate about completing assignments, for example, or set goals that are unrealistically high.

====Social Goals====
Most students need and value relationships, both with classmates and with teachers, and often (though not always) they get a good deal of positive support from the relationships. But the effects of social relationships are complex, and at times can work both for and against academic achievement. If a relationship with the teacher is important and reasonably positive, then the student is likely to try pleasing the teacher by working hard on assignments (Dowson &amp; McInerney, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Dowson, M. &amp; McInerney, D. (2003). What do students say about their motivational goals? Toward a more complex and dynamic perspective on student motivation. ''Contemporary Educational Psychology, 28,'' 91-113.&lt;/ref&gt;. Note, though, that this effect is closer to performance than mastery; the student is primarily concerned about looking good to someone else. If, on the other hand, a student is especially concerned about relationships with peers, the effects on achievement depend on the student’s motives for the relationship, as well as on peers’ attitudes. Desiring to be close to peers personally may lead a student to ask for help from, and give help to peers—a behavior that may support higher achievement, at least up to a point. But desiring to impress peers with skills and knowledge may lead to the opposite: as we already mentioned, the competitive edge of such a performance orientation may keep the student from collaborating, and in this indirect way reduce a student’s opportunities to learn. The abilities and achievement motivation of peers themselves can also make a difference, but once again the effects vary depending on the context. Low achievement and motivation by peers affects an individual’s academic motivation more in elementary school than in high school, more in learning mathematics and than learning to read, and more if there is a wide range of abilities in a classroom than if there is a more narrow range (Burke &amp; Sass, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Burke, M. &amp; Sass, T. (2006). ''Classroom peer effects and student achievement.'' Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, Boston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In spite of these complexities, social relationships are valued so highly by most students that teachers should generally facilitate them, though also keep an eye on their nature and their consequent effects on achievement. Many assignments can be accomplished productively in groups, for example, as long as the groups are formed thoughtfully; in that chapter we discuss some ways of insuring that such groups are successful, such as by choosing group tasks wisely and recognizing all members’ contributions are fully as possible. Relationships can also be supported with activities that involve students or adults from another class or from outside the school, as often happens with school or community service projects. These can provide considerable social satisfaction and can sometimes be connected to current curriculum needs (Butin, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Butin, D. (2005). ''Service learning in higher education.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;. But the majority of students’ social contacts are likely always to come from students’ own initiatives with each other in simply taking time to talk and interact. The teacher’s job is to encourage these informal contacts, especially when they happen at times that support rather than interfere with learning.

===Encouraging Mastery Goals===
Even though a degree of performance orientation may be inevitable in school because of the mere presence of classmates, it does not have to take over students’ academic motivation completely. Teachers can encourage mastery goals in various ways, and should in fact do so because a mastery orientation leads to more sustained, thoughtful learning, at least in classrooms, where classmates may sometimes debate and disagree with each other (Darnon, Butera, &amp; Harackiewicz, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Darnon, C., Butera, F., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. (2006). Achievement goals in social interactions: Learning with matery versus performance goals. ''Motivation and Emotion, 31,'' 61-70.&lt;/ref&gt;.

How can teachers do so? One way is to allow students to choose specific tasks or assignments for themselves, where possible, because their choices are more likely than usual to reflect prior personal interests, and hence be motivated more intrinsically than usual. The limitation of this strategy, of course, is that students may not see some of the connections between their prior interests and the curriculum topics at hand. In that case it also helps for the teacher to look for and point out the relevance of current topics or skills to students’ personal interests and goals. Suppose, for example, that a student enjoys the latest styles of music. This interest may actually have connections with a wide range of school curriculum, such as: 
* biology (because of the physiology of the ear and of hearing),
* physics or general science (because of the nature of musical acoustics),
* history (because of changes in musical styles over time),
* English (because of relationships of musical lyrics and themes with literary themes),
* foreign languages (because of comparisons of music and songs among cultures).

Still another way to encourage mastery orientation is to focus on students’ individual effort and improvement as much as possible, rather than on comparing students’ successes to each other. You can encourage this orientation by giving students detailed feedback about how they can improve performance, or by arranging for students to collaborate on specific tasks and projects rather than to compete about them, and in general by showing your own enthusiasm for the subject at hand.

'''Cleve's Cajun Seafood Gumbo'''.

==Ingredients==
&lt;div style=&quot;column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2&quot;&gt;
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 10 oz. [[Cookbook:okra|okra]] (optional)
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:celery|celery]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
* 6 cloves [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], chopped
* 6 cups [[Cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]] [[Cookbook:stock|stock]] or [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 8 oz. [[Cookbook:clam|clam]] juice (opt.)
* ½ t. [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* ½ t. [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 1½ t. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* ½ - 1 t. [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste
* 2 T. [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]] (fresh)
* 1 lb. Andouille sausage
* 1 lb. shrimp
* ½ pint [[Cookbook:oyster|oysters]] (at least)
* ½ lb. [[Cookbook:crayfish|crawfish]] (opt.)
* 4 chopped [[Cookbook:Green Onion|green onions]] (as topping)
&lt;/div&gt;

==Procedure==

# For stock, simmer shrimp shells in about 6½ cups of water for 20 minutes.
# In a 6-8quart pot, make roux:  Heat oil, then sprinkle in flour gradually, as you whisk.  Cook flour and oil on medium heat about 20 minutes, to a very dark reddish brown.  Stir constantly, especially towards the end.  (Be gutsy.  The best roux is quite dark, but don’t let it burn.  Dark roux is what makes this gumbo great. )
# Add vegetables to the roux.  Cook 10 minutes (or 15 minutes with okra).  Add cooled stock slowly.
# Add herbs, spices and clam juice.  Simmer 15 minutes, then another 30-40 more with Andouille sausage. Add the seafood at the end, to avoid overcooking.
# Makes about 10 servings.  Top with chopped green onions.  Many like to serve over rice.  Goes great with a baguette or cornbread.

==Note, tips and variations==
* You can add cut-up boneless chicken, or substitute chicken for the oysters, if they’re not your thing.  If you don’t have Andouille sausage, smoked or Polish sausage will do fine.

'''Honey's Cheese Enchiladas''' - this cheese enchilada recipe was handed down from my grandmother and mother.  It is definitely Tex-Mex, as my family is from south Texas.  

==Ingredients==
* 1½ pounds grated [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* ~20 &lt;u&gt;corn&lt;/u&gt; [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortillas]]

For the '''chili gravy''':

* 3 tablespoons (T.) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 3 T. [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* 3 T. [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* 3 cups of [[Cookbook:water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).  You will need at least one 9 inch X 12 inch baking pan. No need to grease it.
# Fry chili powder and flour in oil in a 10&quot; or 12&quot; skillet until emulsified.  Add water, bring to a simmer, and then stir for ~5 minutes until slightly thickened.  Turn down heat to low.
# Soak one tortilla in chili gravy until softened, 20-30 seconds.  Remove tortilla from gravy, place flat on a plate, and add ~1 T. cheese and ~1 T. onion to center of the tortilla.  Roll it up, and place with edges facing down in the baking pan.  Repeat this until you have used all the tortillas.  (If you get low on the gravy at the end, stir in ⅛ - ¼ cup of water.)  Cover the enchiladas with the remaining cheese, onions and chili gravy.
# Heat in oven for about 5 minutes (longer will toughen the cheese).  Serves 5-6.

(These freeze well, but defrost completely before reheating).

In Tex-Mex cuisine, these are often served with [[Cookbook:Mexican Rice|Mexican rice]], pinto beans and guacamole salad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Note: Some smiths refer to a method of tempering medium sized objects by applying heat, as from a torch or hot object, directly to the part to be tempered, as &quot;drawing.&quot;)

Drawing, or &quot;drawing out&quot; is the process of lengthening a piece by forging.  This is one of the most basic operations in that it is very simple to explain and perform, at least in theory.  It does, however, form the basis of many related operations that are not so well defined.

To &quot;draw out&quot; a work, it must first be heated to working temperature.  This takes patience, and practice, to recognize the right color changes and other signs. Once that has been done, move the piece to the anvil and (assuming it is a flat sided piece) place it ''flat'' on the anvil face.  you want to strike the piece squarely, so that the hammer face doesn't gouge into the piece.  This takes practice.  

It is very important to work quickly and above all carefully.  You will want to really pound that metal, maybe make some sparks fly like on the USMC advertisements.  Don't.  It is much more important to control your strikes than to drive the hammer straight through to the anvil.  Go easy, and work your way into it.  Your arms and shoulders will thank you too.  

Now a strike or two (maybe 5 or 6 if you are really taking it easy) and you may start to see some change. It's high time to change sides.  I think it is probably best to strike once or twice, flip up to an adjacent side, then go to the opposite side, then the (former) &quot;bottom&quot;.  That's my opinion, and if you stay at it you'll soon find a method that works, both for you and for the metal.

Work your way down the length of the area to be drawn until you have the desired length and thickness.  

There are several pitfalls to basic drawing out that make the practice much harder than the theory. One is the tendency of the metal to &quot;turn.&quot;  This is where, due to uneven striking, uneven metal qualities, or uneven cooling, the piece starts to bend while being drawn. This can usually be corrected if caught early, by simply adjusting where you are striking to even it out.  Don't let it go on too long, though, before correcting.

Another common problem is bowing(?) which is where the metal on the striking face begins to mushroom.  This often happens when the piece has a relatively narrow face adjacent to a broad face. (Rectangular for example).  Again, catching this early is the key to salvaging it.  Usually this is a direct result of striking too hard or spending too much time on the narrow face.  Fix by alternating between broad faces for awhile until it smooths back out.

The worst problem, and the hardest to &quot;fix&quot; is gouging.  striking at an angle and/or too hard will cause the edge of the hammer face to dig into the work.  Slight indentations may be buffed out later, or hammered out now, but deep gouges are all too often unfixable.

== empty tags? wtf ==
wtf do you mean with empty tags? no attributes? cause that's nonsens. the example is really bad also.

== deprecated elements ==

Check the w3c's web site.  bold and italic are NOT deprecated.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
This program demonstrates several different ways to call a web service from a sample XForms application.  The example uses both HTTP POST and HTTP GET methods and shows how the results are returned into an instance in the model and how the page can be replaced with the results.  The web service it calls is a simple web service that adds two numbers together.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-adder.jpg|frame|center|XForms Adder Example After Execution]]

== Link to XForms Application ==

For the results to be put in the model using FireFox, make sure to add &lt;code&gt;www.cems.uwe.ac.uk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xforms-examples.googlecode.com&lt;/code&gt; to your XForms white list using the Tools/Options/Security/Allowed Sites menu of FireFox.  This is required since our web forms are hosted at one domain but the web services are hosted on another domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we best teach children with disabilities?}}

There are many different approaches to the idea of teaching children with disabilities in the public education system. Some feel that all children with special needs are better off participating fully in a mainstream or regular education class. Others take a less accepting approach; they question if the whole idea of inclusion, specifically full inclusion, has gone too far. Still, other perspectives are shown in the focus of some on the study of the methods used to teach students with special needs. There are even those who might argue that attitude is the key component in teaching disabled children.  Undoubtedly, these questions will only increase as more and more children are educated. However, no matter what the viewpoint is, the important thing is that students with disabilities are given the same rights to education as any other student in school.

==What is Inclusion?==
In the year 2000, an article called “I Believe in Inclusion, But…” was  published in the Journal of Research in Childhood Education to show the rate of success of regular education teachers who taught both children with and without disabilities. While demonstrating the differing points of view on the idea of inclusion, the article seems to emphasize one over the other. “Selection of the participants was made from among early childhood teachers in kindergarten through 3rd-grade regular education classrooms in a small urban school district in Nebraska. This district served approximately 5,000 students, with 10 elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. This is a &quot;pro-inclusion,&quot; rather than a full-inclusion school district. In a full-inclusion district, &quot;...all children with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability, will be educated in general education: in a full inclusion system, separate special education placements would no longer exist&quot; (Hocutt, 1996, p. 79). In a pro-inclusion district inclusion is the preferred choice, whenever possible and appropriate, decided on a case-by-case basis.” (Smith and Smith 2000)
The authors of this article are not as concerned with the success or failure of mainstreaming special education students, as with whether or not the teachers are having success. Though some feel that they have been “hindered”, all teachers participating in this study agree that inclusion works. However, in order for it to be achieved, there are some standards by which all teachers must abide when dealing with their students. “Even when a student has been diagnosed, these teachers will be responsible for providing for the needs of that student, meeting the needs of the rest of the class, and maintaining a classroom of mutual respect and academic standards. This initial experience is critical since it forms the foundation for later school success; hence, the positive and negative perceptions, beliefs, and experiences of early childhood regular education teachers are at the core of the issue of successful inclusion.” (Smith and Smith, 2000)

==Methods of Inclusion==      
While some studies focus on opposing views of those teaching special needs students, others emphasize methods used in instructing these children. For instance, in the later part of 2006, the Science Scope featured an article that briefly summarizes just a few of these methods. The first method is the “Primary/Supplementary” approach, in which one teacher delivers the lecture, while the other teacher moves throughout the classroom to make sure all the students understand what has been taught. Another approach is the “Tag-Team” approach, which is basically the same as the previous method. The difference is that the teachers switch places and teaching roles. Other instructional means include the 50/50, where students divide up into two groups, and two teachers work together leading their individual group.  Though there are more methods used in teaching children with special needs, it appears that these are the methods on which the others are based.  (Peters, Erin, and Timothy Johnson 2006)

==Arguments Against Inclusion==
Although many feel that several strides have been made in full-inclusion education, others are somewhat skeptical with the idea of full-inclusion. “Critics of full inclusion ask whether even students with the most severe disabilities benefit from placement in regular classrooms.” (Cromwell 2004)  Other concerns about inclusion are expressed in the idea that teachers may have to completely change the structure of their class. For instance, they may need to seek the aid of an assistant, which can be time consuming. Also, with technology being more prevalent in schools now than ever before, teachers may be required to receive additional training with any assistive equipment the student might use. (Cromwell 2004)	The author also points out, “While few educators oppose inclusion completely, some express reservations about how full inclusion works in the classroom.” Albert Shanker, writing for the American Federation of Teachers in 1996 in &quot;Where We Stand,&quot; asserted, &quot;What full inclusionists don't see is that children with disabilities are individuals with differing needs; some benefit from inclusion and others do not. Full inclusionists don't see that medically fragile children and children with severe behavioral disorders are more likely to be harmed than helped when they are placed in regular classrooms where teachers do not have the highly specialized training to deal with their needs.” (Cromwell 2004, sighted quote from 1996)
Not only has the idea of inclusion been troubling to some professionals in the field of education, but it is also troubling to the parents of the students being taught. These parents fear that their children might end up getting “dumped” in a regular education class, without the proper support they may need to succeed, and to progress with the other students.  These are some of the reservations that cause some parents to question the virtues of full-inclusion. (Cromwell 2004)

==An Argument for Inclusion==
Being visually impaired, I can personally identify with the struggles faced by students with disabilities.  I was born with an eye condition known as Retinopathy of Prematurely (R.O.P.). I have no sight in my right eye and very little vision in my left, and from the time I was a little girl, my family constantly encouraged me to pursue any goal I wanted to achieve, to the best of my ability, including education. In my case, it seemed that a full-inclusion situation was the best thing.
Like all students, I had my share of good and bad teachers, and there is a lot I could say about many of them.  However the most influential teacher who laid the foundation for the person I am today is Dianne Fitzkee. She was my first vision teacher who taught me to read Braille, and surprisingly, it was not so much what she taught me in class that affected me so much, but her positive views about her student’s capabilities. Without question, her methods were good, and she was highly qualified to instruct in her field. However, it was her high expectations and willingness to help me reach my full potential as a student, which led me to where I am today.

== Teacher Attitudes Regarding Inclusion ==
The success of any inclusion program relies heavily on the attitude of the general education teacher involved. However, the views of teachers toward inclusion programs differs. Some teachers may not want to participate in inclusion classroom settings simply due to their apprehension of special education students. This may be due in part to the separation of special and general education in teacher training programs. Teacher training programs typically had separate curriculum and did not prepare new teachers certified in specific subjet areas to work with special education students. (Coombs-Richardson, 2000) This may have left many teachers feeling unprepared and frustrated when faced with inclusion classrooms. 

Project Inclusion in Louisiana was enacted to attempt to help general education teachers feel more prepared in inclusion settings. This program offered general education teachers college level courses that focused on techniques for working with students with disabilities. Classes included topics on behavior identification and intervention, collaboration with special education teachers, and teaching strategies for learning disabled students. Comparing the scores of teachers from before they completed the program and after completing the program indicates tht teachers not only felt more knowledgeable about special education students but also felt more accepting of the inclusion of special education students in their classroom. (Coombs-Richardson, 2000)

==Classroom Management==
To be fair to general education students as well as special education students the teacher must have some type of management system so that every student in the class can benefit from her lesson. One approach is to consult with an Intervention Assistance Team (IAT) whose job is to create appropriate interventions for children with problem behaviors (Goodman, Williams, 2007). In many cases being a stern educator is just not enough to help children with a disability pay attention, sit still or focus on the subject matter. These are the symptoms of many students with behavioral and learning disabilities. Susan Cahill, an occupational therapist feels that &quot;maintaining order in the classroom is the responsibility of the teacher regardless of the subject area or certification. The challenge lies in balancing the time required to teach the curriculum and the energy it takes to manage the needs of each of the students in the classroom&quot; (Cahill, 2006).   

==Conclusion==
The debate of the opposing views and methods of teaching special education children continues endlessly. Many researchers and professionals will all point in their own direction on this issue. Yet, the main thing is that all children with varying degrees of ability be given the same access to a public education, so that they can become all they were created to be.

{{question-answer|question=According to the information from Albert Shanker which you read in this article, what are some of the arguments against full-inclusion?	
|answer=Shanker asserts that full-inclusion is not always the best thing for every child for many different reasons. First, he explains that children with disabilities have individual needs and therefore should not be put into a box. Some children with severe mental or physical needs would not necessarily benefit from the instruction in a mainstream classroom. Another argument he uses against full-inclusion is that teachers do not always have the training they may need in dealing with students who are severely impaired. Teachers might possibly be hindered because of a lack of knowledge in dealing with assistive technology the student will likely be using. Finally, Shanker believes that a full-inclusion setting may present more harm than help to the child because of all these roadblocks. It is something that should be considered on an individual basis. 
----
Albert Shanker makes a number of arguments against full-inclusion in the school system.  He is feels that children with disabilities are individuals with varying degrees of needs.  He also states that, children with disabilities can be more harmed than helped when placed in a regular classroom.  In school bullying is a problem in schools as it is.  Now, if we integrated children with serious disabilities, they too are now subject to the cruelty and danger that bullying offers.  Will they be able to defend themselves?  Will they be able to even understand what is happening?  How will that help in creating a positive learning environment?  Shanker also points out that teachers are not trained appropriately for dealing with some disabilities.  For example, a child with a severe case of autism probably would not function in a regular classroom.  There are specific training techniques for every type of autism.  Teachers in a traditional classroom will not have that special training.  In the end, the child is the only one to suffer.  Not all disabilities are equal and they should not or sometimes cannot be taught the same.  These children should not be forced to fit in a cookie cutter type of educational system. &amp;mdash;Erika Murdock}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Why is special education an issue for all teachers?}}

Samantha (not her real name) was a student in my class a few years ago when I replaced a teacher who left on maternity leave at the end of April.  Samantha was labeled by my team members as &quot;one of the more difficult students&quot; in the fifth grade.  She rarely completed her class work, frequently asked for the pass to the bathroom/nurse/office and liked to challenge authority.  At the end of my second day on the job, I decided to stay late to allow myself a sufficient block of time in which I could read through my students' files.  What I found was astonishing.

According to Samantha's file, she had first been referred to the Child Study committee in second grade, then again in the third and fourth grades. Finally in the middle of the fifth grade, a 504 plan was written for Samantha.  Unfortunately, had I not taken the time to read through her file, I would never have known about her 504, as neither the exiting teacher nor any other staff members mentioned her need for accommodations.  Furthermore, after consultation with Samantha's mother and my fellow fifth grade team members, I learned that modifications were not being followed in any of Samantha's classes.  Samantha, it turns out, was difficult at times…but with reason.  She was being medicated with Lithium to control Bipolar Disorder.  Perceived as excuses to skip class time, her frequent trips to the bathroom were really a means to go to the water fountain because she was always thirsty (a side effect of her medication). She often had headaches (another side effect of her meds) and had days when she just needed a break from the stress of the classroom.  She was trying to cope as best she could. She was faced with a medical condition she did not understand and being educated by teachers who did not understand her special needs. She was not having a very successful or productive school year and felt her situation was hopeless. 

Using my prior knowledge of Bipolar Disorder and based on my past experiences with students who suffered from Bipolar, Samantha and I were able to work out a plan that not only helped her cope with her disorder but also improved her class performance significantly.  A year end Child Study meeting resulted in her finally receiving the IEP she needed.  

This story exemplifies the reason why special education is an issue for ALL educators, not just those identified as special education teachers.  Ignorance of law is not an excuse for failing to serve the needs of the special education students in your classroom.  As educators, we pledge to serve ALL students in our class to the best of our ability.  This, at times, means going the extra mile to find the methods that will best serve our students; and educating ourselves before we attempt to teach others.

== What is Special Education? ==
According to the Virginia Department of Education Parent's guide to Special Education, Special Education is &quot;specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.  This includes instruction conducted in the classroom, home, hospital, institution, or other setting. (http://www.pen.k12.va.us)  There are five steps in the special education process.  The first step is called identification and referral.  This is an extremely important step for regular education teachers. A child's regular education/classroom teacher has first-hand knowledge of the student's strengths and weaknesses.   If the teacher suspects that one of the students may be in need of special services, it is that teacher's responsibility as an educator to request an evaluation by writing or speaking with the special education administrator of the school or system.  It is best to put this request in written form, so that the request is documented and the referral starts a special education timeline.  Within five days, the special education administrator may request a review by the child study committee.  The committee has ten days from the date of said request to decide whether or not to evaluate (Step 2). The special education administrator has sixty-five days from the date of the referral for evaluation to determine eligibility for special education and related services (Step 3).  

A child study team will be created to evaluate the referred student's information.  This team includes the person who referred the child (except in cases of confidentiality conflicts), the principal or his/her designee, at least one regular education teacher, and one specialist.  If the referred child is found eligible for special education and related services, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) will be developed by the team and the child's parents that best meets the needs of the child. This document will be reviewed annually (Step 4).  Finally, step five, is re-evaluation, which requires a child study team to review the IEP every three years to determine whether or not services are still needed.

== Mainstreaming and Inclusion ==
Mainstreaming refers to the idea of selective placement of special education students in one or more &quot;regular&quot; education classes; whereas, inclusion is a term which refers to the maximum appropriate time that a child would benefit from attending the &quot;regular&quot; education classes with special services coming to the child rather than moving the child to a separate class.  Full inclusion means that all students, regardless of their disability, remain in the &quot;regular&quot; class full-time with an aide.  

It seems that everyone has their own opinion on whether or not the idea of mainstreaming or inclusion actually is a successful concept; much like the idea of &quot;tracking&quot; students.  Those who support mainstreaming say that it is a benefit to the special education student because it helps them to achieve socialization goals through improved self confidence, and greater skills and independence are achieved in integrated settings.  &quot;Regular&quot; education students learn to appreciate the individual differences and regular education teachers learn to incorporate their &quot;mainstreaming&quot; techniques in their everyday lessons, which in turn, assists all students in the class. 

Those who disagree with mainstreaming/inclusion feel that if the concept is not executed properly, mainstreaming can result in greater prejudice and rejection for the special education student.  Large class size can hinder the teacher's ability to meet the needs of the special education students and both the regular and special education students in the class suffer. Adequate support from the special education team is essential for the idea of mainstreaming to succeed.

Bottom line, the concept of mainstreaming is one that can be a success, if appropriate training and support is provided to the regular education teacher.  The regular education teacher needs to understand the student's disability and plan lessons and activities accordingly.  The teacher needs to get to know the student, meet frequently with his/her special education teacher, attend parent conferences, plan the day to include promoting social interaction, giving extra help when needed, respecting confidentiality rights, and above all, being realistic!  The teachers should not be afraid to ask for help in developing new teaching strategies or assisting in assessing the effectiveness of your lessons.  For the student, the teacher needs to provide clear and concise directions to ensure the student's daily success.  Use a variety of teaching techniques and integrating the special education student into your classroom should also be incorporated in the student's daily activities.  Finding opportunities to recognize the student's progress (i.e. catch them being &quot;good&quot;) helps the student to identify self-worth, achievement, and success.  Inclusion and mainstreaming really does work, and done the right way is extremely beneficial to all the students in your classroom!

== The Importance of High Expectations ==
{{Rquote|right|If we prophesy (expect) that something will happen, we behave (usually unconsciously) in a manner that will make it happen. We will, in other words, do what we can to realize our prophecy|Spitz, 1999, p. 200}}

My daughter was identified as having cognitive deficits as early as her eight month well baby check up.  She began an early intervention program when she was eighteen months old, and rode her first school bus to school when she was two years old.  The public education system has done a lot to improve my child’s chances for a more fulfilling life, but individuals she has encountered within that system have unfortunately hindered some of her progress.  Much of the hindrance has been a result of teacher expectations, or lack thereof, and my own ignorance of how to fight for her right to an education.  It has been our unfortunate experience that some special educators view their role as more a babysitter whose purpose is to keep her safe, teach only self-help skills, not challenge academically, and pacify parents that this is the most our child is capable of.   Case in point, my daughter was in sixth grade last school year.  I went in to observe a “science experiment” in which her teacher was guiding the class.  The teacher had bought these little paleontology activities- lumps of hard packed sand that surrounded small plastic dinosaurs.  The children were allowed to chisel away at the sand to search for the dinosaur.  There was no preliminary discussion about paleontology, or relating the activity to the digging up of fossils, no explanation of what fossils are, no stories about dinosaurs or comparisons between meat eaters and plant eaters, not even a comparison of the different structures of the dinosaurs the children revealed.  There was no follow up activity at all.  The only activity I observed on this day was six children chipping away at a lump of sand.  My daughter didn’t even find her dinosaur.  I asked her what she learned from the activity, and her response was “I don’t know.”  This is a perfect example of a teacher having low expectations of a child’s potential academic achievement.  Her plan for the day was to keep the kids busy and out of trouble, not challenge them to achieve a higher level of understanding about the world in which they live.  I found an article that discussed Arthur Binet’s battery of tests that sought to assign an IQ to a child to whom they were administered, and a psychologist named Cyril Burt who claimed that based on the IQ, a child’s academic potential is set.  Binet used the information from the IQ tests to determine strengths and weaknesses so that the educational program enhanced the child’s educational experience; Burt used the IQ tests to pigeon-hole a student into a particular tract.  In the sphere of education today, educators are supposed to be embracing Binet’s “cup half full” ideal of academic expectation, but the reality is that many teachers ascribe to Burt’s “cup half empty” idea that you can’t put a gallon of milk into a pint jug.  Students will fulfill the prophesies that their parents and teachers give them- low expectations will yield low effort and poor results, whereas high expectations yield stronger effort and good results.  The concept works for children with disabilities every bit as much as their contemporaries without.

== Cooperative Teaching ==
Cooperative teaching is described as &quot;an educational approach in which general and special educators work in co-active and coordinated fashion to jointly teach heterogeneous groups of students in educational settings…In cooperative teaching, both general and special educators are simultaneously present in general classroom, maintaining joint responsibilities for specified education instruction that is to occur in the setting&quot; (Bauwens, Hourcade, &amp; Friend, 1989, pg.36)

In collaborative teaching, both the general education and special education instructors bring their own set of skills, training, and resources to the team.  This combination enriches the educational benefits for the students in the class. Whereas, the general education teacher's strengths tend to lie in the content area, the special education teacher brings the assessment and adaptation specialization to the classroom.  An effective collaborative team will work together in all areas of planning, teaching, and assessment. 

Teachers need preparation and classroom support from administration for collaborative teaching to be a success.  Joint planning time is essential and must be consistent throughout the school year.  Individualized instruction, multiple learning styles, team teaching, frequent evaluations and joint planning are all beneficial to every student in the class.  Combined expertise and planning helps the instructors to meet the need of all learners in the classroom.

== Regular Education Teachers' Rights in Special Education ==
Many regular education teachers do not understand their rights regarding special education. First and foremost, the regular education teacher has the right to seek help for any student in their class they believe needs special assistance. Teachers have a duty to provide the best possible educational opportunities to all children in their classroom, and as such, it is their responsibility to refer any child for evaluation that they feel would benefit from additional services/resources.  The ADA does recognize teachers as child advocates; therefore, retaliation, intimidation and reprisals for teachers who advocate for children are forbidden.  The regular education teacher has the right to know all information that is pertinent to the referred child's education, and has the right to receive teacher training needed to serve said child.  The general education teacher has the right to participate in the IEP process so that all their questions regarding the education of said child can be asked and answered. The regular teacher has the right to request special materials and related services be provided in the regular classroom to meet the needs of the special education child, and has the right to participate in assessing the effectiveness of the program. The general education teacher should above all be treated like a professional and should never be treated as soldier expected to carry out a general's orders.  They have the right to ask questions and to act as an advocate for all the children in the classroom. If the placement of a special needs child in the regular education classroom is having an adverse effect on the other students in the class, the special education child's right to learn in &quot;the least restrictive environment&quot; should not outweigh the right of other students to learn in a safe, nurturing and peaceful environment.  The general education teacher has the right to voice their concerns in this matter as well.

== Skills Needed by All Teachers ==
There are certain skills that should be utilized by educators, not just those in special education.  Teaching is a complex process, one which requires planning, time management, and organization. Educators need to decide what their teaching priorities are so that they understand how to use their instructional time wisely. Devise a blueprint and stick to it.  Map out the methods and exercises you are going to use in the classroom that will maximize the time you have with your students. Vary your teaching and learning methods (teacher lead instruction, student oriented tasks, group projects, peer tutoring).  Model concepts and lessons and ask for feedback from your students.  Give your students opportunities to contribute and ask questions.   Make your expectations clear and encourage your students to become active in the learning process. Reevaluate the strategies that you use in the classroom to determine the ones of greatest value.  Prepare lessons that are interesting, keep students on task and provide instruction that is relevant.     

== Conclusion ==
All teachers need the skill and knowledge to work with special needs students. Mainstreaming and inclusion are part of our current school system, and most students with disabilities spend the majority of their day in a regular education classroom.  Therefore, all teachers need to be trained in methods or strategies for teaching special needs students. All students, even those deemed &quot;regular education students&quot; need specialized attention and instructional plans to assure that they will achieve their very best.  

Take the time to read your students' files.  Read about their disabilities and learn as much as you possibly can about their needs before they come to your classroom. Educate yourself about the laws concerning special education and work as an advocate for all students in your classroom.  The future of our world depends on the leadership and dedication of our teachers to assure that the next generation is prepared for what lies ahead.  All of our students are &quot;special&quot;, and as educators, we need to meet them at their present educational levels and help them build their own path for success

== Terminology ==
'''Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)''' refers to special education and related services that: are provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge; meet requirements of the Virginia Board of Education; include preschool, elementary school, middle school, or secondary school education in the state; and are provided in keeping with an individualized education program.

'''Individualized Education Plan (IEP)''' is a written statement for a child with a disability that is developed, reviewed, and revised in a team meeting.  The IEP specifies the individual educational needs of the child and what special education and related services are necessary to meet the child's needs.

'''Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)''' means that children with disabilities are educated with children without disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate.  The child must not be placed in special classes or separate schools unless education in regular education classes with aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.

'''Section 504 of ''The Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973''''' states that people cannot be excluded from any federally funded program because of their handicapping condition.  A handicapping condition is defined as &quot; any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more life activities.&quot;  In this case, school staff must develop a plan that provides the student with need services or changes to the regular school program.  One of the frequent reasons for the 504 plan is related to student who have been diagnosed as ADD or ADHD.

{{question-answer|question=You have a new transfer student in your class.  He moves frequently, and as such, has never cycled completely through the Special Education process.  He has neither a 504 plan nor an IEP, but his parents have expressed concern over his poor grades and lack of attention in school.  How can you best serve this child?
|answer=There are several ways in which you can assist this child.  The first thing you should do is read through the child's student file.  This will help you assess the child's strengths and areas of improvement.  Meet with the child parents so that you can document and address their concerns regarding their child's education.  Ask them about their child's interests and hobbies, areas that they see as their child's strengths are subjects/topics in which their child would benefit from additional support.  Meet with the child and do the same.  After the initial meetings with the child and parents, determine whether or not the child should be referred to the Child Study committee for evaluation.  If the child does meet the criteria for referral, you may as the regular education teacher, develop interim modifications for the child within your classroom to assist with the transition and integration into the class.   Try a variety a different means of communication (written, verbal, hands-on) of new information and vary the method of student participation (individual, peer tutoring, group assignments) to allow the student to excel in the medium that works best for them.  Provide additional support if you notice the child struggling with concepts and help re-direct their attention and participation.  Lastly, be an advocate for the child and fight for their right to receive an education in the environment in which the child is least restricted.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What roles do fun and joy play in the learning environment?}}
{{Rquote|right|When we are active and truly enthusiastic about our lives and jobs, we are often much happier.|Ron Clark|2004}}

It has been said that we learn something new every day from the day we are born.  What are these things? Well it can be anything from learning the a b c‘s, riding a bike, or repairing a car engine.  Many of the skills or new information we learn throughout our lives are learned in a school or college and for many, they are things that are carried with them through the rest of their lives. 

From preschool all the way to college, one common thing that we all learn is to make transition.  What I mean by this is from early in preschool all the way to middle school, learning was fun.  Most of us learned our alphabets by singing along with a nice tune.  We got to play with blocks to learn shapes and put pieces together.  So what happened to the fun once we grew up and the classes became longer?  Those who teach or are being taught now aren’t having as much fun in the classroom as when they were younger, and for some, aren’t really retaining the information as well because they aren’t being engaged enough. Couldn’t there be a way to keep learning fun and exciting for any age group? Of course there can.  It doesn’t have to be all fun and games, but it doesn’t also have to be boring and bland either.  

According to John Luckner, integrating fun activities into teaching can help strengthen students’ communication skills, builds self confidence, and help instill a greater appreciation of alternate forms of education. (Luckner 33)

Enthusiasm and laughter can also go a long way in any classroom, which is why there can be fun and joy in a learning environment but it must be incorporated with the fundamentals of learning for all learning types.  

== Enthusiasm ==
If a teacher walks into a classroom full of students, back slumped and the look of not wanting to be there, then the students aren’t going to be all too excited to be there either.  In their minds they are probably thinking about how tired they are from getting up early or how they can’t wait to get home to watch their favorite show.  But if a teacher comes in with their head up high with a huge smile and a positive attitude, it will most likely get the students to smile as well and probably wonder why their teacher is smiling.  Ron Clark, teacher and author of The Essential 11 describes in his book how he would capture his student’s attention by moving around and throwing his whole body and self into his lessons.  Once they saw just how enthusiastic Mr. Clark was about teaching them, they soon became enthusiastic about learning from him. (Clark 20)

== Creativity ==
Just coming in with a smile and positive attitude is not the only thing a teacher must do to get the students active in learning.  As a part of planning the school day, teachers are responsible for a number of tasks.  The most important task is how to make learning creative and enjoyable for all students.  Some creative ways to spark a student’s mind to learn are songs centered around the subject being taught, toys or props, games, and more.  There is an endless list of techniques and tools that are to get and keep the student’s engaged in learning, but it takes a teacher’s devotion and creative mind to bring it out. 

Here are some fun activities to spark a student’s mind from Education World™ http://www.education-world.com/:
 
* Quotations of the day
* &quot;Every Day&quot; Activities Across the Curriculum
* Journal Writing Every Day
* Find it Fast! – a fast paced review of any subject
* The Dictionary Game – Students guess the real meaning of unfamiliar words

6th Grade teacher Deb Odom used comics to help her students learn new vocabulary and also help develop their own creative minds by creating their own comics to reinforce what they were learning.  This proves that with the right creativity and motivation, anything can be a tool and aid in the classroom to add a little fun and excitement to learning.

If as a teacher you don’t feel like you have a creative mind, but are enthusiastic about teaching and helping students learn, don’t worry! There are plenty of resources out there to give you many ideas and activities to add fun to your lessons.

== Technology in the Classroom ==
{{Rquote|right|A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.|Henry B. Adams}}

Technology is growing bigger and better each day and has definitely come a long way over the years, and it is evident in today’s classrooms. Many schools have computers in each classroom, television, and smart boards “an interactive that is a large, touch-sensitive display that is placed on a wall or floor stand in classrooms, meeting rooms, boardrooms and other places where people gather to meet, teach, train and present.” (Wikipedia)  The smart board is primarily connected to a computer so that a teacher can upload presentations, pictures, or other media to be projected to the class.  This piece of technology is certainly different than the old chalk and blackboard.  With this new method, teachers can implement many types of techniques and tools to go along with their lesson plans in a very fun and organized way.

“In today's world of video games, cable and satellite television, and high action digital video, teachers need to integrate technology in order to keep the attention of their students.” (Wikipedia)

Technology can be a very fun and engaging addition to the learning environment.  A teacher can incorporate visual and auditory technologies into their lessons to promote a fun learning environment.  This can be anywhere from watching a movie, listening to an audio disk, or playing a computer game.  A fun activity utilizing the computer in a classroom where available is to have the students go on a virtual treasure hunt that goes with the subject they are learning.  You can provide a list of certain things they must hunt for using the web.  

By including some technology in the lesson plans, it not only keeps the classroom a fun and exciting place to be but it also helps to enrich the learning process by giving it that extra “wow” factor. 

== All for Fun and Fun for All! ==
Preschoolers and elementary schoolers are not the only ones who can have fun learning.  Learning can be fun for all ages! Some ways a teacher can promote fun in a class of high schoolers or even college aged students are through fun stories, often about personal life experiences that can give them something to relate to, competition games such as classroom trivia, or lively class debate.  No matter what the age, learning can be fun for everyone of any age.  It is just a matter of finding and channeling that fun to make what is being learned more enjoyable.

In a learning environment such as a classroom, it is up to the teacher to figure out how and what kind of activities would help keep everyone interested and also help enrich everyone’s learning. Don’t fret. Again, if you are stumped as to what kinds of activities would make learning fun, search the web or ask other teachers how they keep their students engaged in learning and at the same time having fun doing it!

{{question-answer|question=Looking back at your early school career, what kinds of activities would you have wished your teacher incorporated into his or her lesson plan? Think about your future classroom. How would you incorporate fun into your students' learning environment?
|answer=Looking back at my early school career, I can say that my teachers did a great job incorporating fun activities in their lesson plans.  Some activities that I would have enjoyed more of would be reenactments for history, game reviews for all the subjects, and the use of any type of hands on material such as clay, etc.  For history, the reenactments worked best to help me personally remember events that happened.  An example of this is in my third grade class when we pretended to be Paul Revere and the British soldiers.  It was such a fun experience that it is one lesson in history I will have a hard time forgetting.  As far as my future science classroom, I plan to incorporate fun into the learning environment through the use of demonstrations.  I believe that allowing my students to make practical use of what they are learning and to have a visual or hands on experience with the subject will allow them to understand concepts better.  I also plan to use game reviews for tests and in preparation for the often dreaded SOL tests.  Incorporating fun into the learning environment of our students is essential if we want them to enjoy and benefit from learning. &amp;mdash;Lauren Teed
----
High school taught me many different educational facts.  I encountered many different teaching styles.  I mostly enjoyed and remember the lessons that were taught through either review games or role playing.  I also enjoyed a class were the students were able to teach one of the lessons from our textbook.  I would have like to have learned more about computers and the new uses of technology.  

In my classroom I would like to have a similar set up to an Elementary classroom.  The local schools have block schedules, meaning each class is about two hours long.  I would like to lecture for the first part but then have the classroom break up into groups for the second part.  One group would be using the computer to understand how to use math programs to solve the problems that were lectured on.  There would also be a group that discusses the topic as well as answer each others questions.  Those are just a few examples of group work I would like to have in my class.  I would also like to involve the students by having them work in groups to teach the class a section from the textbook.  I would like to play games with the students to help them review each chapter taught.

I would like to involve the students in the learning process as much as I can to help all of the students learn the given material.  I hope my class will be fun as well as educational.  I want to make sure my students enjoy learning and leave my classroom with a strong understanding of the math skills learned in class.  Using exciting ways of presenting the material, my goal is to have 100% of my students passing my class with confidence about the material taught. &amp;mdash;Victoria Monaghan}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
Normal http query strings use the ampersand (&amp;) character in order to differentiate between different terms in a query string. However, because ampersands also are used as the start of entities within HTML and XML, this can make it difficult encoding parametric content into XML links, and it moreover makes it difficult to visually decipher query strings. 

This program illustrates how to parse query strings using alternative delimiters (such as the semi-colon).

This program demonstrates some standard XQuery functions that are not part of the original XQuery specification but are required for precise web server XQuery functionality.

The functions are:
* [[/eXist/request/ | exist]] request:get-method()
* [[/eXist/util/ | exist]] util:unescape-uri()
* [[/eXist/request/ | exist]]  request:get-query-string()
* [[/eXist/request/ | exist]] request:get-parameter()
* [[/eXist/request/ | exist]] request:get-parameter-names()

== Namespace ==
  module namespace common = &quot;http://www.metaphoricalweb.org/xmlns/common&quot;;

== Platform ==
* eXist

== Parsing Query Strings ==

=== common:get-parameters ===
This base function retrieves the query string from the URI, parses the string using
the given delimiter and creates an XML structure of the form

  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;param name=&quot;param1&quot; value=&quot;paramval1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;param name=&quot;param2&quot; value=&quot;paramval2&quot;/&gt;

     let $params := if (request:get-method() = &quot;GET&quot;) then 
          let $query-string := util:unescape-uri(request:get-query-string(),&quot;UTF-8&quot;)
          let $parsed-query := tokenize($query-string,$delimiter)
          return &lt;params&gt;
          {for $parsed-query-term in $parsed-query 
                let $parse-query-name := substring-before($parsed-query-term,&quot;=&quot;)
                let $parse-query-value := substring-after($parsed-query-term,&quot;=&quot;)

This function retrieves a sequence of string values corresponding to the values for a given parameter key given 
in the query string. Note that while typically there will be only one string in the sequence, if you have a query
string of the form ?a=val1;b=val2;a=val3 then get-parameter(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;;&quot;) will return (&quot;val1&quot;,&quot;val3&quot;)

  declare function common:get-parameter($param-name as xs:string,$default-value as xs:string,$delimiter as xs:string) as xs:string* {
    let $params := common:get-parameters($delimiter)
    let $param-nodes := $params/param[@name=$param-name]
    let $param-values := 
       for $param-node in $param-nodes 
       return 
         if ($param-node/@value) 
         then string($param-node/@value) 
         else $default-value 
    return  $param-values
    };

=== common:get-parameter-names ===
This function retrieves the name of each query string key (once and only once per key).
    
  declare function common:get-parameter-names($delimiter as xs:string) as xs:string* {
    let $params := common:get-parameters($delimiter)
    for $param-name in distinct-values($params/param/@name)
    return $param-name
    };

== Example Program ==
Assumes query string of
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.metaphoricalweb.org/?a=5;b=test;a=8;c=new+message&lt;/nowiki&gt;

  let $msg := common:get-parameter(&quot;c&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)
  return $msg
  
returns [[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmldb/rest//db/Wiki/param_1.xq?a=5;b=test;a=8;c=new+message Execute]]
  new message   
----

  &lt;data&gt;
   {
     for $key in common:get-parameter-names(&quot;;&quot;)
     return 
        &lt;seq&gt;{$key}:{common:get-parameter($key,&quot;&quot;,&quot;;&quot;)}&lt;/seq&gt;
   }
  &lt;/data&gt;
 
  
returns   [[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmldb/rest//db/Wiki/param_2.xq?a=5;b=test;a=8;c=new+message Execute]]
  &lt;data&gt;

  &lt;/data


----
  
    let $seq1 := common:get-parameter(&quot;a&quot;,0,&quot;;&quot;)
    return  sum(for $n in $seq1 return number($n))

returns  [[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmldb/rest//db/Wiki/param_3.xq?a=5;b=test;a=8;c=new+message Execute]]

A '''serrano pepper''' is a type of chili pepper that originated in the mountainous regions of the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] states of Puebla and Hidalgo. Unripe serranos are green, but the color at maturity varies. Common colors are red, brown, orange, or yellow. Serranos are very meaty and thus they do not dry very well.  They are generally between 1 and 4 inches long (2.5 to 10 cm) and around ½ inch (1 cm) wide. 

Most serranos rate between 10,000 and 20,000 [[w:Scoville scale|Scoville units]].</text>

==Current staging==
&lt;big&gt;'''Endometrial Carcinomas'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;p&gt;
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
:Corresponds to updated FIGO staging (2009)
:'''FIGO 2009''' PMID 19345353 -- &quot;Revised FIGO staging for carcinoma of the endometrium.&quot;

:This staging now applies only to endometrial carcinomas and there is now a separate staging for [[Radiation Oncology/Uterine Sarcoma/Staging|uterine sarcomas]]. 
::Carcinosarcomas (MMMT) should be staged as high grade carcinoma.
&lt;br&gt;

''Primary Tumor:'' (FIGO Stage in parentheses)
:Note: FIGO uses pathologic staging
*Tis - in situ
*:Note: FIGO no longer includes Stage 0
*T1 (I) - confined to corpus
**T1a (IA) - limited to endometrium or invades less than 1/2 of myometrium
**T1b (IB) - invades &amp;ge; 1/2 of myometrium
*T2 (II) - invades stromal tissue of the cervix but does not extend beyond uterus
*:Note: endocervical glandular involvement only should be considered as Stage I not Stage II
*T3
**T3a (IIIA) - involves serosa and/or adnexa (direct extension or metastasis)
**T3b (IIIB) - vaginal involvement (direct extension or metastasis) or parametrial involvement
*T4 (IVA) - invades bladder mucosa and/or bowel mucosa

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - none
*N1 (IIIC1) - metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes
*N2 (IIIC2) - metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes
*:Note: Regional nodes include obturator, internal iliac, external iliac, common iliac, para-aortic, presacral, and parametrial
*:Note: For pathologic staging, FIGO classifies cases with &lt;6 resected LNs as pNX

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1 (IVB) - distant metastasis - includes inguinal LN, intraperitoneal disease, lung, liver, or bone.

''Stage Grouping:''
*Corresponds to FIGO stage given above (in parentheses)

''Changes from 6th Edition:''
*No longer includes uterine sarcoma (now staged with a new staging system)
*Positive peritoneal cytology is no longer considered (previously was T3a/IIIA)
*Involvement of the endocervical glands is not longer considered (previously was Stage IIA)
*Stages IA+IB combined (now: IA). IC moved to IB.
*Stage IIIC subdivided into IIIC1 and IIIC2. 


===Older staging systems===
FIGO moved to surgical staging in 1988 (AJCC 6th edition same).  There is also a clinical staging system developed by FIGO in 1971.

Note: until the update of the FIGO / AJCC in 2009, '''uterine sarcomas''' and carcinomas were staged using the same system

'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
*IA - Limited to endometrium
*IB - &lt; 1/2 of myometrium
*IC - 1/2 or more of myometrium
*II - invades cervix
**IIA - glandular epithelium of endocervix
**IIB - stroma of cervix
*III - extra-uterine
**IIIA - involves serosa and/or adnexa (direct extension or mets) and/or ascites or positive peritoneal washings
**IIIB - vaginal involvement (direct extension or mets)
**IIIC - LN+ (pelvic and/or paraaortic)
*IV - other organs
**IVA - bladder or bowel
**IVB - distant mets


===Clinical staging===
Staging is now surgical (see above), but clinical staging may be utilized for non-operative pts.

'''FIGO 1971'''

*I - Confined to corpus
**IA - Length of uterine cavity 8 cm or less
**IB - Length of uterine cavity &gt; 8 cm
*II - Involves corpus and cervix, but no extension beyond the uterus
*III - Extends outside uterus but not outside true pelvis
*IV - Outside the true pelvis or involves bladder or rectum
**IVA - Involves bladder, rectum, sigmoid, or small bowel
**IVB - Distant mets

==Epidemiology==
*Most common GYN malignancy in United States (incidence 44K, deaths 7.5K)
*Two forms:
**Type I: typically endometriorid, low-grade tumors, estrogen-related
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Endometrium/UPSC|Type II]]: typically papillary serous or clear cell; high-grade tumors, not estrogen related
*Risk factors for Type I (primarily related to long-term estrogen exposure):
**Exogenous estrogen: postmenopausal women treated with unopposed estrogen have 10X risk
**Endogenous estrogen: obesity, functional ovarian tumors
**Chronic anovulation (e.g. PCO)
**Tamoxifen: due to pro-estrogenic properties in endometrium (unlike anti-estrogenic properties in breast)
**Diseases: Hypertension, diabetes, breast cancer
**Age: 75% in post-menopausal women
**Hereditary: [[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Lynch_syndrome.2C_Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer_.28HNPCC.29|HNPCC]]
*Protective factors for Type I:
**Combination oral contraceptives
**Physical activity
**Smoking
*Risk factors for Type II - none known

==Screening==
*Society of Gynecological Oncologists and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [http://www.sgo.org/publications/endoguidelines.doc guidelines]:
**There is no standard screening test 
**Routine screening is not recommended because of the lack of an appropriate, cost-effective, and acceptable test that reduces mortality


==Clinical Presentation==
*Abnormal uterine bleeding (~90% cases); even one drop of blood in a postmenopausal woman on HRT is worrisome
**However, only 5-20% of postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding will have endometrial CA (most commonly due to atrophy)
**Bleeding due to superficial necrosis of the tumor expanding into the uterine cavity
*Endometrial cells on Pap smear (though &lt;50% of cancer patients have abnormal cells on Pap smear)


==Work-Up==
*Endometrial biopsy: office procedure, well tolerated, high sensitivity, low cost
*Hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&amp;C): higher yield, but higher complications
*Transvaginal ultrasound: normal endometrial thickness (&quot;stripe&quot;) is 4-5 mm; average thickness is 20 mm for endometrial CA
*CT of abdomen/pelvis typically not necessary, unless suspicion of extra-pelvic disease
*MRI is best modality for assessing myometrial invasion and cervical involvement, but provides no additional information if surgery is planned anyway
*CA-125 is useful for estimating extra-uterine/nodal spread

==Anatomy==
*Primary site
**Lower boundary is the isthmus
***Denoted exteriorly by slight constriction that translates interiorly into the internal os. 
***Average length in non-pregnant uterus is ~0.5cm
***Frequently located about 1/3 of the way up from external os
***Develops in utero from interaction between downgrowth of Muellerian mesoderm and upgrowth of mesodermic fibers from forming vaginal vault
***[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1826815&amp;blobtype=pdf Lower uterine segment] develops during pregnancy from isthmus + superior cervical canal, as the uterus expands to hold the fetus
**Upper two thirds of the uterus, above isthmus, is the corpus
**Portion of the corpus above the line joining the tubo-uterine openings is the fundus
**Wall is made of three layers
***Endometrium: glandular tissue + basal layer
***Myometrium: smooth muscle fibers with rich lymphatic network
***Serosa: visceral peritoneum
**Nulliparous uterus is ~7.5 cm long (cervix 2.5 cm + corpus 5.0 cm); uterine cavity is ~6 cm long; the wall is ~1.2 cm thick

*Lymphatics
**Superior fundus drains parallel to ovarian vessels into para-aortic lymph nodes
**Middle/lower uterus drains through [[w:Broad_ligament_of_the_uterus|broad ligaments]] to pelvic lymph nodes (obturator, internal iliac, external iliac, common iliac, presacral)
**Few lymphatics drain through [[w:Round_ligament_of_uterus|round ligaments]] to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes
**As a result, nodal mets can occur at any level and in any combination

*Distant spread
**Lung
**Vagina

==Pathology==
[[File:Endometrioid_endometrial_adenocarcinoma_high_mag.jpg|thumb|right]]
*Epithelial tumors. For mesenchymal tumors, please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Uterine_Sarcoma|uterine sarcomas]] page
*Type I(5-year OS)
**Endometrioid carcinoma (83%) - grouped based on degree of differentiation
***Adenocarcinoma
***Adenoacanthoma (adenocarcinoma with benign squamous metaplasia) - graded according to glandular component
***Adenosquamous carcinoma (mixed adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) (81%)
*Type II
**Papillary serous adenocarcinoma (53%)
**Clear cell adenocarcinoma (63%)
*Rare
**Mucinous adenocarcinoma (77%)


*Endometrioid (75-80%)
**Most are well-differentiated, with proliferation of endometrial glands without intervening stroma
**Endometrial hyperplasia is thought to be a precursor lesion developed with unopposed estrogen and genetic events
***Simple vs complex hyperplasia based on glandular architecture
***Cytologic atypia increases risk of progression to carcinoma (complex atypical hyperplasia risk ~30%)
**Cells show microsatellite instability, PTEN, and k-ras mutations
*Clear cell (5-10%)
**Clear due to presence of glycogen
**Tubulocystic, papillary, or solid patterns
**[[w:Psammoma|Psammoma bodies]] not as common
**Have to be present in at least 25-50% (depending on pathologist) of sample to qualify as clear cell
**Aggressive, with myometrial invasion in ~80%
*Papillary serous (1-5%)
**Complex papillary architecture, similar to papillary serous CA of ovary
**Presence of [[w:Psammoma|psammoma bodies]]
**Marked nuclear atypia
**Believed to transform from endometrial surface epithelium
*Mixed pattern
**Serous and endometrioid histology present next to each other in the specimen
**If &gt;50% serous component, classified as papillary serous
**If 10-50% serous component, classified as mixed serous
*Rare tumor types (&lt;2%)
**Mucinous, squamous cell, transitional cell, small cell

==Treatment Overview==
*Surgery is the primary treatment modality. Most patients should have a full surgical staging, including complete lymph node dissection, which is both diagnostic and improves survival
*Low-risk patients typically do not require adjuvant therapy; argument can be made for vaginal brachytherapy in Stage IC Grade 3 disease
*Intermediate-risk treatment is contentious. RT decreases local recurrence, but there is no impact on survival, at the cost of side-effects. Specific role of EBRT, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and various combinations needs to be clarified
*High-risk treatment is also controversial; role of brachytherapy, pelvic RT, whole abdominal RT, chemotherapy, and combinations also needs to be clarified

==Types of Surgery==
'''''Classes of hysterectomy:'''''
*'''Piver''' classification, 1974 - PMID 4417035 &amp;mdash; &quot;Five classes of extended hysterectomy for women with cervical cancer.&quot; Piver MS et al. Obstet Gynecol. 1974 Aug;44(2):265-72.
**'''Class I''' - '''Total (Simple Extrafascial) Abdominal Hysterectomy''' - removes just the uterus and a small rim of vaginal cuff.  
**'''Class II''' - '''Modified Radical Hysterectomy''' - removes uterus, a 1-2 cm cuff of vagina, wide excision of parametrial and paravaginal tissues (median half of cardinal and uterosacral ligaments).  The ureters and uterine arteries and only partially mobilized (as in Class III). Ligates uterine artery at ureter. (Limited to cervical cancers with invasion up to 5 mm).
**'''Class III''' - '''Radical Hysterectomy''' (Wertheim-Meigs procedure) - classic operation. Removes uterus and upper 1/3 to 1/2 of vagina. Dissection of paravaginal and parametrial tissues to the pelvic sidewalls. Ligates uterine artery at its origin at the internal iliac artery. Pelvic lymphadenectomy. 
**'''Class IV''' - '''Extended Radical Hysterectomy''' - same as Class III but adds full mobilization of the ureters past the bladder (which is the point to which they are mobilized in the Class II and Ill procedures). Removes more paracervical tissue medial to the uteter.
**'''Class V''' - '''Pelvic Exenteration''' - ''Anterior exenteration'' removes uterus, tubes, ovaries, vagina, and bladder.  ''Posterior exenteration'' removes uterus, tubes, ovaries, and rectosigmoid.  ''Total exenteration'' removes all pelvic organs.


*'''The Netherlands''' (2007-2009) -- total abdominal hysterectomy vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy
**Randomized. 283 patients, 21 hospitals, Stage I endometrioid CA or complex atypical hyperplasia. Arm 1) total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) vs Arm 2) total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Primary outcome major complication rate
**'''2010''' PMID 20638901 -- &quot;Safety of laparoscopy versus laparotomy in early-stage endometrial cancer: a randomised trial.&quot; (Mourits MJ, Lancet Oncol. 2010 Aug;11(8):763-71. Epub 2010 Jul 16.)
***Outcome: major complications TLH 15% vs TAH 15% (NS); minor complications 13% vs 12% (NS). Conversion to laparotomy 11%. TLH significantly less blood loss, pain medication use, hospital LOS and faster recovery; however, procedure took longer
***Conclusion: No difference in complication rate, less pain and better resumption of daily activities with TLH

*'''ILIADE Study, Italy''' (1998-2004) -- extrafascial hysterectomy vs modified radical hysterectomy
**Randomized. 520 patients, clinical Stage I endometrial CA. Arm 1) Standard extrafascial (Class I) hysterectomy vs Arm 2) Modified radical (Class II) hysterectomy. Adjuvant therapy risk adapted: if low risk, observation; if intermediate risk (IC and no PLND, IIIA cytology) +/- EBRT +/- BT; if high risk (IIB, IIIA adnexal mets) doxorubicin/cisplatin + EBRT. No difference in adjuvant therapies between arms. Primary endpoint OS
**'''2009''' PMID 19834767 -- &quot;Modified Radical Hysterectomy Versus Extrafascial Hysterectomy in the Treatment of Stage I Endometrial Cancer: Results From the ILIADE Randomized Study.&quot; (Signorelli M, Ann Surg Oncol. 2009 Oct 16. [Epub ahead of print]) Median F/U 5.8 years
***Outcome: Median length of vagina removed standard 5mm vs. modified radical 15mm (SS); length of parametria 15mm vs 20mm (SS). OR time and blood loss higher for modified radical. 5-year DFS 88% vs. 90% (NS); 5-year OS 89% vs. 92% (NS). Vaginal cuff recurrence 1% vs. 1% (NS), pelvic recurrence 4% vs. 4% (NS), distant recurrence 5% vs. 5% (NS)
***Conclusion: Class II hysterectomy didn't improve LRC or survival for clinical Stage I patients. However, if adequate cuff transection not feasible with Class I, recommend modified radical hysterectomy

*'''GOG LAP2''' (1996-2005) -- laparoscopy vs open laparotomy
**Randomized. 1682 patients with clinical Stage I-IIA uterine cancer. Arm 1) laparoscopy vs Arm 2) open laparotomy. Surgery included hysterectomy, BSO, pelvic and para-aortic LND. Conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy in 26% (poor visibility 15%, mets 4%)
**'''2009''' PMID 19805679 -- &quot;Laparoscopy compared with laparotomy for comprehensive surgical staging of uterine cancer: Gynecologic Oncology Group Study LAP2.&quot; (Walker JL, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 10;27(32):5331-6. Epub 2009 Oct 5.)
***Outcome: Operative time laparoscopy 204 minutes vs laparotomy 130 minutes (SS). Hospitalization &gt;2 days 52% vs 94% (SS). Complete P/PALND 92% vs 96% (SS). No difference in assessment of tumor stage
***Toxicity: No difference in intra-op complications. Postop complications laparoscopy 14% vs laparotomy 21% (SS).
***Conclusion: Laparoscopic surgery is feasible and safe, with fewer post-op complications
**'''2012''' PMID 22291074 -- &quot;Recurrence and Survival After Random Assignment to Laparoscopy Versus Laparotomy for Comprehensive Surgical Staging of Uterine Cancer: Gynecologic Oncology Group LAP2 Study.&quot; (Walker JL, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012;30(7):695–700)
***Outcome: Median followup 59 months for 2,181 patients. Identical 5-yr survival rate in both arms (89.8%). HR for laparoscopy relative to laparotomy was 1.14 (90% lower bound, 0.92; 95% upper bound, 1.46) (NS). 3-yr recurrence rate - 11.4% laparoscopy and 10.2% Laparotomy. ''Laparoscopy is SAFE''

==Surgical staging studies==
*'''GOG 33''' (1977-83)
**Prospective. 933/1180 patients evaluable, 43 institutions. Endometrial C Stage I and II occult (by curettage), any histologic type. Abdominal hysterectomy, BSO, peritoneal cytology, selective pelvic/aortic LN sampling (not full dissection). Goal to determine incidence of pelvic/aortic LNs as a function of prognostic factors (site of tumor, grade, depth of invasion, capillary space involvement, adnexal metastasis); no prescription for post-op management
**'''Extrauterine risk; 1987''' - PMID 3652025 &amp;mdash; &quot;Surgical pathologic spread patterns of endometrial cancer. A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.&quot; Creasman WT et al. Cancer. 1987 Oct 15;60(8 Suppl):2035-41.
***621 patients with clinical Stage I. Underwent TAH/BSO, selective pelvis and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, peritoneal cytology, endocervical curettage prior to surgery to rule out occult Stage II disease.
***Myometrial invasion (middle/deep): 41%; more likely with higher grade (G1 22%, G2 44%, G3 58%)
***Risk of higher stage on surgery: washings+ (IIIA) 12%, adnexa+ (IIIA) 5%, peritoneal mets+ (IIIA) 6%, pelvic LN+ (IIIC) 9%, PA LN+ (IIIC) 5%, LVSI+ 15%
***Risk of pelvic LN+: Grade (G1 3%, G2 9%, G3 18%); myometrial invasion (superficial 5%, middle 6%, deep 25%); washings+ (7% vs. 25%); adnexal mets (8% vs. 32%); peritoneal mets (7% vs. 51%); LVSI+ (7% vs. 27%). Myometrial invasion more important than grade
***Risk of PA LN+: similar as pelvic LN, also papillary/clear cell type (5% vs. 18%)
***Positive nodes grossly enlarged only 10% of the time, thus dissection is needed, not just palpation alone.
***Risk groups (for nodes):
***:''Low Risk'': Grade 1, endometrium only, no intraperitoneal disease -- 0% pelvic LN, 0% PA
***:''Moderate Risk'': inner or middle myometrial invasion, Grade 2 or 3, no intraperitoneal disease -- one factor only: 3% pelvic, 2% PA. two factors: 6% pelvic, 2% PA
***:''High Risk'': deep myometrial invasion only (18% pelvic, 15% PA), intraperitoneal disease (33%, 8%), both (61%, 30%)
**'''Recurrence risk; 1991''' - PMID 1989916 &amp;mdash; &quot;Relationship between surgical-pathological risk factors and outcome in clinical stage I and II carcinoma of the endometrium: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; Morrow CP et al. Gynecol Oncol. 1991 Jan;40(1):55-65.
***895 patients, Stage I and II (occult), clear cell and papillary serous excluded. Managed per individual physician preference, without restrictions. 
***Risk of recurrence: Stage (IA 1%, inner 8%, middle 14%, outer 15%); Grade (1 4%, 2 12%, 3 18%)
***Risk factors: Mets (PLN+, PALN+, adnexa+, R2) &gt; Grade 3 &gt; IC &gt; LVI+ = washings+ &gt; LUS cytology+, LVI+, LUS/Cervix+
***47 of 48 pts with para-aortic LN had either 1) grossly positive pelvic LN (32% of PLN+), 2) grossly positive adnexal mets (23%), 3) LVI+ (19%) or 4) IC (17%). 
***5-year DFS: 92.7% (no extrauterine disease), 69.8% (Stage II), 56% (positive peritoneal washings), 55% (vascular space invasion), 57.8% (LN+ or adnexal mets), 41.2% (PALN+).
***Conclusion: High probability for PALN+ in IC and G2-3 lesions; significant prognostic information of PALN+, but ~40% survival, so even patients with PALN+ can be cured

'''Lower Uterine Segment'''
*'''Brown University, 2007''' (1999-2004) PMID 17157904 -- &quot;The prognostic significance of lower uterine segment involvement in surgically staged endometrial cancer patients with negative nodes.&quot; (Brown AK, Gynecol Oncol. 2007 Apr;105(1):55-8.)
**Retrospective. 147 patients with TAH/BSO and pathologically negative LNs. 57% had LUS involvement. High risk histology 25%, LVI+ 29%, IC 39%. Follow-up 6.2 years. Not indicated whether/what RT they received
**Outcome: PFS LUS+ 5.8 years vs. LUS- 5.25 years (NS). Recurrence did not correlate with LUS status on multivariate analysis, only LVI+
**Conclusion: In patients with negative LNs, disease within LUS does not imply worse prognosis

==Lymphadenectomy==
*Controversy over whether it is better to do extensive nodal staging or do limited/no nodal staging and frequent adjuvant therapy
*Society of Gynecological Oncologists and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [http://www.sgo.org/publications/endoguidelines.doc guidelines]:
**&quot;Most women with endometrial cancer should undergo complete systematic surgical staging (including assessment of lymph nodes) to help determine appropriate management&quot; 
*Some surgeons believe that visual inspection/palpation is sufficient for Stage IA-B Grade 1-2 based on PMID 16977653, since survival 94-97% regardless
*There are no randomized trials to compare LN sampling vs. full LND, but SEER data as well as other series suggest that complete lymphadenectomy is both diagnostic (for RT field extent) and therapeutic (for improved survival)
*However, the MRC ASTEC randomized trial suggests that performing a pelvic lymph node dissection does not improve outcomes for women with early stage endometrial cancer



*'''Oxford''' PMID 20091639 -- &quot;Lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer.&quot; (May K, Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010 Jan 20;(1):CD007585.)
**Cochrane meta-analysis. 2 RCT, 1851 women with presumed Stage I
**Outcome: No difference in OS (HR 1.07, NS) and RFS (HR 1.23, NS)
**Toxicity: Lymphadenectomy higher risk of surgically-related morbidity
**Conclusion: No evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence, but more surgically-related morbidity


*'''MRC ASTEC''' -- no PLND vs PLND
**Randomized. 1408 women, endometrial CA, clinically confined to corpus. Arm 1) Surgery only (hysterectomy + BSO, peritoneal washings, palpation of PA nodes; suspicious PA nodes could be sampled, 5% done) vs. Arm 2) surgery + lymphadenectomy (iliac and obturator nodes, PA node sampling at discretion of surgeon). Patients at intermediate/high risk (high grade, IC, or IIA) further randomized to the [[Radiation_Oncology/Endometrium/Early_Stage#Adjuvant_RT|ASTEC adjuvant RT trial]], 33% randomized. Primary outcome OS
**'''2009''' PMID 19070889 -- &quot;Efficacy of systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer (MRC ASTEC trial): a randomised study.&quot; (Kitchener H, Lancet. 2009 Jan 10;373(9658):125-36. Epub 2008 Dec 16.). Median F/U 3 years
***Outcome: In PLND arm, 9% had involed nodes (median 12 nodes removed). 5-year OS no PLND 81% vs PLND 80% (NS); two thirds died of their disease (NS)
***Conclusion: No evidence for benefit of pelvic LND in early endometrial CA

*'''Italian Trial''' -- no PLND vs PLND
**Randomized. •514 patients with clinical 1988 stage IB-C endometrial cancer (endometrioid or adenosquamous), excluding 1988 stage IB FIGO grade 1 on intra-op frozen path, underwent TAH-BSO and randomized to Arm 1) Pelvic LND (para-aortic LND at surgeon's discretion) vs Arm 2) No pelvic LND (could remove bulky LN &gt;1cm on palpation). Adjuvant therapy at physician's discretion. Primary endpoint OS.
**'''2008''' PMID 19033573 -- &quot;Systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy vs. no lymphadenectomy in early-stage endometrial carcinoma: randomized clinical trial.&quot; (Pancini, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2008 Dec 3;100(23):1707-16. Median F/U 4.1 years
***Outcome:
****Median LN removed = 30 in PLND arm (median pelvic LN = 26, 26% had para-aortic LN’s removed) vs 0 in no PLND arm (22% had LN removed)
****More early and late post-operative complications with PLND
****Improved staging with PLND (positive LN found in 13% vs 3%, P&lt;0.001)
****No difference in adjuvant treatment (69% vs 65%, P=0.07 PLND vs no PLND)
****No difference in 5 yr DFS (81% vs 82%, P=0.68), PLND vs no PLND
****No difference in 5 yr OS (86% vs 90%, P=0.50), PLND vs no PLND
***Conclusion:  PLND is prognostic but not therapeutic, improving staging but not affecting outcome.
***Criticism: PMID 19509367- No systemic para-aortic LND, adjuvant therapy not standardized, included relatively low risk population (evidenced by only 13% with pelvic LN mets).

*'''US SEER data, 2006''' (1988-2001) PMID 16977653 -- &quot;Therapeutic role of lymph node resection in endometrioid corpus cancer: a study of 12,333 patients.&quot; (Chan JK, Cancer. 2006 Oct 15;107(8):1823-30.)
**Population-based. 12,333 women who underwent surgical staging with lymph node assessment; 73% Stage I. 
**In intermediate/high-risk patients (IB G3, IC, II-IV): more extensive LN dissection (1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20, &gt;20) associated with improved 5-year DFS (75%, 82%, 84%, 85%, 87%, SS); In stage IIIC-IV: survival benefit 51%, 53%, 60%, 72% (SS)
**In low-risk patients (IA G1-3, IB G1-2): no benefit of LN dissection
**Conclusion: Extent of LN dissection improves survival in intermediate/high-risk groups

**Retrospective. 509 pts. Clinical stage I-IIA.
**Pts with poorly differentiated tumors and more than 11 lymph nodes removed had improved survival and PFS compared with those with &lt; 11 LN.  Number of nodes removed was not predictive for grades 1-2.

**Retrospective study. 649 pts. Compared multiple site pelvic node sampling (mean 11 nodes) vs limited site sampling (mean 4 nodes) vs no sampling. 
**Conclusion: Improved overall survival for pts with multiple site sampling vs no sampling

**Retrospective. 1289 patients, 74 patients with lymphedema due to other medical condition excluded. Median F/U 3 years
**Rate of lymphedema: overall 1.2%; initial surgery 2.4% vs. later 0% (SS); &gt;10 LN removed 3.4% vs. &lt;10 LN 0% (SS). Developed median 5 months after surgery; unilateral 69%, bilateral 31%
**Conclusion: Lymphedema risk highest for &gt;10 LN and LND during initial operation (3.4%); overall rates reasonably low (1.2%)

*Seen postoperatively in up to 30% of GYN surgeries with pelvic/para-aortic LND
*Believed to arise from surgical transsection or inadequate ligation of draining lymphatics
*Lymphatic fluid may accumulate in various pelvic and retroperitoneal compartments
*Small lymphoceles typically resorb spontaneously
*Large lymphoceles may cause compression symptoms, and may result in abdominal distention, abdominal and pelvic pain, hydronephrosis, bladder dysfunction, constipation, tenesmus, edema of the ipsilateral leg and of the genitalia, and thromboembolism of iliac vessels
*Infection may cause fever, chills, and sepsis 
*Symptomatic lymphoceles are typically managed initially with percutaneous CT-guided drainage, surgical therapy may be required

&lt;big&gt;Early Stage Endometrial Cancer (Stage I-II)&lt;/big&gt;


==Preop BT vs EBRT==
*'''St. Louis/Peoria, Illinois''' (1968-1975) -- Intrauterine BT vs EBRT
**Randomized. 105 patients, adenocarcinoma, FIGO clinical Stage I. Arm 1) Single implant Cs-137 with Heyman capsules and/or T&amp;O 6000-6500 mg-hrs vs Arm 2) EBRT 40/20
**'''1984''' PMID 6360334 -- &quot;Preoperative radiation therapy in Stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma. II. Final report of a clinical trial.&quot; (Weigensberg IJ, Cancer. 1984 Jan 15;53(2):242-7.)
***Outcome: pCR at surgery BT 49% vs 30%; pelvic failure 4% vs 13%; 5-year DFS BT 80% vs EBRT 70%; 10-year DFS 67% vs 59%. Half recurrences in pelvis
***Toxicity: BT 46% vs EBRT 24%
***Conclusion: Intracavitary radiation is superior to EBRT

==Pre-op RT vs. Adjuvant RT==
*'''GOG 16'''
**Randomized. Clinical Stage I, Grade 1-3. ''Closed early due to non-accrual.''


==Adjuvant RT==
*4 randomized trials published thus far
**The Norwegian trial randomized patients with surgical Stage I (but no lymph node dissection) and brachytherapy to +/- EBRT. There was local control overall, but survival benefit only for Stage IC G3
**The PORTEC trial randomized patients with intermediate-risk Stage I (specifically no IC G3; no lymph node dissection) to +/- EBRT. There was local control benefit, but no survival benefit
**The GOG 99 trial randomized patients with Stage IB-IC or occult IIA-IIB (selective LND) to +/- EBRT. There was local control benefit, but no survival benefit
**Data from ASTEC/CTG EN.5 trials randomizing patients with IC-IIA or IA-IIAG3 or serous papillary/clear cell (PLND done per institution) to +/- EBRT. Approximately 50% of patients in observation arm received vaginal brachytherapy. There was no OS or DFS benefit, and higher toxicity
**Due to low number of events, none of the trials were really powered to show overall survival benefit. Endpoint for GOG 99 was DFS
**Cochrane meta-analysis didn't find benefit for EBRT in IA-ICG2, but found 10% survival benefit in ICG3
*SEER Registry population-based analysis revealed statistically significant benefit for survival with adjuvant radiation in Stage IC patients, but not IA-B
*A Japanese randomized trial comparing pelvic RT vs. chemotherapy in patients with &gt;50% myometrial invasion (Stage IC-IV) found no overall difference in PFS or OS, and on subset found benefit in high risk patients in favor of chemotherapy
*PORTEC 2 has been published (see below) comparing EBRT vs BT (but excluding ICG3). BT had slightly higher pelvic failure rate (NS), but no impact on OS, and was felt to be the standard of care for these patients



===Randomized===
'''''Meta-analysis'''''
*'''Cochrane; 2007''' PMID 17803718 -- &quot;Survival and recurrent disease after postoperative radiotherapy for early endometrial cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.&quot; (Johnson N, BJOG. 2007 Nov;114(11):1313-20. Epub 2007 Sep 5.)
**Cochrane methodology. 5 randomized trials. 
**&lt;u&gt;Low-risk&lt;/u&gt; disease (IA, IBG1-2): EBRT worsens survival (OR for death without RT 0.71, SS)
**&lt;u&gt;Intermediate-risk&lt;/u&gt; disease (IBG3, ICG1-2): EBRT doesn't alter survival (OR 0.97, NS)
**&lt;u&gt;High-risk&lt;/u&gt; disease (ICG3): EBRT offers DFS benefit (OR 1.76, SS), and benefits 1/10 women
**Conclusion: Adjuvant EBRT should not be used for IA, IB, or IC G1-2 disease. There is a 10% survival advantage for IC G3 patients


'''''Randomized'''''
*'''PORTEC 2''' (2002-2006) -- Pelvic EBRT 46/23 vs. vaginal BT 21/3
**Randomized. 427 patients, intermediate-high risk endometrial CA. Eligible if: (1) age greater than 60 years and stage 1C grade 1 or 2 disease, or stage 1B grade 3 disease; and (2) stage 2A disease, any age (apart from grade 3 with greater than 50% myometrial invasion). TAH/BSO, PLND not allowed. Excluded papillary serous and clear cell. Arm 1) EBRT 46/23 vs. Arm 2) HDR 21/3 or LDR 30/1. Primary endpoint vaginal relapse.

***Outcome: 3-year vaginal relapse EBRT 2.0% vs. VBT 0.9% (NS), pelvic relapse 0.7% vs. 3.6% (SS), OS 90% vs. 91% (NS)
***Toxicity: Significantly higher rate of diarrhea, persisted &gt;2 years in EBRT group
***Conclusion: Vaginal BT effective in preventing vaginal recurrences, with slightly higher pelvic failure rate, but no impact on RFS or OS. Quality of life better, so should be considered standard for these patients
***Comment: [http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/conferences/article.cfm?c=3&amp;s=48&amp;ss=269&amp;id=1784 Oncolink at UPenn]

***QoL evaluated by EORTC QoL-C30, PR-25, and OV-28 questionnaires. 348 patients (81%) evaluable for QoL. Median F/U 2 years
***Outcome: VBT better social functioning (SS), and significantly improved diarrhea, fecal leakage, need to stay close to the toilet, and limitation of daily activities due to bowel symptoms (SS). No difference in sexual functioning (~40%)
***Conclusion: EBRT patients significantly worse diarrhea and bowel symptoms, and worse social functioning

***Outcome: 5-year vaginal recurrence VBT 1.8% vs EBRT 1.6% (NS); 5-year loco-regional relapse 5.1% vs 2.1% (NS); isolated pelvic recurrence 1.5% vs 0.5% (NS); DM 8.3% vs 5.7% (NS). 5-year OS 85% vs 80% (NS).
***Toxicity: Acute G1-2 at completion of RT VBT 13% vs EBRT 54%
***Conclusion: VBT is effective, with fewer toxic effects
***Editorial (PMID 20206759): Agree that VBT should be the standard of care for these patients

*'''MRC ASTEC and NCIC CTG EN.5''' (1996-2005) -- EBRT vs Observation
**Two randomized trials merged in 1998 to pool results and facilitate data monitoring. 906 Stage I-IIA endometrial CA patients, with intermediate or high risk features (one or more of the following: IA-IB Grade 3, IC Grade 1-3, serous papillary or clear cell type, FIGO stage IIa). PLND not required; women with positive pelvic LN eligible for ASTEC but not EN.5. Para-aortic LN+ excluded. Peritoneal washings could be negative, positive, or not done. Arm 1) EBRT 40-46 Gy daily vs. Arm 2) observation. BT allowed by institutional preference (ASTEC HDR 8/2 or LDR 15/1, EN.5 per institution), BT given in 51% of observation arm vs. 5% of EBRT arm
**Patient characteristics: 30% PLND; 84% endometrioid; IA 3%, IB 20%, IC 77%; Grade 1 26%, Grade 2 42%, Grade 3 31%. Brachy given to 52% patients in both arms

***5-year outcome: OS 84% both groups (NS), DSS 89% (NS); small difference in isolated vaginal/pelvic recurrence with brachytherapy
***Morbidity: EBRT 56% vs. no EBRT 24%; Grade 3+ toxicity rare
***Conclusion: EBRT alone not indicated due to no benefit on OS/DFS, but higher toxicity
**'''RT; 2009''' PMID 19070891 -- &quot;Adjuvant external beam radiotherapy in the treatment of endometrial cancer (MRC ASTEC and NCIC CTG EN.5 randomised trials): pooled trial results, systematic review, and meta-analysis.&quot; (ASTEC/EN.5 Study Group, Lancet. 2009 Jan 10;373(9658):137-46.

***Subset analysis: No difference in intermediate risk, high risk, no PLND, and PLND for both OS and DSS
***Toxicity: Any acute toxicity OBS 27% vs. EBRT 57%, Grade 3 &lt;1% vs. 3%; Any late toxicity 45% vs. 61%, any Grade 3-4 3% vs. 8%
***Updated Meta-analysis (GOG99, PORTEC1, ASTEC/EN.5): HR 1.04 for benefit of RT (0.84-1.29, NS)
***Conclusion: Adjuvant EBRT cannot be recommended as part of routine treatment for women with intermediate/high risk early stage endometrial CA. There is no benefit on OS or DFSS, and absolute benefit for isolated local recurrence is small and not without toxicity

***Two different questions, but due to overlap don't answer either one

*'''PORTEC 1''' (The Netherlands)(1990-1997)
**Randomized. 715 patients with Stage IB (G2-3) or IC (G1-2), specifically no IC G3. TAH/BSO with washings, not allowed to have lymphadenectomy. Allowed adenocarcinoma and variants (including papillary serous and clear cell).
**Randomized to postoperative EBRT 46 Gy vs no further therapy. Fields: superior border at L5/S1.

PORTEC Study Group. Post Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma.&quot; Creutzberg CL et al. Lancet. 2000 Apr 22;355(9213):1404-11. Median F/U 4.3 years
***5-year outcome: LRF: 4% vs 14% (SS); 73% of recurrences in vagina. DM unaffected (7%). OS same (80% vs 84%, NS) with ~50% deaths due to other causes
***Salvage: Most LR salvaged, which may explain why the survival is similar in both arms despite a difference in LR. 3-year OS after vaginal relapse 69% vs. 13% for pelvic or DM. 
***Toxicity: RT 25% vs. 6% (SS); excess of secondary cancers of the GI tract, which is associated with endometrial cancer. 
***Prognostic: Age &gt;60, G3, IC predictive for LR; If 2 of 3 criteria, LR 23% vs. 4% (SS)
***Conclusion: EBRT reduces LR but has no impact on survival. Don't recommend if &lt;60 or if IB G2

***By site: GI 20% (3% severe); GU 8% (no severe); bone 2% (no severe); vagina 1% (no severe)
***Time course: ~50% Grade 1-2 resolved over time (2-3 years), but not in Grade 3-4 complications
***Technique: 4F box lower risk; 4F 21% vs. AP/PA 30% vs. 3F 36% (p=0.06)
***Conclusion: Severe complications 3%, mild complications 20%. RT use requires careful consideration, since no survival benefit
***Comment: Reporting done differently between the 2 arms, special form for acute RT toxicity. Also, surgeons don't report large midline scar as a complication while transient erythema is one

***Poor prognosis for LR: age &gt;60, Stage IC, Grade 3. LVI poor prognosis for DM
***Conclusion: In view of significant LR control benefit, RT indicated if high-risk features (2 of 3: age &gt;60, G3, IC)
**&lt;u&gt;Comment&lt;/u&gt;: Since ~50% deaths due to competing causes, overall survival not a good metric. Number of events even less than GOG-99, since high risk IC G3 disallowed. Trial not really powered to show survival difference.

**Randomized. 392 patients, treated with TAH/BSO, selective PLN and PALND. Originally included &quot;intermediate risk&quot; -- stages IB, IC, and II (occult), any grade, with negative LN.  Revised during the course of study to enroll only &quot;high intermediate risk&quot; group expected to have 25% recurrence risk based on increasing age, G2-3 tumor, LVI, or outer 1/3 myometrial invasion: 1) &gt;70 yrs old with only 1 other risk factor, 2) &gt;50 yrs old with 2 risk factors; 3) any age with 3 risk factors. Randomized to Arm 1) no additional treatment vs Arm 2) postoperative pelvic EBRT. Fields: superior border at L4/L5, lateral borders 1cm beyond pelvis, posterior border at posterior border of S3, ant border at symphysis pubis. Dose: 50.4 Gy. No brachytherapy

***Outcome: 2-year recurrence rate: 3% vs 12% (SS). 2-year isolated LR 2% vs 7%.  4-year OS 92% vs 86% (NS). In HIR subgroup (34%): 2-yr recurrence, 6% vs 26%.
***Conclusion: Strong benefit for adjuvant EBRT in high intermediate risk group
**&lt;u&gt;Comment&lt;/u&gt;: OS not primary survival, not powered for it. Primary end-point DFS, which was significantly better with RT

*'''Norwegian Radium Hospital''' -- VBT alone vs VBT + EBRT
**Randomized. 540 patients with surgical Stage I. All patients had TAH/BSO (no lymphadenectomy) + postoperative brachytherapy 60 Gy to the surface of the vagina (~40 Gy LDR @ 0.5cm and ~ 24 Gy HDR @ 0.5 cm). Then randomized to no further treatment vs pelvic RT  40 Gy (central shielding after 20 Gy)

***9-year outcome: OS BT alone 90% vs BT+EBRT 87% (NS). EBRT decreased LR (7% vs 2%) but there were more distant mets (5% vs 10%, borderline SS).  Similar recurrence rate in both groups, but more deaths in XRT group. 
***Subset analysis: Improved OS for BT+EBRT in IC Grade 3 (82% vs. 72%); probably due to improved local control (LR 5% vs. 20%) with comparable DM (14% vs. 15%). IC G1-2 had no difference in OS, LR, and DM.
***Poor prognosis: Age &gt;60, Stage IC, Grade 3, LVI+
***Conclusion: No benefit for EBRT after vaginal BT, except for Stage IC G3 patients

'''''Risk of Vaginal Relapse'''''
*In PORTEC: risk of vaginal relapse in surgery only arm was IBG2 5%, IBG3 14%, ICG1 10%, and ICG2 13% (personnal communication in PMID 16814156)
*In ASTEC/EN.5: risk of isolated vaginal or pelvic relapse: observation (50% received BT): 6% vs. EBRT 3%
*Rosewell Park (PMID 19944453): 3.4% in &quot;high risk&quot; patients treated with VB alone
*PORTEC2 editorial (PMID 20206759): Without any radiotherapy the risk of vaginal relapse is 10-14% based on GOG92 and PORTEC

*'''SEER; 2012''' (UNC) (1988-2006) PMID 21640502 -- &quot;The influence of radiation modality and lymph node dissection on survival in early-stage endometrial cancer.&quot; (Chino JP, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Apr 1;82(5):1872-9.)
**SEER database. 56,360 pts with Stage IA or IB (using FIGO 2009 staging), negative lymph nodes if sampled. 70% were low risk, 26% intermediate, and 3% high. 42% underwent lymph node dissection. 17% had RT: 9.4% WPRT alone, 4.6% VB alone, and a combination in 3.7%.
**RT was used less frequently over the later years of the study, decreasing from 25% in 1988 to 16% in 2006. (The drop was from a decrease in the use of WPRT. The use of VB alone and combination EBRT+VB remained stable.) The use of LND increased: 16.2% to 59.5%.
**In low-risk disease, LND was associated with higher survival; RT was not.  In intermediate-risk, both LND and RT were associated with higher survival; there were no differences between RT modalities.  In high risk, both LND and RT were associated with increased survival; VB alone was inferior to WPRT if LND was not performed.
**Conclusion: &quot;Both WPRT and VB alone are associated with increased survival in the intermediate-risk group. In the high-risk group, in the absence of LND, only WPRT is associated with increased survival. LND was also associated with increased survival.&quot;

**Population-based. 21,249 patients with Stage IA-IC on TAH/BSO and pathologic staging, N0 endometrial adenocarcinoma. Adjuvant RT in 19% (62% EBRT, 18% BT, 26% EBRT+BT). Median F/U 3.8 years.
**Outcome: 4-year OS 86% (3% dead due to endometrial CA, 10% dead due to other causes) 
**Adjuvant RT improved OS in Stage IC G1 (SS) and IC G3-4 (SS)
**Conclusion: Statistically significant improvement in survival in Stage IC disease

**Purpose: to evaluate the results of patients treated with EBRT alone without VB.
**Retrospective. 61 pts with Stage IC. EBRT alone to a median dose of 48.6 Gy (range: 43.2-50.4 Gy). No pts received VB.
**Median f/u 69.5 months. 5-yr DFS 86.7%, OS 97.6%. No pt had a local / vaginal recurrence.
**Conclusion: local control was excellent with EBRT without VB

==Adjuvant RT +/- Chemo==
*'''EORTC 55991''' (1996-2006) -- RT vs sequential RT-&gt;Chemo

&lt;big&gt;Locally Advanced Endometrial Cancer (III-IV)&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview==
*Stage III and IV disease represents ~16% of endometrial cancer
*Systemic chemotherapy is superior to whole abdominal radiation, based on GOG 122. However, chemotherapy alone has pelvic relapse rates of 20-40%, and 5-year OS only 50%
*Addition of chemotherapy to pelvic radiation in two European randomized trials (NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 and MaNGO ILIADE-III) improved progression-free survival and trended to improved overall survival
*GOG 184, which evaluated incorporation of paclitaxel into the chemotherapy regimen, used postoperative radiation as a standard component
*Retrospective multi-institutional data suggests improved OS with combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, delivered as a &quot;sandwich&quot; (chemotherapy -&gt; radiation therapy -&gt; chemotherapy)

==Sequential chemotherapy with radiation therapy==
*'''Albert Einstein; 2012''' PMID 22035806 -- &quot;Phase II trial of adjuvant pelvic radiation &quot;sandwiched&quot; between combination paclitaxel and carboplatin in women with uterine papillary serous carcinoma.&quot; (Einstein MH, Gynecol Oncol. 2012 Jan;124(1):21-5. Epub 2011 Oct 27.)
**Phase II. 81 patients (89% completed chemo-&gt;RT and are reported here), surgically staged UPSC, no visible residual. Stage I/II 82%, Stage III/IV 18%. Adjuvant paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 Q3 weeks x 3 cycles, followed by RT (pelvis 45/25, PA if 2+ pelvic nodes or documented PA disease, HDR vaginal brachytherapy 5 Gy x 3 at 0.5 cm), followed by chemotherapy x 3 cycles
**Outcome: Stage I/II OS 6.3 years, Stage III/IV OS 3.0 years. 3-year OS 84% and 50%. PFS 5.4 years and 2.1 years
**Toxicity: G3/4 non-hematologic toxicity 2.5%
**Conclusion: RT-chemotherapy &quot;sandwich&quot; well tolerated and high efficacious in completely resected UPSC 

*'''NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 and MaNGO ILIADE-III'''
**NSGO-9501/EORTC-5591 (1996-2007): endometrial cancer, status post surgery, Stage I (high risk), Stage II, Stage IIIA (only positive cytology) and Stage IIIC (only positive pelvic lymph nodes). Arm 1) adjuvant RT only vs Arm 2) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Sequence of therapy elective. Pelvic RT. Vaginal brachytherapy ~40%. Chemotherapy several alternative regimens. 383 patients accrued.
**MaNGO ILIADE-III (1998-2007): endometrioid cancer, Stage IIB, IIIA-IIIC (arm IIIA with cytology only excluded), serous/clear cell excluded. Arm 1) adjuvant RT only vs Arm 2) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Pelvic RT 45/25, PA-field as needed to L1/L2. Vaginal brachytherapy if cervical stromal involvement. Chemotherapy doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 Q3W x 3 cycles. 157 patients accrued
**'''Pooled Results; 2010''' PMID 20619634 -- &quot;Sequential adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in endometrial cancer--results from two randomised studies.&quot; (Hogberg T, Eur J Cancer. 2010 Sep;46(13):2422-31. Epub 2010 Jul 7.)
***Outcome: 5-year PFS RT 69% vs RT-CT 78% (HR 0.6, SS), 5-year OS RT 75% vs RT-CT 82% (HR 0.7, p=0.07). Subset analysis shows no benefit of chemotherapy for serous/clear cell, while significant benefit for endometrioid
***Conclusion: Addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation improves progression free survival, with trend to improved overall survival

Randomized to WAI (30 Gy, 20 fx, AP/PA plus boost to pelvic +/- para-aortic LN 15 Gy in 8 fx) vs chemotherapy (AP; doxorubicin + cisplatin q3w x 8 cycles).

***5-year outcome: PFS raw RT 38% vs. chemo 42% (p not given), stage-adjusted  38% vs. 50% (SS); raw OS RT 42% vs. chemo 53% (p not given), stage-adjusted (despite it being ranomized trial) 42% vs. 52% (SS)
***Recurrence locations: WAI: recurrence in 54% (pelvic in 13%, abdomen in 16%, distant 22%). For chemo: 50% recurrence (18%,14%,18%)
***Grade 3-4 Toxicity: hematologic RT 14% vs. chemo 88%, GI 13% vs. 20%, cardiac 0% vs. 15%, neurologic 1% vs. 7%
***Conclusion: chemotherapy improves PFS and OS for advanced disease, compared with whole abdomen RT, though with significant toxicity
**Comment: Despite this being a randomized trial, the chemo arm was stage-adjusted during analysis. Argument was that it had worse prognosis patients (presumably the Stage IIIC, however, LN+ was not a prognostic variable in the study itself). The whole abdomen arm also had bad prognosis patients (IIIA with serosal/adnexal mets). The raw OS result are still significantly better for the chemo arm, but raw PFS was comparable in the two arms (38% vs. 42%). The statistical rationale is not justified, and thus questionable

&lt;big&gt;'''Endometrial Brachytherapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy==
===Overview===
*Treat upper proximal 3-5cm for endometrioid, treat entire vagina for clear cell and UPSC 
*For ICRT only: LDR dose 50-60 Gy at 0.5 cm depth over 72 hrs (70-80 cGy/hr). HDR dose 21 Gy (7 Gy x 3 at 0.5 cm).
*For EBRT + ICRT: LDR dose 30 Gy. HDR dose 15 Gy (5 Gy x 3 at 0.5 cm) or 6 Gy x 3 (at surface).

===American Brachytherapy Society===
*'''HDR Recommendations; 2000''' PMID 11020575 &amp;mdash; &quot;The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for high-dose-rate brachytherapy for carcinoma of the endometrium.&quot; Nag S et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Oct 1;48(3):779-90.
**Prescription documentation: Treatment site, radionuclide, prescribed absorbed dose, fractionation, prescription point, type of applicator, optimization points, method of optimization, number of dwell positions, relative dwell weights, isodose distribution
**Localization: Use localization radiographs in treatment position
**Doses: see table below
**Dose specification:
***Endometrioid: treat proximal 3-5 cm of the vagina
***Clear cell and UPSC: treat entire vaginal canal
***Prescribe to either surface or 0.5 cm depth
***Report both surface and depth doses
***Place optimiaztion points on both lateral surfaces, along the curved portion of the cylinder dome, and at the apex 
***Use proper anisotropic calculations
**Optimization:
***Dose distribution should satisfy physician requirements, not just optimization specs
***Dwell positions should not extend beyond target to avoid overdosing normal structures
***High-dose heterogeneity within normal tissues is not acceptable
***Process should not be too time-consuming
**Treatment review (second check):
***Dosimetry data are correct
***Absorbed dose prescription point, absorbed dose per fraction, number of fractions are per facility protocol
***Absorbed dose distribution plan matches the prescription
***Reconstructed applicator geometry matches the radiograph
***Distance from machine reference point to the most distant dwell position is consistent with treatment plan
***Absorbed doses to normal tissues are within tolerances
***Dwell times for the generated plan are within a range consistent with those for similar patients
***Programmed treatment data (dwell times, locations, step sizes) match those on the plan
***Subsequent fractions using the same plan are performed with the correct data and the current source activity, and treatment time is adjusted accordingly
***HDR source activity for the treatment day is corrected for source decay in the treatment planning system/console computer and verified by a separate independently calculated source decay chart or method
**Other checks for multifraction treatment
***Use of correct applicator for each fraction
***Reproduced applicator position
**Doses
***To calculate LDR equivalent, use dose-modifying factor 0.7 for late effects
***Recommended doses in tables below, depending on EBRT and prescription depth:

===Dose Evaluation===
*'''Oreboro; Sweden''' (1989-2003)
**Randomized. 290 low-risk (endometrioid, Stage IA-B, Grade 1-2, &lt;50% myometrial infiltration, diploid DNA, pLN-, washings-), Stage IA 62%, Stage IB 38%. Vaginal cylinders 20-30 mm, dose prescription 5mm depth. All received 6 fractions in 8 days, randomized to Arm 1) 2.5 Gy/fractions (total 15 Gy) or Arm 2) 5.0 Gy/fx (total 30 Gy). Colpometric measurements of vaginal shortening pretreatment and at 5 years

**30 patients. Dosimetric evaluation of &quot;natural&quot; insertion angle vs. horizontal insertion angle (determined by a level). Prescription 5.5 Gy at 0.5 cm depth. ICRU rectal and Bladder points used
**Outcome: Mean change in angle of 19.7 degrees, resulting in mean absolute dose reduction of 1.3 Gy to rectum, but increase of 0.5 Gy to bladder
**Conclusion: Vaginal BT should be performed in &quot;corrected&quot; horizontal position to reduce bowel dose at expense of bladder dose


===Retrospective===

**Retrospective. 157 pts. Treated with surgery + external beam RT. Compared pts with or without vaginal cuff boost of 30-50 Gy surface dose.
**No difference in local control (but higher risk features in the group receiving brachy).
**Conclusion: Adding vaginal cuff boost to EBRT does not improve local control

**Literature review. 13 series, 1800 cases. Wide range of fractionation schedules; BED calculated using LQ model
**Outcome: vaginal control rate 99%. No threshold for tumor control, moderate dose (BED10 ~50 Gy) appeared tumoricidal with control rate at least 98%. 3 series using 21/3 showed 0% toxicity and 98-100% control rate
**Toxicity: BED3 &gt;100 Gy predicted for late complications
**Conclusion: HDR brachytherapy yields high local control and extremely low morbidity using modest dose fractionation schedules

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

This book covers a sub-field of Music Technology called ''sound synthesis''. Although the ''tone'' is generally aimed at musicians and people with little prior knowledge of music systems, there may be some mathematical concepts and programming techniques that are not familiar. The book focuses on synthesis from a digital perspective rather than an analogue one, since it aims to demonstrate the theory of digital synthesis rather than applications to a specific medium or piece of software. 

[[Image:Korg_ms10.jpg|400px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The Korg MS10 is an example of an early analogue synthesizer.&lt;/center&gt;]] 

==What is sound synthesis?==

Sound synthesis is the technique of generating sound, using electronic hardware or software, from scratch. The most common use of synthesis is musical, where electronic instruments called synthesizers are used in the performance and recording of music. Sound synthesis has many applications both academic and artistic, and we commonly use synthesizers and synthesis methods to:

* Generate interesting and unique sounds or timbres incapable of being produced acoustically.
* Recreate or model the sounds of real-world acoustic instruments or sounds.
* Facilitate the automation of systems and processes (text-to-speech software, train station P.A.s)

==Background and history==

One of the earliest musical synthesizers was Thaddeus Cahill's Teleharmonium, presented to an audience of about nine hundred in 1906. This massive instrument defined a fundamental synthesis technique called additive synthesis which used combinations of pure tones to generate its sounds. Other early synthesizers used technology derived from electronic analog computers, laboratory test equipment, and early electronic musical instruments. However, it was not until the late 1960s that technology had developed far enough for synthesizers to be a commercial success, most notably with Robert Moog's ''modular'' and ''mini-modular'' analogue synthesizers. 

Since the late 1980s most new synthesizers have been completely digital. At the same time analogue synthesis has also revived in popularity, so in recent years the two trends have combined in the appearance of virtual analog synthesizers, digital synthesizers which model analog synthesis using digital signal processing techniques. Digital synthesizers use digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to make musical sounds. Some digital synthesizers now exist in the form of 'softsynth' software that synthesizes sound using conventional PC hardware. Others use specialized DSP hardware.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Sound in the Digital Domain}}


Digital systems (e.g. computers) and formats (e.g. CD) are clearly the most popular and commonplace methods of storing and manipulating audio. Since the introduction of the [[w:Compact disc|compact disc]] in the early 1980's, the digital format has provided increasingly greater storage capacity and the ability to store audio information at an acceptable quality. Although ''analogue'' formats still exist  ([[w:vinyl record|vinyl]], [[w:Tape|tape]]), they typically serve a niche audience. Digital systems are ubiquitous in modern music technology. It must be stressed that there is no argument as to whether one domain, be it analogue or digital is superior, but the following provides some desirable features of working with audio in the digital domain.

* ''Storage''. The amount of digital audio data capable of being stored on a modern hard drive is far greater than a tape system. Furthermore, we can choose the quality of the captured audio data, which relates directly to file size and other factors.

* ''Control''. By storing audio information in digital, we can perform powerful and complex operations on the data that would be extremely difficult to realise otherwise.

* ''Durability''. Digital audio can be copied across devices without any loss of information. Furthermore, many systems employ [[w:error correction|error correction codes]] to compensate for wear and tear on a physical digital format such as a compact disc.

==Digital &lt;-&gt; Analogue Conversion==

Acoustic information (sound waves) are treated as ''signals''. As demonstrated in the previous chapter, we traditionally view these signals as varying amplitude over time. In analogue systems, this generally means that the amplitude is represented by a ''continuous'' voltage; but inside a digital system, the signal must be stored as a stream of ''discrete'' values.

Digital data stored in this way has no real ''physical'' meaning; one could describe a song on a computer as just an [[w:Array|array]] of numbers; these numbers are meaningless unless there exists within the system a process that can interpret each number in sequence appropriately. '''Fig. 2.1''' shows an overview of the process of capturing analogue sound and converting it into a digital stream of numbers for storage and manipulation in such a system. The steps are as follows:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid grey; padding: 5px; width: 85%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;&gt;
'''1'''. An input such as a microphone converts acoustic air pressure variations (sound waves) into variations in voltage.

'''2'''. An analogue to digital converter (ADC) converts the varying voltage into a stream of digital values by taking a 'snapshot' of the  voltage at a point in time and assigning it a value depending on its amplitude. It typically takes these 'snapshots' thousands of times a second, the rate at which is known as the ''sample rate''.

'''3'''. The numerical data is stored on the digital system and then subsequently manipulated or analysed by the user.

'''4'''. The numerical data is re-read and streamed out of the digital system.

'''5'''. A digital to analogue converter (DAC) converts the stream of digital values back to a varying voltage.

'''6'''. A loudspeaker converts the voltage to variations in air pressure (sound).
&lt;/div&gt;

Although the signal at each stage comes in a different form (sound energy, digital values etc.), the information is ''analogous''. However, due to the nature of the conversion process, this data may become manipulated and distorted. For instance, low values for sample rates or other factors at the ADC might mean that the continuous analogue signal is not represented with enough detail and subsequently the information will be distorted. There are also imperfections in physical devices such as microphones which further &quot;colour&quot; the signal in some way. It is for this reason that musicians and engineers aim to use the most high-quality equipment and processes in order to preserve the integrity of the original sound throughout the process. Musicians and engineers must consider what other processes their music will go through before consumption, too (radio transmission etc.).

==Sampling==

Sound waves in their natural acoustic form can be considered ''continuous''; that is, their time-domain graphs are smooth lines on all zoom factors without any ''breaks'' or ''jumps''. We cannot have these breaks, or ''discontinuities'' because sound cannot switch instantaneously between two values. An example of this may be an idealised waveform like a [[w:Square wave|square wave]] - on paper, it switches between 1 and -1 amplitude at a point instantaneously; however a loudspeaker cannot, by the laws of physics, jump between two points in no time at all, the cone has to travel through a continuous path from one point to the next.

[[Image:Zeroorderhold.signal.svg|400px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 2.2'''. Discrete samples (red) of a continuous waveform (grey).&lt;/center&gt;]] 

''Sampling'' is the process of taking a continuous, acoustic waveform and converting it into a digital stream of discrete numbers. An ADC measures the amplitude of the input at a regular rate creating a stream of values which represent the waveform in digital. The output is then created by passing these values to the DAC, which drives a loudspeaker appropriately. By measuring the amplitude many thousands of times a second, we create a &quot;picture&quot; of the sound which is of sufficient quality to human ears. The more and more we increase this ''sample rate'', the more accurately a waveform is represented and reproduced.

===Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem===

The frequency of a signal has implications for its representation, especially at very high frequencies. As discussed in the previous chapter, the frequency of a sine wave is the number of cycles per second. If we have a sample rate of 20000 samples per second (20Khz), it is clear that a high frequency sinusoid such as 9000 Hz is going to have less &quot;snapshots&quot; than a sinusoid at 150 Hz. Eventually there reaches a point where there are not enough sample points to be able to record the cycle of a waveform, which leads us to the following important result:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The sample rate of a system defines the maximum representable frequency, which is half the sample rate.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Why is this? The minimum number of sample points required to represent a sine wave is two. It may seem apparent at this time that using just two points to represent a continuous curve such as a sinusoid would result in a crude approximation - a square wave. And, inside the digital system, this is true. However, both ADCs and DACs have [[w:Audio filter|low-pass filters]] set at half the sample rate (the highest representable frequency). What this means for input and output is that ''any'' frequency above the cut-off point is removed and it follows from this that the crude sine representation - a square wave in theory - becomes filtered down to a single frequency (i.e. a sine wave). From this, we have two mathematical results:


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F_{s} \ge 2 f_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{N} = \frac{F_{s}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;F_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample rate, &lt;math&gt;f_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the highest frequency in the signal. &lt;math&gt;F_{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the highest possible frequency that can be represented with &lt;math&gt;F_{s}&lt;/math&gt;, and is known as the ''Nyquist frequency''. Frequencies over the Nyquist frequency do not exist due to the presence of filters to block them; without such processes there would be frequency component foldover, otherwise known as ''aliasing''.

===Sampling accuracy and bit depth===

It has been established that the higher the sample rate, the more accurate the representation of a waveform in a digital system. However, although there are many reasons and arguments for higher sample rates, there are two general standards: ''44100'' samples per second and ''48000'' samples per second, with the former being most commonplace. The main consideration for this is the fact that the human hearing range extends, at maximum, to an approximate limit (that varies from person to person) of '''20000''' Hz. Frequencies above this are inaudible. Considering the example of 44.1 Khz, we find that the Nyquist frequency evaluates to ''22050'' Hz, which is more than the human hearing system is capable of perceiving. There are other reasons for this particular sample rate, but that is beyond the scope of this book.

[[Image:SSampling.png|500px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 2.3'''. Effects of increased sample rate and bit depth on representing a continuous analogue signal.&lt;/center&gt;]] 


There is one more important factor to consider when considering the sampling process: ''bit depth''. Bit depth represents the precision with which the amplitude is measured. In the same way that there are a limited amount of samples per second in a conversion process, there are also a limited amount of amplitude values for a sample point, and the greater the number, the greater the accuracy. A common bit resolution found in most standard digital audio systems (Hi-Fi, Compact Disc) is 16 binary [[w:Bit|bits]] which allows for a range of 65536 (&lt;math&gt;2^{16}&lt;/math&gt;) individual amplitude values at a point in time. Lower bit values result in a greater distortion of the sound - a two bit system (&lt;math&gt;2^2&lt;/math&gt;) only allows for four different amplitudes, which results in a massively inaccurate approximation of the input signal.

==The appearance and behaviour of sound waves==
The metric (acoustical) definition of sound is variation in pressure waves and density caused by the propagation of the waves through a medium. Between about 25Hz, and 18kHz, human hearing systems sense these waves as they cause the ear drum to move. This mechanical movement is transduced into electrochemical signals in the cochlea as nerve impulses, and sent to the auditory region of the brain for analysis. Sound waves, being variation in air pressure over time, may be represented as a varying voltage or a stream of data over time. This is a 'time/amplitude' representation of sound, also known as the amplitude time line. The amplitude represents the molecular displacement caused by the changes in air pressure. In the digital domain, amplitude is typically represented as a value between '''1''' and '''-1''' where '''1''' and '''-1''' represent maximum positive and negative amplitudes of the signal, and '''0''' represents zero amplitude.


[[Image:SSsine1.png|300px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 1.1'''. A simple sinusoidal waveform represented as varying amplitude over time.&lt;/center&gt;]] 


The waveform in '''Fig. 1.1''' is called a ''sine wave'' or ''sinusoid''. Sine waves can be considered the fundamental building blocks of sound. The figure demonstrates that the amplitude varies over time, but that pattern of variance repeats ''periodically''.












[[Image:SSComplex1.png|300px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 1.2'''. A more complex waveform.&lt;/center&gt;]]


The waveform in '''Fig. 1.2''' is more complicated than the sinusoid in '''1.1'''. There are peaks and troughs of different amplitudes, and, although the pattern does repeat itself over time (see if you can find it) it is harder to spot. In the same way that a sine wave behaves in a simple way and sounds simple, this sound behaves with greater complexity and also sounds more complex. For this reason, detailed, complex sounds that change over time often have no discernible features when viewed this close up- there may be no repeating pattern or behaviour which we can use to tell us something about the sound.





[[Image:SSDrum1.png|300px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 1.3'''. A time-domain plot of a drum kit over 2 seconds.&lt;/center&gt;]]


In '''Fig. 1.3''' we are given a look at a sound over the course of about 2 seconds rather than 2 milliseconds. From this perspective, we can see the way the overall sound amplitude changes over time; in particular, the parts with high amplitude can easily be seen as drum hits - they appear suddenly and drop in amplitude very quickly as one would expect from striking a drum head. It may have been very difficult to tell what kind of instrument was being played if this sound was viewed over the range of a few milliseconds. From this, we should conclude that the short time interval and long time interval perspectives both show different types of information and that selecting the right perspective to suit one's needs is important.

==Sinusoids, frequency and pitch==

As indicated in '''Fig. 1.1''', the sine wave has a periodic form that repeats every &lt;math&gt;T \,&lt;/math&gt; seconds which is known as the period, ''cycle''. The wave also has a positive maximum amplitude, &lt;math&gt;A \,&lt;/math&gt; and a negative maximum amplitude, &lt;math&gt;-A \,&lt;/math&gt;.  The ''frequency'', &lt;math&gt;f \,&lt;/math&gt;, of a sine wave is the number of ''cycles per second'' and is measured in ''Hertz'' (Hz). We can obtain the frequency from wavelength from the following equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Furthermore, we can express a sine wave with the following mathematical form (with angles in radians). This form may be useful to programmers interested in creating their own controllable sine functions in code:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(t) = Asin \left (\frac{2 \pi t}{T} \right ) = Asin(2\pi f t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Psychometrically, higher frequencies (eg above 1.5kHz) are often associated with words such as 'brightness', whereas lower frequencies (eg below 200Hz) are often associated with 'depth' or 'bass'. The intermediate range may be associated with the term 'warmth'. For example, an instrument such as an electric guitar played clean may be called 'bright' or 'sharp' whereas an acoustic double-bass may be referred to as 'dark' and 'warm'. Being psychometric, terms like these are not objective quantities we can measure precisely, but are often used in describing the ''timbre'', or tone color of a particular sound. The various amplitudes of frequencies present in a sound, and their evolution over time are the major factors associated with timbre, and there are infinite shades of timbre that can be achieved through combinations of different frequencies that make up a sound. In psychometric terms, human hearing associates whole number frequency ratios with ''pitch'', and associate particular frequencies with particular notes in the standard Western scale:

Note that this table covers the range of an octave. The frequency doubles and the wavelength halves.

==Construction and deconstruction of sinusoids==

Using Fourrier analysis, sine waves can be considered the fundamental components of sound, since a single sine wave is a single frequency. Within Fourrier analysis, combining sinusoids of different frequency, aptitude and phase can recreate the frequency spectrum of and sound. Similarly, complex sounds may be analyzed in terms of frequencies, amplitudes and phase.


'''Fig. 1.5''' demonstrates the appearance of two sine waves summed together. The characteristics of both waves are combined in the resultant waveform. This technique is the basis of additive synthesis which is covered later in the book. Furthermore, in the way that the sound is constructed, it is possible to filter out the two component frequencies from the whole; this is typically done by analysis of the waveform in the frequency domain, which is covered in the subsequent chapter.

==Introduction==

Digital systems (e.g. computers) and formats (e.g. CD) are clearly the most popular and commonplace methods of storing and manipulating audio. Since the introduction of the [[w:Compact disc|compact disc]] in the early 1980s, the digital format has provided increasingly greater storage capacity and the ability to store audio information at an acceptable quality. Although ''analogue'' formats still exist  ([[w:vinyl record|vinyl]], [[w:Tape|tape]]), they typically serve a niche audience. Digital systems are ubiquitous in modern music technology. It must be stressed that there is no argument as to whether one domain, be it analogue or digital is superior, but the following provides some desirable features of working with audio in the digital domain.

* ''Storage''. The amount of digital audio data capable of being stored on a modern hard drive is far greater than a tape system. Furthermore, we can choose the quality of the captured audio data, which relates directly to file size and other factors.

* ''Control''. By storing audio information in digital, we can perform powerful and complex operations on the data that would be extremely difficult to realise otherwise.

* ''Durability''. Digital audio can be copied across devices without any loss of information. Furthermore, many systems employ [[w:error correction|error correction codes]] to compensate for wear and tear on a physical digital format such as a compact disc.

==Digital &lt;-&gt; Analogue Conversion==

Acoustic information (sound waves) are treated as ''signals''. As demonstrated in the previous chapter, we traditionally view these signals as varying amplitude over time. In analogue systems, this generally means that the amplitude is represented by a ''continuous'' voltage; but inside a digital system, the signal must be stored as a stream of ''discrete'' values.


[[Image:Analogue Digital Conversion.png|500px|thumb|center|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 2.1'''. An overview of the digital &lt;-&gt; analogue conversion process.&lt;/center&gt;]] 


Digital data stored in this way has no real ''physical'' meaning; one could describe a song on a computer as just an [[w:Array|array]] of numbers; these numbers are meaningless unless there exists within the system a process that can interpret each number in sequence appropriately. '''Fig. 2.1''' shows an overview of the process of capturing analogue sound and converting it into a digital stream of numbers for storage and manipulation in such a system. The steps are as follows:


# An input such as a microphone converts acoustic air pressure variations (sound waves) into variations in voltage.
# An analogue to digital converter (ADC) converts the varying voltage into a stream of digital values by taking a 'snapshot' of the  voltage at a point in time and assigning it a value depending on its amplitude. It typically takes these 'snapshots' thousands of times a second, the rate at which is known as the ''sample rate''.
# The numerical data is stored on the digital system and then subsequently manipulated or analysed by the user.
# The numerical data is re-read and streamed out of the digital system.
# A digital to analogue converter (DAC) converts the stream of digital values back to a varying voltage.
# A loudspeaker converts the voltage to variations in air pressure (sound).


Although the signal at each stage comes in a different form (sound energy, digital values etc.), the information is ''analogous''. However, due to the nature of the conversion process, this data may become manipulated and distorted. For instance, low values for sample rates or other factors at the ADC might mean that the continuous analogue signal is not represented with enough detail and subsequently the information will be distorted. There are also imperfections in physical devices such as microphones which further &quot;colour&quot; the signal in some way. It is for this reason that musicians and engineers aim to use the most high-quality equipment and processes in order to preserve the integrity of the original sound throughout the process. Musicians and engineers must consider what other processes their music will go through before consumption, too (radio transmission etc.).

==Sampling==

Sound waves in their natural acoustic form can be considered ''continuous''; that is, their time-domain graphs are smooth lines on all zoom factors without any ''breaks'' or ''jumps''. We cannot have these breaks, or ''discontinuities'' because sound cannot switch instantaneously between two values. An example of this may be an idealised waveform like a [[w:Square wave|square wave]] - on paper, it switches between 1 and -1 amplitude at a point instantaneously; however a loudspeaker cannot, by the laws of physics, jump between two points in no time at all, the cone has to travel through a continuous path from one point to the next.

[[Image:Zeroorderhold.signal.svg|400px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 2.2'''. Discrete samples (red) of a continuous waveform (grey).&lt;/center&gt;]] 

''Sampling'' is the process of taking a continuous, acoustic waveform and converting it into a digital stream of discrete numbers. An ADC measures the amplitude of the input at a regular rate creating a stream of values which represent the waveform in digital. The output is then created by passing these values to the DAC, which drives a loudspeaker appropriately. By measuring the amplitude many thousands of times a second, we create a &quot;picture&quot; of the sound which is of sufficient quality to human ears. The more and more we increase this ''sample rate'', the more accurately a waveform is represented and reproduced.

===Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem===

The frequency of a signal has implications for its representation, especially at very high frequencies. As discussed in the previous chapter, the frequency of a sine wave is the number of cycles per second. If we have a sample rate of 20000 samples per second (20 kHz), it is clear that a high frequency sinusoid such as 9000 Hz is going to have fewer &quot;snapshots&quot; than a sinusoid at 150 Hz. Eventually there reaches a point where there are not enough sample points to be able to record the cycle of a waveform, which leads us to the following important requirement:


&lt;center&gt;
{| WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;The sample rate must be greater than twice the maximum frequency represented.&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


Why is this? The minimum number of sample points required to represent a sine wave is two, but we need at least slightly more than this so that we're not dependent phase (samples at exactly twice the sine wave frequency, the samples may fall on the peaks of the sine wave, or on the zero crossings). It may seem apparent at this time that using just two points to represent a continuous curve such as a sinusoid would result in a crude approximation - a square wave. And, inside the digital system, this is true. However, both ADCs and DACs have [[w:Audio filter|low-pass filters]] set at half the sample rate (the highest representable frequency). What this means for input and output is that ''any'' frequency above the cut-off point is removed and it follows from this that the crude sine representation - a square wave in theory - becomes filtered down to a single frequency (i.e. a sine wave). From this, we have two mathematical results:


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F_{s} &gt; 2 f_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{N} = \frac{F_{s}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;F_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample rate, &lt;math&gt;f_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the highest frequency in the signal. &lt;math&gt;F_{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Nyquist frequency''. Frequencies over the Nyquist frequency are normally blocked by filters before conversion to the digital domain when recording; without such processes there would be frequency component foldover, otherwise known as ''aliasing''.

===Sampling accuracy and bit depth===

It has been established that the higher the sample rate, the more accurate the representation of a waveform in a digital system. However, although there are many reasons and arguments for higher sample rates, there are two general standards: ''44100'' samples per second and ''48000'' samples per second, with the former being most commonplace. The main consideration for this is the fact that the human hearing range extends, at maximum, to an approximate limit (that varies from person to person) of '''20000''' Hz. Frequencies above this are inaudible. Considering the example of 44.1 kHz, we find that the Nyquist frequency evaluates to ''22050'' Hz, which is more than the human hearing system is capable of perceiving. There are other reasons for this particular sample rate, but that is beyond the scope of this book.

[[Image:SSampling.png|500px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 2.3'''. Effects of increased sample rate and bit depth on representing a continuous analogue signal.&lt;/center&gt;]] 


There is one more important factor to consider when considering the sampling process: ''bit depth''. Bit depth represents the precision with which the amplitude is measured. In the same way that there are a limited amount of samples per second in a conversion process, there are also a limited amount of amplitude values for a sample point, and the greater the number, the greater the accuracy. A common bit resolution found in most standard digital audio systems (Hi-Fi, Compact Disc) is 16 binary [[w:Bit|bits]] which allows for a range of 65536 (&lt;math&gt;2^{16}&lt;/math&gt;) individual amplitude values at a point in time. Lower bit values result in a greater distortion of the sound - a two bit system (&lt;math&gt;2^2&lt;/math&gt;) only allows for four different amplitudes, which results in a massively inaccurate approximation of the input signal.

==Oscillators==

[[Image:Waveforms.svg|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 5.1''' Sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms&lt;/center&gt;]]

An ''oscillator'' is a repeating waveform with a fundamental frequency and peak amplitude and it forms the basis of most popular synthesis techniques today. Aside from the frequency or pitch of the oscillator and its amplitude, one of the most important features is the shape of its waveform. The time-domain waveforms in '''Fig. 5.1''' show the four most commonly used oscillator waveforms. Although it is possible to use all kinds of unique shapes, these four each serve a range of functions that are suited to a range of different synthesis techniques; ranging from the smooth, plain sound of a sine wave, to the harmonically rich buzz of a sawtooth wave.

Oscillators are generally controlled by a keyboard synthesiser or MIDI protocol device. A key press will result in a MIDI note value which will be converted to a frequency value (Hz) that the oscillator will accept as its input, and the waveform period will repeat accordingly to the specified frequency. From here, the sound can be processed or manipulated in a variety of ways in the synthesizer or program to enrich or modify the sound further.

==Generating oscillator waveforms==
===Sine wave===

As mentioned previously, the sine wave can be considered the most fundamental building block of sound. The best way to generate an oscillator which produces this waveform is to make use of an inbuilt library or function in the system concerned. Many programming languages have standard mathematics libraries with many of the trigonometric functions represented. A cycle of a sine wave is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt; radians long and has a peak amplitude of &lt;math&gt;+/-1&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in '''Fig. 5.2'''. In a digital system, the generated waves will be a series of equally-spaced values at the sample rate. 

[[Image:SSTsine.png|thumb|400px|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 5.2''' One cycle of a sine wave with phase 2π (radians).]]


With a sample rate of 44100 cycles per second, and a required cycle length of 1 second, it will take 44100 samples to get from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, we can determine the steps per cycle &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; from cycle length &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = T \cdot F_{s} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;F_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample rate. Each step will therefore take the following amount in radians:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{T \cdot F_{s}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi f}{F_{s}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, in the second result, is the same result in terms of frequency. The importance of this is that it is possible to expand it into an algorithm that will be suitable for generating a sinusoidal wave of a user specified frequency and amplitude- effectively the simplest synthesizer possible! A sinusoidal wave can be generated by repeatedly incrementing a phase value by an amount required to reach a desired number of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; length cycles a second, at the sample rate. This value can be passed to a sine function to create the output value, between the user specified peak amplitude.

&lt;pre&gt;
Input: Peak amplitude (A), Frequency (f)
Output: Amplitude value (y)

y = A * sin(phase)

phase = phase + ((2 * pi * f) / samplerate)

if phase &gt; (2 * pi) then
      phase = phase - (2 * pi)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The most important thing to note about this algorithm is that when the phase value has exceeded &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; it will subtract by one whole period. This is to ensure that the function &quot;wraps&quot; round to the correct position instead of going straight back to 0; if a phase increment ''oversteps'' &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; and resets to 0, undesirable discontinuities would occur, causing harmonic distortion in the oscillatory sound.

===Square wave===

The square wave cannot be generated from a mathematical function library so easily but once again the algorithm is particularly straightforward since it is constructed from straight line segments. Unlike the sine wave, square waves have many harmonics above their ''fundamental frequency'', and have a much brighter, sharper timbre. After examining a number of different waveforms it will start to become apparent that waveforms with steep edges and/or abrupt changes and discontinuities are usually harmonically rich.

(Note that the following square, sawtooth, and triangle functions are &quot;naive&quot;; they are equivalent to sampling the ideal mathematical functions without first bandlimiting them.  In other words, all of the harmonics above the Nyquist frequency will be aliased back into the audible range.  This is most obvious when sweeping one of these waveforms into the high frequencies.  The aliased harmonics will move up and down the frequency spectrum, making &quot;radio tuning&quot; sounds in the background.  A better method to produce waveforms for audio would be additive synthesis, or something like MinBLEPs.  A properly-bandlimited waveform will have &quot;jaggies&quot; as you approach the discontinuities instead of piecewise straight lines.)

[[Image:SSTsquare.png|thumb|400px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 5.3''' One cycle of a square wave with phase 2π (radians).]]

The square wave is constructed in a very similar fashion to the sine wave, and we use the same approach by cycling through a pattern with a phase variable, and resetting once we exceed &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; width:50%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Input: Peak amplitude (A), Frequency (f)
Output: Amplitude value (y)

if phase &lt; pi then
      y = A
else
      y = -A

phase = phase + ((2 * pi * f) / samplerate)

if phase &gt; (2 * pi) then
      phase = phase - (2 * pi)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

As is evident there is no reliance on an external function, the square wave can be defined by simple arithmetic, since it essentially switches between two values per cycle. One can expand on this by introducing a new variable which controls the point in the cycle the initial value switches to its signed value; this waveform is known as a ''pulse wave''. Pulse waves are similar in character to square waves but the ability to modulate the switching point offers greater sonic potential.

===Sawtooth wave===

[[Image:SSTsaw.png|thumb|400px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 5.4''' One cycle of a sawtooth wave with phase 2π (radians).]]

The sawtooth wave is more similar in sound to a square wave although it has harmonic decay and an appropriately &quot;buzzy&quot; timbre. It is constructed out of diagonal, sloping line segments and as such requires a line gradient equation in the algorithm. The mathematical form:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = A - \frac{A}{\pi} \phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; represents amplitude and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the phase. This can be incorporated into the algorithmic form as follows:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; width:50%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Input: Peak amplitude (A), Frequency (f)
Output: Amplitude value (y)

y = A - (A / pi * phase)

phase = phase + ((2 * pi * f) / samplerate)

if phase &gt; (2 * pi) then
      phase = phase - (2 * pi)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Triangle wave===

[[Image:SSTtri.png|thumb|400px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 5.5''' One cycle of a triangle wave with phase 2π (radians).]]

The triangle wave shares many geometric similarities with the sawtooth wave, except it has two sloping line segments. The algebra is slightly more complex and programmers may wish to consider consolidating the line generation into a new function for ease of reading. Triangle waves contain only odd-integer harmonics of the fundamental, and have a far softer timbre than square or saw waves, which is nearer to that of a sine wave. The mathematical form of the two lines segments are:

For &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = -A + \frac{2A}{\pi} \phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


For &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = 3A - \frac{2A}{\pi} \phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



The algorithm then, is similar to the previous examples but with the gradient equations incorporated into it. In the example algorithms presented here it is evident that a range of different waveshapes can be designed, but there is the realisation that the shapes can only be described as mathematical functions. Complex shapes may become very demanding due to the increased processing power for more complicated mathematical statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
Input: Peak amplitude (A), Frequency (f)
Output: Amplitude value (y)

if phase &lt; pi then
      y = -A + (2 * A / pi) * phase
else
      y = 3A - (2 * A / pi) * phase

phase = phase + ((2 * pi * f) / samplerate)

if phase &gt; (2 * pi) then
      phase = phase - (2 * pi)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Wavetables==

There may be a situation or a desire to escape the limitations or complexity of defining an oscillatory waveform using mathematical formulae or line segments. As mentioned before, this could be a concern for processing power, or simply the fact that it would be easier to specify the shape through an intuitive graphical interface. In cases like these, musicians and engineers may use ''wavetables'' to be their source oscillator. Wavetables are popular in digital synthesis applications because accessing a block of memory is computationally faster than calculating values using mathematical operations.

[[Image:SSWavetable.png|thumb|450px|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 5.6''' The basic structure of a wavetable oscillator.]]

The wavetable is in essence an array of ''N'' values, with values 1 through to N representing one whole cycle of the oscillator. Each value represents an amplitude at a certain point in the cycle. Wavetables are often displayed graphically with the option for the user to draw in the waveshape he or she requires, and as such it represents a very powerful tool. There is also the possibility of loading a pre-recorded waveshape as well; but note that a wavetable oscillator is only a reference table for one cycle of a waveform; it is not the same as a ''sampler''. The wavetable has associated with it a ''read pointer'' which cycles through the table at the required speed and outputs each amplitude value in sequence so as to recreate the waveform as a stream of digital values. When the pointer reaches the last value in the table array, it will reset to point one and begin a new cycle.

===Using wavetables===

The size of the wavetable and the sampling rate of the system determine what the fundamental frequency of the wavetable oscillator will be. If we have a wavetable with ''1024'' individual values and a sampling rate of ''44.1'' kHz, it will take:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1024}{44100} = 0.023 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 


seconds to complete one cycle. As previously shown, frequency can be determined from &lt;math&gt;1 / t \,&lt;/math&gt;, giving us a fundamental frequency of:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{0.023} = 43.5&lt;/math&gt; Hz.&lt;/center&gt;


It therefore becomes apparent that, in order to change the frequency of our oscillator we must change either the size of the wavetable or the sampling rate of the system. There are some real problems with both approaches:

* Changing the ''wavetable size'' means switching to a different sized wavetable with the same, updated waveform. This would require dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of individual wavetables, one for each pitch, which is obviously totally inefficient and memory-consuming.

* Digital systems, especially mixers that combine several synthesized or recorded signals, are designed to work at a fixed ''sampling rate'' and to make sudden changes to it is once again inefficient and extremely hard to program.

* The sample rate required to play high frequencies with an acceptable level of precision becomes very high and puts high demand on the system.

One of the most practical and widely-used approaches to playing a wavetable oscillator at different frequencies is to change the size of the &quot;steps&quot; that the read pointer makes through the table. As with our previous example, our 1024-value wavetable had a fundamental frequency of 43.5 Hz when every point in the table was outputted. Now, if we stepped through the table every '''5''' values, we would have:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1024 / 5}{44100} = 0.0046 = 217.4&lt;/math&gt; Hz.&lt;/center&gt;


It follows from this a general formulae for calculating the required step size, ''S'' for a given frequency, ''f'':


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = N \frac{f}{F_{s}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Where ''N'' is the size of the wavetable and &lt;math&gt;F_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample rate. It is important to note that because the step size is being altered, the read pointer may not land exactly on the final table value ''N'', and so it must &quot;wrap around&quot; in the same fashion as the functionally generated waveforms in the earlier section. This can be done by subtracting the size of the table from the current pointer value if it exceeds N; the algorithmic form of which can easily be gleaned from the examples above.

===Frequency precision and interpolation===

We must consider that some frequency values may generate a step size that has a fractional part; that is, it is not an integer but a rational number. In this case we find that the read pointer will be trying to step to locations in the wavetable array that do not exist, since each member of the array has an integer-valued index. There may be a value at position 50, but what about position 50.5? If we desire to play a frequency that uses a fractional step size, we must consider ways to accommodate it:

* '''Truncation and rounding'''. By removing the fraction after the decimal point we reduce the step size to an integer—this is ''truncation''. For instance, 1.3 becomes 1, and 4.98 becomes 4. ''Rounding'' is similar, but chooses the closest integer—3.49 becomes 3, and 8.67 becomes 9. For simple rounding, if the value after the decimal point is less than 5, we round down (truncate), otherwise we round up to the next integer. Rounding may be supported in the processor at no cost, or can be done by adding 0.5 to the original value and then truncating to an integer. For wavetable synthesis, the only difference between truncation and rounding is a constant 0.5 sample phase shift in the output. Since that is not detectable—and neither an improvement nor a detriment—a decision between truncation and rounding comes down to whichever is more convenient or quicker.

* '''Linear interpolation'''. This is the method of drawing a straight line between the two integer values around the step location and using the values at both points to generate an amplitude value that interpolates between them. This is a more computationally demanding process but introduces greater precision.

* '''Higher order interpolation'''. With linear interpolation considered ''first order'' interpolation (and truncation and rounding considered ''zero order'' interpolation) there are many higher-order forms that are commonly used—cubic Hermite, Lagrangian, and others. Just as linear interpolation requires two points for the calculation, higher orders require even more wavetable points to be used in the calculation, but produce a more accurate, lower distortion result. ''Sinc interpolation'' can be made arbitrarily close to perfect, at the expense of computation time.

By increasing the wavetable size, the precision of the above processes becomes greater and will result in a closer fit to the idealised, intended curve. Naturally, large wavetable sizes result in greater memory requirements. Some wavetable synthesizer hardware designs prefer table sizes that are powers of two (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, etc.), due to shortcuts that exploit the way in which digital memory is constructed (binary).

==Introduction==
As previously discussed in '''Section 1''', sine waves can be considered the building blocks of sound. In fact, it was shown in the 19th Century by the mathematician Joseph Fourier that any periodic function can be expressed as a series of sinusoids of varying frequencies and amplitudes. This concept of constructing a complex sound out of sinusoidal terms is the basis for additive synthesis, sometimes called ''Fourier synthesis'' for the aforementioned reason. In addition to this, the concepts of additive synthesis have also existed since the introduction of the organ, where different pipes of varying pitch are combined to create a sound or timbre.

[[Image:SSadditiveblock.png|400px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 6.1'''. Additive synthesis block diagram.&lt;/center&gt;]] 

A simple block diagram of the additive form may appear like in '''Fig. 6.1''', which has a simplified mathematical form based on the Fourier series:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n \sin(f_{n} t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is an offset value for the whole function (typically 0), &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; are the amplitude weightings for each sine term, and &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency multiplier value. With hundreds of terms each with their own individual frequency and amplitude weightings, we can design and specify some incredibly complex sounds, especially if we can modulate the parameters over time. One of the key features of natural sounds is that they have a dynamic frequency response that does not remain fixed. However, a popular approach to the additive synthesis system is to use frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, which is known as ''harmonic additive synthesis''. For example, if the first oscillator's frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; represents the fundamental frequency of the sound at 100 Hz, then the second oscillator's frequency would be &lt;math&gt;f2 = 2f_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the third &lt;math&gt;f3 = 3f_1&lt;/math&gt; and so on. This series of sine waves produces an even &quot;harmonic&quot; sound that can be described as &quot;musical&quot;. Oscillator frequency relationships that are not integer related, on the other hand, are called &quot;inharmonic&quot; and tend to be noisier and take on the characteristics of bells or other percussive sounds.

==Constructing common harmonic waveforms in additive synthesis==

[[Image:SSsquarepartials.png|250px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 6.2'''. The first four terms of a square wave constructed from sinusoidal components (partials).&lt;/center&gt;]] 

If we know the amplitude weightings and frequency components of the first &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; sinusoidal components or ''partials'' of a complex waveform, we can reconstruct that waveform using an additive system with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; oscillators. The popular waveforms square, sawtooth and triangle are harmonic waveforms because the constituent sinusoidal components all have frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. The property that distinguishes them in this form is that they all have unique ''amplitude weightings'' for each sinusoid. '''Fig. 6.2''' demonstrates the appearance of the time-domain waveform as a set of sines at unique amplitude weightings are added together; in this case the form begins to approximate a square wave, with the accuracy increasing with each added partial. Note that to construct a square wave we only include odd numbered harmonics- the amplitude weightings for &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_6&lt;/math&gt; etc. are 0. Below is a table that demonstrates the partial amplitude weightings of the common waveshapes:

&lt;/center&gt;

A conclusion you may draw from '''Fig. 6.2''' and the table is that it requires a large amount of frequency partials to create a waveform that closely approximates the idealised mathematical forms of the waveforms introduced in '''Section 5'''. For this reason, it should be apparent that additive synthesis techniques are perhaps not the best method for producing these forms. The strengths of additive synthesis lie in the fact that we can exert control over every partial component of our sound, which can produce some very intricate and wonderful results. With the constant modification of the frequency and amplitude values of each oscillator, the possibilities are endless. Some examples of ways to control the weightings and frequencies of each component oscillator are illustrated:

* Manual control. The user controls a bank of oscillators with an external control device (typically MIDI), tweaking the values in real time. More than one person can join in and change / alter the timbre to their whims.

* External data. Digital information from another source is taken and converted into appropriate frequency and amplitude values. The varying data source will then effectively be in 'control' of the timbral outcomes. Composers have been known to use data from natural sources or pieces derived from interesting geometric, aleatoric and mathematical models.

* Recursive data. Given a source set of values and a set of algorithmic rules, the control parameters reference the previous value entered into the system to determine the result of the next one. Users may wish to &quot;interfere&quot; with the system to set the process on a new path. See [[w:Markov chain|Markov chains]]. 

There is, however, the major consideration of computational power, however - complex sounds may require many oscillators all operating at once which will put major demand on the system in question.

== Additive resynthesis ==

In ''Section 1'' it was mentioned that just as it is possible to construct waveforms using additive techniques, we can analyse and deconstruct waveforms as well. It is possible to analyse the frequency partials of a recorded sound and then resynthesize a representation of the sound using a series of sinusoidal partials. By calculating the frequency and amplitude weighting of partials in the frequency domain (typically using a Fast Fourier transform), an additive resynthesis system can construct an equally weighted sinusoid at the same frequency for each partial. Older techniques rely on banks of filters to separate each sinusoid; their varying amplitudes are used as ''control functions'' for a new set of oscillators under the user's control. Because the sound is represented by a bank of oscillators inside the system, a user can make adjustments to the frequency and amplitude of any set of partials. The sound can be 'reshaped' - by alterations made to timbre or the overall amplitude envelope, for example. A harmonic sound could be restructured to sound inharmonic, and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Subtractive Synthesis=
Whereas additive synthesis is the process of combining individual sinusoidal partials to construct a complex sound, ''subtractive synthesis'' is essentially the reverse of this process. By starting with a harmonically (or partially) rich sound, a subtractive system will filter and modify the signal to reduce it to a desired form. By doing this, one can use one or two oscillators instead of a bank of 10 to achieve similar sonic results. Subtractive synthesis is an extremely popular method of synthesis that has been employed in hardware and software synthesizers since their popularity skyrocketed in the 1970s. This method of synthesis can be found traditionally in old modular or compact analogue synthesizers as well as modern virtual analogue models and software synthesizers. '''Fig. 7.1''' illustrates a simple block diagram form of a subtractive system.

[[Image:SSSubtractiveBlock.png|300px|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 7.1''' Block diagram of a simplified subtractive synthesis system.&lt;/center&gt;]] 

The oscillator will typically produce a waveform with a wide frequency spectrum (square wave, noise) at a frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and an amplitude &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, although there can be two or perhaps even three oscillators in the design; any more begin to distract from the purpose of a subtractive synthesis technique although there are designs which exist. The filter block, which can be comprised out of many different types of filter (lowpass, bandpass), changes the character of the oscillator by controlling the balance of the frequency spectrum, before being modified further by additional effect modules built into the system. These elements can be user specified or automated using other oscillators or value ''envelopes''. The subtractive approach is favoured by many musicians due to the fact that it is comparatively imprecise and therefore requires tweaking and experimentation of control parameters to get a desired sound.

      <comment>/* Amplitude Modulation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Modulation Synthesis=
==Introduction==

When we talk about ''modulation'' from an audio synthesis point of view, we refer to a time-varying signal (the ''carrier'') being affected in some way by another (the ''modulator''). Modulation can be found in a range of different sound effects and synthesis techniques and some of these effects occur naturally and help us to identify certain types of sound; for instance the commonly found performance styles of ''tremolo'' (modulation of amplitude) and ''vibrato'' (modulation of frequency) that are used in many stringed instruments are examples of this. Modulation is typical in synthesis because it enriches the character of the sound and also adds to the variance in timbre / character over time which is so often found in nature.

[[Image:BipolarUnipolar.png|thumb|600px|center|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 8.1''' Unipolar (between 0 and 1) and Bipolar (between -1 and +1) waveforms.&lt;/center&gt;]]


In the two basic methods of modulation synthesis that occur, ''ring modulation'' and ''amplitude modulation'', there are two unique types of signal that occur in each method: ''bipolar'' and ''unipolar'' signals. A bipolar signal is the type of signal we have been examining in previous chapters, it has both a negative and positive amplitude and the waveform generally &quot;rests&quot; around zero in a time-domain plot. A unipolar signal is a bipolar signal that has been ''constant-shifted'', that is, a constant value added to the overall signal to shift it into a range above zero, typically between 0 and 1. The reason for these two different types of signal follows.

==Ring Modulation==

Ring modulation is the multiplication of two bipolar audio signals by each other. Each value of a carrier signal, ''C'', is multiplied by a modulator signal, ''M'', to create a new ''ring-modulated'' signal, ''R'':


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R(t) = C(t) \times M(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


There are different ways to implement this; most likely it is suitable to simply multiply the two signals, but alternatively the amplitude input of a carrier module can be the output of a modulator module, as well. The frequency of the modulator signal also plays an important role in the characteristic of the RM signal. From this, we achieve the following important result:


&lt;center&gt;
{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
If the frequency of ''M'' is under '''20''' Hz or so, we will generally perceive the tremolo effect, where the amplitude of ''C'' will vary at the frequency of ''M''. Periodic signals ''M'' with a frequency below '''20''' Hz are called ''low-frequency oscillators''.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


When the frequency of ''M'' is in the audible range, that is, 20 Hz or more, there is an effect on the ''timbre'' of the signal. The variations in amplitude become fast enough that the modulator generates a set of ''frequency sidebands''. With two sine waves as carrier and modulator, RM will generate a frequency spectrum containing two sidebands, which are the ''sum'' and ''difference'' of the carrier and modulator frequencies. When this occurs, the actual carrier frequency is removed from the spectrum, leaving two ''harmonic'' sidebands (if the frequency of ''C'' and ''M'' are an integer ratio to one another) or two ''inharmonic'' sidebands (if the ratio is otherwise). For instance, if the carrier is 900 Hz and the modulator is 500 Hz, we will get two sidebands; one at '''400''' Hz (900 - 500) and one at '''1400''' Hz (900 + 500).

If ''C'' and ''M'' are not sine waves (i.e. their waveforms are more complex) then the resultant signal will contain more than one or many different sidebands at different frequencies and amplitudes, indicating a more complex sound. '''Figure 8.2''' illustrates two examples of ring modulation - the original example with frequencies C = 900 and M = 500 but also when C = 400 and M = 1000, which introduces ''negative frequencies'' into the spectrum. This results in a &quot;wrapping&quot; phenomenon where the difference sideband of ''C'' and ''M'' is '''-600''' Hz! As a result, we find that a difference sideband occurs at '''600''' Hz, and that is true for any negative frequency; a sideband will occur at its the unsigned (positive) frequency.

'''a)''' a C frequency of 900 and M of 500 and '''b)''' a C frequency of 400 and M of 1000, showing the emergence of negative frequencies into the audible spectrum.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Amplitude Modulation==
Amplitude modulation is similar to ring modulation, except it works with a unipolar modulator. The amplitude of the carrier signal, ''C'', is modulated by the unipolar modulator ''M''. At infrasonic (below 20hz) frequencies, the modulator serves to attenuate or boost the amplitude of the signal. A simple example of this would be a typical ADSR envelope, which scales the amplitude of the carrier signal over time from 0 to 1 and back down again. However, for synthesis techniques we generally consider the effect that periodic modulator signals above 20 Hz have on a carrier. Once again, the mathematical form is simply the product of two signals:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A(t) = C(t) \times M(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Where ''C'' is the carrier signal and ''M'' is a unipolar modulator, typically set to vary between values of 0 and 1. Without mention of the unipolar modulator, this technique would appear to be identical to ring modulation. Like ring modulation, amplitude modulation produces a pair of sidebands for every sinusoidal component in the carrier and modulator, and these sidebands are generated at frequencies the sum and difference of the two signal frequencies. The difference between the two techniques is highlighted here:

&lt;center&gt;
{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
The difference between amplitude modulation and ring modulation is that in AM the carrier frequency is preserved and the sidebands generated are at ''half'' the amplitude of the carrier amplitude.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:AMSpectra.png|thumb|400px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 8.3''' The frequency-domain spectrum of an amplitude-modulated signal. The two sidebands are sum and difference frequencies of the carrier and modulator, ''C'' and ''M'', and have amplitudes at ''half'' the amplitude of the carrier signal.&lt;/center&gt;]]

One of the advantages of AM, like its cousin, RM, is that using just two signals or oscillators, we can create some ''partially'' rich signals. Using a harmonically dense signal such as a square wave oscillator can create a wealth of sidebands from a minimum of control parameters and computation. Control over these generated partials may not, however, be as detailed and straightforward as techniques such as additive synthesis. As a result, we find that AM and RM is used more often in signal ''processing'' than signal ''generation''. 

[[Image:AMSTime.png|thumb|300px|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 8.4''' A time-domain plot of an amplitude-modulated signal. '''M(t)''', the sinusoidal 10hz modulator signal, '''C(t)''' the sinusoidal 220 Hz carrier signal, and '''A(t)''' the two combined using amplitude modulation.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Expanding on amplitude modulation requires us to introduce more parameters and elements to the technique to give it some &quot;weight&quot; with other, more popular techniques. For instance, we can introduce into the system a unipolar low-frequency oscillator which is set to control the amplitude of the modulator; by changing the amplitude of the modulator we are modifying what is known as the ''modulation index''; a factor which controls the strength of the AM sidebands. In addition to modifying the amplitude of the modulator, we can also modify the ''frequency'' of the modulator. As you may expect, this causes a shift in the frequencies of the sidebands generated through the AM process and can, carefully controlled, produce some interesting, dynamic sounds that are hard to produce with other techniques. Breaking away from sinusoidal oscillators in both cases of carrier and modulator, and even the modulation of the modulation index is one of the first steps to exploring this technique; try experimenting with the waveshapes introduced in the previous chapters.

== Overview ==

'''''Alecto Carrow''''', sister of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]], is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. When she is initially described, all [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] seems to notice about her is her repeated, almost-nervous giggle.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Alecto and Amycus are two of the Death Eaters who break out of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]] in about March. While their names are not mentioned at the time of the breakout, their membership in that group is strongly implied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s comments in the early chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Severus Snape mentions the Carrows when he is talking to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]].

The Carrows take part in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|the Battle of Lightning-Struck Tower]]. Both of them are at the top of the tower when Snape kills [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. As Harry chases Snape through the battle and out the front door, he sees Alecto dueling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

With Snape being appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charity Burbage|Charity Burbage]] having been killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], there are vacancies for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]] teachers. Alecto Carrow is given the post of Muggle Studies teacher. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] tells Harry that, under Alecto, Muggle Studies seems to have become institutionalized hatred of Muggles, promulgating falsehoods about how Muggles are a lower order, dirty and stupid.

Alecto, told by Lord Voldemort to expect Harry to visit Ravenclaw Tower, has herself let into the Ravenclaw common room before Harry's arrival. When Harry steps out from under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] to examine the statue of Rowena Ravenclaw, Alecto sees him and summons Voldemort by touching her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]]. She is then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], who was accompanying Harry, and had remained under the Invisibility Cloak. Bound by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], she takes no further part in the story.

== Strengths ==

Alecto compensates for her lack of intelligence by the use of unrestrained violence and Unforgivable Curses, most notably the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]. It is debatable whether this could be considered a strength.

== Weaknesses ==

Alecto is not particularly intelligent. When her brother Amycus is unable to enter Ravenclaw tower, eventually he forces Professor McGonagall to open the door for him. Professor McGonagall at that time says that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] had earlier opened the door for Alecto, leading us to understand that she also was unable to answer the eagle's-head door knocker's query.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

While there is apparently some closeness between herself and her brother, Amycus Carrow, the only dealings we see her having with other people are situations in which she is operating from a position of power, or dueling. Her usual mode of interpersonal relationship seems to be taunting. Unlike other Death Eaters, Alecto trusted Snape immediately upon his return to the Death Eaters. 

From her treatment of the students, as related by Neville, we can safely guess that Alecto disliked any sign of independent thought from the students. In this, she seems to be following Voldemort's lead with his own underlings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preventing Management Problems by Focusing Students on Learning==
The easiest management problems to solve are ones that do not happen in the first place! You can help to prevent problems even before the first day of school by arranging classroom furniture and materials in ways that make learning as easy to focus on as possible. Later, during the first few days, you can establish procedures and rules that support a focus on learning even more.

===Arranging Classroom Space===
Viewed broadly, it may be tempting to think that classrooms are arranged in similar ways, but there are actually important alternative arrangements to consider. Variations happen because of grade level, the subjects taught, the teacher’s philosophy of education, and of course the size of the room and the furniture available. Whatever the arrangement that you choose, it should help students to focus on learning tasks as much as possible and minimize the chances of distractions. Beyond these basic principles, however, the “best” arrangement depends on what your students need and on the kind of teaching that you prefer and feel able to provide (Bothmer, 2003; Nations &amp; Boyett, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Bothmer, S. (2003). ''Creating the peaceable classroom.'' Tuscon, AZ: Zephyr Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nations, S. &amp; Boyett, S. (2002). ''So much stuff, so little space: Creating and managing the learner-centered classroom.'' Gainesville, FL: Maupin House&lt;/ref&gt;. Here are some ideas to help choose among your options. In considering them (and before moving too much furniture around your room!), you might want to try experimenting with spatial arrangements “virtually” by using one of the computer programs available on the Internet (see, for example, http://teacher.scholastic.com/tools/class_setup/).

====Displays and Wall Space====
All classrooms have walls, of course, and how you fill or use them can affect the mood or feeling of a classroom. More displays make the room more interesting and be used to reinforce curriculum goals and display (and hence recognize) students’ work. But too many displays can also make a room seem “busy” or distracting as well as physically smaller; and they can also be more work to maintain. If you are starting a new school year, then, there is usually a need to decorate some of the wall or bulletin board space, but no urgent need to fill it all. Leaving some open space can give flexibility to respond to curriculum or learning needs that emerge after the year is underway. The same advice applies for displays that are especially high maintenance, such as aquariums, pets, and plants. These can serve wonderfully as learning aids, but do not have to be in place on the first day of school. Not only the students, but also you yourself, may already have enough distractions to cope with at that time.

====Computers in the Classroom====
If you are like the majority of teachers, you will have only one computer in your room, or at most just a few, and their placement may be pre-determined by location of power and cable outlets. If so, you need to think about computer placement early in the process of setting up a room. Once the location of computers is set, locations for desks, high-usage shelves, and other moveable items can be chosen more sensibly—in general so as to minimize distractions to students and to avoid unnecessary traffic congestion.

====Visibility of and Interactions with Students====
Learning is facilitated if the furniture and space allow you to see all students and to interact with them from a comfortable distance. Usually this means that the main, central part of the room—where desks and tables are usually located—needs to be as open and as spacious as possible. While this idea may seem obvious, enacting it can sometimes be challenging in practice if the room itself is small or unusually shaped. In classrooms with young students (kindergarten), furthermore, open spaces tend to allow, if not invite, movement of children that is longer and faster—a feature that you may consider either constructive or annoying, depending on your educational goals and the actual level of activity that occurs.

====Spatial Arrangements Unique To Grade Levels or Subjects====
Some room arrangements depend significantly on the grade level or subject area of the class. If you teach in elementary school, for example, you may need to think about where students can keep their daily belongings, such as coats and lunches. In some schools, these can be kept outside the classroom—but not in all schools. Some subjects and grade levels, furthermore, lend themselves especially well to small group interaction, in which case you might prefer not to seat students in rows, but around several small-group tables or work areas. The latter arrangement is sometimes preferred by elementary teachers, but  is also useful in high schools wherever students need lots of counter space, as in some shops courses, or wherever they need to interact, as in English as a Second Language courses (McCafferty, Jacobs, &amp; Iddings, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;McCafferty, S., Jacobs, G., &amp; Iddings, S. (Eds.). (2006). ''Cooperative learning and second language teaching.'' New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. The key issue in deciding between tables and rows, however, is not grade level or subject as such, but the amount of small group interaction you want to encourage, compared to the amount of whole-group instruction. As a rule, tables make talking with peers easier, and rows make listening to the teacher more likely and group work slightly more awkward to arrange.
 
Ironically, some teachers experience challenges about room arrangement without even having a room of their own, because they must “float” or move among other teachers’ rooms. “Floating” is especially likely among specialized teachers (e.g. music teachers in elementary schools, who move from class to class) and in schools that are short on classrooms overall. Floating can sometimes by annoying to the teacher, though it actually also has advantages, such as not having to take responsibility for how other teachers’ rooms are arranged). If you find yourself floating, it helps to consider a few key strategies, such as:
* consider using a permanent cart to move crucial supplies from room to room;
* make sure that every one of your rooms has an overhead projector (do not count on using chalkboards in other teachers’ rooms);
* talk to the other teachers about having at least one shelf or corner in each room designated for your exclusive use.

===Establishing Daily Procedures and Routines===
Procedures or routines are specific ways of doing common, repeated classroom tasks or activities. Examples include checking daily attendance, dealing with students who arrive late, or allowing students to use the bathroom during class or go to their lockers to get materials which they forgot to bring. Procedures also include ways of turning in or retrieving daily homework (e.g. putting it on a designated shelf at a particular time), or of gaining the teacher’s attention during quiet seat work (e.g. raising your hand and waiting), or of choosing and starting a “free choice” activity after completing a classroom assignment.

Procedures serve the largely practical purpose of making activities and tasks flow smoothly and efficiently—a valuable and necessary purpose in classrooms, where the actions of many people have to be coordinated within limited amounts of time. As such procedures are more like social conventions than like moral expectations. They are not primarily about what is ethically right or ethically desirable to do (Turiel, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E. (2006). The development of morality. In W. Damon, R. Lerner, &amp; N. Eisenberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of child psychology, vol. 3,'' pp. 789-857. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. Most procedures or routines can be accomplished in more than one way, with only minor differences in success at the outcomes. There is more than one way, for example, for the procedure of taking attendance: the teacher could call the role, delegate a student to call the role, or simply note students’ presence on a seating chart. Each variation accomplishes essentially the same task, and the choice among them may therefore be less important than the fact that the class coordinates its actions somehow, by committing to some sort of choice.

For teachers, of course, an initial task is to establish procedures and routines in the first place. Because of the conventional quality of procedures, some teachers find that it works well simply to announce and explain key procedures without inviting much discussion from students (“Here is how we will choose partners for the group work”). Other teachers, however, prefer to invite input from students when creating procedures (asking “What do you feel is the best way for students to get my attention during a quiet reading time?”). Both approaches have advantages as well as disadvantages. Simply announcing key procedures saves time and insures consistency in case you are teaching more than one class (as you would in high school). But it creates a bigger responsibility to choose procedures that are truly reasonable and practical. On the other hand, inviting students’ input can help students to become aware of and committed to procedures, but at the cost of taking more time to establish them, and at the risk of creating confusion if you teach multiple classes, each of which adopts different procedures. Whatever approach you choose, you and the students of course have to take into account the procedures or rules imposed by the school or school district as a whole. A school may have a uniform policy or expectation about how to record daily attendance, for example, and that policy may determine, either partly or completely, how you take attendance with your particular students.

===Establishing Classroom Rules=== 
Unlike procedures or routines, rules express standards of behavior for which individual students need to take responsibility. Although they may help in insuring the practical efficiency of classroom tasks, they are really about encouraging students to be personally responsible for learning, as well as for behaving decently and respectfully with each other. [[Table 7-X]] lists a typical set of classroom rules.

Note three things about the rules in [[Table 7-X]]. One is that they are not numerous; the table lists only five. Most educational experts recommend keeping the number of rules to a minimum in order to make them easier to remember (Thorson, 2003; Brophy, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, S. (2003). ''Listening to students: Reflections on secondary classroom management.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. Another feature is that they are stated in positive terms (“Do X…”) rather than negative terms (“Do not do Y…”), a strategy that emphasizes and clarifies what students should do rather than what they should avoid. A third feature is that each rule actually covers a collection of more specific behaviors. The rule “Bring all materials to class,” for example, potentially covers bringing pencils, paper, textbooks, homework papers, and permission slips—depending on the situation. As a result of being stated somewhat generally, rules contain a degree of ambiguity that sometimes requires interpretation. Infractions may occur, that is, that are marginal or “in a grey area,” rather than clearcut. A student may bring a pen, for example, but the pen may not work properly, and you may therefore wonder whether this incident is really a failure to follow the rule, or just an unfortunate (and in this case minor) fault of the pen manufacturer.

As with classroom procedures, rules can be planned either by the teacher alone, or by the teacher with advice from students. The arguments for each approach are similar to the arguments for procedures: rules “laid on” by the teacher may be more efficient and consistent, and in this sense more fair, but rules influenced by the students may be supported more fully by the students. Because rules focus strongly on personal responsibility, however, there is a stronger case for involving students in making classroom rules than in making classroom procedures (Brookfield, 2006; Kohn, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Brookfield, S. (2006). ''The skillful teacher: On technique, trust, and responsiveness in the classroom, 2nd edition.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2006). ''Beyond discipline: From compliance to community.'' Reston, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;. In any case the question of who plans classroom rules is not necessarily an either/or choice. It is possible in principle to impose certain rules on students (for example, “Always be polite to each other”) but let the students determine the consequences for violations of certain rules (for example, “If a student is discourteous to a classmate, he/she must apologize to the student in writing”). Some mixture of influences is probably inevitable, in fact, if only because of your own moral commitments as a teacher and because the school itself is likely to have rules of its own (like “No smoking in the school” or “Always walk in the hallways”). A classroom set of rules therefore might need to refer to and honor this broader source of rules somehow, if only by including a classroom rule stating something like “Obey all school rules.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pacing and Structuring Lessons and Activities==
One of the best ways to prevent management problems is by pacing and structuring lessons or activities as smoothly and continuously as possible. Reaching this goal depends on three major strategies:
* selecting tasks or activities at an appropriate level of difficulty for your students,
* providing a moderate level of structure or clarity to students about what they are supposed to do, especially during transitions between activities, and
* keeping alert to the flow and interplay of behaviors for the class as a whole and for individuals within it.

Each of these strategies presents its own special challenges to teachers, but also its own opportunities for helping students to learn.

====Choosing Tasks at an Appropriate Level of Difficulty====
As experienced teachers know and as research has confirmed, students are most likely to engage with learning when tasks are of moderate difficulty, neither too easy nor too hard and therefore neither boring nor frustrating (Britt, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Britt, T. (2005). Effects of identity-relevance and task difficulty on task motivation, stress, and performance. ''Motivation and Emotion, 29''(3), 189-202&lt;/ref&gt;. Finding the right level of difficulty, however, can sometimes be a challenge if you have little experience in teaching a particular grade level or curriculum, or even if a class is simply new to you and in this sense “unknown.” Whether familiar to you or not, members of any class are likely to have diverse abilities and readiness, and this fact alone makes it harder to determine what level of difficulty is appropriate. A common strategy for dealing with these ambiguities is to begin units, lessons, or projects with tasks or content that is relatively easy and familiar, and then gradually introduce more difficult material or tasks until students seem challenged, but not overwhelmed. Using this strategy gives the teacher a chance to observe and diagnose students’ learning needs before adjusting content, and gives students a chance to orient themselves to the teacher’s expectations and the topic of study without becoming stressed or frustrated prematurely. Later in a unit, lesson, or project, students are then in a better position to deal with more difficult tasks or content (Van Merrionboer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Van Meerionboer, J., Kirschner, P., &amp; Kester, L. (2003). Taking the cognitive load off a learner’s mind: Instructional design for complex learning. ''Educational Psychologist, 38''(1), 5-13.&lt;/ref&gt;. The principle seems to help even with “authentic” learning projects—ones that resemble real-world activities of students (such as learning to drive an automobile), and that present a variety of complex tasks simultaneously. Even in those cases it helps for the teacher to isolate and focus on the simplest subtasks first (such as “put the key in the ignition”) and only move to harder tasks later (such as parallel parking).

Sequencing instruction is only a partial solution to finding the best “level” of instruction, because it still does not deal with lasting differences among students as individuals. The core challenge to teachers is to fully individualize or differentiate instruction: to tailor instruction or activities not only to the class as a group, but to the differences among members of the class? One way to approach this problem is to plan different content or activities for different students or groups of students. While one group works on Task A, another group works on Task B; one group works on relatively easy math problems, for example, while another works on harder ones. Taken very far, managing multiple activities or tasks obviously complicates a teacher’s job, but it can and has been done by many teachers (and it also can make teaching more interesting!). (In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8, &quot;Instructional Strategies&quot;]], we describe some classroom management strategies that can help with the multi-tasking that differentiated instruction requires.

====Providing Moderate Amounts of Structure and Detail====
Chances are that at some point in your educational career you have asked, or at least wished, that a teacher would clarify or explain an assignment more fully, and thereby give it more structure or organization. Students’ need and desire for clarity is especially common with assignments that are by nature open-ended, such as long essays, large projects, or creative works. Simply being told to “write an essay critiquing the novel,” for example, leaves more room for uncertainty (and worry) than being given guidelines about what the essay should contain, what topics or parts it should have, and its appropriate length or style (Chesebro, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Chesebro, J. (2003). Effects of teacher clarity and nonverbal immediacy on student learning, receiver apprehension, and affect. ''Communication Education, 52''(2), 135-147.&lt;/ref&gt;. Students’ need for structure and clarity varies, furthermore, not only among assignments, but among students as individuals. Some students desire it more than others, and perform especially well when provided with relatively more structure and clarity. Students with certain kinds of learning difficulties, in particular, often learn more effectively and stay on task more if provided with somewhat more explicit or detailed instructions about the specific tasks expected for assignments (Marks, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Marks, L. (2003). Instructional management tips for teachers of students with autism-spectrum disorder. ''Teaching Exceptional Children, 35''(4), 50-54.&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a teacher, the challenge is to accommodate students’ need for clarity without making guidance so specific or detailed that students have little room to think for themselves. Carried to a (ridiculous) extreme, for example, a teacher can give “clear” instructions for an essay by announcing not only exactly which articles to read and cite in preparing for the essay and which topics or issues to cover, but even the wording of the key sentences in their essays. This much specificity may reduce students’ uncertainties and make the teacher’s task of evaluating the essays relatively straightforward and easy. But it also reduces or even eliminates the educational value of the assignment—assuming, of course, that its purpose is to get students to think for themselves.

Ideally, then, structure should be moderate rather than extreme. There should be just enough to give students some sense of direction and to stimulate more accomplishment than if they worked with less structure or guidance. This ideal is essentially Vygotsky’s idea of the zone of proximal development that we discussed in [[../../Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]]: a place (figuratively speaking) where students get more done with help than without it. The ideal amount of guidance—and the “location” of the zone of proximal development—may vary with the assignment and with the student, and it may (hopefully) decrease over time for all students. One student may need more guidance to do his or her best in math, but less guidance in order to write his best essay. Another student may need the reverse. Both students may need less at the end of the year than at the beginning.

====Managing Transitions====
The time between activities is often full of distractions and “lost” time, and is often when inappropriate behaviors are especially likely to occur. Part of the problem is intrinsic to transitions: students often have to wait before a new activity begins, and therefore get bored, at the same moment when the teacher may be preoccupied with locating and arranging materials for the new activity. From the point of view of students, therefore, transitions may seem essentially like unsupervised group time, when (seemingly) “anything goes.”

Minimizing such problems requires two strategies, one of which is easier to implement than the other. The easier strategy is for you, as teacher, to organize materials as well as possible ahead of time, so that you minimize the time needed to begin a new activity or class session. This advice sounds simple, and mostly is, but it can sometimes take a bit of practice to implement smoothly. When one of us [[User talk:Klseifert|(Kelvin)]] first began teaching university, for example, particular papers or overhead transparencies would sometimes move “magically” into the wrong folder in spite of his efforts to keep them where he would find them easily, and finding them caused delays at the last minute while students waited.

A second, more complex strategy is to teach students as many ways as possible to manage their own behavior during transitions (Marzano &amp; Marzano, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Marzano, R. &amp; Marzano, J. (2004). The key to classroom management. ''Educational Leadership, 62,'' pp. 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt;. If students talk too loudly between activities, for example, then discuss with them what constitutes appropriate levels or amounts of talk during those times, as well as about the need for them to monitor their own sound level at that time. Or if students stop work early in anticipation of the end of an activity, then talk about—or even practice—using a signal from yourself to indicate the true ending point for an activity. If certain students continue working beyond the end of an activity, on the other hand, then try giving students advance warning of the impending end of the activity, and remind them about their taking the responsibility for actually finishing work once they hear the advance warning. And so on. The point of all of these tactics is to encourage students’ sense of responsibility for their behavior transitions, and thereby reduce your own need to monitor them at that crucial time.

None of these ideas, of course, mean that you, as teacher, can or should give up monitoring students’ behavior entirely. Chances are that you still will need to notice if and when someone talks too loudly, finishes too early, or continues too long, and you will still need to give those students appropriate reminders. But the amount of reminding will be less to the extent that students can remind and monitor themselves—a welcome trend  at any time during the day, but especially during transitions.

====Maintaining the Flow of Activities====
A lot of classroom management is really about keeping activities flowing smoothly, both during individual lessons and across the school day. The trouble with this straightforward-sounding idea, however, is that there is never just “one” event happening at a time, even if only one activity has been formally planned and is supposed to be occurring. Even if, for example, everyone is supposed to be attending a single whole-class discussion on a topic, individual students will be having different experiences at any one moment. Several students may be listening and contributing comments, for example, but a few others may be planning what they want to say next and ignoring the current speakers, still others may ruminating about what a previous speaker said, and still others may be thinking about unrelated matters, like using the restroom, food, or sex. Things get even more complicated if the teacher deliberately plans multiple activities: in that case some students may interact with the teacher, for example, while others do work in an unsupervised group or work independently in a different part of the room. How is a teacher to keep activities flowing smoothly in the face of such variety?

A common mistake of beginning teachers in multi-faceted activity settings like these is to pay too much attention to any one activity, student, or small group, at the expense of noticing and responding to all the others. If you are helping a student on one side of the room but someone on the other side disturbs classmates with off-task conversation, it tends to be less effective either to finish with the student you are helping before attending to the disruption, or to interrupt your help for the student until you have solved the disruption on the other side of the room. Either approach is likely to allow the flow of activities to be disrupted somewhere; there is a risk that either the student’s chatting may spread to others, or the interrupted student may become bored with waiting to regain the teacher’s attention and get off-task herself.

A better solution, though at first it may seem tricky or challenging, is to attend to both events at once—a strategy that was named withitness in a series of now-classic research students several decades ago (Kounin, 1970)&lt;ref&gt;Kounin, J. (1970). ''Discipline and group management in classrooms.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;. Withitness does not mean that you focus on all simultaneous activities with equal care, but only that you are aware multiple activities, behaviors, and events to some degree. At a particular moment, for example, you may be focusing on helping a student, but in some corner of your mind you also notice when chatting begins on the other side of the room. You have, as the saying goes, “eyes in the back of your head.” Research has found that experienced teachers are much more likely to show withitness than inexperienced teachers, and that these qualities are associated with their managing classrooms successfully (Emmer &amp; Stough, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, E. &amp; Stough, L. (2001). Classroom management: A critical part of educational psychology, with implications for teacher education. ''Educational Psychologist, 36''(2), 103-112.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Simultaneous awareness—withitness—makes possible responses to the multiple events that are immediate and nearly simultaneous—what educators sometimes called overlapping. The teacher’s responses to each event or behavior need not take equal time, nor even be equally noticeable to all students. If you are helping one student with seat work at the precise moment when another student begins chatting off-task, for example, a quick glance to the second student may be enough to bring him back to the work at hand, and may scarcely interrupt your conversation with the first student, or be noticed by others who are not even involved. The result is a smoother flow to activities overall.

As a new teacher, you may find your initial skill at withitness and overlapping develops more easily in some situations than in others. It may be easier to keep an eye (and an ear) on the entire class during familiar routines, for example, like taking attendance, and harder to do the same during lessons or activities that are unfamiliar or complex, such as introducing a new topic or unit that you have never taught before. But skill at broadening your attention can and does increase with time and practice. So it helps to keep trying. Merely demonstrating to students that you are “withit,” in fact, even without making deliberate overlapping responses, can sometimes deter students from task behavior. Someone who is tempted to pass notes in class, for example, might not to do so because she decides that you will probably notice her doing it anyway.

===Communicating the Importance of Learning and of Positive Behavior===
Taken together, arranging space, establishing procedures and rules, and developing withitness about multiple events set the stage for communicating an important message: that the classroom is a place where learning and positive social behavior are priorities. In addition, teachers can convey this message by giving feedback to students in a timely way, by keeping accurate records of their performance, and by deliberately communicating with parents or caregivers about their children and about activities in class.

Communicating effectively is so important for all aspects of teaching, in fact, that we discuss it more fully later in this book (see [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 12: The Nature of Classroom Communication|Chapter 12]] about the nature and communication and about ways to facilitate it). Here we focus on only one of its important aspects: how communication contributes to a smoothly functioning classroom by conveying the importance of learning to students and their families.

====Giving Timely Feedback====
Feedback is a term often used by educators to refer to responses given to students about their behavior or performance. Feedback is essential for students if they are to learn or if they are to develop classroom behavior that is new or more subtle and “mature.” But feedback can only be fully effective if received as soon as possible, when it is still relevant to the task or activity at hand which is usually as soon as possible (Reynolds, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, A. (1992). What is competent beginning teaching? ''Review of Educational Research, 62''(1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;. A score on a test is more informative immediately after a test than after a six-month delay, when students may have forgotten much of the content of the test. A teacher’s comment to a student about an inappropriate, off-task behavior may not be especially welcome immediately after the behavior occurs, but it can be more influential and informative then; later, both teacher and student have trouble remembering the context of the off-task behavior, and in this sense may literally “not know what they are talking about.” The same is true for comments about a positive behavior by a student: hearing a compliment right away makes it easier to connect the comment with the behavior, and allows the compliment to influence the student more strongly. Even though there are of course practical limits to how fast feedback can be given, the general principle is clear: feedback tends to work better when it is timely.

The principle of timely feedback is consistent, incidentally, with one of the principles of operant conditioning discussed in Chapter 2: reinforcement works best when it follows a to-be-learned operant behavior closely. In this case think of a teacher’s feedback as a form of reinforcement. The analogy is easiest to understand when the feedback takes the form of praise for something a student did or performed; in operant conditioning terms, the reinforcing praise then functions like a “reward.” But the analogy to operant conditioning still holds when feedback is negative—when a teacher criticizes or reprimands a student. In those cases the criticism or reprimand sometimes functions like what Skinner call an “aversive stimulus” (or mild punishment), shutting down the behavior criticized. At other times, though, a teacher’s criticism functions in a more paradoxical and unexpected way: it acts less like an aversive stimulus than like a negative reinforcement. In these cases the criticism does not shut down a behavior (as true punishment might do), but leads to a less negative state for the student. This happens, for example, if a student misbehaves in order to gain attention from the teacher or classmates and to avoid being ignored. If the teacher in this case criticizes the student for the misbehavior, the student may experience the criticism as a reduction in isolation and as in increase in his importance in the class—in other words, as reinforcement for misbehavior. So the inappropriate behavior continues, and as teachers we might be tempted to say that “he is just misbehaving to get attention.” [[Figure 7-1]] diagrams this sequence of events.

====Maintaining Accurate Records====
Although timeliness in responding to students can sometimes happen easily or spontaneously, there are also situations where promptness depends on having organized key information ahead of time. Obvious examples are the scores, marks, and grades returned to students for their work. With a short quiz (like, say, a weekly spelling test), it may be possible to return it quite soon after the quiz—especially if you or even your students themselves can mark it during class. More often, though, assignments and tests requiring longer processing times: you have to take significant time personally to read, score, or add constructive comments. The time needed for this work can reduce the usefulness of a teacher’s evaluations to students when she finally does return assignments (Black, et al., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Black, P., Harrison, C., Lee C., Marshall, B., &amp; Wiliam, D. (2004). Working inside the black box: Assessment for learning in the classroom. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 86''(1), 8-21.&lt;/ref&gt;. During the days or weeks while students wait for a test or assignment to be returned, they are left without information about quality or nature of their performance; at the extreme they may even have to complete a next test or assignment before getting any information from an earlier one. (Perhaps you have already experienced this problem during your years as a student!)

Delays in providing feedback about academic performance can never be eliminated entirely, but they can be reduced by keeping accurate, well-organized records of students’ work. We offer suggestions for organizing academic records in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-Made Assessment Strategies|Chapter 10]], but for now we simply emphasize that grading systems benefit students’ learning the most when they provide feedback as quickly and frequently as possible—precisely the circumstances which accurate, well-organized record-keeping can help the most. A number of computer programs are available to help with this challenge; if your school does not already have one in use, then there are several downloadable either free or at low cost from the Internet (e.g. http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Educational/Teachers_Help/Gradebooks/).

Accurate records are helpful not only for scores on tests, quizzes or assignments, but also for keeping descriptive information about the nature of students’ academic skills or progress. A common way to do so is the student portfolio, which is a compilation of the student’s work and on-going assessments of it added by the teacher or by the student (Moritz &amp; Christie, 2005; White, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, J. &amp; Christie, A. (2005). It’s elementary: Using elementary portfolios with young students. In C. Crawford (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education International Conference 2005'' (pp. 144-151). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, C. (2005). Student portfolios: An alternative way of encouraging and evaluating student learning. In M. Achacoso &amp; N. Svinicki (Eds.), ''Alternative Strategies for Evaluating Student Learning'' (pp. 37-42). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;. To know of how a student’s science project evolved from its beginning, for example, a teacher and student can keep a portfolio of lab notes, logs, preliminary data, and the like. To know how a student’s writing skills are developing, on the other hand, they could keep a portfolio of early drafts on various writing assignments. As the work accumulates, the student can discuss it with the teacher, and either of them can write brief reflections on its strengths thus far and on the next steps needed to improve the work further. By providing a way to respond to work as it evolves, portfolios can respond to students’ work relatively promptly, and in any case sooner than if a teacher waited until the work was complete or final. (For more on portfolios, see [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-Made Assessments of Learning|Chapter 10).

===Communicating with Parents and Caregivers===
Since parents and caregivers in a sense “donate” children to schools (at least figuratively speaking), teachers are responsible for keeping parents informed and involved to whatever extent is practical. Virtually all parents understand and assume that schools are generally intended for learning, but communication can enrich their understanding of how this purpose is realized in their particular child’s classroom, and it can show them more precisely what their particular child is doing there. Such understanding in turn allows parents and caregivers to support their child’s learning more confidently and “intelligently,” and in this sense contributes, at least indirectly, to a positive learning environment in their child’s class.

There are various ways to communicate with parents, each with advantages and limitations. Here are three common examples:
* ''A regular classroom newsletter:'' The advantage of a newsletter is that it establishes a link with all parents or caregivers with comparatively little effort on the part of the teacher. Since it is not likely to be concerned the problems of individual students, furthermore, it can be phrased in very positive terms. At the beginning of the year, for example, a newsletter can tell about special materials that students will need, important dates to remember (like professional development days when there is no school), or about curriculum plans for the next few weeks. But newsletters also have limitations. They can seem impersonal, for example, or they may get lost on the way home and never reach parents or caregivers. They can also be impractical for teachers with multiple classes, as in high school or in specialist subjects (like music or physical education), where each class may follow a different program or have a different purpose.

* ''Telephone calls:'' The main advantage of phoning is its immediacy and individuality. Teacher and parent or caregiver can talk about a particular student, behavior, or concern, and it now. By the same token, however, phone calls are not an efficient way to inform parents about events or activities that affect everyone in common. The individuality of phoning may explain why teachers tend to use this method more often when a student has a problem that is urgent or unusual—as when he has failed a test or has misbehaved seriously. Rightly or wrongly, a student’s successes may not seem urgent enough to merit a call to the student’s home (though perhaps students are more likely to communicate their successes to parents themselves, than to communicate their failures).

* ''Parent-teacher conferences:'' Most schools schedule regular times—often a day or an evening—when teachers meet briefly with any parents or caregivers who request a meeting. Under good conditions, the conferences can have the individuality of phone calls, but also the greater richness of communication possible in face-to-face meetings. Since conferences are available to all parents, they need not focus on behavior or academic problems, but often simply help to build rapport and understanding between parents or caregivers and the teacher. Sometimes too, particularly at younger grade levels, teachers organize conferences to be led by the student, who displays and explains his or her work using a portfolio or other archive of accumulated materials (Benson &amp; Barnett, 2005; Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Benson, B. &amp; Barnett, S. (2005). ''Student-led conferencing using showcase portfolios.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiggins, R. &amp; Chappuis, J. (2005). Using student-involved classroom assessment to close achievement gaps. ''Theory into Practice 44''(1), 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;. In spite of all of these advantages, though, parent-teacher conferences have limitations. Some parents have trouble getting to conferences, for example, because of their work schedules. Others may feel intimated by any school-sponsored event because they speak limited English or because they remember getting along poorly in school themselves as children.

Even if you make all of these efforts to communicate, some parents may remain out of contact. In these cases it is important to remember that the causes may not be parents’ indifference to their child or to the value of education. Other possibilities exist, as some of our comments above indicate: parents may have difficulties with child care, for example, have inconvenient work schedules, or feel self-conscious because of their own limited English skills (Stevens &amp; Tollafield, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, B. &amp; Tollafield, A. (2003). Creating comfortable and productive parent/teacher conferences. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 84''(7), 521-525.&lt;/ref&gt;. Whatever the reasons, there are ways to encourage parents who may be shy, hesitant, or busy. One is to think of how they can assist the class or school even from home—for example, by making materials to be used in class or (if they are comfortable using English) phoning other parents about class events. A second way is to have a specific task for the parents in mind—one with clear structure, definite starting and ending points, and one that truly will benefit the class if someone can in fact complete it. A third is to encourage, support, and respect the parents’ presence and contributions when they do show up at school functions. Keep in mind, after all, that parents are experts about their own particular children, and without their efforts, you would have no students to teach!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Responding to Student Misbehavior==
So far we have focused on preventing behaviors that are off-task, inappropriate, or annoying. Our advice has all been pro-active or forward-looking: plan the classroom space thoughtfully, create reasonable procedures and rules, pace lessons and activities appropriately, and communicate the importance of learning clearly. Although we consider these ideas to be important, it would be naïve to imply they are enough to prevent all behavior problems. For various reasons, students sometimes still do things that disrupt other students or interrupt the flow of activities. At such moments the challenge is not about long-term planning but about making appropriate, but prompt responses. Misbehaviors left alone can be contagious, a process educators sometimes call the '''ripple effect''' (Kounin, 1970)&lt;ref&gt;Kounin, J. (1970). ''Discipline and group management in classrooms.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;. Chatting between two students, for example, can gradually become chatting among six students; rudeness by one can eventually become rudeness by several; and so on. Because of this tendency, delaying a response to inappropriate behavior can make the job of getting students back on track harder than responding to it as immediately as possible.

There are many ways to respond to inappropriate behaviors, of course, and they vary in how much they focus on the immediate behavior of a student rather than on longer-term patterns of behavior. There are so many ways to respond, in fact, that we can only describe a sampling of the possibilities here. None are effective all of the time, though all do work at least some of the time. We start with a response that may not seem on the surface like a remedy at all—simply ignoring misbehaviors.

===Ignoring Misbehaviors===
A lot of misbehaviors are not important enough or frequent enough to deserve any response from the teacher at all. They are likely to disappear (or extinguish, in behaviorist terms) if simply left alone. If a student who is usually quiet during class happens to whisper to a neighbor once in awhile, it is probably simpler, less disruptive, and just as effective to ignore this rare infraction of a classroom rule. And some misbehaviors may not be worth a response even if they are frequent, as long as they do not seem to bother others. Suppose, for example, that a certain student has a habit of choosing quiet seat work times to sharpen her pencil. Yet this behavior is not really noticed by others. Is it then really a problem, however unnecessary or ill-timed it may be? In both examples ignoring the behavior may be wise because there is little danger of the behavior spreading to other students or of become even more frequent. Interrupting your activities—or the students’—might cause more disruption than simply ignoring the problem.

That said, there can sometimes still be problems in deciding whether a particular misbehavior is indeed minor, infrequent, or unnoticed by others. Unlike in our example above, a student may whisper more than “rarely” but less than “often”: in that case, when do you decide that the whispering is in fact too frequent and needs a more active response from you? Or that student who taps her pencil, whom we mentioned above, may not bother most others, but she may nonetheless bother a few. In that case how many bothered classmates are “too many”—five, three, just one, or…? In these grey, ambiguous cases, you may need a more active way of dealing with an inappropriate behavior, like the ones described in the next sections.

===Gesturing Nonverbally===
Sometimes it works to communicate using gestures, eye contact, or “body language” that involve little or no speaking. Nonverbal cues are often appropriate if a misbehavior is just a bit too serious or frequent to ignore, but not serious or frequent enough to merit taking the time deliberately to speak to or talk with the student. If two students are chatting off-task for a relatively extended time, for example, sometimes a glance in their direction, a frown, or even just moving closer to the students is enough of a reminder to get them back on task. And even if these responses prove not to be enough, they may help to keep the off-task behavior from spreading to other students.

A risk of relying on nonverbal cues, however, is that some students may not understand their meaning, or even notice them. If the two chatting students mentioned above are too engrossed in their talking, for example, they may not see you glance or frown at them. Or they might notice but not interpret your cue as a reminder to get back on task. Misinterpretation of nonverbal gestures and cues is a little more likely with young children, who are still learning the subtleties of adults’ nonverbal “language” (Guerrero &amp; Floyd, 2005; Heimann, et al., 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L. &amp; Floyd, K. (2005). ''Nonverbal communication in close relationships.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heimann , M. Strid, K., Smith , L.,  Tjus , T.,  Ulvund , S. &amp; Meltzoff, A. (2006). Exploring the relation between memory, gestural communication, and the emergence of language in infancy: a longitudinal study. ''Infant and Child Development, 15(''3), 233-249.&lt;/ref&gt;. It can also be more likely with students who speak limited English and whose cultural background differs significantly different from yours, because the students may be used to communicating nonverbally in ways that literally “look different” from the ways familiar to you (Marsh, Elfenbein, &amp; Ambady, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, A., Elfenbein, H. &amp; Ambady, N. (2003). Nonverbal &quot;accents&quot;: cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion. ''Psychological Science, 14''(3), 373-376.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Natural and Logical Consequences===
Consequences are the outcomes or results of an action. When managing a classroom, two kinds of consequences are especially effective, at least when the conditions are appropriate: natural consequences and logical consequences. Natural consequences are ones that happen “naturally” or without any deliberate intention by anyone. If a student is late for class, for example, a natural consequence is that he may miss information or material that he needs to do an assignment. Logical consequences are ones that happen because of the responses of others, but that also have an obvious or “logical” relationship to the original action. If one student steals another’s lunch, for example, a logical consequence might be for the thief to reimburse the victim for the cost of the lunch. Natural and logical consequences are often woven together and thus hard to distinguish: if one student picks a fight with another student, a natural consequence might be injury to the aggressor (a natural risk of fighting), but a logical consequence might to lose friends (the response of others to fighting). In practice both may occur.

In general research has found that natural and logical consequences can be effective for minimizing undesirable behaviors, provided they are applied in appropriate situations (Weinstein, Tomlinson-Clarke, &amp; Curran, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, C.,Tomlinson-Clarke, S., &amp; Curran, M. (2004). Toward a conception of culturally responsive classroom management. ''Journal of Teacher Education, 55''(1), 25-38.&lt;/ref&gt;. Take, for example, a student who runs impulsively down school hallways. By the very nature of this action, he or she is especially likely to have “traffic accidents,” and thus (hopefully) to see that running is not safe and to reduce the frequency of running. Or think of a student who chronically talks during class instead of working on a class-time assignment. A logical outcome of this choice is to require the student to make up the assignment later, possibly as homework. Because the behavior and the consequence are connected directly, the student is relatively likely to see the drawback of choosing to talk, and to reduce how much he or she talks on subsequent occasions. In both cases, the key features that make natural and logical consequences work is
# that they are appropriate to the misbehavior and
#that the student sees or understands the connection between the consequences and the original behavior.

Notice, though, that natural and logical consequences do not work for every problem behavior; if they did, there would be no further need for management strategies! One limitation is that misbehaviors can sometimes be so serious that no natural or logical consequence seems sufficient or appropriate. Suppose, for example, that one student deliberately breaks another student’s eyeglasses. There may be a natural consequence for the victim (he or she will not be able to see easily), but not for student who broke the glasses. There may also be no logical consequences for the aggressor that are fully satisfactory: the misbehaving student will not be able to repair the broken glasses and may not even be able to pay for new glasses for the victim.

Another limitation of natural and logical consequences is that their success depends on the motives of the misbehaving student. If the student is seeking attention or acceptance by others, then the consequences often work well. Bullying in order to impress others, for example, is more likely to lose friends than to win them—so this sort of bullying is to some extent self-limiting. If a student is seeking power over others, on the other hand, then consequences may not work well. Bullying in order to control others’ actions, for example, may actually achieve its own goal, and its “natural” results (losing friends) would not affect it. And of course, students may sometimes act from combinations of motives, with the result that natural and logical consequences may succeed, but only partially.

A third problem with natural and logical consequences is that they can easily be confused with deliberate punishment (Kohn, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2006). ''Beyond discipline: From compliance to community.'' Reston, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;. The difference is important. Consequences are focused on repairing damage and restoring relationships, and in this sense consequences focus on the future. Punishments, in contrast, highlight the mistake or wrongdoing and in this sense focus on the past. Consequences tend to be more solution focused; punishments tend to highlight the person who committed the action and to shame or humiliate the wrong doer. ([[Table 7-2]] summarizes these and other differences.) 

Classroom examples of the differences are plentiful. If a student is late for class, then a consequence may be that he or she misses important information, but a punishment may be that the teacher scolds or reprimands the student. If a student speaks rudely to the teacher, a consequence may be that the teacher does not respond to the comment, or simply reminds the student to speak courteously. A punishment may be that the teacher scolds the student in the presence of other students, or even imposes a detention (“Stay after school for 15 minutes”).

===Conflict Resolution and Problem Solving===
When a student misbehaves persistently and disruptively, you will need strategies that are more active and assertive than the ones discussed so far, and that lead to conflict resolution—the reduction of disagreements that persist over time. The conflict resolution strategies that educators and teachers advocate and use usually have two parts (Jones, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Jones, T. (2004). Conflict resolution education: The field, the findings, and the future. ''Conflict Resolution Quarterly, 22''(1-2), 233-267.&lt;/ref&gt;. First, the strategies involve a way of identifying precisely what “the” problem is. Once this is done, they require reminding the student of classroom expectations and rules without apology or harshness, but with simple clarity and assertiveness. When used together, the clarification and assertion can not only reduce conflicts between a teacher and an individual student, but also provide a model for other students to consider when they have disagreements of their own.

:'''Step 1: Clarifying and Focusing Problem Ownership''': Classrooms can be emotional places even when its primary purpose is to promote “thinking” rather than the expression of feelings as such. The emotional quality can be quite desirable: it can give teachers and students “passion” for learning and respect or even good feelings for each other. But it can also cause trouble if students misbehave: at those moments negative feelings—annoyance, anger, discomfort—can interfere with understanding exactly what went wrong and how to set things right again. But gaining a bit of distance from the negative feelings is exactly those moments need, especially by the teacher, the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity.

:In one widely cited and used approach to conflict resolution called '''Teacher Effectiveness Training''', the educator Thomas Gordon discusses this challenge as a matter of identifying problem ownership: deciding whose problem a behavior or conflict really is (Gordon, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2003). ''Teacher effectiveness training.'' New York: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The “owner” of the problem is the primary person who is troubled or bothered by it. The owner can be the student committing the behavior, or the teacher, or another student who merely happens to see the behavior. Since the owner of a problem needs to take responsibility for solving it, ownership makes a difference in how to deal with the behavior or problem effectively.

:Suppose, for example, that a student makes a remark that the teacher finds offensive (like “Fats kids are stupid”). This could be primarily the teacher’s problem because it is mostly the teacher who is bothered by the remark. The student may not believe that anything serious is wrong with the remark. On the other hand, suppose that a different student complains repeatedly that classmates refuse to let him into group projects. This is less likely to be the teacher’s problem than the student’s: the student’s difficulty may affect the student’s ability to do his work, but not really affect the teacher’s ability to do her work. Then again (on the “third” hand?!), a problem may affect several people at once. That student who criticizes “fat kids” may discover that he is offending not only the teacher, but also classmates, who therefore avoid working with him. At that point everyone shares in some aspect of “the” problem: the criticizing student is prevented from doing his group work, and many classmates and the teacher are offended.

:'''Step 2: Active, Empathetic Listening''': Diagnosing accurately who really has a problem with a behavior—who owns it—is helped by a number of strategies. One is active listening—attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to understand or empathize with it as fully as possible, even if you do not agree with what is being said (Cooper &amp; Simonds, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, P. &amp; Simonds, C. (2003). ''Communication for the classroom teacher, 7th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Active listening involves asking a lot of questions in order continually to check your understanding. It also involves encouraging the student to elaborate or expand on his or her remarks, and paraphrasing and summarizing what the student has said in order to check your perceptions of what is being said. It is important not to move too fast toward “solving” the problem with advice, instructions, or scolding, even if these are responses that you might, as a teacher, feel responsible for making. Responding too soon in these ways can shut down communication prematurely, and leave you with an inaccurate impression of the source of the problem.

:'''Step 3: Assertive Discipline and I-Messages''': Once you have listened well enough to understand the student’s point of view, it helps to frame your responses and comments in terms of how the student’s behavior affects you as a teacher. The comments should have several features:

::* They should be ''assertive''—neither passive and apologetic, nor unnecessarily hostile or aggressive. State what the problem is, as matter-of-factly as possible: “Joe, you are talking while I’m explaining something,” instead of either “Joe, do you think you could be quiet now?” or “Joe, be quiet!”

::* The comments should emphasize ''I-messages,'' which are comments that focus on how the problem behavior is affecting the teacher’s ability to teach, as well as how the behavior makes the teacher feel. They are distinct from ''you-messages,'' which focus on evaluating the mistake or problem which the student has created. An I-message might be, “Your talking is making it hard for me to remember what I’m trying to say.” A you-message might be, “Your talking is rude.”

::* The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others—a strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, J. (2003). ''Moral development and reality: Beyond the theories of Kohlberg and Hoffman.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead of simply saying, “When you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them,” you can try saying, “How do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?”

:'''Step 4: Negotiation''': The steps so far describe ways of interacting that are desirable, but also fairly specific in scope and limited in duration. In themselves they may not be enough when conflict persists over time and develops a number of complications or confusing features. A student may persist, for example, in being late for class, in spite of diverse efforts by the teacher to modify this behavior. Two students may persist in speaking rudely to each other, even though the teacher has mediated this conflict in the past. Or a student may fail to complete homework, time after time. Because these problems develop over time, and because they may involve repeated disagreements between teacher and student, they can eventually become stressful for the teacher, for the student, and for any classmates who may be affected. Their persistence can tempt a teacher simply to announce or dictate a resolution—a decision that may simply leave everyone feeling defeated, including the teacher.

:Often in these situations it is better to negotiate a solution, which means systematically discussing options and compromising on one if possible. Negotiation always requires time and effort, though usually not as much as continuing to cope with the original problem, and the results can be beneficial to everyone. A number of experts on conflict resolution have suggested strategies for negotiating with students about persistent problems (Davidson &amp; Wood, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J. &amp; Wood, C. (2004). A conflict resolution model. ''Theory into Practice, 43''(1), 6-13.&lt;/ref&gt;. The suggestions vary in detail, but usually include some combination of the steps we have already discussed above, along with a few others. 

::* ''Decide as accurately as possible what the problem is''—Usually this step involves a lot of the active listening described above.

::* ''Brainstorm possible solutions, and then consider their effectiveness''—Remember to include students in this step; otherwise you are simply imposing a solution on others, which is not what negotiation is supposed to achieve.

::* ''Choose a solution, if possible by consensus''—Complete agreement on the choice may not be possible, but strive for it as best you can. Remember that taking a vote may be a democratic, acceptable way to settle differences in many situations. If feelings are running high, however, voting has an ironic by-product: it simply allows individuals to “announce” their differences to each other and therefore maintain the conflict.

::* ''Pay attention later to how well the solution works''—For many reasons, things may not work out the way you or the students hope or expect, and you may need to renegotiate the solution at a later time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motives as Interests==
In addition to holding different kinds of goals—with consequent differences in academic motivation—students show obvious differences in level of interest in the topics and tasks of the classroom. Suppose that two high school classmates, Frank and Jason, both are taking chemistry, and specifically learning how to balance chemical equations. Frank finds the material boring and has to force himself to study it; as a result he spends only the time needed to learn the basic material and to complete the assignments at a basic level. Jason, on the other hand, enjoys the challenges of balancing chemical equations. He thinks of the task as an intriguing puzzle; he not only solves each of them, but also compares the problems to each other as he goes through them.

Frank’s learning is based on effort compared to Jason’s, whose learning is based more fully on interest. As the example implies, when students learn from interest they tend to devote more attention to the topic than if they learn from effort (Hidi &amp; Renninger, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hidi, S. &amp; Renninger, A. (2006). A four-phase model of interest development. ''Educational Psychologist, 41,'' 111-127.&lt;/ref&gt;. The finding is not surprising since interest is another aspect of intrinsic motivation—energy or drive that comes from within. A distinction between effort and interest is often artificial, however, because the two motives often get blended or combined in students’ personal experiences. Most of us can remember times when we worked at a skill that we enjoyed and found interesting, but that also required effort to learn. The challenge for teachers is therefore to draw on and encourage students’ interest as much as possible, and thus keep the required effort within reasonable bounds—neither too hard nor too easy.

===Situational Interest versus Personal Interest===
Students’ interests vary in how deeply or permanently they are located within students. Situational interests are ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate situation. Unusual sights, sounds, or words can stimulate situational interest. A teacher might show an interesting image on the overhead projector, or play a brief bit of music, or make a surprising comment in passing. At a more abstract level, unusual or surprising topics of discussion can also arouse interest when they are first introduced. Personal interests are relatively permanent preferences of the student, and are usually expressed in a variety of situations. In the classroom, a student may (or may not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities, or subject matter. Outside class, though, he or she usually has additional personal interests in particular non-academic activities (e.g. sports, music) or even in particular people (a celebrity, a friend who lives nearby). The non-academic personal interests may sometimes conflict with academic interest; it may be more interesting to go to the shopping mall with a friend than to study even your most favorite subject.

====Benefits of Personal Interest====
In general personal interest in an academic topic or activity tends to correlate with achievement related to the topic or activity. As you might suppose, a student who is truly interested is more likely to focus on the topic or activity more fully, to work at it for longer periods, to use more thoughtful strategies in learning—and to enjoy doing so (Hidi &amp; Renninger, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hidi, S. &amp; Renninger, A. (2006). A four-phase model of interest development. ''Educational Psychologist, 41,'' 111-127.&lt;/ref&gt;. Small wonder that the student achieves more! Note, though, a persistent ambiguity about this benefit: it is often not clear whether personal interest leads to higher achievement, or higher achievement leads to stronger interest. Either possibility seems plausible. Research to sort them out, however, has suggested that at least some of the influence goes in the direction from interest to achievement; when elementary students were given books from which to learn about a new topic, for example, they tended to learn more from books which they chose themselves than from books that were simply assigned (Reynolds &amp; Symons, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, P. &amp; Symons, S. (2001). Motivational variables and children’s text search. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 93,'' 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt;. So interest seemed to lead to learning. But this conclusion does not rule out its converse, that achievement may stimulate interest as well. As Joe learns more about history, he steadily finds history more interesting; as McKenzie learns more about biology, she gradually wants to learn more of it.

===Stimulating Situational Interests===
If a student has little prior personal interest in a topic or activity, the teacher is faced with stimulating initial, situational interest, in hopes that the initial interest will gradually become a more permanent and personal. There are a number of strategies for meeting this challenge:

:* It helps to include surprises in your comments and in classroom activities from time to time: tell students facts that are true but counter-intuitive, for example, or demonstrate a science experiment that turns out differently than students expect (Guthrie, Wigfield, &amp; Humenick, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, J., Wigfield, A., &amp; Humenick, N. (2006). Influences of stimulating tasks on reading motivation and comprehension. ''Journal of Educational Research, 99,'' 232-245.&lt;/ref&gt;.

:* It also helps to relate new material to students’ prior experiences even if their experiences are not related to academics or to school directly. The concepts of gravitation and acceleration, for example, operate every time a ball is hit or thrown in a softball game. If this connection is pointed out to a student who enjoys playing a lot of softball, the concepts can make concepts more interesting.

:* And it helps to encourage students to respond to new material actively. By having students talk about the material together, for example, student can begin making their own connections to prior personal interests, and the social interaction itself helps to link the material to their personal, social interests as well.

====A Caution: Seductive Details====
Even though it is important to stimulate interest in new material somehow, it is also possible to mislead or distract students accidentally by adding inappropriate, but stimulating features to new material (Garner, et al., 1992; Harp &amp; Mayer, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Garner, R., Brown, R., Sanders, S. &amp; Menke, D. (1992). “Seductive details” and learning from text. In A. Renninger, S. Hidi, &amp; A. Krapp (Eds.), ''The role of interest in learning and development,'' pp. 239-254. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp, S. &amp; Mayer, R. (1998). How seductive details do their damage. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 90,'' 414-434.&lt;/ref&gt;. Distractions happen a number of ways, such as any of these among others:

:* deliberately telling jokes in class,
:* using colorful illustrations or pictures,
:* adding interesting bits of information to a written or verbal explanation.

When well chosen, all of these moves can indeed arouse students’ interest in a new topic. But if they do not really relate to the topic at hand, they may simply create misunderstandings or prevent students from focusing on key material. As with most other learning processes, however, there are individual differences among students in distractability, with students who are struggling more prone to distraction and misunderstanding than students who are already learning more successfully (Sanchez &amp; Wiley, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, C. &amp; Wiley, J. (2006). An examination of the seductive details effect in terms of working memory capacity. ''Memory and Cognition, 34,'' 344-355.&lt;/ref&gt;. On balance the best advice is probably therefore to use strategies to arouse situational interest, but to assess students’ responses to them continually and as honestly as possible. The key issue is whether students seem to learn because of stimulating strategies that you provide, or in spite of them.

LaTeX describes what it is typesetting while it does it. If it encounters something it doesn't understand or can't do, it will display a message saying what is wrong. It may also display warnings for less serious conditions.

''Don't panic if you see error messages'': it is very common to mistype or misspell commands, forget curly braces, type a forward slash instead of a backslash, or use a special character by mistake. Errors are easily spotted and easily corrected in your editor, and you can then run LaTeX again to check you have fixed everything. Some of the most common errors are described in next sections.

== Error messages ==
The format of an error message is always the same. Error messages begin with an exclamation mark at the start of the line, and give a description of the error, followed by another line starting with the number, which refers to the line-number in your document file which LaTeX was processing when the error was spotted. Here's an example, showing that the user mistyped the &lt;tt&gt;\tableofcontents&lt;/tt&gt;
command:

&lt;pre&gt;
! Undefined control sequence.
l.6 \tableofcotnetns
&lt;/pre&gt;

When LaTeX finds an error like this, it displays the error message and pauses. You must type one of the following letters to
continue:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Key 
!Meaning
|-
|x
|Stop immediately and e'''x'''it the program.
|-
|q
|Carry on '''q'''uietly as best you can and don't bother me with any more error messages.
|-
|e
|Stop the program but re-position the text in my '''e'''ditor at the point where you found the error (This only works if you're using an editor which LaTeX can communicate with).
|-
|h
|Try to give me more '''h'''elp.
|-
|i
|(followed by a correction) means '''i'''nput the correction in place of the error and carry on (This is only a temporary fix to get the file processed. You still have to make that correction in the editor).
|-
|r
|'''r'''un in non-stop mode. Plow through any errors, unless too many pile up and it fails (100 errors).
|-
|}

Some systems (Emacs is one example) run LaTeX with a &quot;nonstop&quot; switch turned on, so it will always process through to the end of the file, regardless of errors, or until a limit is reached.

==Warnings==
Warnings don't begin with an exclamation mark: they are just comments by LaTeX about things you might want to look into, such as overlong or underrun lines (often caused by unusual hyphenations, for example), pages running short or long, and other typographical niceties (most of which you can ignore until later).
Unlike other systems, which try to hide unevennesses in the text (usually unsuccessfully) by interfering with the letter spacing, LaTeX takes the view that the author or editor should be able to contribute. While it is certainly possible to set LaTeX's parameters so that the spacing is sufficiently sloppy that you will almost never get a warning about badly-fitting lines or pages, you will almost certainly just be delaying matters until you start to get complaints from your readers or publishers.

==Examples==

Only a few common error messages are given here: those most likely to be encountered by beginners. If you find another error message not shown here, and it's not clear what you should do, ask for help.

Most error messages are self-explanatory, but be aware that the place where LaTeX spots and reports an error may be later in the file than the place where it actually occurred. For example if you forget to close a curly brace which encloses, say, italics, LaTeX won't report this until something else occurs which can't happen until the curly brace is encountered (e.g. the end of the document!) Some errors can only be righted by humans who can read and understand what the document is supposed to mean or look like.

Newcomers should remember to check the list of special characters: a very large number of errors when you are learning LaTeX are due to accidentally typing a special character when you didn't mean to. This disappears after a few days as you get used to them.

===Too many }'s ===

&lt;pre&gt;	
! Too many }'s.
l.6 \date December 2004}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The reason LaTeX thinks there are too many }'s here is that the opening curly brace is missing after the &lt;tt&gt;\date&lt;/tt&gt; control sequence and before the word December, so the closing curly brace is seen as one too many (which it is!). In fact, there are other things which can follow the &lt;tt&gt;\date&lt;/tt&gt; command apart from a date in curly braces, so LaTeX cannot possibly guess that you've missed out the opening curly brace until it finds a closing one!

===Undefined control sequence===

&lt;pre&gt;
! Undefined control sequence.
l.6 \dtae
{December 2004}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, LaTeX is complaining that it has no such command (&quot;control sequence&quot;) as &lt;tt&gt;\dtae&lt;/tt&gt;. Obviously it's been mistyped, but only a human can detect that fact: all LaTeX knows is that &lt;tt&gt;\dtae&lt;/tt&gt; is not a command it knows about: it's undefined. Mistypings are the most common source of errors. Some editors allow common commands and environments to be inserted using drop-down menus or icons, which may be used to avoid these errors.

===Not in Mathematics Mode===

&lt;pre&gt;
! Missing $ inserted
&lt;/pre&gt;

A character that can only be used in the mathematics was inserted in normal text.
If you intended to use mathematics mode, then use &lt;tt&gt;$...$ &lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\begin{math}...\end{math}&lt;/tt&gt; or use the 'quick math mode': &lt;tt&gt;\ensuremath{...}&lt;/tt&gt;.
If you did not intend to use mathematics mode, then perhaps you are trying to use a [[LaTeX/Basics#Special_Characters|special character]] that needs to be entered in a different way; for example &lt;tt&gt;_&lt;tt&gt; will be interpreted as a subscript operator in mathematics mode, and you need &lt;tt&gt;\_&lt;/tt&gt; to get an underscore character.

This can also happen if you use the wrong character encoding, for example using utf8 without &quot;\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}&quot; or using iso8859-1 without &quot;\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}&quot;, there are several character encoding formats, make sure to pick the right one.

===Runaway argument===

&lt;pre&gt;
Runaway argument?
{December 2004 \maketitle
! Paragraph ended before \date was complete.
&lt;to be read again&gt;
\par
l.8
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this error, the closing curly brace has been omitted from the date. It's the opposite of the error of too many }'s, and it results in &lt;tt&gt;\maketitle&lt;/tt&gt; trying to format the title page while LaTeX is still expecting more text for the date! As \maketitle creates new paragraphs on the title page, this is detected and LaTeX complains that the previous paragraph has ended but \date is not yet finished.

===Underfull hbox===

&lt;pre&gt;	
Underfull \hbox (badness 1394) in paragraph
at lines 28--30
[][]\LY1/brm/b/n/10 Bull, RJ: \LY1/brm/m/n/10
Ac-count-ing in Busi-
[94]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is a warning that LaTeX cannot stretch the line wide enough to fit, without making the spacing bigger than its currently permitted maximum. The badness (0-10,000) indicates how severe this is (here you can probably ignore a badness of 1394). It says what lines of your file it was typesetting when it found this, and the number in square brackets is the number of the page onto which the offending line was printed. The codes separated by slashes are the typeface and font style and size used in the line. Ignore them for the moment. 

This comes up if you force a linebreak, e.g., \\, and have a return before it. Normally TeX ignores linebreaks, providing full paragraphs to ragged text. In this case it is necessary to pull the linebreak up one line to the end of the previous sentence.

===Overfull hbox===

&lt;pre&gt;
[101]
Overfull \hbox (9.11617pt too wide) in paragraph
at lines 860--861
[]\LY1/brm/m/n/10 Windows, \LY1/brm/m/it/10 see
\LY1/brm/m/n/10 X Win-
&lt;/pre&gt;

An overfull \hbox means that there is a hyphenation or justification problem: moving the last word on the line to the next line would make the spaces in the line wider than the current limit; keeping the word on the line would make the spaces smaller than the current limit, so the word is left on the line, but with the minimum allowed space between words, and which makes the line go over the edge.

The warning is given so that you can find the line in the code that originates the problem (in this case: 860-861) and fix it. The line on this example is too long by a shade over 9pt. The chosen hyphenation point which minimizes the error is shown at the end of the line (Win-). Line numbers and page numbers are given as before. In this case, 9pt is too much to ignore (over 3mm), and a manual correction needs making (such as a change to the hyphenation), or the flexibility settings need changing.

If the &quot;overfull&quot; word includes a forward slash, such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;input/output&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, this should be properly typeset as &quot;&lt;code&gt;input\slash output&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The use of &lt;code&gt;\slash&lt;/code&gt; has the same effect as using the &quot;&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&quot; character, except that it can form the end of a line (with the following words appearing at the start of the next line). The &quot;&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&quot; character is typically used in units, such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;mm/year&lt;/code&gt;&quot; character, which should not be broken over multiple lines.

The warning can also be issued when the \end{document} tag was not included and/or was deleted.

===Missing package===

&lt;pre&gt;
! LaTeX Error: File `paralisy.sty' not found.
Type X to quit or &lt;RETURN&gt; to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)
Enter file name:
&lt;/pre&gt;

When you use the &lt;tt&gt;\usepackage&lt;/tt&gt; command to request LaTeX to use a certain package, it will look for a file with the specified name and the filetype &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt;. In this case the user has mistyped the name of the paralist package, so it's easy to fix. However, if you get the name right, but the package is not installed on your machine, you will need to download and install it before continuing. If you don't want to affect the global installation of the machine, you can simply download from Internet the necessary &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt; file and put it in the same folder of the document you are compiling.

===Package babel Warning: No hyphenation patterns were loaded for the language X===
Although this is a warning from the Babel package and not from LaTeX, this error is very common and (can) give some strange hyphenation (word breaking) problems in your document. Wrong hyphenation rules can decrease the neatness of your document.
&lt;pre&gt;
Package babel Warning: No hyphenation patterns were loaded for
(babel)                the language `Latin'
(babel)                I will use the patterns loaded for \language=0 instead.
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can happen after the usage of: (see [[LaTeX/Internationalization]])

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[latin]{babel}
&lt;/source&gt;

The solution is not difficult, just install the used language in your [[LaTeX/Installation#TeX_and_LaTeX|LaTeX distribution]].

===Package babel Error: You haven't loaded the option X yet.===
If you previously set the X language, and then decided to switch to Y, you will get this error.
This may seem awkward, as there is obviously no error in your code if you did not change anything.
The answer lies in the &lt;tt&gt;.aux&lt;/tt&gt; file, where babel defined your language.
If you try the compilation a second time, it should work.
If not, delete the &lt;tt&gt;.aux&lt;/tt&gt; file, then everything will work as usual.

===No error message, but won't compile===
{{expand|section}}
One common cause of (pdf)LaTeX getting stuck is forgetting to include &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\end{document}&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motives Related to Attributions==
Attributions are perceptions about the causes of success and failure. Suppose that you get a low mark on a test and are wondering what caused the low mark. You can construct various explanations for—make various attributions about—this failure. Maybe you did not study very hard; maybe the test itself was difficult; maybe you were unlucky; maybe you just are not smart enough. Each explanation attributes the failure to a different factor. The explanation that you settle upon may reflect the truth accurately—or then again, they may not. What is important about attributions is that they reflect personal beliefs about the sources or causes of success and failure. As such, they tend to affect motivation in various ways, depending on the nature of the attribution (Weiner, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (2005). Motivation from an attribution perspective and the social psychology of perceived competence. In A. Elliot &amp; C. Dweck (Eds.), ''Handbook of Competence and Motivation,'' pp. 73-84. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Locus, Stability, and Controllability===
Attributions vary in three underlying ways: ''locus,'' ''stability,'' and ''controllability.'' '''Locus''' of an attribution is the location (figuratively speaking) of the source of success or failure. If you attribute a top mark on a test to your ability, then the locus is internal; if you attribute the mark to the test’s having easy questions, then the locus is external. The '''stability''' of an attribution is its relative permanence. If you attribute the mark to your ability, then the source of success is relatively stable—by definition, ability is a relatively lasting quality. If you attribute a top mark to the effort you put in to studying, then the source of success is unstable—effort can vary and has to be renewed on each occasion or else it disappears. The '''controllability''' of an attribution is the extent to which the individual can influence it. If you attribute a top mark to your effort at studying, then the source of success is relatively controllable—you can influence effort simply by deciding how much to study. But if you attribute the mark to simple luck, then the source of the success is uncontrollable—there is nothing that can influence random chance.

As you might suspect, the way that these attributions combine affects students’ academic motivations in major ways. It usually helps both motivation and achievement if a student attributes academic successes and failures to factors that are internal and controllable, such as effort or a choice to use particular learning strategies (Dweck, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. (2000). ''Self-theories: Their role in motivation, personality, and development.'' Philadelphia: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Attributing successes to factors that are internal but stable or controllable (like ability), on the other hand, is both a blessing and a curse: sometimes it can create optimism about prospects for future success (“I always do well”), but it can also lead to indifference about correcting mistakes (Dweck, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. (2006). ''Mindset: The new psychology of success.'' New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;, or even create pessimism if a student happens not to perform at the accustomed level (“Maybe I’m not as smart as I thought”). Worst of all for academic motivation are attributions, whether stable or not, related to external factors. Believing that performance depends simply on luck (“The teacher was in a bad mood when marking”) or on excessive difficulty of material removes incentive for a student to invest in learning. All in all, then, it seems important for teachers to encourage internal, stable attributions about success.

===Influencing Students’ Attributions===
How can they do so? One way or another, the effective strategies involve framing teachers’ own explanations of success and failure around internal, controllable factors. Instead of telling a student “Good work! You’re smart!”, try saying “Good work! Your effort really made a difference, didn’t it?” If a student fails, instead of saying “Too bad! This material is just too hard for you,” try saying “Let’s find a strategy for practicing this more, and then you can try again.” In both cases the first option emphasizes uncontrollable factors (effort, difficulty level), and the second option emphasizes internal, controllable factors (effort, use of specific strategies). 

Such attributions will only be convincing, however, if teachers provide appropriate conditions for students to learn—conditions in which students’ efforts really do pay off. There are three conditions that have to be in place in particular. First, academic tasks and materials actually have to be at about the right level of difficulty. If you give problems in advanced calculus to a first-grade student, the student will not only fail them but also be justified in attributing the failure to an external factor, task difficulty. If assignments are assessed in ways that produce highly variable, unreliable marks (in the statistical sense—see [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 11: Standardized and Other Formal Assessments|Chapter 11]]), then students will rightly attribute their performance to an external, unstable source: luck. Both circumstances will interfere with motivation.

Second, teachers also need to be ready to give help to individuals who need it—even if they believe that an assignment is easy enough or clear enough that students should not need individual help. Readiness to help is always essential because it is often hard to know in advance exactly how hard a task will prove to be for particular students. Without assistance, a task that proves difficult initially may remain difficult indefinitely, and the student will be tempted to make unproductive, though correct, attributions about his or her failure (“I will never understand this” or “I’m not smart enough” or “It doesn’t matter how hard I study”).

Third, teachers need to remember that ability—usually considered a relatively stable factor—often actually changes incrementally over the long term. Recognizing this fact is one of the best ways to bring about actual increases in students’ abilities (Blackwell, Trzniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2007; Schunk, Pintrich, &amp; Meese, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, L., Trzniewski, K., &amp; Dweck, C. (2007). Implicit theories predict achievement across an adolescent transition: a longitudinal study. ''Child Development, 78,'' 246-263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, D. &amp; Zimmerman, B. (1997). Social origins of self-regulatory competence. ''Educational psychologist, 34''(4), 195-208.&lt;/ref&gt;. A middle-years student might play the trumpet in the school band at a high level of ability, but this ability actually reflects a lot of previous effort and a gradual increase in ability. A second-grade student who reads fluently and in this sense may have high current ability to read; but at some point in the distant past that same student could not read as well, and even further back he may not have been able to read at all. The increases in ability have happened at least in part because of effort. While these ideas may seem obvious, they can easily be forgotten in the classroom because effort and ability evolve according to very different time frames. Effort and its results appear relatively immediately; a student expends effort this week, this day, or even at this very moment, and the effort (if not the results) are visible right away. But ability may take longer to show itself; a student often develops it only over many weeks, months, or years.

== Overview ==

'''''Amycus Carrow''''', brother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. When we first see him, he is described as a lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Alecto and Amycus are two of the Death Eaters who break out of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]] in about March. While their names are not mentioned at the time of the breakout, their membership in that group is strongly implied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s comments in the early chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] mentions the Carrows when he is talking to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]].

The Carrows take part in the attack on Hogwarts. Both of them are at the top of the tower when Snape kills [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. During the Death Eater's escape, Amycus was seen overwhelming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] before being repelled by Harry. He was later ordered by Snape to leave the grounds along with his sister and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

With Snape being appointed Headmaster, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charity Burbage|Charity Burbage]] having been killed, there are vacancies for Defence Against the Dark Arts and Muggle Studies teachers. Amycus Carrow is given the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and supervises its change of focus to remove the Defence aspects of the course. According to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], under the supervision of Amycus Carrow the students were forced to perform horrible acts such as practicing the Cruciatus Curse on people who had earned detentions.

Amycus' sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto]], told by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] to expect Harry to visit Ravenclaw Tower, has herself let into the Ravenclaw common room before Harry's arrival. She is then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], who was accompanying Harry under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. Amycus, responding to her summons (Alecto has pressed her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]], to summon Voldemort), demands to be let in, but is unable to answer the riddle posed by the eagle's-head knocker guarding the door. Having been let in by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]], he finds his sister Stunned, and proposes to blame it on the students of Ravenclaw. McGonagall refuses to countenance this, Amycus spits at her, and Harry, outraged, hits Amycus with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]. When he regains consciousness, McGonagall places him briefly under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]], forcing him to give her his and his sister's wands, then lie down beside his sister, whereupon McGonagall binds them both. He takes no further part in the story.

== Strengths ==

Amycus Carrow seems to have brute strength, and we can assume better than average skill in the Dark Arts and offensive spell casting, as shown by Voldemort assigning him the position as Dark Arts teacher.

== Weaknesses ==

Amycus is not particularly intelligent; he is unable to enter Ravenclaw tower, as he is unable to propose an answer that the eagle-head guardian will accept. His initial response seems to be brute-force, and eventually he forces Professor McGonagall to open the door for him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motives as Self-Efficacy==
In addition to being influenced by their goals, interests, and attributions, students’ motives are affected by specific beliefs about the student’s personal capacities. In self-efficacy theory the beliefs become a primary, explicit explanation for motivation (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1977). Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change. ''Psychological Review, 84'', 191-215. Bandura, A. (1986). ''Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory.'' Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Bandura, A. (1997). ''Self-efficacy: The exercise of control.''  New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Self-efficacy''' is the belief that you are capable of carrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal. Note that the belief and the action or goal are specific. Self-efficacy is a belief that you can write an acceptable term paper, for example, or repair an automobile, or make friends with the new student in class. These are relatively specific beliefs and tasks. Self-efficacy is not about whether you believe that you are intelligent in general, whether you always like working with mechanical things, or think that you are generally a likeable person. These more general judgments are better regarded as various mixtures of self-concepts (beliefs about general personal identity) or of self-esteem (evaluations of identity). They are important in their own right, and sometimes influence motivation, but only indirectly (Bong &amp; Skaalvik, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Bong, M. &amp; Skaalvik, E. (2004). Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really? ''Educational psychology Review, 15''(1), 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt;. Self-efficacy beliefs, furthermore, are not the same as “true” or documented skill or ability. They are self-constructed, meaning that they are personally developed perceptions. There can sometimes therefore be discrepancies between a person’s self-efficacy beliefs and the person’s abilities. You can believe that you can write a good term paper, for example, without actually being able to do so. And vice versa: you can believe yourself incapable of writing a paper, but discover that you are in fact able to do so. In this way self-efficacy is like the everyday idea of confidence, except that it is defined more precisely. And as with confidence, it is possible have either too much or too little self-efficacy. The optimum level seems to be either at or slightly above true capacity. As we indicate below, large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can create motivational problems for the individual.

===Effects of Self-Efficacy on Students’ Behavior===
Self-efficacy may sound like a uniformly desirable quality, but research as well as teachers’ experience suggests that its effects are a bit more complicated than they first appear. Self-efficacy has three main effects, each of which has both a “dark” or undesirable side and a positive or desirable side. 

====Choice of Tasks====
The first effect is that self-efficacy makes students more willing to choose tasks where they already feel confident of succeeding. This effect is almost inevitable, given the definition of the concept of self-efficacy, it has also been supported by research on self-efficacy beliefs (Pajares &amp; Schunk, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Pajares, F. &amp; Schunk, D. (2002). Self-beliefs in psychology and education: An historical perspective. In J. Aronson (Ed.), ''Improving academic achievement'' (pp. 3-21). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. For teachers, the effect on choice can be either welcome or not, depending on circumstances. If a student believes that he or she can solve mathematical problems, then the student is more likely to attempt the mathematics homework that the teacher assigns. Unfortunately the converse is also true. If a student believes that he or she is incapable of math, then the student is less likely to attempt the math homework (perhaps telling himself, “What’s the use of trying?”), regardless of the student’s actual ability in math.

Since self-efficacy is self-constructed, furthermore, it is also possible for students to miscalculate or misperceive their true skill, and the misperceptions themselves can have complex effects on students’ motivations. From a teacher’s point of view, all is well even if students overestimate their capacity but actually do succeed at a relevant task anyway, or if they underestimate their capacity, yet discover that they can succeed and raise their self-efficacy beliefs as a result. All may not be well, though, if students do not believe that they can succeed and therefore do not even try, or if students overestimate their capacity by a wide margin, but are disappointed unexpectedly by failure and lower their self-efficacy beliefs.

====Persistence at Tasks====
A second effect of high self-efficacy is to increase a persistence at relevant tasks. If you believe that you can solve crossword puzzles, but encounter one that takes longer than usual, then you are more likely to work longer at the puzzle until you (hopefully) really do solve it. This is probably a desirable behavior in many situations, unless the persistence happens to interfere with other, more important tasks (what if you should be doing homework instead of working crossword puzzles?). If you happen to have low self-efficacy for crosswords, on the other hand, then you are more likely to give up early on a difficult puzzle. Giving up early may often be undesirable because it deprives you of a chance to improve your skill by persisting. Then again (on the third hand?), the consequent lack of success because of giving up may provide a useful incentive to improve your crossword skills. And again, misperceptions of capacity make a difference. Overestimating your capacity by a lot (excessively high self-efficacy) might lead you not to prepare for or focus on a task properly, and thereby impair your performance. So as with choosing tasks, the effects of self-efficacy vary from one individual to another and one situation to another. The teacher’s task is therefore twofold: first, to discern the variations, and second, to encourage the positive self-efficacy beliefs. [[Table 6-2]] offers some additional advice about how to do this.

====Response to Failure====
High self-efficacy for a task not only increases a person’s persistence at the task, but also improves their ability to cope with stressful conditions and to recover their motivation following outright failures. Suppose that you have two assignments—an essay and a science lab report—due on the same day, and this circumstance promises to make your life hectic as you approach the deadline. You will cope better with the stress of multiple assignments if you already believe yourself capable of doing both of the tasks, than if you believe yourself capable of doing just one of them or (especially) of doing neither. You will also recover better in the unfortunate event that you end up with a poor grade on one or even both of the tasks.

That is the good news. The bad news, at least from a teacher’s point of view, is that the same resilience can sometimes also serve non-academic and non-school purposes. How so? Suppose, instead of two school assignments due on the same day, a student has only one school assignment due, but also holds a part-time evening job as a server in a local restaurant. Suppose, further, that the student has high self-efficacy for both of these tasks; he believes, in other words, that he is capable of completing the assignment as well as continuing to work at the job. The result of such resilient beliefs can easily be a student who devotes less attention to school work than ideal, and who even ends up with a lower grade on the assignment than he or she is capable of.

===Learned Helplessness and Self-Efficacy===
If a person’s sense of self-efficacy is very low, he or she can develop learned helplessness, a perception of complete lack of control in mastering a task. The attitude is similar to depression, a pervasive feeling of apathy and a belief that effort makes no difference and does not lead to success. Learned helplessness was originally studied from the behaviorist perspective of classical and operant conditioning by the psychologist Martin Seligman (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Martin Seligman--add reference&lt;/ref&gt;. The studies used a somewhat “gloomy” experimental procedure in which an animal, such as a rat or a dog, was repeatedly shocked in a cage in a way that prevented the animal from escaping the shocks. In a later phase of the procedure, conditions were changed so that the animal could avoid the shocks by merely moving from one side of the cage to the other. Yet frequently they did not bother to do so! Seligman called this behavior learned helplessness.

In people, learned helplessness leads to characteristically ways of dealing with problems. They tend to attribute the source of a problem to themselves, to generalize the problem to many aspects of life, and to see the problem as lasting or permanent. More optimistic individuals, in contrast, are more likely to attribute a problem to outside sources, to see it as specific to a particular situation or activity, and to see it as temporary or time-limited. Consider, for example, two students who each fail a test. The one with a lot of learned helplessness is more likely to explain the failure by saying something like “I’m stupid; I never perform well on any schoolwork, and I never will perform well at it.” The other, more optimistic student is more likely to say something like “The teacher made the test too hard this time, so the test doesn’t prove anything about how I will do next time or in other subjects.”

What is noteworthy about these differences in perception is how much the more optimistic of these perspectives resembles high self-efficacy and how much learned helplessness seems to contradict or differ from it. As already noted, high self-efficacy is a strong belief in one’s capacity to carry out a specific task successfully. By definition therefore self-efficacy focuses attention on a temporary or time-limited activity (the task), even though the cause of successful completion (oneself) is “internal.” Teachers can minimize learned helplessness in students, therefore, by encouraging their self-efficacy beliefs. There are several ways of doing this, as we explain next. 

===Sources of Self-Efficacy Beliefs===
Psychologists who study self-efficacy have identified four major sources of self-efficacy beliefs (Pajares &amp; Schunk, 2001, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Pajares, F. &amp; Schunk, D. (2001). Self-beliefs and school success: Self-efficacy, self-concept, and school achievement. In . Riding &amp; S. Rayner (Eds.), ''Perception'', pp. 239-266. London: Ablex Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;. In order of importance they are
# prior experiences of mastering tasks,
# watching others’ mastering tasks,
# messages or “persuasion” from others, and
# emotions related to stress and discomfort.
Fortunately the first three can be influenced by teachers directly, and even the fourth can sometimes be influenced indirectly by appropriate interpretive comments from the teacher or others.

====Prior Experiences of Mastery====
Not surprisingly, past successes at a task increase students’ beliefs that they will succeed again in the future. The implication of this basic fact means that teachers need to help students build a history of successes. Whether they are math problems, reading assignments, or athletic activities, tasks have to end with success more often than with failure. Note, though, that the successes have to represent mastery that is genuine or competence that is truly authentic. Success at tasks that are trivial or irrelevant do not improve self-efficacy beliefs, nor does praise for successes that a student has not really had (Erikson, 1968/1994)&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E. (1968/1994). ''Identity, youth, and crisis.&quot;&quot; New York: Norton.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a practical matter, creating a genuine history of success is most convincing if teachers also work to broaden a student’s vision of “the past.” Younger students (elementary-age) in particular have relatively short or limited ideas of what counts as “past experience”; they may go back only a few occasions when forming impressions of whether they can succeed again in the future (Eccles, et al., 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Eccles, J., Wigfield, A., &amp; Schiefele, U. (1998). Motivation to succeed. In W. Damon &amp; N. Eisenberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of child psychology, Volume 3: Social, emotional, and personality development, 5th edition'' (pp. 1017-1095). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. Older students (secondary school) gradually develop longer views of their personal “pasts,” both because of improvements in memory and because of accumulating a personal history that is truly longer. The challenge for working with any age, however, is to insure that students base self-efficacy beliefs on all relevant experiences from their pasts, not just on selected or recent experiences.

====Watching Others’ Experiences of Mastery====
A second source of efficacy beliefs comes from vicarious experience of mastery, or observing others’ successes (Schunk &amp; Zimmerman, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, D. &amp; Zimmerman, B. (1997). Social origins of self-regulatory competence. ''Educational psychologist, 34''(4), 195-208&lt;/ref&gt;. Simply seeing someone else succeed at a task, in other words, can contribute to believing that you, too, can succeed. The effect is stronger when the observer lacks experience with the task and therefore may be unsure of his or her own ability. It is also stronger when the model is someone respected by the observer, such as a student’s teacher, or a peer with generally comparable ability. Even under these conditions, though, vicarious experience is not as influential as direct experience. The reasons are not hard to imagine. Suppose, for example, you witness both your teacher and a respected friend succeed at singing a favorite tune, but you are unsure whether you personally can sing. In that case you may feel encouraged about your own potential, but are likely still to feel somewhat uncertain of your own efficacy. If on the other hand you do not witness others’ singing, but you have a history of singing well yourself, it is a different story. In that case you are likely to believe in your efficacy, regardless of  how others perform.

All of which suggests that to a modest extent, teachers may be able to enhance students’ self-efficacy by modeling success at a task or by pointing out classmates who are successful. These strategies can work because they not only show how to do a task, but also communicate a more fundamental message, the fact that the task can in fact be done. If students are learning a difficult arithmetic procedure, for example, you can help by demonstrating the procedure, or by pointing out classmates who are doing it, or by pointing out classmates who are doing it. Note, though, that vicarious mastery is helpful only if backed up with real successes performed by the students themselves. It is also helpful only if the “model classmates” are perceived as truly comparable in ability. Overuse of vicarious models, especially in the absence of real success by learners, can cause learners to disqualify a model’s success; students may simply decide that the model is “out of their league” in skills and is therefore irrelevant to judging their own potential.

====Social Messages and Persuasion====
A third source of efficacy beliefs are encouragements, both implied and stated, that persuade a person of his or her capacity to do a task. Persuasion does not create high efficacy by itself, but it often increases or supports it when coupled with either direct or vicarious experience, especially when the persuasion comes from more than one person (Goddard, Hoy, &amp; Hoy, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, R., Hoy, W., &amp; Hoy, A. (2004). Collective efficacy beliefs: Theoretical developments, empirical evidence, and future directions. ''Educational Researcher, 33''(3), 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;.

For teachers, this suggests two things. The first, of course, is that encouragement can motivate students, especially when it is focused on achievable, specific tasks. It can be motivating to say things like “I think you can do it” or “I’ve seen you do this before, so I know that you can do it again.” But the second implication is that teachers should arrange wherever possible to support their encouragement by designing tasks at hand that are in fact achievable by the student. Striking a balance of encouragement and task difficulty may seem straightforward, but sometimes it can be challenging because students can sometimes perceive teachers’ comments and tasks quite differently from how teachers intend. Giving excessive amounts of detailed help, for example, may be intended as support for a student, but be taken as a lack of confidence in the student’s ability to do the task independently.

====Emotions Related to Success, Stress or Discomfort====
The previous three sources of efficacy beliefs are all rather cognitive or “thinking oriented,” but emotions also influence expectations of success or failure. Feeling nervous or anxious just before speaking to a large group (sometimes even just a class full of students!) can function like a message that says “I’m not going to succeed at doing this,” even if there is in fact good reason to expect success. But positive feelings can also raise beliefs about efficacy. When recalling the excitement of succeeding at a previous, unrelated task, people may overestimate their chances of success at a new task with which they have no previous experience, and are therefore in no position to predict their efficacy.

For teachers, the most important implication is that students’ motivation can be affected when they generalize from past experience which they believe, rightly or wrongly, to be relevant. By simply announcing a test, for example, a teacher can make some students anxious even before the students find out anything about the test—whether it is easy or difficult, or even comparable in any way to other experiences called “tests” in their pasts. Conversely, it can be misleading to encourage students on the basis of their success at past academic tasks if the earlier tasks were not really relevant to requirements of the new tasks at hand. Suppose, for example, that a middle-years student has previously written only brief opinion-based papers, and never written a research-based paper. In that case boosting the student’s confidence by telling him that “it is just like the papers you wrote before” may not be helpful or even honest.

====A Caution: Motivation as Content versus Motivation as Process====
A caution about self-efficacy theory is its heavy emphasis on just the process of motivation, at the expense of the content of motivation. The basic self-efficacy model has much to say about how beliefs affect behavior, but relatively little to say about which beliefs and tasks are especially satisfying or lead to the greatest well-being in students. The answer to this question is important to know, since teachers might then select tasks as much as possible that are intrinsically satisfying, and not merely achievable.
Another way of posing this concern is by asking, “Is it possible to feel high self-efficacy about a task that you do not enjoy?” It does seem quite possible for such a gap to exist. As a youth, for example, one of us contributors [[User talk: Klseifert|(KelvinLeeSeifert)]] had considerable success with solving mathematics problems in high school algebra, and expended considerable effort doing algebra assignments as homework. Before long, he had developed high self-efficacy with regard to solving such problems. But Kelvin never really enjoyed solving the algebra problems, and later even turned away permanently from math or science as a career (much to the disappointment of his teachers and family). In this case self-efficacy theory nicely explained the process of his motivation—Kelvin’s belief in his capacity led to persistence at the tasks. But it did not explain the content of his motivation—his growing dislike of the tasks. Accounting for such a gap requires a different theory of motivation, one that includes not only specific beliefs, but “deeper” personal needs as well. An example of this approach is self-determination theory, where we turn next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Data Coding Theory/Page}}

== Channels ==

A channel is a communications medium, through which data can flow through. In a wireless network, the channel is the open space between the sender and the receiver through with the electromagnetic waves travel. In a wired network, the channel is the wire through with the electrical signals flow.

== Signal to Noise Ratio ==

Data flowing through a channel is subjected to outside noise interference. In a wireless system, this interference can be a competing transmittor, or even natural phenomena such as lightning or solar radiation. These same kinds of interference can affect wired transmissions as well.

The ratio, in dB (decibels) of the transmitted information power to the noise power in the received signal is known as the '''signal to noise ratio'''. The signal to noise ratio, abbreviated &quot;SNR&quot;, is an important metric to learn when studying a transmission network, because it affects how much data can be sent and at what speed. If we have a signal with energy ''E'', and a noise density of ''N'', we calculate the SNR as:

:&lt;math&gt;SNR = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{E}{N}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, if we have a signal with an amplitude of ''A'', and a noise with variance &amp;sigma;, we calculate the SNR as:

:&lt;math&gt;SNR = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{A^2}{\sigma^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The higher the SNR, the more faithful the received signal will be to the sent signal. The lower the SNR, the more likely the received signal is going to contain errors. We won't cover SNR in too much detail in this book. However, the SNR is a very important quantity in a communications system, and there are classes of codes that are designed to help reduce errors in a channel with a low SNR.

== Bandwidth ==

Bandwidth is a measurement of a communication's channel, and determines what frequency ranges are transmitted faithfully through the channel, and which ranges are not. We don't need to discuss bandwidth in any detail in this book, but suffice it to say that it is an important quality of a communications channel.

== Shannon's Channel Capacity ==

The '''Shannon Channel Capacity''' is a formula that relates the bandwidth of a channel, the channel's SNR, and the bit rate. 

{{Eqn|Shannon's Channel Capacity}}
:&lt;math&gt;C = W  \log_2 (1 + SNR)&lt;/math&gt;

The channel capacity is the bit rate at which data can be sent along a channel with a negligible error rate. Attempting to send bits faster then this rate will increase the error rate beyond a negligible value. This will have large negative effects on our communications system. Notice that for a fixed bandwidth, as SNR decreases, the bitrate must also decrease.

== Ramifications of Channel Capacity ==

Because of Shannon's Channel Capacity, we can see a few important facts. The first of which is, the more noise a channel has, the slower our bitrate needs to be. This means that if we want to send data at or above the channel capacity, we will need to have a robust error checking and correcting mechanism.

What we can also see is that for a fixed SNR, more bandwidth means a faster data rate. 

In short, to send more information over a channel more quickly, we need to:
*Increase the SNR
*Increase the bandwidth
*Use better coding and error correcting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Data Coding Theory/Page}}

== Modulo ==

The modulo operation, commonly expressed as a &quot;%&quot; operator, is a useful operation in data coding. What a modulo is, is the remainder of a division operation between two numbers. For instance, if we divide 10 by 3 and we don't calculate decimal points, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{3} = 3&lt;/math&gt;

And the remainder would be:

:&lt;math&gt; 10 % 3 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

In division, we typically have the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;s = n \times d + r&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''s'' is our dividend, ''d'' is our divisor, ''n'' is our quotient, and ''r'' is the remainder. From this equation, we have two operations:

:&lt;math&gt;s \div d = n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s % d = r&lt;/math&gt;

Notice from these equations that ''r'' must always be smaller than ''d''.

== Modulo-2 Arithmetic ==

Modulo-2 arithmetic is an arithmetic system where every result is taken modulo-2. Here are some examples:

:&lt;math&gt;(10 + 5)_{%2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(2 \times 8)_{%2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In short, the result of the operation is 1 if the result is odd, and 0 if the result is even. Since we are dealing with individual bits in our data coding, most of our operands will be a 1 or a 0. So long as our operands are 1 or 0, and our results are modulo 2, all the number we write should be 1 or 0.

A common application of modulo-2 arithmetic is in digital circuitry, where logic operations are all performed modulo-2.

== Modulo-2 operators ==

In our modulo-2 arithmetic system, we define new operators. These operators are frequently very similar to boolean logical operators, so we will discuss those here too.

;Add:To add two numbers, we take the modulo-2 of the result. Here is a truth table for an add operation:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!+ !!0!!1
|-
!0
|0
|1
|-
!1
|1
|0
|}
:If you are familiar with boolean logic, you will see that addition is identical to the ''xor'' operation. Because of this, we will use the terms &quot;add&quot; and &quot;xor&quot; interchangably, and we will denote the modulo-2 addition operation with a &quot;circle-plus&quot;:
::&lt;math&gt;1 \oplus 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

;Multiply:Multiplication in modulo 2 happens normally, and no new operator needs to be defined. Here is the truth table for a multiplication operation:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!&amp;times;!!0!!1
|-
!0
|0
|0
|-
!1
|0
|1
|}
:This is exactly the same as the boolean &quot;and&quot; operation. We will use the words &quot;multiplication&quot; and &quot;and&quot; interchangably.

Subtraction and division operations are rare in data coding, so we won't discuss them here.</text>

      <comment>/* Our Simple Teardrop */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Side Walls ==
[[Image:Teardrop bed4.jpg|thumb|Bed bolted to trailer frame.]]
At this point in your build, you should have an assembled trailer frame (less lights, fenders, and fender braces), with a nice wooden bed bolted in position.  The bottom of the bed is protected with roofing tar.

[[Image:Teardrop polyglue strength.jpg|thumb|right|Author's strength test of polyurethane glue.]]
Polyurethane glue is going to be an important part of the trailer construction.  It fills gaps, is not brittle (like yellow wood glue) and is extremely binding and strong.  So strong that the force applied to a piece of 2x2 pine wood which was polyurethane glued to cabinet grade .75&quot; plywood for only 30 minutes actually took the first ply off the wood, but not before splitting the plywood down the middle.  

The difference between this teardrop trailer body and just a simple box is that the body walls, roof and bed will be bonded together with this polyurethane glue, in essence creating a monocoque.  In addition, the teardrop shape of the roof line increases the strength over a square box because forces are transferred ''around'' the curves down to the base.

== Profiles ==
[[Image:Teardrop sides1.jpg|thumb|right|Cutting out the sidewalls.]]
You need to spend some time and pick out a profile for your teardrop trailer.  There are many variations of profiles and some have names like &quot;benroy&quot;, &quot;modern&quot; but there are really only two ''classes'' of sidewalls - those which come down perpendicular to the bed and those which curve out beyond the front of the bed then curve back to it. And these are used in combination also.  The modern profile has both front and back curving out and back like an airplane wing.  The benroy front and rear meet perpendicular to the bed.  Others use the out and back curve on the front and meet the bed perpendicular at the rear.  Yet others do the opposite.

You really should take the time to explore what you like and design your own variation.  The profile of the teardrop trailer is the most distinctive and artistic part.  It defines the trailer and can either make onlookers say &quot;Wow!&quot; or &quot;Ugh!&quot;.

One other thing, the cabinet grade plywood has a good side and a bad side.  Its up to you but you should really put the good side out unless you are going to skin the trailer or paint it.  This book doesn't cover skinning or painting.  Our &quot;simple&quot; trailer is a &quot;woodie&quot; that will be covered with marine grade urethane varnish.

Also when you are drawing your profile on the wood you should draw it on the &quot;inside&quot;, because a sabor-saw cuts on the upstroke and the exit side of the cutting blade is the side that has the rough edges.  You want the &quot;outside&quot; to have the cleanest cut edges.

== Door Shape ==
[[Image:Teardrop doorshape.jpg|thumb|right|Door Shapes]]
You also need to decide on a door shape. Again there are many variations. Some are completely square.  Some have a straight edge on hinge side and a straight edge across the bottom, and have a long side arch opposite the hinge side. Some have a simple arched top or rounded corners. Other variations exist and are possible.

You need to put some thought into the door shape, the hinge and how you are going to place a door seal.  The door shape will have an impact on the type of hinge you use and whether you can seal from the outside or not.  

=== Hinge styles ===
* There are three styles of hinges commonly used for teardrop trailers.
** Regular house style hinges
** A piano hinge.
** Gate hinges

A regular house style hinge requires that a door jam be constructed deep enough to accommodate it. On the plus side there is nothing custom or experimental about it. You create the door and jam just like on a house.

Piano hinges are common on teardrop trailers.  One issue with a piano hinge is that you need to buy one that has a galvanized pin.  The kind found at the hardware stores usually have a plain steel pin which will rust.  There are also nylon piano hinges that have no pin at all. The nylon is narrowed in the center to form the bending point.

Gate hinges are another option and can easily be attached without the need for an accommodating jam. These hinges simply bolt on.  They also have an advantage over the previous two in that the pivot of the hinge can easily be offset or mounted away from the edge of the door.  However, one issue with gate hinges is that you need to find ones with nylon bushings.  Ones without nylon bushings are too sloppy to hold the door in a precise position for closing.

=== Door design considerations ===
* If you have a square door you have the option of constructing it just like the door of your house, with a home style door jam, seals and door knob.  The downside is that its square and not very stylish, however, some clever builders will attach a perimeter moulding around the outside of the door and arch the moulding to beautify the profile.

* One popular door style is the side arch style. It is mounted with a piano hinge on the straight side from top to bottom.  Then a seal is placed in the pinch area behind the hinge and a perimeter moulding is attached either around the rest of the outside of the door perimeter or around the complete inside door opening parameter as a seal seat.

* The other styles of doors can increase complexity quite a bit.  Basically any door style that does not have a straight edge all the way from the top of the door to bottom of the door on the hinge side is problematic.  The reason is that the seal surface behind the hinge mechanically creates a &quot;pitch&quot; motion where as the surface around the rest of the perimeter simply contacts the surface.  So for example if you have rounded corners then you have a situation where the motion of the closing door actually traverses the surface sideways on the seal and will tend to push the seal out of position.

=== Rain ===
It is also helpful to understand how rain will behave on the trailer.  Rain will hit the body of the trailer first and travel along the body surface.  Driving down the road at 70 mph sets up hurricane force wind conditions.  No seals are designed to operate under those conditions.  If you look at door and trunk seals on a car you will see that the solution involves designing a channel for the main stream of water to flow around the door harmlessly and use the seal only to stop any extraneous water streams.

So the rules are to design so that openings are flush with the sides and to keep seals out of the main stream of water flow as much as possible. This means if you have an exterior perimeter moulding on the door you may need to have a perimeter &quot;guard&quot; on the body adjacent to the door.  Some builders will just put a deflector over the top of the door and down the front.



[[Image:Info icon.svg|30px|left]]Its also important to put things into perspective.  How much time and effort are you going to put into trying to make the doors absolutely watertight?  Its your decision depending on how much effort and money you are putting into the rest of the trailer.  However it may be reasonable to consider the home-made teardrop trailer for what it is - one step up from tent camping and thus you really should treat it like a tent.  Meaning that after a camping trip, just like a tent, you better clean it out, open it up, and make sure its clean and dry before you pack it away.  And if you need to use a towel to catch a few drops while on vacation - don't sweat it.

== Our Simple Teardrop ==
[[Image:Teardrop side2.jpg|thumb|right|Cut sidewall]]
For our simple teardrop the profile attaches perpendicular to the bed. We are also using .75 inch cabinet grade plywood for our sidewalls.  Lay the plywood down on the saw horses and draw out your profile and door opening. 


You can make compasses by simply cutting a long strip of wood, drilling a hole in one end snug enough to hold a pencil firmly and putting a drywall screw through the other end at the right radius.

The author's teardrop used a 20 inch radius for the front and a 38 inch radius for the rear.  The radius for the door corners is 6 inches.

[[Image:Important-3.svg|10px|left]] Do not use a radius smaller than 20 inches.  In fact, for the front you should choose a larger radius (25 or even 30 inches).  The reason is that the top will be covered with 5.2mm luan (birch plywood) and the 20 inch radius required that the screws be started and rotationally and incrementally tightened in order to avoid breaking the plywood. A larger radius will help you avoid this headache.

Once you have your doors and profile drawn, you can start cutting.  Use a decent saber saw with a new blade stand comfortably, wear your safety glasses and take your time.  The wood cut out for the door opening is used for the door, so you don't want to drill a hole to start the cut.  The saber saw cut can be started by angling the saw up, turning the saw on, and very slowly and carefully lower it onto the cutting line you have drawn. Practice on a scrap piece to get a feel for it.  After cutting, sand the edges of the plywood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Tcl was created in 1988 by John Ousterhout and is distributed under a BSD style license (which allows you everything GPL does, plus commercial use). The current stable version, in September 2006, is 8.4.14, while the alpha of its successor is 8.5a5.&quot; -- the GPL lets you use it for commercial purposes but must stay under the GPL [[User:172.135.73.10|172.135.73.10]] 01:23, 25 August 2007 (UTC)

This has since been rewritten to be more precise. [[User:Suchenwi|Suchenwi]] ([[User talk:Suchenwi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Suchenwi|contribs]]) 09:03, 25 November 2012 (UTC)

==wikimedia have a source highlighting extention==
shall use it?! --[[User:Hoxel|Hoxel]] 14:47, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

I think this coloring scheme is, like many others, butt ugly; and it seems to suggest semantic differences between words that mostly are not really there. Unlike other languages with reserved words and restrained syntax, Tcl is very relaxed here, e.g. in the command
 set set set
the first word is the command name, the second a variable name, the third a string constant (well, all three are string constants after all). A syntax colorizer might know that due to hard-learned knowledge, but it'll then fail on user-defined commands, for which of course the same liberty holds.

When I do coloring in Tcl editors, I refrain myself to painting the top line of proc's blue, and comments in red... but mostly I'm happy enough with just black on white all the way. And this is a Wiki*book*, isn't it? [[User:Suchenwi|Suchenwi]] 21:23, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

==Error in section &quot;Quick summary&quot;==
In the mentioned section of this page, it says:
&quot;In quoted words, substitutions can occur before the command is called: $[A-Za-z0-9_]+ substitutes the value of the given variable.&quot;
If I understand this sentence right, it says that variable names must be composed of alphanumerical characters or underscore. This is wrong: Tcl does not know such limitations! A variable name can contain  '''any''' character:
 % set :-) foobar
 foobar 
 % puts ${:-)}
 foobar
 %

Thanks for pointing that out - I have clarified it with another example. [[User:Suchenwi|Suchenwi]] ([[User talk:Suchenwi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Suchenwi|contribs]]) 09:03, 25 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Basic Algebra''' project! 

Each lesson has 5 sections:
*'''Vocabulary''' - simple explanations of new terms. 
*'''Lesson''' - What does this new skill let us do?
*'''Example Problems''' - three example problems worked out in detail.
*'''Practice Games''' - links to outside games on the internet that reinforce skills needed for this new skill
*'''Practice Problems''' - in three sections (easy, medium, hard). Please list the question, then give the answer in parentheses. Example 2x=6: (x=3)

Remember: All textbooks have many, many problems in common. Don't worry if the problem you add is in a copyrighted textbook. No one owns 2x = 16, for example. Be sure that you do not copy lists of problems.  Make sure all word problems you give are completely original as far as subject matter is concerned. Please be sure the subject of your word problem is a BE850 word.

We assume that these students are ready for algebra. We do include a review of basic mathematics ideas in order to direct the students towards integrating their prior math knowledge, especially math vocabulary. This is a standard practice in algebra textbooks.

Also, please log in when you contribute so we can contact each other. Thanks!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lesson 1. Simple Operations==
An ''operation&quot; is a thing you do to numbers. You use signs like: +, –, × , or ÷ for operations.
The Equals Sign is not an operation.

;Adding
:Adding is a way to put two numbers together.
*1 + 2 = 3

;Subtracting
:Subtracting is a way of taking a number out from another number.
*2 – 1 = 1

;Multiply
:Multiplying is a way of adding a number many times
*3 × 2 = 6

;Dividing
:Dividing is a way of subtracting a number many times. 
*6 ÷ 2 = 3

;Example Problems:

#2 + 1 = (3)
# 8 + 2 = (10)
# 8 – 4 = (4)
# 5 – 2 = (3)
# 6 × 2 = (12)
# 2 × 3 = (6)
# 12 ÷ 6 = (2)
# 4 ÷ 2 = (2)

[[../Simple_Operations|Back to lesson]]

==Lesson 2. Exponents and Powers==
Exponent is the number on the top that shows.

Base is the number to be multiplied by itself.

'''Example Problems''' 

#6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (36)
# 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (8)
# 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16)
# 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (125)
# 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (16)

[[../Exponents_and_Powers|Back to lesson]]

==Lesson 3. Order of Operations== 
Math problems are done in this order from top to bottom:

*Parenthesis ( ) 
*Exponent ^ 
*Multiply *, Divide / (Left to Right) 
*Add +, Subtract – (Left to Right) 

'''Example Problem''' 
{|
|2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (3 * 4)          ||Original problem.
|-
|2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (12)             ||Do parenthesis first.
|-
|2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12               ||Do exponent. 
|-
|4 + 12                           ||Add. 
|-
|16                               ||Answer 
|}

[[../Order_of_Operations|Back to lesson]]

==Lesson 4. Working With Negative Numbers==

A positive number is a number more than zero.

A negative number is a number less than zero.

'''Example Problems'''

# 6 + (–3) = (3)
# 3 + (–9) = (–6)
# –4 * 4 = (16)
# 4 * (–9) = (77)
# –2 * (–4) = 8

[[../Working_With_Negative_Numbers|Back to lesson]]

==Lesson 5. Solving Equations Using Properties of Mathematics==
It is very important to show math in the simplest way. For example, 5/10 is the same as 1/2, but 1/2 is better because it is easier to understand. The simplest answer is usually the best.

'''Example Problems''' -- find x when y=9

# x = 8( y / 3 )(x=24)
# ( x – 4 ) = 8 + y (x=21)
# ( 14 + x ) / y = 3 (x=13)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== generalised equals ==
= is a sequence comparison which is true if the intersection is not empty. Thus:

 (1, 2, 3) = (3, 4, 5)

and
  3 = (3, 4, 5)

but there are some oddities.  For example
  () = ()
is false, as is 
  () != ()

The operator eq is used to compare values only.

== Arithmetic operators ==
The minus sign needs space around it since $x-3 is a valid variable name which is not the same as $x - 3.

== Matching brackets etc ==
Check carefully for matching single and double quotes, round and square brackets and curly braces. The java client will show the matching bracket, but errors are often poorly diagnosed by  XQuery compilers.


== Binding ==
 := is the binding operator.

The abbreviated form in which multiple binding statements can be separated by a comma:

  let $x := 3
  let $y := 4
  let $x := &quot;fred&quot;
           
Abbreviates to 

  let $x := 3,
      $y := 4,
      $x := &quot;fred&quot;

          
is convenient but can lead to errors when code is amended.  Consider avoiding this syntax.

== Conditional expression ==
The conditional expression must have the else part. Return the empty sequence () if one alternative is not required:                   

 if ($x = 4) 
 then &quot;Four&quot;
 else ()

== Sorting ==

'Order by'  sorts numbers as text
   order by $c/population

To get it sorted as a number, you have to use the number() function

   order by number($C/population)

or cast to a number type 

   order by xs:integer($c/population)   

or 
   order by $c/population cast as xs:integer

== XML construction ==

You can build XML by simply starting a tag.  These tags are really XQuery expression operators.  However, this puts you in a lexical scope where everything is XML and curly braces then switch back to normal XQuery (and an open tag will then switch back to XML).  Escape curly braces with double braces ({{ }}).

Note the toggling between XQuery and XML construction modes: 

  let $a:= &quot;bob&quot;
  let $b:= &quot;jane&quot;
  let $ab := ($a, $b)
  return 
    &lt;people&gt;
    { for $person in $ab
      return &lt;person&gt; {$person} &lt;/person&gt;
    }
    &lt;/people&gt;

== Comments ==

Comments in XQuery use (: ... :) whereas comments in XML use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- ... --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It is easy to use the wrong kind in the wrong context, particularly XQuery comments in constructed XML.

 &lt;A&gt; (: a comment :) &lt;/A&gt;
makes the comment the text part of an XML element.

== let ==

''let'' statements are part of a FLWOR expression and can't appear alone.  XQuery is a functional language and let statements are only temporary bindings of names to expressions.

 let $x := 5
 return $x

== function result ==

''return'' is not required in functions.  It is part of a FLWOR statement and not a statement in itself (like ''let'').  So it is not required and not allowed if there is no ''for'' or ''let''.

  declare function local:sum($a, $b) {
    $a + $b
  }

or

 declare function local:sum($a, $b) {
    let $c := $a + $b
    return $c
  }
  
but not 
  declare function local:sum($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b
  }

== Rounding with double and floats ==
You might be surprised at that the result of the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
number(3.1) + number(3.2)
&lt;/source&gt;
is
6.30000000000001
This is because number() casts the values to double and the double precision numbers round values using an algorithm that is statistically close when using many numbers but fails in specific test cases like this.  This is not technically an error and other systems (Scala, ruby, python etc.) will also generate the same errors.  The way around this is to not use the number() function, but cast to an xs:decimal().

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xs:decimal(3.1) + xs:decimal(3.2)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A planche is a skill learned in Gymnastics where the goal is to hold the body in a position that is parallel to the ground while keeping the arms straight. When performed correctly, the body should appear to be floating. The skill requires an extreme amount of strength and a minimal amount of balance. Bending the arms, back, or the legs is incorrect form.

In order to progress to a full planche (Where the body is completely straight with the legs kept together) there are easier forms of planche to practice.

In order to gain the amount of balance you will need a frog stand is recommended.

After the minimal balance is learned, a tuck planche can be practiced. In this position the performer keeps their legs as close to their chest as possible (bending the back) while only touching the ground with their hands. Arms must be kept straight. Bending the arms will not train the correct muscles for a full planche.

After becoming comfortable in a tuck planche, the advanced tuck planche is the next step. This is the same position but the back is kept straight to increase the difficulty. (Legs are forced away from the body by becoming straight.)

The next step is the straddle planche. The back should be straight and the legs are now straight as well but kept separated from each other. (As if in the splits position but off of the ground staying parallel to the floor.)

The last step is the full planche where the legs are brought together. The is the most difficult form.

There are multiple ways of touching the floor with the hands. For people with flexible wrists, keeping the palms touching the ground while leaning forward would be easiest. For those who have less flexible wrists, going up unto the finger tips is easier because the back of the hand faces up instead of backwards. The last position is to have the hands placed backwards with the palms flat which can make balancing more difficult.

After mastering any of the positions, push up motions can be added for intense motion workouts.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Iran|Iranian Cuisine]]

(Iran - Sharbat bil Loz)

== Ingredients ==  
* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanched]] [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
* 4 cups water
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]- optional, it is healthier without sugar
* 1/4 cup orange blossom water (or [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]])

== Procedure ==
# Grind the almonds finely in blender.
# Add the water and continue to grind.
# Strain the liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth.
# When drained, squeeze the remaining pulp to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp.
# Pour into a heavy saucepan, then stir in the sugar (optional). 
# Boil, stirring constantly, then lower the heat and simmer very gently for 5-10 minutes. 
# Turn off the heat, add the orange flower water, and let the syrup cool. 

To serve, pour 1/4 cup of syrup into a glass, add ice water and stir well.

== Notes == 
Instead of throwing away the almond pulp, you can mix it into almond [[Cookbook:Agar Jelly|agar jelly]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation as Self-Determination==
Common sense suggests that human motivations originate from some sort of innate “need.” We all think of ourselves has having various “needs”—a need for food, for example, or a need for companionship—that influence our choices and activities. This same idea also forms part of some theoretical accounts of motivation, though the theories differ in the needs that they emphasize or recognize. In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development|Chapter 3]], for example, we talked about Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as an example of motivations that function like needs that influence long-term personal development. According to Maslow, individuals must satisfy physical survival needs before they seek to satisfy needs belonging, they satisfy belonging needs before esteem needs, and so on. In theory, too, people have both deficit needs and growth needs, and the deficit needs must be satisfied before growth needs can influence behavior (Maslow, 1970)&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1970). ''Motivation and Personality, 2nd edition.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Maslow’s theory, as in others that use the concept, a need is a relatively lasting condition or feeling that requires relief or satisfaction and that tends to influence action over the long term. Some needs may decrease when satisfied (like hunger), but others may not (like curiosity). Either way, needs differ from the self-efficacy beliefs discussed earlier, which are relatively specific and cognitive, and affect particular tasks and behaviors fairly directly.

A recent theory of motivation based on the idea of needs is self-determination theory, proposed by the psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E. &amp; Ryan, R. (2003). The paradox of achievement: The harder you push, the worse it gets. In E. Aronson (Ed.), ''Improving academic achievement: Impact of psychological factors in education'' (pp. 62-90). Boston: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, among others. The theory proposes that understanding motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:

* autonomy—the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior

* competence—the need to feel capable or skilled, and 

* relatedness—the need to feel connected or involved with others.

Note that these needs are all psychological, not physical; hunger and sex, for example, are not on the list. They are also about personal growth or development, not about deficits that a person tries to reduce or eliminate. Unlike food (in behaviorism) or safety (in Maslow’s hierarchy), you can never get enough of autonomy, competence, or relatedness. You (and your students) will seek to enhance these continually throughout life.

The key idea of self-determination theory is that when persons (such as you or one of your students) feels that these basic needs are reasonably well met, they tend to perceive their actions and choices to be intrinsically motivated or “self-determined.” In that case they can turn their attention to a variety of activities that they find attractive or important, but that do not relate directly to their basic needs. Among your students, for example, some individuals might read books that you have suggested, and others might listen attentively when you explain key concepts from the unit that you happen to be teaching. If one or more basic needs are not met well, however, people will tend to feel coerced by outside pressures or external incentives. They may become preoccupied, in fact, with satisfying whatever need has not been met and thus exclude or avoid activities that might otherwise be interesting, educational, or important. If the persons are students, their learning will suffer.

===Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation===
In proposing the importance of needs, then, self-determination theory is asserting the importance of intrinsic motivation, an idea that has come up before in this book (see especially Chapter 2, about learning theory), and that will come again later (see especially Chapter 7, about instructional planning). The self-determination version of intrinsic motivation, however, emphasizes a person’s perception of freedom, rather than on the presence or absence of “real” constraints on action. Self-determination means a person feels free, even if the person is also operating within certain external constraints. In principle, a student can experience self-determination even if the student must, for example, live within externally imposed rules of appropriate classroom behavior. To achieve a feeling of self-determination, however, the student’s basic needs must be met—needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In motivating students, then, the bottom line is that teachers have an interest in helping students to meet their basic needs, and in not letting school rules or the teachers’ own leadership styles interfere with or block satisfaction of students’ basic needs.

“Pure” self-determination may be the ideal for most teachers and students, of course, but the reality is usually different. For a variety of reasons, teachers in most classrooms cannot be expected to meet all students’ basic needs at all times. One reason is the sheer number of students, which makes it impossible to attend to every student perfectly at all times. Another reason is teachers’ responsibility for a curriculum, which can require creating expectations for students’ activities that sometimes conflict with students’ autonomy or makes them feel (temporarily) less than fully competent. Still another reason is students’ personal histories, ranging from divorce to poverty, which may create needs in some individuals which are beyond the power of teachers to remedy.

The result from students’ point of view is usually only a partial perception of self-determination, and therefore a simultaneous mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Self-determination theory recognizes this reality by suggesting that the “intrinsic-ness” of motivation is really a matter of degree, extending from highly extrinsic, through various mixtures of intrinsic and extrinsic, to highly intrinsic (Koestner &amp; Losier, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Koestner, R. &amp; Losier, G. (2004). Distinguishing three ways of  being highly motivated: a closer look at introjection, identification, and intrinsic motivation. In E. Deci &amp; R. Ryan (Eds.), ''Handbook of self-determination research'' (pp. 101-122). Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. At the extrinsic end of the scale is learning that is regulated primarily by external rewards and constraints, whereas at the intrinsic end is learning regulated primarily by learners themselves. [[Table 6-3]] summarizes and gives examples of the various levels and their effects on motivation. By assuming that motivation is often a mix of the intrinsic and extrinsic, the job of the teacher becomes more realistic; the job is not to expect purely intrinsic motivation from students all the time, but simply to arrange and encourage motivations that are as intrinsic as possible. To do this, the teacher needs to support students’ basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

===Using Self-Determination Theory in the Classroom===
What are some teaching strategies for supporting students’ needs? Educational researchers have studied this question from a variety of directions, and their resulting recommendations converge and overlap in a number of ways. For convenience, the recommendations can be grouped according to the basic need that they address, beginning with the need for autonomy.

====Supporting Autonomy in Learners====
A major part of supporting autonomy is to give students choices wherever possible (Ryan &amp; Lynch, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, R. &amp; Lynch, M. (2003). Philosophies of motivation and classroom management. In R. Curren (Ed.), ''Blackwell companion to philosophy: A companion to the philosophy of education'' (pp. 260-271). New York, NY: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;. The choices that encourage the greatest feelings of self-control, obviously, are ones that are about relatively major issues or that have relatively significant consequences for students, such as whom to choose as partners for a major group project. But choices also encourage some feeling of self-control even when they are about relatively minor issues, such as how to organize your desk or what kind of folder to use for storing your papers at school. It is important, furthermore, to offer choices to all students, including students needing explicit directions in order to work successfully; avoid reserving choices for only the best students or giving up offering choices altogether to students who fall behind or who need extra help. All students will feel more self-determined and therefore more motivated if they have choices of some sort.

Teachers can also support students’ autonomy more directly by minimizing external rewards (like grades) and comparisons among students’ performance, and by orienting and responding themselves to students’ expressed goals and interests. In teaching elementary students about climate change, for example, you can support autonomy by exploring which aspects of this topic have already come to students’ attention and aroused their concern. The point of the discussion would not be to find out “who knows the most” about this topic, but to build and enhance students’ intrinsic motivations as much as possible. In reality, of course, it may not be possible to succeed at this goal fully—some students may simply have no interest in the topic, for example, or you may be constrained by time or resources from individualizing certain activities fully. But any degree of attention to students’ individuality, as well as any degree of choice, will support students’ autonomy.

====Supporting the Need for Competence====
The most obvious way to make students feel competent is by selecting activities which are challenging but nonetheless achievable with reasonable effort and assistance (Elliott, McGregor, &amp; Thrash, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, A., McGregor, H., &amp; Thrash, T. (2004). The need for competence. In E. Deci &amp; R. Ryan (Eds.), ''Handbook of self-determination research'' (pp. 361-388). Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although few teachers would disagree with this idea, there are times when it is hard to put into practice, such as when you first meet a class at the start of a school year and therefore are unfamiliar with their backgrounds and interests. But there are some strategies that are generally effective even if you are not yet in a position to know the students well. One is to emphasize activities that require active response from students. Sometimes this simply means selecting projects, experiments, discussions and the like that require students to do more than simply listen. Other times it means expecting active responses in all interactions with students, such as by asking questions that call for “divergent” (multiple or elaborated) answers. In a social studies class, for example, try asking “What are some ways we could find out more about our community?” instead of “Tell me the three best ways to find out about our community”. The first question invites more divergent, elaborate answers than the second.

Another generally effective way to support competence is to respond and give feedback as immediately as possible. Tests and term papers help subsequent learning more if returned, with comments, sooner rather than later. Discussions teach more if you include your own ideas in them, while still encouraging students’ input. Small group and independent activities are more effective if you provide a convenient way for students to consult authoritative sources for guidance when needed, whether the source is you personally, a teaching assistant, a specially selected reading, or even a computer program. In addition, you can sometimes devise tasks that create a feeling of competence because they have a “natural” solution or ending point. Assembling a jigsaw puzzle of the community, for example, has this quality, and so does creating a jigsaw puzzle of the community if the students need a greater challenge.

====Supporting the Need to Relate To Others====
The main way of support students’ need to relate to others is to arrange activities in which students work together in ways that are mutually supportive, that recognize students’ diversity, and minimize competition among individuals. We will have more to say about this strategy in Chapter 8 (“Instructional Strategies”), where we describe several varieties of cooperative learning, as well as some of their pitfalls to be avoided. For now, simply note that having students work together can happen in many ways. You can, for example, deliberately arrange projects that require a variety of talents; some educators call such activities “rich group work” (Cohen, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, E. (1994). ''Designing groupwork: Strategies for the heterogeneous classroom, 2nd edition.'' New York: Teachers’ College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In studying in small groups about medieval society, for example, one student can contribute his drawing skills, another can contribute his writing skills, and still another can contribute his dramatic skills. The result can be a multi-faceted presentation—written, visual, and oral. The groups needed for rich group work provide for students’ relationships with each other, whether they contain six individuals or only two.

And there are other ways to encourage relationships among students. In the jigsaw classroom (Aronson &amp; Patnoe, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E. &amp; Patnoe, S. (1997). ''The Jigsaw classroom: Building cooperation in the classroom, 2nd edition.'' New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;, for example, students work together in two phases. In the first phase, groups of “experts” work together to find information on a specialized topic. In a second phase the expert groups split up and reform into “generalist” groups containing one representative from each former expert group. In studying the animals of Africa, for example, each expert group might find information about a different particular category of animal or plant; one group might focus on mammal, another on bird, a third on reptiles, and so on. In the second phase of the jigsaw, the generalist groups would pool information from the experts to get a more well-rounded view of the topic. The generalist groups would each have an expert about mammals, for example, but also an expert about birds and about reptiles.

As a teacher, you can add to these organizational strategies by encouraging the development of your own relationships with class members. Your goal, as teacher, is to demonstrate caring and interest in your students not just as students, but as people. The goal also involves behaving as if good relationships between and among class members are not only possible, but ready to develop and perhaps even already developing. A simple tactic, for example, is to speak of “we” and “us” as much as possible, rather than speaking of “you students.” Another tactic is to present cooperative activities and assignments without apology, as if they are in the best interests not just of students of “us all” in the classroom, yourself included.

===Keeping Self-Determination in Perspective===
In certain ways self-determination theory provides a sensible way to think about students’ intrinsic motivation and therefore to think about how to get them to manage their own learning. A particular strength of the theory is that it recognizes degrees of self-determination, and bases many ideas on this reality. Most people recognize combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation guiding particular activities in their own lives. We might enjoy teaching, for example, but also do this job partly to receive a paycheck. To its credit, self-determination theory also relies on a list of basic human needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—that relate comfortably with some of the larger purposes of education.

Although these are positive features for understanding and influencing students’ classroom motivation, some educators and psychologists nonetheless have lingering questions about the limitations of self-determination theory. One is whether providing merely choices actually improves students’ learning, or simply improves their satisfaction with learning. There is evidence supporting both possibilities (Flowerday &amp; Schraw, 2003; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Flowerday, T., Shraw, G., &amp; Stevens, J. (2004). Role of choice and interest in reader engagement. ''Journal of Educational Research, 97,'' 93-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E. &amp; Ryan, R. (2003). The paradox of achievement: The harder you push, the worse it gets. In E. Aronson (Ed.), ''Improving academic achievement: Impact of psychological factors in education'' (pp. 62-90). Boston: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is likely that there are teachers whose classroom experience supports both possibilities as well. Another question is whether it is possible to overdo attention to students’ needs—and again there is evidence for both favoring and contradicting this possibility. Too many choices can actually make anyone (not just a student) frustrated and dissatisfied with a choice the person actually does make (Schwartz, 2004). Furthermore, differentiating activities to students’ competence levels may be impractical if students are functioning at extremely diverse levels within a single class, as sometimes happens. Differentiating may be inappropriate, too, if it slows holds a teacher back from covering key curriculum objectives which students need and which at least some students are able to learn. These are serious concerns, though in our opinion not serious enough to give up offering choices to students or to stop differentiating instruction altogether. In Chapter 7 (“Creating a Positive Learning Environment”) and Chapter 8 (“Instructional Strategies”), therefore, we explain the practical basis for this opinion, by describing workable ways for offering choices and recognizing students’ diversity.

I have recently finished to write a book on [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]] in Russian wikibook [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]]. I want to find somebody to translate it to English. Can you help me with this?
P.S. I am interesting to write some books on math and computer science. On math I am currently working on [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]] and on computer science on [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] and [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (all this is on currently on hold). In my English texts I have a lot of grammar mistakes, so I need somebody to correct one. I want that all that I am writing will be on English. It can be translating of written on another language text or original text. 

P.P.S. I have some material on math in Hebrew. Also hebrew wikibook has some material. It can be nice, while not mandatory, if you will know Hebrew too.

Я недавно закончил писать книгу в русском викиучебнике  [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]] . Я хотел бы найти кого-то ктобы перевёл бы его на английский [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]]. Не могли бы вы мне в этом помочь? 
P.S. Я хочу написать пару книг по математике и компьютерным наукам (программированию). По математике я начал работать над [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]], а по компьютерным наукам над  [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] и [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (пока я оставил это). Я пишу на английском со многими грамматическими ошибками, мне нужен кто-то, чтобы их исправлять. Я хочу, чтобы все мои книги были на английском. Это может быть как перевода с другого языка, так и оригинальный, изначально написанный на английском текст.
P.P.S. По математике, у меня часть материала на иврите, да и в ивритском викиучебнике можно взять. Было бы прекрасно, если бы вы владели также ивритом. Но вовсе не обязательно. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 16:02, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Sub-FO Logics=
==From Propositional Logic to FO==
===Propositional Logic===
===Monadic FO===
===Existential FO===
===Universal FO===

==Modal Logic==
Modal logic expands propositional logic by operators for the modalities ''possibility'' and ''necessity''.  These basic ''modal operators'' are usually written &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; (or ''L'') for ''necessarily'' and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; (or ''M'') for ''possibly''. Each can be defined from the other in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;\Diamond P \leftrightarrow \lnot\, \Box\, \lnot\, P.&lt;/math&gt;

==Conjunctive Logic==
Conjunctive Logic is a fragment of FO that is restricted to atomic FO expressions joined by conjunctions that can be preceded by existential quantifiers. It is especially important in Database theory.

'''Definition''' CON

# Atom
# &lt;math&gt;\varphi \land \psi&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\exists_x \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remarks'''

# In other words: a CON-formula is a (relational) FO-formula built from atomic formulas using only conjunction and existential quantification.
# The semantics of FO applies here correspondingly.  
# The 'usual' notions of free and bound variables also apply here.
# A formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\exists_{x_1} ... \exists_{x_n} \varphi_1 \land ... \land \varphi_m&lt;/math&gt;, where each φ is quantifier free, is said to be in Normal Form
# Each CON formula is equivalent to one in Normal Form
# All CON formulas are satisfyable

'''Examples'''

# &lt;math&gt;\exists_x (\varphi(x, y) \land \psi(x, y))&lt;/math&gt; has a bound x and a free variable y
# &lt;math&gt;\exists_x (\varphi(x) )\land \exists_y (\psi(y))&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\exists_x \exists_y (\varphi(x) \land \psi(y))&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is said to be in normal form.

'''Equality'''

Additionally Equality between variables or constants can be be introduced by
* &lt;math&gt;x \equiv y&lt;/math&gt;

Example. Not always satisfiable. Each satisfiable CON formula is equivalent to one without equality.

=Higher-order Logics=
==Fixed-Point Logics==
Fixed-Point Logics augment the syntax of FO by a fixed-point opreator, a mechanism that enables recursion on expressions, and so allows higher expressive power. This idea is quite similar to adding the construct of while-loop to an imperative programming language.

'''Example''' Transitive Closure

[[Image:Graph_TransitiveClosure_SimpleExample.jpg|thumb|250px|right| Transitive Closure illustrated]]
Consider the transitive closure of a graph G. For distance one we have:

&lt;math&gt;G(x, y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for distance up to two:

&lt;math&gt;G(x, y) \lor \exists_z ( G(x, z) \land G(z, y) )&lt;/math&gt;

so we can go on by expanding this disjunction for further fixed distances (only).  In order to express transitive closure for an arbitrary distance (what is vital for most situations) recursion can be introduced employing:

&lt;math&gt;\varphi(T) = G(x, y) \lor T(x, y) \lor \exists_z ( T(x, z) \land G(z, y) )&lt;/math&gt;

where T is the transitive closure up to some i. Thus φ(T) gives the transitive closure up to i + 1. So it can be defined a sequence

&lt;math&gt;J_0 = \empty ; J_i = \varphi(J_{i-1}) , i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

that clearly gives the transitive closure for some k, i.e. the sequence converges (i.e. J&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = J&lt;sub&gt;k+j&lt;/sub&gt;, for all j &gt; 0) and it's limit is the transitive closure.

In the illustration we have an initial graph G as in (a) and thus

(a) as &lt;math&gt;J_1 = G(x, y)\,&lt;/math&gt;

(b) as &lt;math&gt;J_2 = G(x, y) \lor \exists_z ( G(x, z) \land G(z, y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the fixed point (c) as 

&lt;math&gt;J_3 = G(x, y) \lor \exists_z ( G(x, z) \land G(z, y) ) \lor \exists_z ( \exists_t ( G(x, t) \land G(t, z) ) \land G(z, y) )&lt;/math&gt;

and thus J&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = J&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ... .

♣

As we have seen in this example, recursion can be used to express formulas of arbitrary length.  But since we are always dealing with finite formulas here some terminator must be given for the recursion.  This role can be played by the fixpoint.  In the above example such a fixpoint exists. But this is not always the case, as we see next.

'''Example'''

TODO Jumper

♣

As we have seen in this example, a fixpoint of a recursion not always exists.  So we must be careful defining a recursion-based logic.  We extend FO by a fixpoint operator to PFP for cases where a fixpoint exists.

===Partial Fixed-Point Logics (PFP)===
TODO

♣

The above assumption that a fixpoint exists it not really satisfying, so one now can think of restrictions on the recursion in order to enforce the existence in every case.  Therefore three ideas are introduced: monotonicity, positivness and inflation of the recursion.

== re: Questions Regarding Pre-university courses ==

Hi Leightwing,

Thanks for you message. This series of books is not one with which i have had previous experience, however i believe that, having looked at the scopes and aims of the two books, you have made correct assumptions. 

The High School Mathematics book looks to be a self-help guide, for students to use themselves whereas the Primary School Mathematics book looks to be aimed exclusively at parents, to help them teach their children maths to aid their school work. The High School Mathematics book will focus more tightly on the actual mathematics, looking in depth at mathematical technique and teaching it to the reader. The Primary School Mathematics book will focus heavily on the methods used to teach mathematics to the young, expecting the reader to be generally competent with maths, but not so much with teaching.

It is unusual for books in a series to have such different purposes, but not unheard of.

I hope this clears things up, if not please don't hesitate to send me another message and I will take another look at it for you.

[[User:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:17, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

I have had a look through the edits that you have made to the series so far and they are of high quality. Keep up the good work!

== Formulas and images ==

G'day, you might be interested in the MathML markup support in Wikibooks. This allows you to insert properly formatted maths formulas without having to upload an image. For example, I've replace your image of the five puppies formula with this:

&lt;math&gt;P = 2 \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) ^n&lt;/math&gt;

See [[m:Help:Displaying a formula]] for more details. 

Can I also suggest that when you create an image for upload, consider formats other than JPEG. JPEG is really good for photographs, but not very good for line art and mathematical graphing. Anything that is made up of mostly lines is better as either SVG (vector art) or PNG. If your graphics package supports those, your images will come out cleaner and clearer than they would as JPEG. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:23, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== Wikiversity course? ==

The pages you have been working on, the &quot;Primary Mathematics&quot; pages appear to be more of a wikiversity course then a wikibooks textbook. The wikiversity project moved off this server some time ago, although some old pages still remain here that have not been completely deleted. 

There are two options for you, if you want to continue work on this book:
#We can try to reformat these pages to be a &quot;textbook&quot; and not a course. In this case all the pages can stay on wikibooks, but it will take a little bit of formatting work to make everything correct.
#We can move your work to [[v:|Wikiversity]]. You won't need to change the format or layout of your work, but you would need to create an account on that server to continue working on it.

Please let me know what you would like to do. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:51, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:Your confusion is understandable, this is a confusing situation. The way to progress right now really depends on what you want to do. Do you want to write a textbook or do you want to write a course? That decision will determine which environment you work in (wikibooks or wikiversity, respectively). Let me know what you would prefer to do, and I can go about fixing some of the links and moving the pages to where they need to be. I would much rather that you got off to the right foot then if you tried to work from a bad starting point and get very frustrated.

::Okay. Let me look around at Wikiversity, see what needs to be moved and who I need to talk to about doing it. I'll let you know as soon as I have some results for you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:04, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

All the pages from the Primary Mathematics course have been successfully imported to Wikiversity. The new page for you to edit is: [[v:Topic:Primary School Mathematics]]. The versions of the pages here on Wikibooks are going to be changed into book pages. Let me know if you have any questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:49, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

:These kinds of things happen, unfortunately. Here is what you can do:
:#Copy + paste the text of the pages here to the pages at Wikiversity. This will update them to reflect the work you have already done.
:#Upload all your images to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. Commons is an image repository that is shared among all the projects, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, Wikipedia, etc.. If you upload images to commons, they will be visible from Wikiversity and Wikibooks. If you upload them to commons, all the image links will &quot;find&quot; the images again.
:I'll get the &quot;overview&quot; page imported, I didnt realize I missed it. That should take care of the problem. If you have any other questions, or if you need help with any of this, let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:29, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::If there appears to be a discrepancy, make sure you are always logged in! Follow the steps I outlined above to resolve the problem permanently. I still have not been able to get your overview page imported. I don't have the ability to import pages myself, I have to request it from other users (who may or may not be too busy to handle all my requests immediately). Copy+Paste all your changes from Wikibooks to Wikiversity, and then upload all of your images to commons. By the time you are done that, hopefully the overview page will be imported and you will be in business. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:03, 29 August 2007 (UTC)

== Some comments on your edits ==

While I appreciated your additions to [[Primary mathematics:Negative numbers]], particularly the graphics, I do have some suggestions:

1) Please add a comment with each edit (the comment box is right below the edit box) so we know why a change was made.  In the case of new materials or additions, it's fairly obvious that you added it because you thought it would be a good addition.  However, in the case of changes to existing text or deletions, some explanation is needed as to why you feel the changed text (or no text at all) is better than the old text.

2) Specifically, I wonder why you blanked out the sections I wrote on multiplying and dividing negative numbers.  I've restored the material, because surely anything on this subject is better than nothing.

3) I feel we should have sections for each of the four basic mathematical operations to be done with negative numbers, although a case could be made for combining addition with subtraction and multiplication with division.  

4) I wrote my material for students and you wrote for teachers and parents.  Perhaps we eventually need to split into two lessons for each topic, with these different audiences in mind.  However, in the meantime, we should avoid deleting each other's material simply because it's written with another audience in mind.

5) I believe section titles are typically written with only the first letter and any proper nouns capitalized, not using mixed case (I actually prefer mixed case, but that's not what I've seen here).

6) I'd avoid using terms like &quot;manipulatives&quot;, without defining them, as many parents and teachers may not understand this term, not to mention students.

[[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 19:48, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

:OK, thanks for your reply.  I have a somewhat different background, coming from teaching some rather remedial adult education students.  It may be difficult to believe, but there are many adults who lack the ability to do math with negative numbers, then need to pick up this skill to take their high-school equivalency test, pass a test to get a promotion at work, etc.  It sounds like we are going to split the lesson into two, one for parents and teachers (yours) and one for students, be they children or adults (my version).  Can you please provide a link to your new location ?  I'd like to take a look (I probably won't edit it unless I find a spelling error or something like that).  Also, you mentioned not knowing how old the existing page was.  You can use the &quot;history&quot; tab at the top of any page to find out how old the page is (first edit, at the bottom) and how recently it was changed (last edit, at the top).  The summary provided with each edit is also listed there, as are links to the user and talk pages for each editor.  You didn't say you would start providing edit summaries, but I hope you will, as that's a valuable way for the various editors to communicate the reason for each edit.  As for spelling, I always try to cut and paste my edits, then spellcheck them on a word processor or e-mail program before saving them.  I only found one spelling error in your material, but that might be enough to make it worth your while for you to do the same. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 14:05, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks, I changed the student oriented version back to include my content, but also retained some of your content, such as the illustrations.  I noticed that the 3 pluses in the answer for the last illustration are not in an oval like the first two; does this have any meaning ?  I also suggest you use the &quot;Show preview&quot; button to see what each section looks like before you pick &quot;Save page&quot;, as that means fewer edits and edit summaries are required. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 17:01, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

I've now added &quot;cross-dabs&quot; to the top of our two lessons, so readers can jump between the two.  One hint on cutting and pasting, I use CONTROL A (select all) followed by CONTROL X (cut) to cut the entire page, then paste (CONTROL V) it into a word processor for spellchecking.  It's easy to recall the cut sequence, because you &quot;AX&quot; the contents out. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 17:36, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

:OK, I added cross-dabs at the top level now, too, and hope to eventually add them for every other subject.  You might want to create an &quot;Introduction&quot; or &quot;Theory of learning&quot; topic and move some of the material you have on the top page there.  (Those looking for a specific lesson have to scroll through a lot of text to find them, at present.)  Thanks for adding that new illustration.  It seems to be a bit fuzzy with a couple red splotches, though, do you have a cleaner copy ?  One thing we apparently agree on is that there is no need to teach the names of the subtracthend, multiplicator, divisor, and all those other silly names.  I recall wasting quite a bit of time trying to memorize those in school. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 01:31, 2 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

In the part of this article where it tells you how to install python onto Windows computers it says
&quot;To check if you already have it installed, open command prompt (cmd in run menu) or MS-DOS and type python. If it says &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; you will need to download the appropriate Windows installer&quot;
I have Python 2.6, not the newly released 2.6.6, and I opened cmd and typed in &quot;python&quot; and it said
&quot;'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file&quot;.
This leads me to believe that this section of this article is wrong. If it's not actually wrong I wouldn't be surprised though, cause my computer isn't the sharpest tool in the shed

      <comment>/* Choosing Good Cables */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Since you are likely to encounter cables at some point in your guitar playing career, it is important learn about them. This is especially true if you play the electric guitar. With the electric guitar, the use of an amplifier is essential and the cable is the only connection that links the two together. So in order to ensure a good sound, you need to use the proper cabling.

[[Image:Photo-audiojacks.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A comparison of 4 jack types. From left to right: A 2.5 mm jack (often used with cellphones), a 3.5 mm mono, a 3.5 mm stereo and a 6.3 mm stereo]] 

==Audio Cables==
[[Image:Guitar_Jack.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Two styles of 6.3mm jack]]
===Jack Plugs===
Plugs and Jacks are one style of connector used to connect audio equipment together.  Jacks are the &quot;female&quot; side of the connection into which Plugs -- the &quot;male&quot; side of the connection are inserted.  Anyone who has ever used a set of headphones is familiar with at least one type of jack. A jack is simply the end of a cable that lets it connect to another audio device. They come in many different sizes, but for guitarists the most important ones are these:

* 3.5mm mono - small microphones and LINE Out or LINE In small audio devices (z. B. sound map)
* 3.5mm stereo - headphones and LINE Out or LINE In small audio devices (e.g. sound map).
* 6.3mm mono - LINE Out or LINE In larger audio devices (guitar amplifier, mixers, etc.), e-guitar, Send or Return of effects equipment, microphones and loudspeakers.
* 6.3mm stereo - combining Send and Return with effects devices, Stereo microphones and headphones.

Plugs and Jacks are often referred to among audio professionals as &quot;tip-sleeve&quot; or &quot;tip-ring-sleeve&quot; connectors.  If one looks closely at plug at the end of a typical set of headphones, one will note that there are white or black plastic rings separating metal surfaces.  Each of those metal surfaces is connected to a wire that is used to send audio from one side to another.  The notch found in the tip of the connector is used to give the connection some resistance to being inadvertently disconnected (though it hardly compares to the positive locking of the XLR connector following).

The 6.3mm (or 1/4&quot; as it's commonly referred to) mono connector is commonly used for connecting a guitar to an amplifier.  Since a guitar, from an audio point of view, really has no sense of left-to-right difference, only two wires are needed, so this mono or &quot;tip-sleeve&quot; connector is fine for the job.  The tip carries the audio signal, while the sleeve carries the ground side of the audio signal.

Looking at a pair of typical headphones for a portable music player, one finds three metal sections.  The 3.5mm stereo or tip-ring-sleeve connector uses the tip for left-hand audio, the ring for right-hand audio and the sleeve for ground.  Look further at a set of headphones for a smartphone like Apple's EarPods, and one finds four metal sections: tip for left-hand audio, ring for right-hand audio, little sleeve for control signals produced by the volume/play-pause controller, and big sleeve for ground.

===Choosing Good Cables===
Choosing the right cable for an electric guitar is all about preserving the tone that the luthier and you have worked so hard to create.   Many different styles of patch cables are available in differing lengths and using different brands of connectors, cable and jackets.  A good patch cable has been made with the rigours of guitar playing in mind: It will use high quality connectors (look for Neutrik or Switchcraft on the connectors themselves as two high quality brands), will be constructed using high quality cable, and will often offer some strain relief using a reinforcing sleeve or spring-type arrangement at the point where connector and cable meet.  A good cable will lay flat when fully extended with no tendency to curl or twist.  When connected between the guitar and amplifier, the connections should feel solid, with no excessive play or looseness. There should be no appreciable noise added to the sound of the guitar, and when the guitarist grasps the connector body while connected to the guitar and amplifier there should not be an increased hum heard.

Patch cords often come with rubberized jackets, fabric jackets or vinyl/polyvinyl jackets.  The first two are particularly good as the main guitar-to-amplifier connection, while the third is more suited to use between effects units or from the effects units to the amplifier.  The choice between rubberized and fabric jackets mainly comes down to personal preference, though, the rubberized cables are somewhat easier to clean off should they come in contact with sticky or damp substances common in some performance locations.

Good patch cables will be priced in the US$20-40 range for a 3-meter cable.  A good quality cable will have a lifespan of five to ten years if properly cared for.

===XLR plugs===
[[Image:Xlr-connectors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|XLR plug and socket]]

These plugs are very durable and they are the plug of choice for professional recordings, and non-professional recordings. Nearly all professional stages and sound studios are equipped with XLR connections... some home studios have XLR connections, thanks to the invention of retail outlets. Loudspeakers and mixers are also often connected with these cables too

The plugs have a catch mechanism, which prevents inadvertent separation of a patch cord. In order to be able to pull a XLR plug from the socket, you have to press the release mechanism. A XLR connection always consists of 3 phases. One phase transfers the mass while the other two transmit the audio signal. Usually one of the two audio signals is misphased in transfer, in order to remove any effects from signal distortion.

===MIDI Cables===

Right now, the 5 pronged MIDI cable are always used for data transfer, but originally they were intended for use with high quality stereo equipment. At that time this 5- pronged cable represented a variant to Stereo, which existed beside the identical, 3 pronged mono execution.

Today these cables are used almost exclusively for the transmission of MIDI control signals between MIDI capable music instruments, amplifiers and computers. Since it does not depend on fast data transmission rates, shielding of the individual wires inside the cable is not necessary.

'''Lemon pickle''' is a traditional condiment used with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] food. Many pickle recipes from India have oil to help preserve the pickle, but this recipe uses no oil.

{{see also|Cookbook:Lemon Pickle 2}}

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]] - 12 small or 6 large (thin skins preferred)
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of 1 large or 2 small lemons
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ¼ cup of [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red chili powder]]
* ½ cup of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seed
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mustard|black mustard]] seed
* ¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] powder (omit for [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] version)

==Procedure==

;Preparation
# Wash the lemons and dry them well, leaving no water on the lemons. Trim off the stalk and any odd bits.
# Cut the lemons in to small pieces about 2 cm / ¾ inch on each side, and place in a bowl.
# Dry-roast the fenugreek, black mustard and asafoetida together in a pan on a medium heat for about 5 minutes. Don't burn them!
# Grind the roasted spices in a grinder, or a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]].
# Add the ground spices, turmeric powder, salt, sugar and chili powder to the bowl and mix together well.
# Pack the mixture into a 2 [[Cookbook:Liter|litre]] (2 [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]]) jar, or use a couple of smaller jars. Don't fill quite to the top - allow at least 1 cm space.

;Fermentation
Sit the jar where it will get the heat of the sun. Bring the jar inside in the evening, and put it back out in the morning. Do this for at least a month in summer, two months in winter. The warmth of the sun will help the pickle to ferment.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Don't worry about the amount of sugar in the recipe, because it will be fermented away over time.
* Asafoetida powder generally has wheat flour added to it, to help it flow well. You can omit this ingredient if you want to make it gluten-free.

      <text xml:space="preserve">G'day and welcome aboard. I just saw your page on [[Physical Activity/Planche]], and it strikes me that it would be perhaps better to start a book on [[Gymnastics]] and have planche as one page of that book. What do you think? 

I could help you get started, but please note that I can't contribute to a book on gymnastics as I know nothing about it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Expectancy x Value: Effects on Students’ Motivation==
As we have explained in this chapter, motivation is affected by several factors, including reinforcement for behavior, but especially also students’ goals, interests, and sense of self-efficacy and self-determination. The factors combine to create two general sources of motivation: students’ expectation of success and the value that students place on a goal. Viewing motivation in this way is often called the expectancy-value model of motivation (Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2002; Wigfield, Tonk, &amp; Eccles, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Wigfield, A. &amp; Eccles, J. (2002). ''The development of achievement motivation.'' San Diego, CA: Academic Press. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wigfield, A., Tonk, S., &amp; Eccles, J. (2004). Expectancy-value theory in cross-cultural perspective. In D. McInerney &amp; S. van Etten (Eds.), ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning.'' Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;, and sometimes written with a multiplicative formula: expectancy x value = motivation. The relationship between expectation and value is “multiplicative” rather than additive because in order to be motivated, it is necessary for a person to have at least a modest expectation of success and to assign a task at least some positive value. If you have high expectations of success but do not value a task at all (mentally assign it a “0” value), then you will not feel motivated at all. Likewise, if you value a task highly but have no expectation of success about completing it (assign it a “0” expectancy), then you also will not feel motivated at all.

Expectancies are the result of various factors, but particularly the goals held by a student, and the student’s self-efficacy, which we discussed earlier in this chapter. A student with mastery goals and strong self-efficacy for a task, for example, is likely to hold high expectations for success—almost by definition. Values are also the result of various factors, but especially students’ interests and feelings of self-determination. A student who has a lasting personal interest in a task or topic and is allowed to choose it freely is especially likely to value the task—and therefore to feel motivated.

Ideally both expectancies and values are high in students on any key learning task. The reality, however, is that students sometimes do not expect success, nor do they necessarily value it when success is possible. How can a teacher respond to low expectations and low valuing? We have offered a number of suggestions to meet this challenge throughout this chapter. In brief, raising low expectations depends adjusting task difficulty so that success becomes a reasonable prospect: a teacher must make tasks neither too hard nor too easy. Reaching this general goal depends in turn on thoughtful, appropriate planning—selecting reasonable objectives, adjusting them on the basis of experience, finding supportive materials, and providing students with help when needed. These teaching strategies are so important that we return to them in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]], which is called “Instructional Strategies.”

Raising the value of academic tasks is equally important, but the general strategies for doing so are different than for raising expectations. Increasing value requires linking the task to students’ personal interests and prior knowledge, showing the utility of the task to students’ future goals, and showing that the task is valuable to other people whom students’ respect. Some of these strategies were discussed earlier in this chapter, but others (e.g. linking new learning with prior knowledge) are discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]], which is called “The Learning Process.”

==Motivational Operation or Motivation (MO)==
Congratulations on putting this book together! 
1 suggestion:  Modern radical behaviorist define motivation as &quot;any stimulus, event, or condition that (1) increases the probability of a previously learner response (also called the EVOCATIVE effect of MO) and (2) establishes (albeit temporarely) the reinforcing effectiveness of another stimulus (also call the REINFORCER ESTABLISHING EFFECT).
For a contemporary treatment of the topic see Jack Michael &quot;concept and principles in behavior analysis&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Technology Supported Learning &amp; Retention (TSLR) wikibook is the &quot;textbook&quot; to help faculty apply the '''Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education''' to their teaching.

In 1987 Chickering &amp; Gamson published the now famous “Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education.” These principles are based on the perspective that the goal of a proper undergraduate education should be active, cooperative, and challenging.

== Technology Supported Learning &amp; Retention (TSLR) ==

Each section looks at one of the best practices in higher education instruction, and then considering technologies that support those practices.

* [[/About.../]]
* [[/Introduction/]]
* [[/1. Student-faculty contact/]]
* [[/2. Cooperation Among Students/]]
* [[/3. Active/Engaged Learning/]]
* [[/4. Prompt Feedback/]]

* [[/Resources/]]
* [[/Instructional Technology Literacy Rubric/]]
* [[/Students say.../]]
* [[/Advanced Topics/]]
* [[/ePortfolio/]]

== TSLR Topics Overview ==

Faculty are asking for information and help using technology to support student learning and retention. We have packaged everything into one place. We provide the &quot;guide on the side&quot; and maximum flexibility to meet faculty needs within their time constraints.

* '''Overview - Introduction to Technology Supported Learning &amp; Retention (TSLR)''' - guided tour of technology, tools, functions, discussions, participate as a student in discussions, assignments, quizzes

* '''Basics - Learning Support'''  - Introduction, develop samples within own course shell, emphasis on application of technology to support learning objectives, access to a course shell on the development system for building course content activities

* '''Course Management - Teaching and Learning'''  - TSLR Introduction, Learning Support, further development of own course to address broader needs of students in a hybrid and fully online learning environment, emphasis on course management and pedagogy, special topics - importing quizzes, content, previous experience with learning support technologies

== Formerly known as TEI - Technology Enhanced Instruction ==

The name change to '''Technology Supported Learning &amp; Retention (TSLR)''' from Technology Enhanced Instruction (TEI) better reflects the focus on student learning rather than faculty teaching - an important distinction. The Technology Enhanced Instruction (TEI) was the name of the original project groundwork done in 2003. However, as the basis for curriculum for 2008 and beyond, a more student-centered title is appropriate. It isn't about us (faculty and course designers), it is about all of us (students and instructors as learners). Interestingly, little needed to be changed beyond the title, as the students' learning was the primary focus of the course materials.

.. may be useful if we decide to expand offering for K-12 teachers

&lt;/noinclude&gt;


The face of the teaching of mathematics is in constant flux.  This course, therefore is an attempt to stay in step with the current pedagogy(s) used in the teaching of mathematics to the primary grades.  While educators should find this book helpful in learning or reacquainting themselves with some of the methodologies currently used, this course attempts to use as much lay language as possible to also be helpful to parents who, in looking over the shoulders of their children, are sometimes baffled by the &quot;New Math&quot;.  Those who perhaps might find the most value from this course would be those who wish to '''home-school''' their child(ren). It is hoped that teachers of mathematics will continually make updates to this course as these changes inevitably occur.

== What This Book is Not ==

This book assumes that the reader has reached some level of competency with the topics it covers.  As such, this book is not designed to teach math to the reader.  Rather, it is meant to give the reader insight into how and why mathematical core understandings and skills are taught the way they are.  Activities will be suggested that will present teachers and prospective home-schoolers with ideas for their own course content.  A basic mathematics background should be all that is needed to find value in this course.  Often times parents (and even teachers) only understand a topic in the way they were taught it, but modern math curriculums are often constructed in such a way that topics are covered in many different ways in order to accommodate the different learning styles of students.  By way of example, this course will '''not''' teach the reader in step by step fashion how to multiply two large numbers, but the various building blocks and algorithms that students are introduced to in the process of learning this skill will be explained.

== Connectedness ==
One of the overarching ideas that is highly valued in the teaching of mathematics in the primary grades involves the ''connections'' students make in their learning.  All of our mathematical understandings are intertwined.  For this reason, different skills such as multiplication and understandings like those learned from the study of geometry are not taught separately.  Rather, they are taught together, in such a way as to reinforce each other. Students should be encouraged to make connections by looking for patterns, exploring extremes, and forming and testing conjectures. Teachers and parents should refrain from simply &quot;telling them how to do it.&quot;  Letting student &quot;guess at&quot; and then check their work, learning from their mistakes as they go, leads to much stronger mathematical understandings.  It also leads them to form mathematical habits that make future mathematically based explorations more efficient. 

Primary and even upper school teachers recognize that understanding mathematics in the abstract is not the goal of most students. They need to see connections to the real world that inspire their learning.   For this reason, teachers prefer to use real world problems that require the need for mathematical models (see below). Teachers prefer not to &quot;teach&quot;.  They prefer to &quot;guide&quot;.  Modern Educators realize that students gain true &quot;ownership&quot; of their understandings through, inasmuch as it is possible, making ''connections'' on their own - by way of their own work and explorations.  Internal links in this course, when found in this course will purposefully be placed there to emphasize what should be an ever-present concept of the connectedness of mathematical understandings.

== Manipulatives and Models==

One very important component of the contemporary methods used to teach math is the use of ''manipulatives'' (such as toys) and ''models'' (visual representations) to give added dimension to students' understandings.  In each chapter of this course, the reader will find various examples of models used to teach different mathematical understandings.  Often, they will find that these models serve to make ''connections'' to material covered in other sections.  Keep in mind that teachers in the classroom tend to be very creative and resourceful.  Often, the models found in this course have many possible permutations, and can come in various shapes, sizes, and guizes.  They are purposely presented here in simple forms to facilitate for the reader their identification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Who were the Vikings?==
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|right|Map showing area of Scandinavian settlements during the 9th to 10th centuries. Also the trade and raid routes, often inseparable, are marked.]]
The Norsemen (Norwegians) who lived around the beginning of the second millennium are today more commonly known as Vikings. The Vikings were farmers who &quot;traded&quot; during the slow months. Now, &quot;trading&quot; doesn't mean &quot;I'll give you five sheep for that cow.&quot; It means &quot;I'll give you five sheep for that cow. If you don't want to trade, I'll kill you.&quot; These people loved to travel in boats from one place to another, and this led to the second discovery of North America (Native Americans first, Vikings second, and Columbus third). Although Irish monks, most famously Brendan, and other European explorers had voyaged in the western waters, the Vikings established a settlement, the remains of which can be seen today at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Anse_aux_Meadows L'Anse aux Meadows], Newfoundland.

===Proported Ancestry and Descendants===
The Norse are believed by some to have descended from the Huns, a people of uncertain ancestry. The Norse are believed by some to be the ancestors of the Goths and of modern Germans. There is no proof for these claims.

==Snorri Sturluson==
Snorri Sturluson (1178 – September 23, 1241) was an Icelandic historian, poet and politician. He was two-time elected lawspeaker at the Icelandic parliament, the Althing. He was the author of the Prose Edda or Younger Edda, which consists of Gylfaginning (&quot;the fooling of Gylfi&quot;), a narrative of Norse mythology, the Skáldskaparmál, a book of poetic language, and the Háttatal, a list of verse forms. He was also the author of the Heimskringla, a history of the Norwegian kings that begins with legendary material in Ynglinga saga and moves through to early medieval Scandinavian history. For stylistic and methodological reasons, Snorri is often taken to be the author of Egils saga.

As a historian and mythographer, Snorri is remarkable for proposing the theory (in the Prose Edda) that mythological gods begin as human war leaders and kings whose funeral sites develop cults (euhemerism). As people call upon the dead war leader as they go to battle, or the dead king as they face tribal hardship, they begin to venerate the figure. Eventually, the king or warrior is remembered only as a god. He also proposed that as tribes defeat others, they explain their victory by proposing that their own gods were in battle with the gods of the others

Snorri Sturluson was born into the wealthy and powerful Sturlungar family of the Icelandic Commonwealth, a sovereign nation, about 1178. His parents were Sturla Þórðarson[2] of Hvamm and Guðný Böðvarsdóttir. He had two older brothers, Þórðr Sturluson (the oldest) and Sighvatr Sturluson.

By a quirk of circumstance he was raised from the age of three (or four) by Jón Loftsson, a relative of the Norwegian royal family, in Oddi, Iceland. As Sturla was trying to settle a lawsuit with Father Páll Sölvason, the latter's wife lunged suddenly at him with a knife, intending, she said, to make him like his hero Odin (one-eyed), but bystanders deflected the blow to the cheek. The resulting settlement would have beggared Páll. Loftsson intervened in the Althing to mitigate the judgement and to compensate Sturla, offered to raise and educate Snorri.

Snorri therefore received an education and made connections that he might not otherwise have made. He attended the school of Sæmundr fróði, grandfather of Loftsson, at Oddi. He never returned to his parents' home. His father died in 1183 and his mother as guardian soon wasted Snorri's share of the inheritance. Loftsson died in 1197. The two families then arranged a marriage in 1199 between Snorri and Herdís, the first daughter of Bersi. From her father, Snorri inherited an estate at Borg and a chieftainship. He soon acquired more property and chieftainships.

Snorri and Herdís were together for four years at Borg. They had a few children. The marriage succumbed to Snorri's philandering, and in 1206 he settled in Reykholt as manager of an estate there, but without Herdís. He made significant improvements to the estate, including a hot outdoor bath (Snorralaug). The bath and the buildings have been preserved to some extent. During the initial years at Reykholt he had several more children by different women: Gudrun, Oddny and Thuridur.

==Eric &quot;the Red&quot; and his Children==
Eric &quot;the Red&quot; fled Norway to Iceland to avoid facing a murder charge, and later was banished from Iceland for yet another murder. His children would have great impact on the discovery and explorations of North America.

===Bjarni Ericson===
Bjarni travelled around trading in his little '''knarr'''. A knarr is a small Norwegian boat that only fits about three to five people. Bjarni sighted Vinland (modern Newfoundland).

An interesting fact is that Leif Ericson bought Bjarni Herjólfsson's boat about ten years later, in about 995 C. E. This is the same boat in which Lief had discovered Vinland. Leif Ericson was about thirty years old (or thirty three, depending on whether one follows the &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot;, i.e. the Saga of Eric the Red, or the &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot;, or the Greenlanders Saga).

===Thorvald Ericson===
Explored from 1004 to 1005 AD.

===Thorfinn Ericson===
Traveled from 1008-1009 AD. He bravely took cattle with him on his knarr, hoping to settle in Greenland. &quot;Greenland&quot; is a misnomer, since it's covered in ice; his cattle died.

===Freydis Erikidottir===
Freydis was Eric's daughter, his fourth child. Since Freydis was a woman, there were many restrictions put upon her, but she wanted to make a name for herself.  In 1013 AD, she explored with 2 Icelandic men, and killed them and their men upon arriving in Vinland (North America).

===Leif Ericson===
Leif Ericson did further exploration of Vinland and settled there. In 986, Norwegian-born Eirik Thorvaldsson, known as Eirik the Red, explored and colonized the southwestern part of Greenland. It was his son, Leiv Eiriksson, who became the first European to set foot on the shores of North America, and the first explorer of Norwegian extraction now accorded worldwide recognition.   

The date and place of Leiv Eiriksson's birth has not been definitely established, but it is believed that he grew up on Greenland. The Saga of Eric the Red relates that he set sail for Norway in 999, served King Olav Trygvasson for a term, and was sent back to Greenland one year later to bring Christianity to its people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the Facilitated online course, students enrolled in the cohort work through the modules together, with predefined deadlines for completing individual lessons. The cohort provides a significant interactive learning experience. The facilitator monitors the progress. The facilitator is available to moderate discussions that go off track and to answer questions as they arise.

Cohorts are scheduled. Registration is required. Participation in discussions is expected. Activity completion is self-paced, but there is considerable advantage to working within the cohort schedule.


=== Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education ===


In 1987 Chickering &amp; Gamson published the now famous “Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education.” These principles are based on the perspective that the goal of a proper undergraduate education should be active, cooperative, and challenging.

# encourage student-faculty contact
# encourage cooperation among students
# encourage active/engaged learning
# give prompt feedback
# emphasize time on task
# communicate high expectations
# respect diverse talents and ways of learning

=== Modules and activities ===


Course modules address each of the seven principles. Each module contains activities grouped for building blocks for learning.

* '''Learn''' - notes, reading, discussion about concepts associated with the Practice theme of the module, introduction to the technologies that support this module's Practice
* '''Explore''' - as a &quot;student&quot; use the tools and participate in demonstrations of the Practice
* '''Apply''' - from the instructional perspective, observe and/or implement the Practice tools
* '''Evaluate''' - reflect on the Practice, implementation process and student outcomes 

Just want the overview? Complete the activities within the course identified as components of the Introduction. You will see that there are many other activities listed and tagged for Student Learning Support or Teaching and Learning. You are welcome to do any or all of these as your time and interest permit.

If you are planning to supplement an existing classroom course, you should work through all the activities tagged Introduction and Student Learning Support.

Experienced technology using faculty planning to use the course management tools are to review and participate in all activities.


=== Course Completion ===

How do you know when you are done? Rubrics are provide to check your work. If you would like academic credit for the work, a formal registration and review process is being considered.

There are no &quot;grades&quot; for the course - just assessment of Completion. As a participant in the TSLR course, you are NOT working for actual course grades. All the assignments and quizzes are hands-on learning experiences - show and tell, only. With that in mind the grades are meaningless.

Did you do the assignment - yes/no? Do you have a student experience with various Catalyst options? Did you get something to think about, discuss and/or add to your own course? That is the ONLY objective for including graded assignments in this course.

Grades are not important, other than to see the ranges and how they work from a student perspective. The &quot;course&quot; is about personal learning experience, professional development, community building, and working toward providing more options for students.

=== Resources ===


The material in the Technology to Support Learning &amp; Retention course is intended to serve as a stand-alone self paced course as well as an ongoing reference for any faculty interested in learning more about the Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education and their application to courses via technology.

Self-paced study - Work through the lessons and activities in the order presented. Engage colleagues in discussion, review of course development. Available anytime. May request review for credit upon successful completion.

=== Group Project ===


Rather than a course, think of this a group project. That is a better model for this learning experience. We are all in this together. I changed the Catalyst course Settings to say Facilitator and Participants, because this more accurately represents our respective roles.

As a graduate and occasional instructor in the CSUEB MS Ed Online Teaching and Learning program, I thought the group project process was an extremely valuable learning experience. In fact, that was the subject of my Masters project (most of which is available from my DeAnza web page).

== Moving pages ==

Please be careful when moving pages. If you move them twice, then it leaves behind a double redirect. Every time a pages is moved, a redirect is created at the old location which points to the new location. If you move a page twice, then there will be redirects from A--&gt;B--&gt;C (but only the B--&gt;C redirect works). That means that all the A--&gt;B redirects need to be updated by hand. I've already cleaned up all the double redirects you made, but in the future try not to create them in the first place. Happy editing!

I have added this chapter in part because I think parents using this book need to understand what their children's learning environment is like.  For this reason, each chapter in this book needs to give examples of manipulatives and/or incorporate the use of models in every chapter.  Additionally, because the web of mathematical understanding is rather complex, a good deal of thought must be given to how to make the various &quot;connections&quot; that the different models support apparent, without too much confusion for the reader.  Hopefully, editors will begin to develop a &quot;format&quot; for each chapter that can be outlined and explained in this &quot;Overview&quot; chapter. I'm not sure if this approach puts the cart before the horse or not, but after a few chapters (that address these issues) have been written, someone should come back to this chapter and updated it to serve as a guide to understanding those chapters, as well a serve as a template for editing of other chapters. [[User:Leightwing|Leightwing]] 01:51, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

It occurs to me that if this becomes a Course rather than a textbook that it might make sense to approach it as if it were an overview of Teaching Primary Mathematics for someone that wants to home-school their child(ren).   In this way the focus would still be on the pedagogical approach, but the language would be directed at the &quot;lay&quot;-educator. [[User:Leightwing|Leightwing]] 16:49, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

= July 2010 = 

I see the last edits were a while ago. There is a Wikiversity project now [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Primary_School_Mathematics] that is distinct from this Wikibook. I will attempt to edit both during the next few months, adding to this Wikibook as a readable book on primary mathematics for self-learners of all ages and to the Wikiversity topic as a guide to teaching primary mathematics for both homeschooling parents and classroom teachers. -- [[User:WeijiBaikeBianji|WeijiBaikeBianji]] ([[User talk:WeijiBaikeBianji|talk]]) 19:47, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

== Navigation Templates ==

Hey anyone, I'm adding navigation to these pages and I'm basically using the same template as on another page. I'm new to this so I'm still figuring out the coding and whatnot.  I can't seem to find any reference on how to make the '''''Previous''''' link take the user back to the main page of this book. Help? [[User:Sheppard|Sheppard]] ([[User talk:Sheppard|talk]]) 04:08, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

:Hmm... probably the template isn't robust enough to do this.  I came up with a rather kludgey fix.  I created a redirect page, and pointed it to the main page.  Then I put this as the link to point to in the navigation template.  The only downside is that, when you follow that link there will be in small print at the top of the page &quot;Redirected from ...&quot;  Try it out and tell me what you think.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is no built in function to make a polar 3D surface plot (that is, height governed by radius and angle). However,a small amount of code allows us to draw one using the identities between Cartesian and polar coordinate systems:

::&lt;math&gt;x=r \cos \left( \theta \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=r \sin \left( \theta \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

How we will do this is to construct a table of values corresponding to the height for a range of angles and radii. Let's us use the function below as an example:

::&lt;math&gt;f\left( r, \theta \right) = r \sin \left(\theta \right) \, &lt;/math&gt;

The first step in constructing our table is to define the function and to state the distance between plot points we would like:

&lt;pre&gt;
dtheta = Pi/20;                          (*Give a radial gridline spacing of Pi/20 radians*)
rmax = 1;                                (*Define the maximum radius*)
dr = rmax/10;                            (*Give 10 circumferential grid lines*)

f[r_, theta_] := r  Sin[theta];          (*This is the function definition*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, we construct our table of height values according to the information above:

&lt;pre&gt;
data = Table[
      f[r, theta],                       (*This is the function giving the value in the table*)
      {theta, 0, 2Pi, dtheta},           (*This is the increment for theta*)
      {r, 0, rmax, dr}];                 (*This is the increment for r*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

At this point, we can plot the table of data in Cartesian coordinates by using ListPlot3D, with ''r'' on onthe ''x''-axis, ''&amp;theta;'' on the ''y''-axis and ''f(r,&amp;theta;)'' on the ''z''-axis. This gives an ordinary SurfaceGraphics output.

&lt;pre&gt;
gr1 = ListPlot3D[
    data,                                (*The array of height values*)
    DataRange -&gt; {{0, rmax}, {0, 2*Pi}}];(*The range that this array covers*) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The image below shows the SurfaceGraphics output, gr1. Note that in this example, the image has been antialiased. Please see the image page for the antialisaing code.

[[Image:X sin(y) Surface Plot.png|center|400px]]

We now convert the SurfaceGraphics object to a Graphics3D object, gr2,:

 gr2 = Graphics3D[gr1];

This is the point at which we transform our Cartesian plot into a polar plot using the relations above. We first define a rule to perform the transformation on a point given by a list of three numbers in the form {x,y,z}. We shall call it &quot;substitution&quot;:

 substitution = {r_, theta_, z_} -&gt; {r Cos[theta], r Sin[theta], z};

Now, we use the ReplaceAll function to go through the Graphics3D object, gr2, and find every polygon point. We set polygon points (a list of three numbers) to be a pattern object using the &quot;:&quot; operator and assign it the name &quot;p&quot;. Now we use RuleDelayed (:&gt;) to perform the transformation above on each point. We cannot use Rule (-&gt;) as that would only evaluate when it was entered, not when it was used, and would not transaform the points.

 gr3 = ReplaceAll[gr2, p : Polygon[pts_] :&gt; ReplaceAll[p,substitution] ]

The last step is to show the resulting polar plot, gr3:

 Show[
   gr3,
   AxesLabel -&gt; {&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, z}]             (*Retitle the axes*)

As we are no longer working in the Cartesian coordinate system, we cannot name the horizontal axes ''x'' and ''y'', however, we did not alter the value of ''z'' so we can leave that as the name of the vertical axis.

[[Image:r sin(theta) Surface Plot.png|center|400px]]

For Mathematica 6.0, please use the next code:

&lt;pre&gt;
MyListPolarPlot3D[data_, rRange_, thetaRange_, zRange_] :=
 Module[
  {},
  gr1 = ListPlot3D[
    data,
    DataRange -&gt; {
      { rRange[[1]], rRange[[2]]},
      { thetaRange[[1]], thetaRange[[2]]}
      },
    DisplayFunction -&gt; Identity,
    ColorFunction -&gt; &quot;SolarColors&quot;,
    ColorFunction -&gt; Automatic,
    MeshFunctions -&gt; {Function[{x, y, z}, x*Cos[y]], 
      Function[{x, y, z}, x*Sin[y]]},
    BoundaryStyle -&gt; None,
    ColorFunctionScaling -&gt; True,
    Mesh -&gt; 30
    ];
  
  substitution = {r_, theta_, z_} -&gt; {r Cos[theta], r Sin[theta], z};
  
  gr2 = gr1 /. 
    GraphicsComplex[p_List, rest__] :&gt; 
     GraphicsComplex[ReplaceAll[p, substitution], rest] ;
  
  (*
  * Retitle the axes and show final graph
  *)
  Return[
   Show[
    gr2,
    AxesLabel -&gt; {&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;},
    DisplayFunction -&gt; $DisplayFunction ,
    BoxRatios -&gt; {1, 1, 0.8},
    PlotRange -&gt; {
      {-0.65*rRange[[2]], 0.65*rRange[[2]]},
      {-0.65 rRange[[2]], 0.65*rRange[[2]]},
      {zRange[[1]], zRange[[2]]}
      }
    ]
   ] ;  
  ]

&lt;/pre&gt;

This is an example

&lt;pre&gt;
Fun[r_, t_] := 
  0.632 (0.710 \[ExponentialE]^(-1.166 (0.492+ r^2 - 
         1.403 r Cos[t])) + 
     0.710 \[ExponentialE]^(-1.166 (0.492+ r^2 + 1.403 r Cos[t]))) ;

dataPlot = 
  Table[ Fun[r, t], {t, 0.0, 2.0*Pi, 2*Pi/100}, {r, 0.0, 4.0, 
    0.08}] ;
MyListPolarPlot3D[ dataPlot, {0.0, 4.0}, {0.0, 2*Pi}, {0, 0.55}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Moodle FAQs represents a collection of questions that have come up during the Technology to Support Student Learning &amp; Retention (TSSLR) course that are related to the Moodle technology itself, rather than directly relating to instruction practices. 

'''Catalyst / Moodle'''

Catalyst is the local name for our course management system which is actually Moodle. This is in line with our view that learning and instruction are key, technology is simply a catalyst.

'''cat·a·lyst'''      /ˈkætlɪst/ 
–noun
1.	Chemistry. a substance that causes or accelerates a chemical reaction without itself being affected.
2.	something that causes activity between two or more persons or forces without itself being affected.
3.	a person or thing that precipitates an event or change: His imprisonment by the government served as the catalyst that helped transform social unrest into revolution.
4.	a person whose talk, enthusiasm, or energy causes others to be more friendly, enthusiastic, or energetic.

[Origin: 1900–05; cataly(sis) + (-i)st]

I have recently finished to write a book on [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]] in Russian wikibook [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]]. I want to find somebody to translate it to English. Can you help me with this?
P.S. I am interesting to write some books on math and computer science. On math I am currently working on [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]] and on computer science on [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] and [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (all this is on currently on hold). In my English texts I have a lot of grammar mistakes, so I need somebody to correct one. I want that all that I am writing will be on English. It can be translating of written on another language text or original text. 

P.P.S. I have some material on math in Hebrew. Also hebrew wikibook has some material. It can be nice, while not mandatory, if you will know Hebrew too.

Я недавно закончил писать книгу в русском викиучебнике  [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]] . Я хотел бы найти кого-то ктобы перевёл бы его на английский [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]]. Не могли бы вы мне в этом помочь? 
P.S. Я хочу написать пару книг по математике и компьютерным наукам (программированию). По математике я начал работать над [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]], а по компьютерным наукам над  [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] и [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (пока я оставил это). Я пишу на английском со многими грамматическими ошибками, мне нужен кто-то, чтобы их исправлять. Я хочу, чтобы все мои книги были на английском. Это может быть как перевода с другого языка, так и оригинальный, изначально написанный на английском текст.
P.P.S. По математике, у меня часть материала на иврите, да и в ивритском викиучебнике можно взять. Было бы прекрасно, если бы вы владели также ивритом. Но вовсе не обязательно. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 16:00, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

Technology Enhanced Instruction (TEI) Revisited 2007


== Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education ==

In 1987 Chickering &amp; Gamson published the now famous “Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education.” These principles are based on the perspective that the goal of a proper undergraduate education should be active, cooperative, and challenging.

# encourage student-faculty contact
# encourage cooperation among students
# encourage active/engaged learning
# give prompt feedback
# emphasize time on task
# communicate high expectations
# respect diverse talents and ways of learning

The TSLR course is structured to apply these good practices to technology enhanced instruction using the Catalyst / Moodle course management system.

* apply the Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education to a specific course
* evaluate instructional technology functions provided within the Catalyst course management system for current and improved curriculum delivery and learning activities
* review assistive technology implications
* use the Catalyst technology to enhance instruction
* discover open source / open course resources for enhancing instructional practices
* build a community of technology using educators within the DeAnza CIS/Business Division (some revision required for public course offering)

This course has been developed to serve a range of faculty course development needs and learning schedules

* facilitated cohort - online (Summer 2007) or hybrid (Fall 2007)
* instructor lead - classroom or hybrid
* self-paced / self-study
* reference / resource 

The course draws on the rich and varied resources available via the web. Our goal is to introduce these to support course development and implementation activities, as well as ongoing instruction enhancement. Course resources include

* TSLR notes, assignments, discussions, quizzes, collaborative writing activities
* Catalyst resources for faculty on the DeAnza Catalyst server (http://catalystdev.deanza.edu) - Catalyst Up-And-Running for Faculty at De Anza College, Catalyst Student Guide = For Faculty Viewing
* Catalyst resources for DeAnza students (http://catalyst.deanza.edu) - Catalyst Student Guide
* Moodle resources - Moodle.org (http://moodle.org)
* Technology Enhanced Instruction (TEI) project 2002
* general online teaching and learning resources 

The course is evolving as we discover more about making online teaching and learning better. If you have questions or comments about the objectives or the implementation, please let me know. I appreciate your feedback.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=How many years=

In this lesson, we learn how to say how long we've been working for, how old we are.  

==Ngineminyaka engu-5 ngisebenza==

:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani!
:'''uPhilani''': Yebo sawubona Nandi!
:'''uNandi''': Unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Ngisaphila, wena unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Nami ngikhona.
:'''uPhilani''': Uneminyaka emingaki, uyasebenza?
:'''uNandi''': Ngineminyaka engu-5 ngisebenza.  Nawe, uneminyaka emingaki ufunda eWits? 
:'''uPhilani''': Ngineminyaka engu-2 ngifunda.
:'''uNandi''': Sala kahle.
:'''uPhilani''': Hamba kahle.

|-

|}

&quot;Nginonyaka ngisebenza eKPMG&quot;  is used for one year.  As said before this has the same pattern as the other verbs.  To express how old we are, we use the same construction but with no verb after it or 'ubudala' may be used, which means years since birth.  Note on the numbers, engu-5 should be read as engu-'five'.  So the number is read as it would be in English.  Thus engu-10 would be read as engu-'ten'.  This is done because Zulu numbers are cumbersome particularly for numbers above 5.

==Uneminyaka emingaki ubudala?==

:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani!
:'''uPhilani''': Yebo sawubona Nandi!
:'''uNandi''': Unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Ngiyaphila, wena unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Nami ngisaphila.
:'''uPhilani''': Uneminyaka emingaki ubudala?
:'''uNandi''': Ngineminyaka engu-25.  Nawe, uneminyaka emingaki? 
:'''uPhilani''': Ngineminyaka engu-22 ubudala.  Usebenzaphi?
:'''uNandi''': Ngisebenza eNedbank.  Ubhuti wakho usebenza na?
:'''uPhilani''': Yebo, yena usenbenza eCrispy Chicken. Umama wakho usebenza kuphi?
:'''uNandi''': Yebo, yena usebenza eChris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.
:'''uPhilani''': ungudokotela?
:'''uNandi''': Cha, yena ungunesi. Umama wakho uneminyaka emingaki?
:'''uPhilani''': Uneminyaka engu-37.
:'''uNandi''': uMama wami uneminyaka engu-41.
:'''uPhilani''': Sala kahle!
:'''uNandi''': Hamba kahle!

Here ''wakho'' means ''your'' again.  The interrogative suffix ''-phi'' can also easily be used with ''sebenza''.   The characters inquire about age with or without ''ubudala''.  Notice how simply a question about someone else's age can be formed.

==uGogo uhamba eKhaya==

Remember these nouns from last lesson.  We are going to make simple sentences with them.  In Zulu, the subject has to provide a concord that is attached to the beginning of the verb.  The words in the  table below all belong to the first noun class. Unlike many other languages that just use the verb conjugated in the third person all the time.  Ironically, this would be the case if all the nouns belonged to the first class.  But this is not the case.  The noun always determines the concord that the verb has attached to the front of it.

'''Examples'''

*Udokotela usebenza eChris Hani Baragwanath.
*Ugogo uhamba eKhaya.
*Umngane wami usebenzela iWits.
*Umpheki usebenzela iMacDonalds.
*Umfundi ufunda eGoli.
*Umyeni wami usebenza eNedbank.
*Umkhulu uhlala eNaturena.
*Uthisha uhamba esikoleni.
*Nina nisebenza eStandard Bank.
*Thina sihlala eHoughton.
*Wena usebenzela iDeloite.
*Yena ufunda eWits.

|}

So if we look at the sentences, we can see that all the nouns use the subject concord 'u'.  This is the same subject concord that is used by 'yena' and 'wena'. The formation of one of these sentences can be summed up as follows:  Umyeni u + sebenza eNedbank.  So all we have to do is attach 'u' to the front of various verbs. Take note of the fact that the 'e' to form places is not used with ''sebenzela'' but it is always used with ''sebenza''.

==Summary==

* We can tell people how old we are. ''Nginemiyaka engu-31.''
* We can say how long we have been working. ''Nginemiyaka engu-11 ngisebenza.''
* We can form simple sentences with nouns as the subject. ''Ugogo uhamba eKhaya.''
* We have further illustrated the use of pronouns and their subject concords.

'''1. Student-faculty contact'''

In 1987 Chickering &amp; Gamson published the now famous “Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education.” These principles are based on the perspective that a proper undergraduate education should be active, cooperative, and challenging.

For the Technology Support Learning &amp; Retention (TSLR) course, each module addresses one of the seven principles and the good practices that support it. The first principle, in this module, Student-Faculty Contact is characterized by instructional tools where the instructor is in charge of the interaction with students.

Learners interact directly with the instructor for questions, comments and evaluations. The instructor may interact with learners as a group in a lecture hall, classroom or online lecture (one-to-many) or individually (one-to-one).

Technology functions available to support student-faculty contact include discussions, assignments, quizzes, and course resources.


'''Learning outcomes'''

* participate in several forms of technology enhanced student-faculty contact
* discuss applicability of functions to traditional expectations for student-faculty contact and identify differences
* suggest new learning activities


== Introduction ==

For most of us - both as students and faculty, when we think of instruction, we think of an instructor-led course - the &quot;sage on the stage&quot; model. Somewhere along the line, we have had teachers or mentors available to help but allowed or required us to direct our own learning within some framework - the &quot;guide on the side&quot; model. Both instructional models can be enhanced with technology.

Adding technology to support student learning covers a broad spectrum of enhancements. For the classroom instruction (face-to-face or f2f), providing online resources rather than paper handouts is often the first foray into enhancing instruction with technology. At the far end of the range of possibilities, are totally online courses with automatic quiz grading and course presentation individualized by student progress monitored by the course management system.


==== Seven Principles ====

Based on each of the &quot;Seven Principles&quot; we will look at how instructional practice can be enhanced using technology.

The &quot;text&quot; for this module is online.

Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education
http://web.archive.org/20040118192529/honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/7princip.htm

Instructional Immediacy and the Seven Principles: Strategies for Facilitating Online Courses
http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/fall63/hutchins63.html
Online Journal of Distance Learning Administration, Volume VI, NumberIII, Fall2003
State University of West Georgia, Distance Education Center

As a study guide, here are a few questions to think about as you read the &quot;text&quot; and work through the activities outlined below.

* The Seven Principles were written in 1987. Instructional Immediacy and the Seven Principles: Strategies for Facilitating Online Courses was written in 2003. Why are they still relevant today?
* Has technology changed the interpretation of some of these Principles?
* Have students and their expectations changed since the Principles were written?
* What challenges does today's higher education environment place on faculty and students? 

Chickering &amp; Gamson provided a good framework for teaching and learning in higher education. Now there are technologies available that they could only imagine. In this course, using their model, we are going to look at each Principle and see its applicability in technology-enhanced instruction.

== Student-Faculty Contact ==


First up - '''Student-Faculty Contact'''. In a traditional classroom, faculty are at the forefront. Students wait for the instructor to arrive before anything happens in the class. The instructor talks, students listen, take notes, and participate in question / answer sessions overseen by the instructor. Students can speak with the instructor after class or during office hours - still with the instructor controlling the time and place for the contact.

As technology is added, students have more opportunity to initiate contact - send emails, ask questions in an online forum. The instructor is still essential to the dialog, but students now play a more active role in the contact. More student interaction, greater responsibility for learning, empowering students in ways not previously available to them.

* '''One : Many''' - Communicating with students can be provided to all students at once with web-based course materials, online lectures - text, audio or video. Other technologies for one-to-many communication include email lists, and discussion forums where only instructor posts, forums that allow students to reply, or discussion forums set to allow students to initiate topics.

* '''One : One''' - Email is an alternative to in-person or phone conversations to communication with individual students. Some instructors are using instant messaging as well. 

Student-Faculty Contact is easily added to any traditional course delivery. Students appreciate the flexibility and the immediacy of these enhancements.

===== Students say... =====

* I can ask questions whenever I think about it, rather than having to wait for the next class. Some times that might be a whole week from when I have a question.
* I am an international student. It really helps me to have email from the instructor so I can read the answer again if I don't understand.
* I hate to have a lot of papers from all my classes. It is better to have links to web sites to find the homework assignment information.

== Overview ==

DeAnza's Catalyst is the Moodle course management system. If you are new to Catalyst or course management technology, start with the Moodle basics.

* About Moodle http://docs.moodle.org/en/About_Moodle

* Moodle Teacher Documentation http://docs.moodle.org/en/Teacher_documentation

== Student Learning Support ==


When we were planning this course, we wanted to emphasize the idea that introducing technology could be a progression of enhancements made over time. There are no absolutes, no &quot;gotchas&quot; in the process. Just as each course is different, so too is the path to using technology to support student learning.

What is offered in this course, are opportunities to see what is possible and consider what might be applicable to your own courses now and in the future. This is a smörgåsbord approach. We have put a lot of different things on the table. We encourage you to sample everything, but it is ok if you don't want to dig in. Perhaps later, you will see a need or an opportunity to put some of these &quot;dishes&quot; into your practice of instruction.

If you are ready to implement the functions, guidelines are provided as well as a forum for discussing strategies, questions, problems, suggestions with peers.

Some of the advantages of using technology in student-faculty contact

* any time, anywhere communication - not limited to class time or office hours e.g. email, online discussion forums, chat / instant messaging

* record of contact - no more &quot;gee, I wish I could remember exactly what I told that student&quot; as there is a copy of the conversation with its time and date.

* repeatable - once you work out great instructions for a lesson, that exact same information can be given to students in all sections this quarter and in the future. Allows for &quot;refinement&quot; as students identify new concerns or areas of difficulty.

* it just gets better - revising and improving material over time helps keep the course material relevant and students engaged 

=== Lectures ===

The primary means of presenting information to the whole class is via resources. There are a number of different types of resources - text pages, web pages, links to other web sites. Resources are the simplest form of passive, or push communication available.

=== Document repository ===

It isn't fancy but it works. Catalyst can be used as storage and presentation for course documents that are only available to enrolled students. Files of all types, links, course notes, lists of assignments, class schedules... can be managed and displayed within Catalyst. Limiting access to this information may be a requirement for &quot;publishing&quot; copyright or proprietary information ensuring strict educational &quot;fair use&quot; compliance.

=== Blogging ===

Have you considered blogging? Some faculty are &quot;pushing&quot; regular notices, comments and course updates to their students in blog (weB-LOG) format. Short postings displayed in reverse date sequence - newest at the &quot;top&quot; along with links to course materials, other resources and important bloggers in the topic area, along with links to &quot;archived&quot; copies of older posts.

http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/?p=183

=== Warm-up activity ===

Online discussions, practice quizzes, minute essays are activities that can be used for &quot;warm-up&quot; to a lesson.

* Question or activity to remind you of what you already know about the topic
* List of questions to start thinking about the topic
* List of goals and objectives for the topic to help focus the learning 

=== Top 10 Tools ===

There is always some new and interesting technology coming along. Finding email news, blogs or other sources of information are useful for staying current. Some examples

== Teaching and Learning ==

A recent EDUCAUSE article, Top-Ten Teaching and Learning Issues, 2007 identifies a number of issues applicable to this course - assessment and best instructional practices, changes in student, faculty, and institutional expectations, collaboration, work together, ethics, privacy, and data stewardship. http://www.educause.edu/apps/eq/eqm07/eqm0732.asp?bhcp=1

This big-picture overview of teaching and learning is helpful, and demonstrates the need for all instructors, particularly those in higher education, to acquire instructional technology literacy.

As the focus of learning support technology shifts from instructor-led teaching to student-directly learning, Student-Faculty Contact takes on a new role - that of managing the course resources and ensuring that students are able to take advantage of this new way of interacting with the instructor.

Understanding and using the student-faculty contact tools - either stand alone or within the course management system, is important.

* encourage students to communicate with you early and often
* model desired contacts using the available communication tools
* make it easy for students to select from several forms of contact - email, messaging, discussion forum
* establish limits and expectations for your availability and speed of response 

=== News Forum ===

The NEWS forum is special forum for sending information and updates to students. Only the instructor can post to this forum. There is an option to have summaries from the News forum appear on the main course page.

=== Student questions ===

Although Catalyst doesn't have an internal e-mail system like WebCT, it does have several options to keep student-faculty communication within Catalyst, that can be used for clarification on the forums and discussions and the communication tools.

Check your profile and the messages you are getting - it may be set up so your get email when a student sends a message from inside Moodle, but there should be information in the email so you know where it originated.

Do you have a Questions? forum where students can add discussions and post? I encourage students to ask their questions there. Unless it is personal, I often just copy the student's email into the question forum and answer it there for all to see.

=== Introducing new technologies ===

You may be surprised to find that your tech-savvy students need some time to come up to speed using technology for formal learning. Students instant message with their friends whenever, but using the same technology to work with four complete strangers (class mates) on a group project is a completely new experience.

Consider introducing the technology in several low-risk activities - introductions in a discussion forum. As students become more comfortable with the educational use of the technology, add the critical thinking, graded analysis component that the technology supports.

'''2. Cooperation Among Students'''

The next of the Seven Principles is '''Cooperation Among Students''' that provides students with the opportunity to work together in groups, usually under the direction of the instructor. Discussions, collaborative learning, share writing in a wiki are all examples of technology enhancing cooperation among students.

Students often resist working in groups for fear of having their grades pulled down by the least effective member of the group. In practice, students working in groups learn more about the content area and are more engaged in the activity than working individually.

In the &quot;real world&quot; people rarely work alone. Learning to work collaboratively in an online environment is an important life skill.

'''Learning objectives'''

* participate in activities as students that require cooperation
* assess the challenges and benefits of technology in student cooperation
* discuss the role of group projects learning in higher education
* use choices and surveys for group selection work on group projects, small group discussions, introduction to the wiki for collaborative writing, introduction to the Online Writing Center
* discuss peer review process and applicability

== Introduction ==

There are many ways that students can use existing technologies to cooperate and collaborate.

* email communication to one or more students
* online discussion where all posts can be viewed
* instant messaging with archiving to permit review and access by student not participating in real-time
* online conferencing for live participation or archived for later viewing
* collaborative writing using a shared writing area, e.g,, wiki 

===== Students say... =====

* I am an international student, and this is the first time that I have ever discussed questions in class.
* I have always hated group work, but this was different. I learned so much more working on the group project.
* I have to work with other people in our company offices all over the world. Working on the group project in this class has helped me a lot with my job and my coworkers.
* After three weeks, I feel like I know my classmates better in this online class than in any on-campus class that I have ever taken. I love it.
* I am really happy to be in my group that we work together as a team, help each other, understand our strengths and weaknesses. For example, I let my group acknowledge that I am not familiar with computers and group online, so I need them to remind if I make mistakes. In addition, they would always be there for me, such as posting their suggestions or thoughts. I am proud to say that our group was able to work together to produce a good report.


== Learning Support ==

Even if some or all of the course work is not face-to-face, students appreciate a sense of community. Working together, sharing information builds connections between students and makes the learning experience more personal.

Students with limited language skills, fears of speaking in class, find great empowerment in finally being able to participate in a class discussion. They can formulate their thoughts, edit, look up words, use spelling and grammar checking software.

=== Meeting classmates ===

Having students introduce themselves, along with sharing some personal information, is a time-honored classroom &quot;ice-breaker&quot; which works well in an online discussion environment. Students get to &quot;know&quot; one another, and can build lasting friendships based on &quot;meeting&quot; someone in an online class.

=== Writing Effective Online Discussion Questions ===

The paper CREST+ Model: Writing Effective Online Discussion Questions provides a model for writing effective online discussion questions, covers the cognitive nature of the question, the reading basis, any experiential possibility, style and type of question, and finally ways to structure a good question. This model encourages students to participate in online forum discussions, provides a template for online faculty to use in creating effective discussion questions, and promotes a higher level processing of the material. http://jolt.merlot.org/vol3no2/akin.htm

=== Grading discussion participation ===

Students need to be reassured that you are looking for a demonstration of reasonable effort. Even if the student posts a great discussion question or makes a significant contribution, it doesn't necessary follow that other students will interact in some interesting meaningful way. Students need to know their efforts will be taken that into account. It is important to require so way to track the participation and contributions of individuals for grading.

Grading discussion participation is recommended. Individual posts can be graded as mini-essays. Counting discussion postings, assessing posts for substantial contribution (not just &quot;I agree&quot; posts) ensure that students take an active role in discussions.

=== Collaboration forum ===

For student collaboration, provide a separate forum and encourage students to to use the forum (rather than email) for project communication. This ensure that there is a record of the interaction and all students have the opportunity to read the information. All the posts are linked and automatically collected together. This is great for students and for faculty.


== Teaching and Learning ==

Monitoring and managing student cooperation in an online environment requires some planning. Making use of the tools available for recording and tracking &quot;conversations&quot; can be a significant benefit. All interactions are available for student and instructor review. This provides a more accurate insight in to group dynamics and workload sharing, than is possible in a classroom setting.

=== Managing Discussion Displays ===

For large classes with a lot of postings, managing the quantity of information can be challenging. Learn to use the different discussion display formats - available in a pull-down menu near the top of the topic display page. Highlighting new posts in context is helpful. Displaying new items at the top of the page provides a quick way to see new posts to a topic thread.

=== Facilitating Discussions ===

Most students are willing to participate in well designed discussions. Several open ended prompt questions are often enough the get the conversation going. Instructions about participation expectations - number of posts, some indication of depth of discussion, help students determine how much is &quot;enough&quot; contribution.

Some instructors find it helpful to guide the discussion with feedback, follow-up questions and summaries of points made. In some cases, it may be necessary to address issues of inappropriate posts - personal attack, inappropriate language. Functions are provided deleting or editing offensive posts. However, these should be used sparingly.

Sometimes, discussions without instructor intervention can be more spontaneous and surprisingly insightful. Without a visible authority presence, students are more willing to express themselves, ask for help and provide assistance to classmates.

'''Others say...'''

I read every comment I get. I don't always reply because I prefer to allow readers to have the last word - though at the urging of some readers I've tried recently to be more forthcoming in my replies. -- OLDaily, Aug 07

=== Online Group Projects ===

One of the most difficult aspects of group project work is often scheduling. Most students have many demands on their time. Surprisingly, being able to work asynchronously is a good alternative, once the initial resistance is overcome.

Encouraging students to work on a single shared document, such as a wiki eliminates the need to track versions of the product as it develops.

=== Grading group projects ===

Grading group projects is &quot;fairer&quot; if there is a published grading rubric. In that way, everyone in the group can assess how the group submission is measuring up, and can take action to ensure the final product meets the published standards.

=== Support for online students ===

The De Anza Online Writing Assistance Center (OWAC) provides online help for De Anza students enrolled in targeted courses. Students post requests and essays to the OWAC, and tutors respond with suggestions for improving content, organization, and grammar, and links to online explanations and exercises for the most important areas where improvement is needed. Our philosophy: &quot;Help the student, not the paper.&quot;

'''3. Active/Engaged Learning'''

Ideally, all students are active and engaged learners most of the time. However, the reality is that instructors must work to provide the environment that motivates students to participate in their learning.

Students are comfortable with technology in many forms. Enhancing instruction to tap into the media literacy of students is not difficult, as we shall see.

Some of the strategies for promoting '''Active/Engaged Learning''' include project based learning, and educational games.


'''Learning outcomes'''

* review strategies for including active and engaged learning in instruction
* discuss problem-based learning in higher education
* create an activity that requires new approach to instruction of curriculum content and add activity to own course
* discuss assessing student performance 


== Introduction ==

We have heard it before.

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Make students active participants in learning. Students learn by doing, making, writing, designing, creating, solving. Passivity dampens students' motivation and curiosity. Pose questions. Don't tell students something when you can ask them. Encourage students to suggest approaches to a problem or to guess the results of an experiment. Use small group work.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;from Motivating Students
http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/motiv.htm &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

All these suggestions are easily enhanced with technology.

* Good questions can prompt analysis, critical thinking, research and problem-solving.
* Discussion forums provide a particularly rich learning environment as students must read and write to participate. Students are not limited by the class time to prepare their responses. Many more voices can be heard in the class.
* Assignments and quizzes require direct interaction with the course materials and provide engagement.
* Collaborative writing, peer review and other forums of active engagement can be facilitated with technology. 

===== Students say... =====

* Don't bore me. If you are going to stand up and lecture me from your yellowing notes, put it on a disk, and I will take it home and read it on my time. Use an electronic forum or presentation- music, video, computer-based tutorials, visual peripherals - not just lecture.

* Interaction is an important part in online classes. The previous online courses I took barely involved any discussions and thus I could not learn much from those classes. I only learnt from the notes and texts. The classes were so boring.


== Learning Support ==

When we think of active, engaged learning, with usually thing of students actively doing something, directing their own learning.

=== Creating and Preparing Activities ===

Developing and refining online materials may necessitate populating the course during a live course session. Fortunately, the &quot;hide&quot; feature enables you to work on developing activities. For sections or individual activities like discussions, visibility options provide &quot;privacy&quot; for behind the scene work to set up anything and hide it until you are ready for students to see it.

Another use of hidden resources - Prepare standard wording for feedback, warnings to students, notes to self, etc., and save them as permanently hidden resources. These resources are part of the course and will automatically be included in subsequent semesters' live courses.

=== Privacy and Personal Information ===

Students need to learn about Privacy and Personal Information as they apply to Computers and Society - from the notes, readings and assignments. Are they aware of computers around them and how computers affecting society? Although access to information within the course management system class is limited to enrolled students, students need to understand that sharing personal information needs to be considered carefully.

Asking students to post information and work outside the course management system is generally discouraged for privacy reasons.

=== Images for Visual Interest ===

Adding visual components to your course can convey strong messages and attract students' interest. Images can be placed in the main course page, in resource pages. Images can be used in quizzes as prompts.

There are many sources of images and video media that can be added to classes without charge. See the Resources section for information.


== Teaching and Learning ==

Managing learning via technology requires some additional tools and techniques.

=== Quizzes ===

How many times should students be permitted to submit a quiz? Is there value in instant feedback? Are quizzes learning opportunities? There are many good ways to use quiz technology to enhance instruction.

* some forms of quiz questions can be automatically graded - they can provide instant feedback to students. The correct / incorrect response reply function can reinforce of answers and provide correction, clarification or further information as students work through the quiz questions. Students are usually highly motivated to learn in a graded activity.

* quizzes can be set to permit allow students to retake a quiz
* the highest score will count
* it is important to learn the material. If you need more than one attempt, that is ok.
* learn something each time you review the material for retaking the quiz.

The Quiz function allows students to save answers to individual questions, and submit the quiz for grading as a separate step. Periodically, students will answer all the questions but not &quot;submit&quot; the quiz for grading. The quiz remains in &quot;open&quot; status and is not graded.

=== Questions ===

Like most course management systems, Catalyst / Moodle separates the Questions function form the Quizzes. You can create questions independently of a quiz. This way, you can assemble a quiz from a pool of questions. The same question can be used in self-study quizzes, chapter reviews and final exams. Questions can be selected at random from a group of questions to ensure that each student receives a unique quiz - just one of many features provided to reduce academic dishonesty.

=== Graded Assignments ===

Assignments allow the teacher to specify a task that requires students to prepare digital content (any format) and submit it. Typical assignments include essays, projects, reports, presentations and web pages.

Depending on the type of assignment, grading feedback can be provided as

* points
* letter grade
* satisfactory/unsatisfactory
* separate note from the instructor, only visible to the student
* mark-up - instructor adds directly to the student submission 

=== Model behavior ===

Many students understand requirements best if they see an appropriate model. Often, the students who post first to a discussion are good, outgoing, confident students and their postings provide a good model for other students to follow. Requiring students to post their assignment answers in a discussion forum helps weaker students understand how to do the work and prepare their own submission. This works well for weekly research questions, and issue analysis discussions.

'''4. Prompt Feedback'''

It seems that students have shorter attentions spans than ever, and with some justification. &quot;Generation Instant Gratification&quot; has never had to wait for anything. Although the Seven Principles date back to the late 1970s and 80s the principle of Prompt feedback is as important as ever.

Fortunately, technology provides some relief - Self-grading quizzes, comments and annotated assignments, chat, all allow students to work at their own pace AND receive '''Prompt Feedback'''. This can be a big help in the 24 / 7 world where today's students live, work and learn.

'''Learning objectives'''

* review issues of plagiarism, intellectual property, cheating
* investigate tools for assessing student learning
* complete quizzes and develop quiz questions and quizzes in own course
* complete assignments with feedback and add activity with feedback to own course
* discuss appropriate level of control and feedback response for learning being assessed 


== Introduction ==

The earliest implementations of technology in education was the dreaded &quot;drill and kill&quot; - an endless stream of multiple choice that students answered, usually by guessing. Used in conjuction with other activities and good teaching practices, online quizzes can be a valuable learning resource. Prompt feedback can be provided automatically with self-grading quizzes. Students appreciate the immediacy. By using the feedback to reinforce correct answers, and providing references to teaching for incorrect responses, students can be guided through the lesson material.

On instructor-graded assignments, you can add comments and annotating to help students understand where they lost points in an assignment. Course management systems are constructed to provide a variety of tools for assessing student learning. These are just a few.

===== Students say... =====

* I love being able to check my grades anytime. It helps me make sure I have submitted all my assignments.
* I learn more taking quizzes and getting the wrong answer feedback. Having review information and extra help right in the quiz is great.
* I am aways nervous about quizzes. Taking quizzes online is much better for me.
* The instructor notes in the assignments along with the grade shows me how I can improve.
* assignments that ask us to comment on our peers’ work really does help you get to know each other. After a while, you tend to remember certain people, such as those who post their work the earliest, or those who respond to your work the most often, or who is more interested in what topic. In its subtle way, the assignments for this class have allowed me to get to know more students 



== Learning Support ==

How prompt is &quot;prompt&quot; when applied to feedback? Unfortunately, for instructors in this &quot;always on&quot; world, students' expectations may need to be reset so that 2-3 day turn around on minor assignments is &quot;normal&quot;.

Replying to student questions within 24 hours is a reasonable expectation.

=== Assignment grades ===

There is a Grades link in the left navigation menu. The Grades page lists all the assignments, quizzes, etc. that will be graded throughout the quarter.

Grades are always available. If there isn't a grade for a submitted assignment, it hasn't been graded. I usually grade assignments within a couple of days of the due date. Late assignments are graded periodically as it requires extra processing.

=== Peer review ===

In some situations, peer review can be a valuable addition to the learning process. Students often learn as much reviewing the work of others as they do preparing their own work, or having their own work reviewed. Posting work to discussions or a collaborative writing tool like a wiki allows for easy access for sharing and comment.

=== CCC Confer ===

Use the phone and the internet to meet in real-time. Great for lectures with audio, slides whiteboard, and audience poling. CCC Confer can be used for whole class discussions, small group work, individual counseling, or office hours. CCC Confer was designed to allow communication and collaboration, using Web conferencing technology, for all staff, faculty and administrators in the California Community Colleges system. It is ADA and Section 508 accessible.

CCC Confer http://cccconfer.org/about/about.aspx



== Teaching and Learning ==

Prompt feedback encourages students to stay engaged in the learning process. Reducing the time between thinking of questions or seeing solutions presented in class, the time to remember where the learning left off is greatly reduced.

=== Discussion Subscriptions ===

Many discussion forums have a subscription feature. If someone posts to a discussion that you subscribe to, you automatically are sent an email with some or all of the information in the new posts. There are several variations and options that usually accompany the subscriptions feature - daily digest, summary or full text of posts, subscribe to all topics within a forum, or just replies to something you posted.

You can change the general forum subscription settings in your profile. Check the options in the post form when you post - you have some additional control over the &quot;subscribe&quot; function there.

Everyone seems to have personal preferences about the &quot;best&quot; subscription setting. Try different configurations and options. See what works for you and your course needs.

=== Instructor comments ===

Students like to know why they got points, as well as how the missed them. Instructor notes along with the assignment grade are accommodated as part of the regular point-assignment grading mechanism.

There are a number of features within the assignment grading to streamline grading student work. Separate windows, automatically displaying the next student's assignment, sorting submissions by time submitted, are just a few of the tools to assist instructors and reduce the time and key strokes required to manage student work.

Students are sent notification when instructor comments are added to the assignment. It looks like this.

    07M_0202 -&gt; Assignments -&gt; Games in Education
    Valerie Taylor has posted some feedback on your assignment submission for 'Games in Education'
    You can see it appended to your assignment submission:

=== Assignment markup ===

For some assignments, it may be appropriate to annotate directly on the student's assignment submission. There is an option to permit this which must be enabled, if you wish to use the tool. Usually, the instructor can add notes as a separate item (much like posting in a discussion). Only the student and the instructor can view these. With the markup option enabled, the instructor can actually edit the student submission.

'''5. Time on Task'''

&quot;Time plus energy equals learning. There is no substitute for time on task.&quot;
-- Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson

Some assignments and course activities produce wonderful learning experiences for students Some are viewed as drudge work and don't produce the desired results. We think our subjects are important and interesting. Getting students to spend the time is a challenge.

For promoting student '''Time on task''' there are a number of technology-facilitated learning activities. These include web-based research, collaboration and presentation.


'''Learning objectives'''

* review types of media
* discuss use of media in course work
* access media types
* locate and include media appropriate for own course
* explore other activity types and suggest suitability - books, workshop, etc.
* discuss accessibility issues, adaptive and assistive technologies 


== Introduction ==

Time on task alone is not enough. There has to be real energy put in, as well.

* Time plus energy equals learning. There is no substitute for time on task. Learning to use one's time well is critical for students and professionals alike.

* Students need help in learning effective time management. Allocating realistic amounts of time means effective learning for students and effective teaching for faculty.

* Seven Principles - Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson http://web.archive.org/20040118192529/honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/7princip.htm

There is no question that working independently on assignments - problem sets, essays that demonstrate analysis and critical thinking are important. However, the technologies are available to provide activities that encourage students to work on subject content in other ways - research, collaboration, presentation, share, analyze.

===== Students say...=====

* Personally, I think that it is great that there is online group work in this class because I have another online class without group work and it is so boring.
* I really liked that group that I ended up with [students pick a group using Choice to limit group size to 5 students]. We had lots in common and were able to voice our opinion on the topic at hand freely. Everyone was accommodating and worked well together.
* I like how webcasted lectures enable students to be more flexible with their schedules. It was also very useful when I was studying for the midterms and final because I could go back and review any of the lectures to understand better what the professor was saying.
* It became quite fun as well--I could sit on my bed with my laptop in my lap, comfortably listening to the lectures and learning about... 



== Learning Support ==

Interactive technologies greatly extend the level of resources that can be offered to students. The internet provides world-class lectures, videos, audio in addition to images and text. Encouraging students to avail themselves of these resources is much easier than getting them to go to campus libraries.

=== Media in Course Work ===

Many students enjoy watching and listening to their learning. For many students, being able to rewind and review lectures is invaluable.

There are plenty of well-respected instructors who have recorded their lectures and make these available. Even if their views and content isn't exactly in line with your course, these differences provide a wonderful opportunity for asking students to compare and contrast your course point of view or facts with those in the external content. Students spend time on task watching the video AND on the critical thinking assignments that you create to bring the students back into your focus.

=== Web-based Research ===

There are lots of different web search activities. For the module on research and trusting sources, I ask students to find a wikipedia article of interest to them and look at the history and discussion as well as the text of the article. I have them report their findings in a discussion so everyone can see their selections and analysis. The results are wonderful. For the most part wikipedia is a good resource, but it is clear to students after this assignment, that they really need to find other sources as well - which was the learning objective.

=== Student Presentations ===

Using new skill or knowledge to create a product or deliverable is an important milestone in learning. Having students create presentations of their work reinforces their learning. Presentations can be PowerPoint slides, web pages, wiki entries - all can be shared with other class members who benefit from the work as well.


== Teaching and Learning ==

If the objective is to encourage students to spend more time and energy learning, using technology can facilitate the process by providing access to resources and guiding students to direct their own learning.

=== Course Organization ===

In-person classes tend to very linear. Presentation of material processes throughout the semester as directed by the instructor. Instruction that is enhanced with technology is not limited to linear, step-wise presentation - it can be but it doesn't have to be.

Depending on the subject, it may be desirable to have students direct their own learning and address lessons, or assignments in a sequence of their own choosing. This sounds somewhat chaotic, but it doesn't need to be. Allowing students to select among assignments, or even topics can encourage students to learn much more on all topics.

=== Assignments ===

Each module has a Note and assignment page. Everything for the module should start there. If you are in a big hurry, all the activities for the module are listed at the bottom of the Notes ans assignments page.

=== Open Source Content ===

Rather than having to create everything from scratch, many creative and computer literate instructors have gone ahead and made their work available to any faculty or students who wish to make use of it. One such example of a library of college-level course materials is the Sofia project made available through Hewlett Foundation funded project at Foothill. Sofia initiative includes courses in language arts, art, geography, music and computer programming.
http://sofia.fhda.edu/

Other sources of open source content are maintained by MIT, Harvard, Rice University, UC Berkeley and many others. All the materials are available under the Creative Commons licensing that permits any use of the material.

=== Changing Discussion Posts ===

You have 30 minutes to edit a posting in the discussion forums. During that time, there will be a link &quot;Edit&quot; next to &quot;reply&quot; at the bottom of you post. It goes away after 30 minutes.

Students can &quot;amend&quot; their posts by Replying to it and adding a note there - the second post will then appear in the &quot;thread&quot; from the original post. It doesn't change the original post, but the additional information is recorded.

Faculty can delete posts. If you want to make a significant change, post the &quot;correct information. Delete the original, incorrect post.

There are a number of discussion management tools available - move, split. See the faculty guide for more information.

'''6. High Expectations'''

Setting '''High expectations''' for students lets them know that this important and interesting. Being clear about what you are asking them to do directs their actions. Students coming to higher education at a community college vary enormously in background, recent academic experience and motivation for learning the subject.

Expectations can be presented and reinforced through evaluation, communication, and modeling.


'''Learning objectives'''

* review communication tools
* understand grading options and displays
* review tracking features
* discuss student expectations and instructor's role in setting course expectations
* participate in communication activities - asynchronous and real-time
* explore grading options and setting in own course
* discuss evaluating student participation and performance 


== Introduction ==

Hold high but realistic expectations for your students.

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Research has shown that a teacher's expectations have a powerful effect on a student's performance. If you act as though you expect your students to be motivated, hardworking, and interested in the course, they are more likely to be so.

Set realistic expectations for students when you make assignments, give presentations, conduct discussions, and grade examinations. &quot;Realistic&quot; in this context means that your standards are high enough to motivate students to do their best work but not so high that students will inevitably be frustrated in trying to meet those expectations. To develop the drive to achieve, students need to believe that achievement is possible -which means that you need to provide early opportunities for success.

&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;from Motivating Students http://web.archive.org/20040318050323/honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/motiv.htm &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;


===== Students say... =====

* I learned that online groups can actually work pretty well using discussion board. I think since you can see who's participating on the discussion board, everyone feels the need to participate in some way.


== Learning Support ==

There are a number of ways to communicate your expectations to students. Anything web-based will help. Students appreciate having online access to the course syllabus, assignment information, grading criteria. While they may not actually read the information, at least they have access to it if the need arises.

=== Grading Rubrics ===

Rubrics or explicit descriptions of grading criteria help students determine what is expected of them for a particular assignment, and can determine if they have adequately fulfilled the requirements. Rubrics take the guess work out of the assignment definition and grading process. Publishing the rubric along with the assignment helps set expectations.

=== Discussion Participation ===

Defining requirements for discussion participation is important.

* counting posts - &quot;I agree&quot; doesn't count
* grading a few individual posts as mini essays
* checking for critical thinking in reply to a prompt 

=== Required Regular / Frequent Access to the Course ===

Asynchronous discussion is one of the important technology-supported learning activities. To be effective, students must participate regularly and often. Requiring frequent access is essential to keep discussions moving and to ensure that all student contribute.

There is a tendency for students to assume that &quot;anytime, anywhere&quot; assignments means the 20 minutes before the due time and date. Establishing guidelines for participation frequency is key to successful discussion.

=== Academic Integrity ===

I ask students to find sites that address academic integrity and discuss their findings. Here is an example.

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;http://www.lib.umich.edu/acadintegrity/students/index.htm 
&lt;BR&gt;
This website gives a range of plagiarism by dividing the academic dishonesty into four categories of fraud, patchwriting, failure to cite, and failure to quote. These four actions fall under three branches of consciousness of plagiarizing, which include intentional, unintentional, and non-attribution. It can occur because of lack of understanding or inexperience with citations and sources.
&lt;BR&gt;
I think that academic integrity is an issue at any school, especially with up to date technology. I think that DeAnza's distance learning and switching questions on different quizzes is the right step in preventing academic dishonesty.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

== Teaching and Learning ==

Online presentation and course navigation contribute to students' success. Students need to be able to locate information and understand how it relates to them. Help students by describing your expectations and placing them where students will access them.

=== @ONE Scholars Research in Instructional Technology ===

The @ONE Scholars Program is a fellowship for California Community College (CCC) faculty to conduct research on the impact of instructional technology on student learning in their own classrooms. Faculty members study the characteristics of their students, their own changes in pedagogical practices using technology, and changes in student learning in technology-enhanced learning environments.
http://www.cccone.org/scholars/index.htm

=== Course Settings ===

Appearance is important. Students are sophisticated consumers of tech-based presentation. The general &quot;look&quot; - background colors, font, icons, ... are all controlled by the Theme for the course. Even within the same course management system, if individual courses are set to different themes, they may look a lot different. This may be desirable as it allows students to tell courses apart at a glance and keeps them from being confused. Some organizations want to &quot;brand&quot; their courses so they can be easily identified by their &quot;look&quot; and consistent layout reduces the student &quot;learning curve.&quot;

Catalyst - In the Settings page, near the bottom, is a pull down menu for Force theme - you can change that and your whole course automatically looks different. I use chameleon for CIS 2 and orangewhite for something else I'm working on. The option &quot;do not force&quot; is the plain mostly white theme.

Note - You can only change your settings in catalystdev, not the live server. However, settings in your Master course on the development system will be copied along with the rest of your course to the live course.

=== Hybrid courses ===

In &quot;hybrid&quot; classes, a significant amount of the course learning activity has been moved online, making it possible to reduce the amount of time spent in the classroom. Traditional face-to-face instruction is reduced but not eliminated.
http://www4.uwm.edu/ltc/hybrid/index.cfm

Ten Questions to consider when redesigning a course for hybrid teaching and learning
http://www4.uwm.edu/ltc/hybrid/faculty_resources/questions.cfm

=== Tracking Students ===

Tracking student participation is made easy. Tracking access to course content, responses to quiz questions, discussion participation, grade point totals - all are readily available for viewing and analysis.

* attendance - not logging in for 10 days &quot;counts&quot; as 3 or more unexcused absences
* log of messages to students - record of conversation
* quiz response report - are students understanding the concepts that this question test? Should the questions be changed? Should the teaching be changed? 

=== Students have expectations too... ===

Are YOU and your course meeting your students' expectations? Do you know what students are expecting from a technology enhanced instructor? Ask them. Including frequent surveys or critical thinking assignments that ask students about their own learn experience in your course environment are wonderful sources of information and insight. You are not required to act on their suggestions, as some may not be practical or support your course objectives, but some are really useful.

'''7. Diverse Talents and Ways of Learning'''

The seventh and final principle concerns '''Diverse talents and ways of learning'''. Learning styles, modality, cultural influence all play significant roles in the differences in students within a class.

One of the most exciting aspects of technology enhanced instruction is the ability to provide learning experiences that acknowledge and encourage this diversity, in ways that are not practical, or even possible, in traditional classroom teaching.


'''Learning objectives'''

* review learning styles, learning modality, cultural differences
* discuss impact of technology and learning styles
* plan and add activities to own course to address learning modality differences
* discuss implications for student / instructor learning style differences 


== Introduction ==

Accommodating many different talents and ways of learning can benefit from the application of technology. Multimedia, self-paced work, repetition of practice quizzes are supported. Providing opportunities to see, hear and read course material is facilitated within a course management system.

We looked at learning styles and modality in earlier modules. Cultural influence is another factor in how students learn.

===== Students say... =====

* I tried out the low vision simulation, which lets you experience a web page through various vision related disabilities, such as Macular degeneration, cataracts, and Glaucoma. The simulation definitely gave me a better understanding of the problems faced by computer users with vision disabilities. Web designers must consider who their audience are and accommodate to them because if they are trying to sell something, the audience must be able to read it or else they will give up and go to another website. The strategies for access friendly websites gives a different perspective of how you design the website. You need to consider where you put the information, how you put the information, and the colors you choose. It needs to be usable and readable.

* After posting each other's AIM screen names on the board, we mobilized and got to chat with each other pretty quickly in the chatroom, seeing that all of us are on AIM every time we are on the computer, and that makes talking to each other very convenient and easy. ... Although it would have been more efficient and fun to speak to each other face-to-face, the fact that we had a chance to collaborate outside our individual spheres was effective.

* Even though getting all the members to meet on AIM at the same time is hard, I personally think it is the best way to communicate, since the response time is instant, and ideas may flow more easily within the group.


== Learning Support ==

One big advantage of using technology is instructional reproducibility - the delivery will be the same every time. Over time, the lessons, the activities, the media can be built and improved on. It is possible to offer the same material in multiple formats to capitalize on many ways of learning.

=== Adaptive Technology ===

DeAnza provides support to individuals with disabilities through a broad range to resources to help them through education and training. People with disabilities are able to participate more fully in work and careers through the use of Adaptive Technology. Here are some websites with good information on Adaptive Technology.

* AbilityHub http://www.abilityhub.com
* Abledata http://www.abledata.com/
* Indiana University also has a site with a lot of information http://www.indiana.edu/~iuadapts/sitemap.html
* High Tech Center Training Unit of the California Community Colleges http://www.htctu.fhda.edu/ 

=== Chat ===

Students are likely more comfortable with Chat than instructors are. Encouraging students to use chat for collaboration gives them the opportunity to communicate quickly and resolve issues in real-time, without the delays that are introduced in the asynchronous discussions. If students use the Chat function within Catalyst, a record if kept. However, students use AIM for their personal communication and often conduct these discussions outside the Catalyst system.

Some students may not be available for the Chat time, so allowances must be made for this situation as well.


== Teaching and Learning ==

Students teaching themselves and other students reinforces student learning. Our students are amazingly talented, and encouraging them to contribute to the overall course benefits everyone.

=== Learning Styles ===

Getting students to think about their learning styles and how they relate to others is important. Even if the quizzes are somewhat accurate, they help students understand that there are several key variations and being sensitive to these makes for better communication.

=== Students' English Language Skills ===

As more of technology enhancement of the course teaching and learning takes place online, there may be few or no on-campus meetings. There is a lot of writing required for a distance learning course. Students' work is expected to demonstrate college-level research, analysis, writing and paper formatting and will be graded accordingly. Students' English language skills must be at a level where they can understand the instructions for the activities and assignments.

Prerequisites or Advisories should be for English Writing 100B and Reading 100 (or Language Arts 100), or English as a Second Language 24 and 72 (or English as a Second Language 4). If students do not meet the prerequisites, they will not be successful in a distance learning course. Please consider this carefully.

=== Students' contribution to course development ===

Students are very generous with their time and their knowledge. Asking students to participate in enhancing or updating course materials can yield some great results. Ask them for feedback about assignments. Include assignments that require research to find new resources to update the course. Include optional or extra credit assignments that encourage students to &quot;teach&quot; something they have learned.

=== You could be the next DeAnza star ===

The DeAnza Media Center is available to help instructors create video or audio to enhance course material. This may be as simple as recording a weekly reading of student work with comments. Some faculty have developed extensive videos to demonstrate medical procedures and practices to prepare students for actual clinical work.

We want the wiki to be THE place to find out about every named lunar landform. Each piece of data is signed or has a reference listed so users can evaluate the quality of the information.
** Our Community: There are three main (=obsessed) contributors including Chuck Wood, a lunar scientist, Mark Tillotson, an engineer and amateur astronomer who has fallen in love with the Moon, and Jim Mosher, a retired physicist. Each has contributed knowledge, hard work and skills, allowing us to create 2055 pages in less than 2 months. Amateur astronomers and professional lunar scientists use and contribute to The-Moon.
** Our Experience with Wikispaces: Wikispaces is a very easy to use tool. We created computer programs to harvest information from sources across the Internet, and then used the Wikispaces template feature to create pages. We did have to add each page by hand, and also hundreds of images - how we wish there were bulk uploads and global editing (for use as we discover new data sources)! Wood has two other Wikispaces sites (including a private one for study of Titan data from the Cassini spacecraft) and will use a new Wikispaces site as a classroom for an online course this fall on education about the Moon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Learn Assembly? ==

Assembly is the most primitive tool in the programmers toolbox. Entire software projects can be written without ever once looking at a single line of assembly code. So the question arises: why learn assembly? Assembly language is the closest form of communication that humans can engage in with a computer. Using assembly, the programmer can precisely track the flow of data and execution in a program. Also, another benefit to learning assembly, is that once a program has been compiled, it is difficult--if not impossible--to decompile the code. That means that if you want to examine a program that is already compiled, you will need to examine it in assembly language. Debuggers also will frequently only show the program code in assembly language. If nothing else, it can be beneficial to learn to read assembly language, if not write it. 

Assembly language is also the preferred tool, if not the only tool available for implementing some low-level tasks, such as bootloaders, and low-level kernel components. Code written in assembly has less overhead than code written in high-level languages, so assembly code frequently will run much faster than programs written in other languages. Code that is written in a high-level language can be compiled into assembly, and &quot;hand optimized&quot; to squeeze every last bit of speed out of a section of code. As hardware manufacturers such as Intel and AMD add new features and new instructions to their processors, often times the only way to access those features is to use assembly routines. That is, at least until the major compiler vendors add support for those features.

Developing a program in assembly can be a very time consuming process, however. While it might not be a good idea to write new projects in assembly language, it is certainly valuable to know a little bit about assembly language anyway.

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book is for those who are learning assembly for the first time, or hoping to optimize their ppc specific code, or even those hoping to learn more about a RISC processor

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Partial Isomorphism==
'''Definition''' (partial isomorphism on relational S-Structures)

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; be relational S-Structures and p be a mapping.  Then p is said to be a ''Partial Isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;'' iff all of the following hold
* dom(p) &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; A and codom(p) &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; B
* for every &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; iff p(&lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;) = p(&lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;).
* for every constant symbol c from S and every a: a = c iff p(a) = c
* for every  n-ary relation symbol R from S and &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;  iff &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p(a_1)&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;p(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; A, &lt;math&gt;b_*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; B.

'''Remark'''

* I.e. a partial Isomorphism on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a (plain) Isomprphism on the substructures obtained by choosing dom(p) and codom(p) and 'prune' constants and relations respectively.

'''Example'''

* Let S ={&lt;} be defined over A ={1, 2, 3} and B ={3, 4, 5, 6} the 'usual' way. Then &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; with 1-&gt;3 and 2-&gt;4 is a partial isomorphism (since 1 &lt; 2 and p(1) &lt; p(2)) as well as &lt;math&gt;p_3&lt;/math&gt; with 2-&gt;3 and 3-&gt;6 as well as &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; with 1-&gt;6. Whereas neither &lt;math&gt;p_4&lt;/math&gt; with 1-&gt;6 and 2-&gt;3 (since 1 &lt; 2 but not p(1) &lt; p(2)) nor &lt;math&gt;p_5&lt;/math&gt; with 2-&gt;5 and 3-&gt;5 is a partial isomorphism.

* Let S ={R} with &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{A} =\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)\}&lt;/math&gt; (a 'square') and &lt;math&gt;R^\mathfrak{B} =\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)\}&lt;/math&gt; (a 'binary tree').  A ={1, ..., 4} and B ={1, ..., 5}. Then p: {1, 2, 3} -&gt; {1, 3, 4} with 1-&gt;1, 2-&gt;3, 3-&gt;4 is a partial isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;, since {(1, 2), (2, 3)} becomes {(1, 3), (3, 4)}.  Notice that in case &lt;math&gt;R_\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; contained e.g. (4, 1) additionally, p would not be a partial isomorphism.

* Let S ={&lt;} be defined over A ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and B ={1, 3, 5} in the 'usual' way. Then p with 2-&gt;3 and 4-&gt;5 defines a partial isomorphism.  Notice that e.g. &lt;math&gt;\exists_x( x&lt;4 \and 2&lt;x )&lt;/math&gt; holds on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\exists_x( x&lt;p(4) \and p(2)&lt;x )&lt;/math&gt; does not hold on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;. I.e. in general the validity of sentences with quantifiers is not preserved.  So in order to preserve this validity we need sth stronger than partial isomorphism.  That is mainly what the Ehrenfeucht-games will provide us with.

==Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games==
'''Definition'''

Suppose that we are given two structures &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;, each with no function symbols and the same set of relation symbols, and a fixed natural number n.

Then an Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game is a game with the subsequent properties:
* Elements
** a position is a pair of sequences α and β, both of length i, i &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; 0, ..., n
** the starting position is the pair of empty sequences (i = 0)
** the game is finished iff α and β are both of size n
** the players are the 'spoiler' S and the 'duplicator' D
* Moves
** moves are carried out alternatingly
** S moves first
** S chooses exactly one element of either A or B that has not been chosen already (latter is not relevant in the first move)
** D chooses exactly one element of the other set, i.e. if S has chosen from A then D has to choose from B and if S chose one from B then D has to choose from A.
* Winning &amp; Information
** D wins iff the final position defines a partial isomorphism by mapping the i-th elements of α and β, for all i.
** else S wins
** both players know both of the structures completely and also know about all the moves played previously


'''Remark'''

* notice that above constants are not mentioned (yet)


'''Example''' 

* Let A ={1, 2, 3}, B ={1, 2}, S ={ &lt; }, where '&lt;' is defined the 'usual' way.  Here player S can win by playing 2 in the first move and playing the second move corresponding to D's first move in the following way: to 1 he responds 1 and in case of 2 his answer is 3.  In both cases D can not follow.  He may have isomorphic structures e.g. {2, 3} and {1, 2} but the mapping defined by the sequence of moves is twisted, i.e. it maps 2 to 2 (1st move) and 3 to 1 and thus is not a partial isomorphism.

* Let A ={1, 2, ..., 9}, B ={1, 2, ..., 8}, S ={ &lt; }, where '&lt;' is defined the 'usual' way.  So, what is the best way to play for S? In case S picks 1 from A, D picks 1 from B and the game left is mainly the same as before just with 1 element less but also 1 move played already.  But we can make a better deal for the price of one move: by playing 5 in A, D is forced to play 5 (or 4) in B what leaves two possible ways to proceed for S: either playing the {1, 2, 3, 4} vs {1, 2, 3, 4} game what of course would lead to an obvious win for D, or playing the {6, 7, 8, 9} vs {6, 7, 8} game.  Choosing the latter the quickest win for S is 7 - 7, 8 - 8 and finally 9 with a 4 move win.  Since there is no better way to play for both sides S wins if n &gt; 3 for the structures above.

* The result from the above example can be generalised to: For linear orders in an n-move Ehrenfeucht game D has a winning strategy if the size of each of A and B is less or equal 2^n. 

* [[Image:Logic-FMT-EFGame-Strg01.gif|thumb|Caption]] The following is an (popular) illustrative representation of an Ehrenfeucht-game: from the two sequences S has won iff the lines connecting matching letters cross (if D can find a match at all), e.g. S wins after three moves:

==Quantifier Rank==
'''Definition'''

The function qr(φ) is said to be the Quantifier Ranking of φ iff
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\varphi) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, for φ atomic
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\varphi_1 \land \varphi_2) = qr(\varphi_1 \lor \varphi_2) = max(qr(\varphi_1), qr(\varphi_2))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\lnot \varphi) = qr(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;qr(\forall \varphi) = qr(\exists \varphi) = qr(\varphi)+1&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark'''

* qr(φ) describes the 'depth of quantifier nesting' of φ.
* We write FO[k] for all Formulas of Quantifier Rank up to k.
* Notice that in prenex normal form the Quantifier Rank of φ is exactly the number of quantifiers appearing in φ.

'''Example'''

* The sentence &lt;math&gt;\forall_x ( \exists_y ((\lnot x = y) \land x R y ) ) \land ( \exists_y ((\lnot x = z) \land z R x ) ) &lt;/math&gt; has the Quantifier Rank 2.
* The sentence in prenex normal form &lt;math&gt;\forall_x\exists_y\exists_y ((\lnot x = y) \land x R y )  \land ( (\lnot x = z) \land z R x ) &lt;/math&gt; has the Quantifier Rank 3.  Notice that it is equivalent to the above.

...

==Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Theorem==

'''Theorem'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; be two structures in a relational vocabulary.  Then the following are equivalent

* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; agree on FO[k]  
* &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}\equiv_k \mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark'''

* The proof is omitted here
* The concept of back and forth relations is not mentioned here, since we do not need it subsequently

==Expressibility Proofs employing Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games==
The basis for considering expressibility by Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-Games is given by the following corollary from the above theorem:

'''Corollary''' 

Let P be a property of finite σ-structures.  Then the following are equivalent

* P is not expressible in FO
* for every k &lt;math&gt;\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; there exist two finite σ-structures &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}_k&lt;/math&gt;, such that the following are both satisfied
** &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}_k\equiv_k \mathfrak{B}_k&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}_k&lt;/math&gt; has P and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}_k&lt;/math&gt; does not have P

'''Example'''

* To begin pick two linear orders say A ={1, 2, 3, 4} and B ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.  For a two-move Ehrenfeucht game D is to win, obviously.  This gives us two structures that satisfy the above conditions for k = 2 and the Property having even cardinality (that A has and B doesn't).  Now we have to expand this over all k &lt;math&gt;\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. From the above example we adopt that in a linear order of cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; or higher D has a winning strategy.  Thus we choose the cardinalities depending on k as |A| = &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; and |B| = &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt;+1.  So we have found an even A and an odd B for every k, where D has a winning strategy.  Thus (by the corollary) having even/odd cardinality is a property that can not be expressed in FO for finite σ-structures of linear order.
* Graphs in general are a popular object of interest for FO expressibility.  So e.g. it can be shown that the following properties can't be defined in FO:
**Connectivity
**Cyclicity
**Planarity
**Hamiltonicity
**n-colorability
**etc

'''Armenian cuisine''' is the cuisine of Armenia or of the Armenians in the Armenian Diaspora. Given the geography and history of Armenia, Armenian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the Mediterranean and the Caucasus, with strong influences from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and, to a lesser extent, from the Balkans. It is also to note that Armenians themselves have greatly influenced the culinary traditions of nearby countries or cities, such as Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;[ My kind of town: Aleppo http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/main.jhtml?xml=/travel/2007/05/20/etmyaleppo120.xml]&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation of a large number of meat, fish and vegetable dishes in the Armenian kitchen requires stuffing, frothing and pureeing.&lt;ref&gt;Pokhlebkin, V.

== Forward Error Correction ==

{{Wikipedia|Forward error correction}}

If we are sending data through an unreliable communications channel, it is frequently a good idea to provide some mechanism to correct data that has been received in error. Incorporating redundancy into your packet, in order to detect and possibly correct errors in the data is known as '''forward error correction''' (FEC).

== Forms of FEC ==

There are many forms of FEC. Some of the most simple are repitition codes where the data is replicated and transmitted multiple times. If the information does not match between the repititions, the value that has been received most commonly is selected as the &quot;correct&quot; version. 

More advanced forms of FEC are block codes and hamming codes. We will discuss all these things later.

== Parity ==

Parity is not strictly an FEC technique, but it's one that we will reference frequently. In a parity situation, an extra bit is appended to the data to detect simple errors. There are two types of parity: even and odd parity.

;Even parity:Even parity counts the number of 1's in the data. If there is an odd number of 1's the parity bit is 1. Otherwise, the parity bit is 0.
;Odd parity:Odd parity counts the number of 1's in the data. If there is an even number of 1's, the parity bit is 1. Otherwise it is zero.

Parity can detect when a single bit is in error, but it cannot determine which bit is wrong. Also, parity cannot detect errors in multiple bits. If two bits, 4 bits, or 6 bits are in error, the parity will indicate that the data is correct.

== FEC Limitations ==

Just as parity can only account for situations with up to 1 error, various FEC codes are designed for other situations. FEC codes can detect one number of errors, and can correct another number. For instance, a particular code could detect up to 3 errors, but only be able to correct up to 1 error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost as important as learning how to [[../Tuning the Guitar/|tune your guitar]] is learning how to tune your ear. Most people do not have &quot;perfect pitch&quot;, which is an umbrella term for anyone who is really accurate at determining or singing notes. Although you can naturally be more or less inclined to hear correct pitches, this is a skill that can be learned, and there are several ways of learning it. However, the truth of the matter is that no one is absolutely &quot;perfect&quot; when it comes to pitch, and indeed, many songs you listen to could be deliberately composed slightly sharp or flat.

Some guitar players prefer their instruments not to be exactly tuned, because it gives some extra texture. Tuning the thinner strings slightly sharp can make chords sound brighter, while tuning thicker strings down slightly can give chords some &quot;bite&quot;. Another important reason to learn to tune your ear is that one day you will sit down to jam with someone, and have no tuner available, and you will be forced to tune to one another. This is especially true if you have a band, and you are playing live shows; being able to quickly adjust your instrument can be the difference between a great performance and a terrible one.

==Using a Human Voice==

If you are in a band, and you have a singer that can never quite hit those notes perfectly, sometimes it is easier to retune your guitar rather than try to retune the singer. Learning to tune your strings to a note someone is singing is a valuable skill, and is surprisingly similar to other regular tuning methods, especially if you can tune to a piano.

First the singer should sing a note, preferably an A or an E, and in the most comfortable range of their singing voice. If they can sing high notes, or different notes on command, it is sometimes easiest to tune each string to the singer, and then quickly do some fine adjustments to make sure the guitar strings are consistent.

==Using Dissonance==

Players that have been playing for a long time begin to learn what a chord or interval is &quot;supposed&quot; to sound like. Sometimes this is because a favourite song starts with this chord, or because they always play a particular chord type (like a power chord, major barre chord, etc.).

With this method of tuning, you simply play the appropriate chord, and then adjust your strings until it sounds &quot;right&quot;. For example, switching into [[Guitar/Alternate Tunings|Drop D tuning]] is often easy for many people, because the open [[Guitar/Double-stops and Power Chords|power chord]] has a certain tone when it is properly tuned. Power chords are especially easy to tell when they are out of tune, because they contain only two notes. 

===Chords for Tuning===

These are some common chords that players use to tell if their guitar is properly tuned.

The power chord is a useful tool in tuning as well as it mimics the natural overtone series of the guitar. Playing a note and a fifth above it, on a piano for example, will allow you to more precisely tune your instrument.

== Repetition Codes ==

Repetition codes are not special &quot;codes&quot; so much as they are tricks to try to reduce the error rate. In a repetition code, data is transmitted multiple times, verbatim. The receiver reads enough of these repeats until a clear consensus emerges as to the value of the message. 

Perhaps the most popular repetition code is &quot;triple modular redundancy&quot;, sending the same message 3 times.

To send ''n'' data bits with ''k'' repetitions, ''nk'' bits need to be transmitted.

Other, more complicated codes can detect and correct occasional single-bit errors with much less overhead, giving a higher goodput data rate through the same channel.

== Example ==

Let's say we have a repeated message of 3 bits that is sent 3 times. When it is received, each message is different:

*101
*001
*100
Because we didn't receive exactly the same message all 3 times, we have detected that some errors occurred.

We can see that the middle bit is almost certainly a 0, because it is the same in all messages. We can also see that the first and the last digit are likely to be a 1 because 2 out of 3 of the messages say that these values are 1. The transmitted message then was most likely 101.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Students say...'''

I ask students for their suggestions for improving the course and the learning experience. These comments just amaze me. I couldn't write this stuff...


=== Managing the Catalyst main course page display ===

One thing about Catalyst that may help a student feel less overwhelmed by the mass of information on each page is that, like this class, when the modules are divided up, you can click the little square box in the top right corner of each module section to isolate one module at a time. This makes the page a little less cluttered and easier to navigate.

If a class has a variety of assignments and activities, such as survey questions, quizzes, discussions, etc., it helps to recognize the icon that's associated with each. By using the links on the lefthand side of the main page for your class, you can look at all the quizzes for the class at once, instead of module-by-module. This allows you to make sure you've fulfilled all the types of activities assigned for the class. -- Stephanie Y, M07

=== Discussions for critical thinking ===

I honestly think that all these discussions force students to think critically rather than fill in bubbles on a multiple choice and forgetting the material as soon as the exam is over. And when we practice to facilitate a discussion and introduce new ideas, then will we truly learn and understand the material. The various mix and matches of different assignments for each week is a great strategy to engage students with the course material. I couldn't have thought of a more innovative strategy to educate students online. -- Rambo S, M07

Some of the responses I read to certain topics just blew me away and made me really analyze the topic in detail. I discovered how creative my peers can be. Their insights really helped me understand certain issues from another perspective. -- Rhea W, M07

=== Podcasts Add a Personal Touch ===

I think it would be beneficial for you (Professor Taylor) to create podcasts that explain project assignments since there are a lot of students that have questions about them. Plus, the students will be able to feel more connected to you by hearing your voice. My EWRT2 distance learning professor used podcasts to explain essays and also included visuals (thanks to iTunes' video feature!). In general, this class suits my learning style well -- I'm a multimodal Visual, Auditory, and Read/write learner. Including videos, reading, research, and group projects makes the course fun and dynamic. -- Katherine S, M07

=== Simulations Provide Learning Experiences ===

I really liked the links [to simulations of] disabilities and what the consequences are. I think more interactive simulations such as the ones on those sites would help me learn more about Computers and Society. That way, I can learn the material through experience rather than just reading a bunch of information from a textbook and websites. -- Lucy L, M07

=== Problem Posting A Web Address in Assignment Text ===

The game can be found at: http://jayisgames .com/ archives/2006/03/ word_sandwich.php
I had to insert random spaces into the web address because it wouldn't show on the assignment submission otherwise. -- Sarina Y, M07

Try putting some text in the line before the web address so that the web address is not the first text in the assignment submission text.

Use the actual HTML &lt;A HREF=... tag with text like &quot;click here&quot; to insert a link to a web address.

Leave off the http:// part of the web address.

Put &lt; and &gt; around the web address

=== Controlling Discussion Subscriptions ===

One thing about Catalyst is that it gives you the option of subscribing to forums so that you can get an e-mail for every new post in that forum. If for some reason you change your mind and want to switch your subscription option to Yes/No, an easy way to do it is to go to the left column on the homepage, and under &quot;Activities&quot; click &quot;Forums.&quot; Listed are the different forums and discussions, and on the right side under the heading &quot;Subscribed&quot; you can change your option to Yes/No. -- Kevin S, M07

You can change the default for yourself for all forums. From the left navigation menu, select Edit Profile. Find the option Forum auto-subscribe: and select No: don't automatically subscribe me to forums. You can subscribe to any forum or topic individually even if you set the default to no automatic subscriptions.

=== Accessibility Issues ===

Simulations :
AbilityHub http://www.abilityhub.com
Abledata http://www.abledata.com/
Indiana University
http://www.indiana.edu/~iuadapts/sitemap.html

I tried out the dyslexia simulation. It required you to read two short paragraphs. Easy, right? Wrong. The paragraphs were formatted in the way a dyslexic would read it. It was immensely difficult to comprehend because letters were switched, turned upside down, transposed, and more. With these handicaps, I am impressed at how much harder dyslexics must try in order to comprehend anything on the web. I'm glad the end of the simulation gave tips for how to create dyslexic-friendly websites. -- Katrina T, M07

I tried out the Distractibility Simulation and it did work on my computer. It was incredibly hard to finish off the tasks as well as move the little man on the bottom of the screen. If that is representative of the problems faced by computer users with vision disabilities, then I sympathize with them and realize how we take so much of these opportunities to go online for granted. I understand now how difficult it must be for certain people who are distracted easily to get tasks done on the computer. -- Jasmine G, M07

I tried out the low vision simulation, which lets you experience a web page through various vision related disabilities, such as Macular degeneration, cataracts, and Glaucoma. The simulation definitely gave me a better understanding of the problems faced by computer users with vision disabilities. Web designers must consider who their audience are and accommodate to them because if they are trying to sell something, the audience must be able to read it or else they will give up and go to another website. The strategies for access friendly websites gives a different perspective of how you design the website. You need to consider where you put the information, how you put the information, and the colors you choose. It needs to be usable and readable. -- Francesca W, M07

=== Online Collaborative Writing (WIKI) Group Project ===

I am really happy to be in my group that we work together as a team, help each other, understand our strengths and weaknesses. For example, I let my group acknowledge that I am not familiar with computers and group online, so I need them to remind if I make mistakes. In addition, they would always be there for me, such as posting their suggestions or thoughts. I am proud to say that our group was able to work together to produce a good report. -- N-C T, M07

I think the thing that I will remember most is the group work. It was something that I did not expect and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. It was a lot of work though, especially in the beginning when I was not used to it. -- Andrew N, M07

There are problems with two people trying to edit the same wiki page at the same time (content locking isn't active ..vt).

=== Peer Reviews ===

assignments that ask us to comment on our peersï¿½ work really does help you get to know each other. After a while, you tend to remember certain people, such as those who post their work the earliest, or those who respond to your work the most often, or who is more interested in what topic. In its subtle way, the assignments for this class have allowed me to get to know more students -- Odelia L, M07

=== Time Management ===

One thing that I was worried about was time management. I finished most of my assignments on time except for a few. If I was to retake this class again, I think I would start on all my assignments earlier. -- Yee Y, M07

If I wasn't committed to the course I would have never been able to have a successful experience with online distance learning. If there is anything that I wish I could have done differently throughout the quarter it would be to have completed the assignments earlier. Sometimes I feel that I didn't do as much as I could during the week and thus I would spend my whole weekend finishing up assignments. My time management skills are not the best that they can be, but I am constantly working hard to manage my time more wisely. -- Rhea W, M07

=== Meeting Other Students and Making Friends in an Online Course ===

I have met wonderful people in my group. I am so glad that I took this class because I not only learned about how computers affect people but I also learned about people themselves. It's interesting that a class on technology can help people associate with other people and for that, I am grateful. -- Eugene S, M07

=== Succeeding in Online Courses ===

I learned more about my own learning style. After taking two online courses this summer, I do not think I will even take another online course again. It may be convenient, but it is extremely time consuming. I’d rather take a class in a formal classroom environment. If I were to do one thing differently this quarter, I would probably try to do as much work as I can throughout the week rather than waiting till the last minute. I tended to procrastinate a lot with the work in this class. However, I found out that I work well under pressure. Having a deadline approaching initiates a spark on me to work very efficiently. -- Jennifer G, M07

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Topics'''


'''Advanced topics''' are those that are beyond the scope of the Technology to Support Student Learning &amp; Retention (TSSLR) course, but are of interest to participants who have a technical background and/or are experienced users of instructional technology.

=== Revisiting Teaching and Learning Issues ===

Discussed briefly in the introduction to Teaching and Learning in module 1. Student-faculty contact, it is worth revisiting Teaching and Learning issues in the Advanced Topics section.

A recent EDUCAUSE article, Top-Ten Teaching and Learning Issues, 2007 identifies a number of issues applicable to this course - assessment and best instructional practices, changes in student, faculty, and institutional expectations, collaboration, work together, ethics, privacy, and data stewardship. http://www.educause.edu/apps/eq/eqm07/eqm0732.asp?bhcp=1

This big-picture overview of teaching and learning is helpful, and demonstrates the need for all instructors, particularly those in higher education, to acquire instructional technology literacy.

Are these the important issues in your teaching practice? Are the issues being addressed by the administration? What responsibilities fall to the individual instructors?

=== Catalyst / Moodle Groups function ===

The Module 2 group activity questions assume that you will augment your in-class group activities with some of the basic Catalyst functions - discussions, chat, messaging, choice for students to select topics or groups.

The subject of the Catalyst / Moodle Groups function came up. This is an &quot;advanced&quot; topic which is beyond the scope of this TEI course. However, the Groups function is available, and, as there is interest, it needs to be addressed.

I thought there would plenty of good documentation about the Groups function available at moodle.org. I would just reference a couple of good sources and it would be covered, right? Well, there are resources, and you are welcome to poke around through them. However, they aren't what I was hoping for - a nice summary of group use and an overview of selecting among the options provided.

* Groups FAQ - MoodleDocs http://docs.moodle.org/en/Groups_FAQ -- lots of questions and answers, some general overview, others more complex

* Groups - MoodleDocs The Groups feature allows a teacher to assign teachers and students to a group within a course. Participants in a course can belong to more than one group ... http://docs.moodle.org/en/Groups -- instructions for setting up groups

* Using Moodle: Groups You may wish to browse and/or contribute to Moodle Docs Groups. .... Have you solutions to these drawbacks of moodle groups please? ... http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=1490 -- discussion forum - enter as guest - whole discussion on groups with people asking and answering specific questions

* Using Moodle: Thinking Through Groups Here are some comments and observations about the &quot;Groups&quot; interface (where an instructor can put participants in distinct groups) and other group-related ... http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=63054 -- discussion forum - just enter as a guest ok to see comments - more talking about the function than how students and instructors use it, but it might answer some of your questions 

Do any of these give you a good general understanding of the Moodle Groups function? Do these answer your questions?

If you find other resources that are good ones, please pass them along.

=== CCC Confer ===

The CCC Confer project, funded from a grant from the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office, offers a viable means to meet and collaborate at a distance. CCC Confer, powered by HorizonLive Web conferencing technology, is available to all staff, faculty and administrators in the California Community Colleges system. It is ADA and Section 508 accessible.

=== Information competency ===

Information Competency is defined as the ability to recognize the need for information, and to identify, locate, validate, and effectively use that information for the issue or problem at hand. How would you determine if someone is &quot;information competent&quot;?

One student responded: I would determine if someone is &quot;information competent&quot; by assessing his or her problem-solving skills. I would give them situations to think about or maybe put them in situations where their &quot;competence&quot; can be measured. Someone is &quot;information competent&quot; if he or she can acknowledge the problem at hand and ask questions, research information, follow up on new discoveries, and then make a decision. The person must have good deductive skills and focus on what needs to be found or solved in order to make the process of locating and using the information the most efficient.

=== No wrong answers ===

Offering students a multiple choice question with no wrong answers followed by the opportunity to explain their selection, allows students to demonstrate critical thinking, analysis, perhaps some research, and logical explanation skills. They have to make a case for their selection over the other choices.

=== Video Games ===

“No Gamer Left Behind” - video games are in fact used to educate high school and college-level students. Even though most educational games are stereotypically for children and toddlers, video games are used to simulate tasks and goals in different types of careers.
http://www.edutopia.org/no-gamer-left-behind

This video initially features a technical high school in which computer programming is a huge part of the curriculum. For one of the projects, the students had to create games that provided information on safety by simulating scenes that involved fire and power outages. Next, the video showed how games simulated an operation for medical students or even building for architects. So video games aren’t just for brain dead fun, but can be used to teach and for others to learn. -- Collin Y, m07

Assessment: Student Portfolios

A student portfolio is a collection of products and processes selected and organized to highlight specific aspects of the portfolio creator and his or her work. What goes into the portfolio depends on its purpose and usually includes reflection on the materials included and the portfolio as a whole. Portfolios may be required for a course, a major, or a career goal. Electronic portfolios may contain photos, graphics, videos, written narratives and hypertext links to organize the material.

The links provide information on portfolio development and examples of student portfolios. The links in the section on electronic portfolios could prove useful to students as they develop their own portfolios.

NLIEE Report on the Use of ePortfolios in Higher Education

This white-paper is an overview of ePortfolio implementation. Three types of e-portfolios are described in this report: student e-portfolios, teaching e-portfolios, and institutional e-portfolios. E-portfolios can support student advisement, career preparation, and credential documentation; the sharing of teaching philosophies and practices; department and program self-studies; and institutional and program accreditation processes. This report defines and categorizes e-portfolios, offers examples of higher education e-portfolio implementations, reviews e-portfolio technology, and addresses adoption issues.

      <comment>/* Recording Environment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">So you've been practicing and practicing, and finally, you're ready to record your first demo. But where to begin? Should you go to a professional studio, or just try to do it yourself at home? What kind of equipment and software will you need? Although everyone talks like they could write and record an entire album in a weekend, recording is a surprisingly tricky and detailed job. Remember that professionals go to school to learn how to record musicians.

This page is a guide for musicians that already have their own songs and are ready to record them. It will cover the basics of the recording process, what to expect with a professional studio, and outline an ideal home recording setup.

[[Image:Recording-studio_control-room.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A control room with a mixing console, monitor speakers, and a computer based Digital Audio Workstation.]]

==What Gets Recorded When==
Drums: Generally speaking, it's a good idea to record the drums and percussion first. This will help all the other recording musicians follow the right beat, instead of the drummer having to follow the other off-beat musicians.

Bass: Should be recorded second, as it's the middle ground between the basic beat of the drums and the chords of the rhythm guitar.

Rhythm Guitar: Gets recorded third, as it's the foundation for the lead guitar.

Lead Guitar: Follows the rhythm guitar, and will give direction to some of the vocalist's melodies.

Vocals: Very last, as the vocalist will be able to wrap melodies around the bass and rhythm guitar's chords, and the lead guitarist's soloing melodies. Vocals are sometimes recorded as a &quot;guide track&quot; to help the other musicians &quot;feel&quot; their way and then at the final stage is replaced with a more focused performance.

All in this order, of course, assuming you don't have the space and tools to make a live recording.

==Mixing==
When it comes to mixing volume levels and other audio dynamics, one needs to take several things into consideration. First, which instruments should be heard the most? In a guitar-focused rock band, one may want to give the lead or rhythm guitar more prominence. In funk or dance music, the bass may want to be given more space. However, certain instruments may also need more focus at different times in the song. If there is a banjo playing in the background in a rock song, but it eventually gets a solo part, one may want to increase the volume at the point of the solo.

The second thing to consider is special effects and left-right panning. Should the guitar be given a delay effect at some parts? Perhaps the bass may need a flange effect, or backing vocals should pan from left to right during the bridge?

Another important thing to keep in mind is the master volume level. At no point in your song should the listener need to abruptly turn down the volume for fear of breaking his/her speakers!

==Professional Studio==

Although you have more &quot;creative control&quot; in a personal setting, having professional sound technicians taking care of the recording make things much, much easier.


==Personal Studio==

Based on your budget and space available, your home recording studio layout and design will vary. What really affects your home studio is the type of instrumentation you intend to record. For a guitarist, you could use a computer, audio interface, amplifier, guitar and a dynamic mic. For more advanced music composition, you could add a hardware mixer, keyboards, drum machines, variety of different microphones, VST software and percussion instruments. 

Putting together a small studio at home is relatively inexpensive compared to the price of hiring a professional studio. The power of modern computers gives you a huge variety of recording options and the computer has become the centre of home recording and pro studios. Pro studios buy extra audio processing equipment like expensive compressors and outboard effects which will always give them an advantage over home recording but with a modest investment the home studio can produce a recording quality that most people would find acceptable. All professional musicians usually prepare demo versions of their songs before they go into a costly professional studio and this should also apply to your working method.

===Equipment===
[[Image:M-Audio -  Fast Track Pro.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An inexpensive USB external audio interface.]]
* Condenser microphones are generally used for recording acoustic guitars and dynamic microphones are more suitable for putting up close to the amplifier speaker. Try not to buy cheap microphones on the basis that the technology used is simple and therefore a cheap microphone will match a microphone like the Shure SM57 (industry standard microphone for recording electric guitar amplifiers and snare drums); the extra cost is reflected in the higher audio quality of your recordings.

* An audio interface is essential for instruments and microphones. Plugging a microphone directly into the computer's microphone input or a guitar into the line-in input produces poor quality results due to the fact that a computer's soundcard and microphone/line inputs are generally not intended for serious recording projects. Audio interfaces can be an external box using USB or Firewire or an internal PCI card with break-out jacks. 

* The PC you use determines the amount of tracks you can record. A laptop can be useful for portable recording but they rarely match the usefulness of a high specification PC. You should aim for a minimum of 4GB of RAM and the fastest processor that you can afford. Audio recording and playback places a heavy demand on the computer's resources and this can lead to timing errors, glitches and less tracks but this has become less of an issue with multiple processor machines. Recording software usually comes with a &quot;multiple processor&quot; enabled option and you should check for this when choosing between software packages. 

* A good guitar is essential. An entry-level guitar should be replaced with a good quality guitar after a guitarist has mastered open chords and a few scales. This usually means within a year or so from the day they started playing. Guitarists tend to become attached to their first guitar and the danger in this is that the guitar itself hinders the development of higher skills. An entry-level guitar will always sound like an entry-level guitar when recorded. * A good rule is to find out what some of your favorite guitarist plays and play them all through a few different amps. You will then be able to see which feels best to you, and not what the &quot;norm&quot; is. That being said, there is a reason Gibson and Fender are the most popular brands to own. Just remember to find a guitar that you like, and if you like how it plays and sounds, its all up to you.

===Recording Environment===
This is an odd subject. Most studios are specifically designed for sound, and are built to get the best quality sound available. However, some of the most famous albums ever where recorded in buildings that were never designed for music. It all comes down to what sounds good to you. 

That being said, you never want a square/rectangle room to record in. Always try and uses as much sound dampening possible, so that you can get the best quality with what you have. As long as there is no reverb (unless wanted), the recording should be adequate.

===PC or Mac?===
This is more a preference than which is better. Certain people are accustomed to windows, others feel that an Apple is easier to operate. However, most professionals use Macs, but it is not uncommon for some major studios to use PCs.

===Recording Software===
There are many companies that supply music recording software (DAW - Digital Audio Workstation). Professional studios tend to use Pro Tools by Avid. Pro Tools is expensive and usually needs to be run on a computer that is built for editing, and are high performance computers such as a Mac Pro/Alienware, or a custom built PC. However, any basic PC/Mac can run it.

There is a learning curve associated with music software and it will take time before you achieve results that match your expectations. A good example is the virtual mixing desk; one aspect of the software that matches its hardware version down to every detail. On a virtual mixer you can assign auxiliary sends and returns, route audio, set instruments in the stereo field, balance volumes, automate changes and much more.   

All recording software allows you choose a software driver from a multiple list. If you have bought an audio interface and installed the software, then choose that driver to achieve lower latency. Latency is caused by the analogue to digital conversion of the audio signal and by the processing that takes place before it is sent to your audio outs on your virtual mixing desk. This can be quite disconcerting to the guitarist; a sense of striking the string but not hearing the sound until milliseconds later. This is usually overcome by the audio interface offering direct monitoring. This bypasses the software and provides you with a signal that is not processed. This has its drawback in that you cannot use any software effects but these can be applied to your audio track afterwards. 

Here is a list of sound drivers:

MME: early Microsoft driver that still appears as a default in driver drop-down menus. Low performance makes this unsuitable for DAWs.

DX: Microsoft multi-media driver designed for improved graphics and sounds. Offers high latency and is therefore not suitable for DAWs.

WDM: later Microsoft driver that offers improved performance over MME 

ASIO: developed for high performance and low latency. This driver is recommended for DAWs. ASIO is not a Microsoft driver and it is essential to check that the DAW you buy supports the protocol.

==Direct injection==

Direct Injection is one of the most hotly debated decisions when recording the sound of guitar. On one hand, if truly direct (that is, does not goes through any amplifier or effects), the extremely clean signal is a blessing for the audio engineer, as he will now have some thing that can be easily manipulated with any effects.  On the other hand, some people say that there are no rescue for such a clean signal, no matter what effects were inserted.

==Effects to use==
Whether you use direct injection or mikes, using computer or traditional 4-tracks, insert the effect while recording or after the recording, you will need to have some to bring life to the otherwise sterile sound.
*Distortion - what makes electric guitar sound great? Distortion, that's what. When combined with proper amount of compression, the sound will be much smoother.
*Compression - In terms of direct injection, compression of an audio signal can help produce a smooth distortion; this effect also produce a sustain on the sound. 
*Delay/Echo/Reverb - provide a front-back aural dimension
*Stereo chorus - provide left-right aural dimension.

Some DI-boxes that is specifically designed for recording may also have additional circuitry, to help mimic the sound of some certain cabinet and the position of the mike.

Alternatively, if you can get a hold of a Pre-Dunlop era Rockman, it provides all the tools and setup needed to produce some of the best direct-injected recorded Guitar.

==Tips for Recording==
*'''Don't get frustrated!''' - If you can't get something to sound right, just take a break. Go and do something that is not music related and then try again. 

*'''Re-amping''' - If your midi tracks sound a bit lifeless then re-amping can put some &quot;air&quot; into the mix. Play the midi track through your amplifier and record back into the DAW onto a separate track. 

*'''Creating a great guitar solo''' - the professionals may &quot;comp&quot; a solo from many different takes. Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin) and David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) are two guitarists who utilize this method of merging the best sections of alternative takes. 

*'''Backup your projects''' - essential to save and back-up your music projects. Music projects tend to grow quite big as you gain proficiency in developing songs and backing up your work is essential if you don't want to lose earlier takes that you may wish to return to.

== Blender screenshots ==

G'day, where you are presenting a screenshot of Blender-3D, you can license it with this template:
:&lt;code&gt;{{tl|free screenshot-GPL}}&lt;/code&gt;
NB: this is only valid for the software itself, not any artwork shown within that software - but if you did the artwork, you can also add your own license (e.g. &lt;code&gt;{{tl|PD-self}}&lt;/code&gt;). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:39, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:Just to be clear, if the image is a screenshot of ''your'' artwork inside Blender, then you can license it with something like &lt;code&gt;{{tl|PD-self}}&lt;/code&gt; or similar. If it's a screenshot showing parts of the Blender application, e.g. some of the buttons and settings displays, then you should use &lt;code&gt;{{tl|free screenshot-GPL}}&lt;/code&gt;. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:55, 27 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

The '''''Secrecy Sensor''''' is a device that detects certain classes of Dark magic.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] tells us that the Secrecy Sensor can detect &quot;''jinxes, curses, and concealment charms''&quot;, and so are useful for detecting a reasonably wide range of Dark magic. They can be operated by the non-magical; the first time we see one, it is being wielded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], who is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]]. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 15|later says]] that they are useless to detect love potions, because love potions are not Dark magic; and they can be concealed by putting them in perfume bottles, no Concealment charm is necessary.

== Analysis ==

The limitations of Secrecy Sensors seem to be that they can only detect those sorts of magic that are associated with secrecy. Hermione mentions that simply putting love potions in perfume bottles, which disguises their nature, is enough to get them into the school, and that secrecy sensors won't trip because there is no curse, jinx, or concealment charm. 

Hermione suggests that the cursed necklace that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] is carrying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 12|in that book]] would not pass the Secrecy Sensors, but does not have a chance to explain why not. If her statement is accurate, then we must assume that the Sensor would read the existence of the concealed curse on the necklace.

Secrecy Sensors, and their limitations, are an illustration of the way the author thinks through the magical world that she has created. We will learn later of the existence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Probity Probe|Probity Probes]], another way of defeating concealment. If it was possible to reliably detect Dark influence, or the actions of Dark wizards, the story would be significantly weakened; if there is no challenge, there is no story. The author understands that a writer, creating a fictional universe, must give the universe a coherent set of rules, and must keep everything within that rule set; it is unfair to the reader to suddenly unveil a skill that effortlessly wins the battle for the protagonist. So the limitations on the Secrecy Sensor, making it possible to evade its detection, make it more possible to believe in its existence as a part of the Wizarding tool set.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

While we don't know when the mead that poisoned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] came into the school, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] suggests that it had been intended as a Christmas present for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. Filch, as we see at the initial mention of the Secrecy Sensors, is already using them in October, and we suspect will not stop using them between then and Christmas, as their introduction seems to be in reaction to Voldemort's return, rather than being an arbitrary decision of Filch's. It is unknown whether their use extends to the faculty, but it is possible, especially if the decision came from Dumbledore. It is possible that the mead was scanned by one of Filch's Secrecy Sensors as it entered the school, and was passed as clean. Non-magical poison in a mead bottle would be as unlikely to trigger a Sensor as love potion in a perfume bottle, of course, so even if the necklace mentioned above had been found, the mead would not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}
The perfect passive is an easy tense to form in Latin, and it is also one of the most useful. The verb &quot;to love&quot; in the perfect passive would translate into English as &quot;I was loved&quot;.


== Forming the Perfect Passive in Latin ==
In order to form the perfect passive you must be familiar with the principal parts of the verb with which you are working, e.g., ''amo, amāre, amāvī, amātum''. The fourth principal part is the '''perfect passive participle'''.
*In its neuter nominative form, the perfect passive participle is identical to the nominative supine (a fourth-declension noun whose morphology and usage are very restricted). Be careful not to confuse the two.

To use the perfect passive, first determine the gender and number of the subject of the sentence. For example, in the sentence &quot;The queen was killed by the soldier,&quot; ''queen'' is the subject. In Latin, ''queen'' will be feminine nominative singular (''regīna'').

Now make the participle agree with the subject in gender and number (and case), just as you would with any adjective. As a review, the singular endings for the participle, a first/second declension adjective, are:

   Masculine: '''''-us''''' — (''amātus'')
   Feminine: ''''' -a''''' — (''amāta'')
   Neuter: '''''-um''''' — (''amātum'')

The endings for plural nouns are:

   Masculine: '''''-ī''''' — (''amātī'')
   Feminine:  '''''-ae''''' — (''amātae'')
   Neuter: '''''-a''''' — (''amāta'')

These participles by themselves can be translated with &quot;having been&quot;, eg. &lt;i&gt;amatus&lt;/i&gt; = having been loved. Add a present form of ''sum'', and you have the perfect passive, eg. &lt;i&gt;amatus sum&lt;/i&gt; = I am having been loved = I have been loved.

== Conjugation of Verbs in the Perfect Passive ==

=== Notes ===

#Remember that the subject '''must''' agree with the passive participle.
#Passive verbs do not take an object. Instead they have an agent or instrument, indicated by the ablative case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}
&lt;!-- I am by no means an expert on this topic, having only secondary school Latin, so this is most definitely not a definitive article --&gt;.The subjunctive mood has several uses in Latin, the most notable of which are: &lt;ul type =&quot;square&quot;&gt;
                     &lt;li&gt;First Person Exhortations&lt;/li&gt;
                     &lt;li&gt;Purpose Clauses&lt;/li&gt;
                     &lt;li&gt;Result Clauses&lt;/li&gt;
                     &lt;li&gt;Indirect Commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
== First Person Exhortations (Hortatory Subjunctive) ==
=== Definition, Common Usage and Expression in Latin ===
An exhortation is a statement which expresses a wish. In English, the most common exhortation is &quot;let's go&quot;. Other possibilities are &quot;would go&quot;, &quot;should go&quot; and &quot;may go&quot;. In Latin, these statements are equally as often used and are expressed in the present subjunctive active tense.

=== Examples ===
''Festinemus ad forum'' - Let's hurry to the forum

''Roma discedamus'' - Let's leave Rome

''Roma non discedam, nam mea familia ibi vivit.'' - I should not leave Rome, for my family lives there. (Also, &quot;I will not leave&quot; -- the form is ambiguous.)

''Cenemus!'' - Let us dine!

''Cenarem tecum si laborem perficerem&lt;ref&gt;Note that in ''si''... (if...) clauses, the future perfect is often used where the present is in English. &quot;I shall dine with you if I finish my work&quot; would be &quot;I shall dine with you if I shall have finished my work&quot;: ''Tecum cenam si laborem perfecero''.&lt;/ref&gt; - I would dine with you if I should finish my work.

== Purpose Clauses ==
=== Definition, Common Usage and Expression in Latin ===

A purpose clause is a clause which expresses that someone did something in order that something else might happen. In English they usually contain the words '''in order to''' or '''so that'''. In Latin this concept is expressed by the words '''ut''' and '''ne''' followed by a verb in the subjunctive mood. ''Ut'' means &quot;so that&quot; or &quot;in order to&quot; and ''ne'' means &quot;lest.&quot; In purpose clauses, only forms of the imperfect (following the secondary sequence of tenses) and present (for the primary sequence) are used.

=== Examples ===
''Quintus donum Scintillae dedit '''ut eum amaret''''' - Quintus gave Scintilla a gift so that she would love him. (The imperfect subjunctive is used to indicate a &quot;present/future&quot; time relationship with the perfect main verb, with pluperfect being the only other option, indicating a past time relationship).

''Fabius equos domum duxit '''ne tempestate timerentur''''' - Fabius brought the horses home lest they be frightened by the storm.

''Marcus Graeciā fugit '''ut matrem suam Romae inveniret''''' - Marcus fled Greece to find his mother in Rome.

== Result Clauses ==
=== Definition, Common Usage and Expression in Latin ===
Result clauses state that something occurred as a result of something else happening. For a positive result, use ''ut''. For a negative result, use ''ut... non''.

=== Examples ===

''Sextus tam iratus erat ut fratrem interficere vellet'' - Sextus was so angry that he wished to kill his brother.

''Horatia tam laeta erat ut lacrimaret'' - Horatia was so happy that she cried.

''Caesar tam potus erat ut Galliam oppugnare non posset'' - Caesar was so drunk that he couldn't attack Gaul.

''Milo tam defessus erat ut in via dormiret'' - Milo was so tired that he slept on the road.

== Indirect Commands == 
=== Definition, Common Usage and Expression in Latin ===
An indirect command is a statement like the following: &quot;He ordered her to do x&quot;. The English equivalent words are &quot;'''to'''&quot; or &quot;'''that they should'''&quot; It can also take the form of &quot;I am ordering you to do x&quot;, as opposed to the imperative &quot;DO X!&quot;. Several verbs in Latin take the subjunctive mood with indirect commands: &lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rogo, rogare, rogavi, rogatum - to ask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;persuadeo, persuadere, persuasi, persuasum - to persuade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impero, imperare, -imperavi, imperatum - to order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peto, petere petivi, petitum - to seek, ask for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
These verbs use an ut/ne + the subjunctive construction.

=== Examples ===
''Imperator militibus imperavit ut castra caperent'' - The general ordered the soldiers to capture the camp

''Eum rogo ut navem emat'' - I am asking him to buy the ship.

''Mater liberis imperavit ne in horto currerent'' - The mother asked her children not to run in the garden.

==Indirect questions==
===Definition, Common Usage and Expression in Latin===
The subjunctive is used in indirect questions. For example, the question 'What are you doing?' is direct, while &quot;He asked what I was doing&quot; is indirect. In Latin, the verb in the clause containing the indirect question must be in the subjunctive.

===Examples===

''Imperator milites rogat si castra ceperint'' - The general asks the soldiers if they captured the camp.

''Eum rogo quid faciat'' - I am asking him what he is doing.

''Magister pueros rogat utrum laborent an ludant'' - The teacher asks the boys whether they are working or playing.

[[File:Unmodified_and_modified_Ruger_10_22_rifles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ruger 10/22  carbines, before accurizing (top) and after (below).]]

'''Accurizing''' is the process of improving the accuracy of a firearm.  The goal of accurizing is ''consistency''.  If every part of the process of firing can be made as consistent as possible, then the bullet should strike the target as close as possible to the same place every time.  Since most modern firearms are mass produced, and since mass production and interchangeable parts all have some allowance for error, most firearms can gain significant accuracy with some additional work.

Accurizing generally concentrates on three different areas:
*'''Usability''':  Enhancements that give the shooter a more consistent hold on the firearm, and a more consistent trigger pull.
*'''Tolerances''':  Parts that fit together better will shift less or shift more consistently under recoil.  Moving parts still have to move, however, and finding the right compromise is more art than science.
*'''Harmonics''':  Barrels vibrate under the shock of firing.  These vibrations can be minimized or tuned to minimize their impact on accuracy.  Generally the harmonic effects are proportional to the square of the barrel length, and so are generally only of concern in rifles but not handguns.

==Defining accuracy==
[[File:AmmoTestResults.gif|thumb|right|200px|Graph showing the results of an accuracy test using 3 different revolvers and 7 different brands of ammunition.]]
While the question &quot;which of these guns is the most accurate&quot; seems to be a fairly simple one to answer&amp;mdash;just shoot and measure&amp;mdash;defining &quot;what is accurate&quot; is not necessarily an easy task.  For a hunting gun, for example, the first shot fired, from a cold, clean barrel, is often the most important.  Target shooters, on the other hand, care as much about the last shot as the first, and so will actually fire ''fouling shots'' before shooting for score, to get the barrel warmed up and dirty so the first shots on the target will have the same conditions as the last.  There is also the issue of ammunition--some guns may be very picky about ammunition, going from excellent groups with one ammunition to horrible groups with another, while others will shoot just about anything with the same performance.  Depending on the shooter and the situation, a gun may be chosen based on its best case performance, its average performance, or even its worst case performance.

A perfect example of the ambiguity in the &quot;which is most accurate&quot; is a test run by ''Performance Shooter'' magazine in December, 1996.  The magazine was testing seven brands of 38 Special wadcutter rounds in three different revolvers, a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686 and Model 52, and a Colt Python Target model, with six, five and eight inch long barrels, respectively.  Ten groups of five shots were fired and measured from each revolver with each ammunition.  Click on the image at right to see a larger view of the graph of average group sizes for each type of ammunition and each revolver.  The average group size for the overall test was 2.85 inches (72.4 mm).

Based on average group size, the winner was the Model 686, which shot an average group of 2.69 inches across the brands of ammunition, with a standard deviation between ammunition types of 0.54 inches.  However, the Model 52, while shooting slightly larger groups at 2.88 inches, was far more consistent across the brands, with a standard deviation of only 0.30 inches, and was the most consistent performer of the test.  But, if you were able to tune your ammunition to the gun, the clear winner was the Python, which averaged just 1.69 inches with its favored brand of ammunition.  The Python was by far the pickiest, however, turning in the largest groups at 6.08 inch and 4.0 inch averages with its least favorite brands, for a standard deviation of 1.6 inches.

==Usability==
The keys to an accurate shot are a firm but not overtight grip, the ability to get a good sight picture, and a controlled squeeze of the trigger.  The ability to manage recoil is also important in heavily recoiling calibers, both to aid in possible additional shots, and to prevent the user from developing a fear of the recoil.  For firing multiple shots, it is also best to minimize the amount of movement that must be made between shots, so that the ideal grip, once obtained, can be retained as easily as possible.  

The enemies to usability are fatigue and anticipation of recoil or report.  Fatigue causes muscles to tremor, eyes to lose focus, and concentration to lapse.  Anticipation of recoil or report causes the user to jerk the trigger and to tense at the moment of firing, which will throw the gun out of alignment and cause a miss.

===Eliminating grip fatigue===
Any portion of the gun that must be gripped should be the right size for the shooter's hands.  Too large and the user must grip too tightly, causing tremors and fatigue; too small, and a firm, consistent grip becomes very difficult to achieve.  Ideally, the rifle stock or pistol grips should be shaped to fit the shooter's hand, so the gun in effect guides the shooter's hand into the same place each time.  The hand used to squeeze the trigger is the most important; swells located under the palm of the hand, a shelf for the thumb to rest on, and a shelf to separate the trigger finger and guide it into place will all help.  Some shooters prefer a smooth grip surface, especially on rifles, while others prefer a rough, checkered or stippled surface on some or all of the grip area.  The angle of the grip is also important.  For rifles the grip angle should ideally keep the wrists straight and the elbows down.  For pistols, low recoiling calibers like .22 Long Rifle generally often have a grip angle of about 30 degrees from vertical, while heavier recoiling calibers have a straighter angle, around 20 degrees.  The higher grip angles encourage a relaxed wrist, while the steeper angles work better with a locked wrist and a firmer grip.  

While pistols only have significant contact with the trigger hand, rifles generally also have contact with the shooter's other hand, cheek, and shoulder--the exception being guns that are designed to be fired from a sandbag or other rest, which are often used with just cheek and trigger hand.  The forend, where the non-trigger hand grips a rifle, is the main source of control in the aiming of the rifle.  It should be wide enough to fill the hand without the fingers touching the barrel (which can get quite hot) and long enough that the user can pick a comfortable elbow angle for any shooting positions used with the rifle.  Since the supporting hand may be placed anywhere along the forend, forends tend to have a constant cross-section along the useful portion of their length.

The weight of the gun is also an important consideration.  A gun that is too heavy will result in a tighter grip and quick fatigue due to the effort of holding it.  Too light can also be a disadvantage, since a heavy gun has more inertia and will be less subject to involuntary muscle movements.

===Eliminating eye fatigue===
Sights should be suited to the targets used.  For large targets engaged at high speeds, large sights are best, for small targets requiring high precision, a finer sight would be best.  Since the eye is capable of focusing only at one distance at a time, the sights should be selected so that the point of focus is where it will do the greatest good, which is usually the front sight.  An aperture rear sight is best (where allowed by rules and other considerations) because even when out of focus, it is easy to center the target in the resulting fuzzy circle.  On target rifles, circular front sights are often used as well; the target bullseye is centered in the front circle, which is then centered in the rear circle.  

Pistol sights are rarely of the aperture type; they are most often Patridge style sights.  When selecting a Patridge sight, the front sight blade should be wide enough to focus on easily, and the image of the target should sit centered on top of the sight blade.  The rear sight should be chosen so that a good amount of light is visible on both sides of the front blade.  Since the rear sight is always out of focus, the intensity of the light bars between rear sight and front sight are used to center the front sight&amp;mdash;when both sides are equally bright and the top of the blade is even with the top of the rear sight, then the sights are correctly aligned.

Optical sights (usually called scopes) are the least fatiguing form of sight, and the easiest to use.  The optical sight visually projects a single aiming point (typically a crosshair) to the same plane as the target image.  Often the target image is magnified, but this is not necessary; many pistol scopes, especially those used in action shooting, have no magnification.  Magnification has tradeoffs in field of view; if you double the target image magnification, you cut the angle that can be viewed in half.  Magnification also magnifies the shooter's movements&amp;mdash;a hold that looks perfectly steady with iron sights can be seen to wander around the bullseye when seen through a high magnification scope.  This can be good or bad, depending on the shooter.  A good shooter will use the magnification to increase the steadiness of their hold, while a poor shooter will be distracted by the movement and try to jerk the trigger as the crosshair slides across the target.

Since the rifle acts as a rest for the shooter's head, it is important that the stock provide both a secure rest for the cheek and a good placement for the shooter's eye.  A rifle with optical sights, for example, should have a higher cheek rest than a rifle with non-optical sights, since optical sights tend to be higher.  Cheek position also can impact accuracy.  Optical sights, since they project the crosshair out to a given distance, suffer from parallax errors at other distances.  As long as the crosshair is centered in the lens this will have no impact. However, if the crosshair is viewed off center parallax error will come into effect.

===Optimizing the trigger pull===
The trigger must fulfill two goals:  it must fire the round with the minimum of disturbance to the shooter's grip, and it must ''not'' fire the round until the shooter is ready to fire.  The force required to pull the trigger, called the ''trigger pull'', and the consistency of the pull are both important for top accuracy.

For some guns, such as handguns used for combat pistol shooting, it is reasonable to expect that the gun may be dropped, so the trigger should be held forward with sufficient force to prevent it from being pulled by the force of a fall.  For a heavy benchrest gun, that is intended only to be fired from a shooting bench and is never loaded except when on the bench and ready to fire, a much lighter force is allowable.  Unfortunately, many manufacturers are afraid of potential lawsuits caused by negligent discharges, and so they build firearms with far heavier trigger pulls than is needed for top accuracy under normal usage conditions.  This can almost always be fixed by using either aftermarket replacement parts, or by careful hand tuning by a competent gunsmith.  Trigger pulls on competition guns range from 10 pounds force (44 newtons) on a double action revolver to as low as 2 ounces (0.6 N) on a benchrest rifle.

Consistency is always important, because sudden changes in the amount of force required to pull the trigger will result in sudden increases or decreases in muscle tension, which can alter the grip on the firearm.  Even after the trigger ''breaks'', or begins the process of firing the round, it is important to maintain a steady force.  There is a short but significant lag between the trigger break and the firing pin striking the primer, called the ''lock time'', and any movement during the lock time can still disturb the path of the bullet.

Many target guns will have triggers with one or more of the different aspects of the pull fully adjustable.  Anschutz, for example, makes triggers where takeup distance, first stage weight, second stage weight, sear engagement, and overtravel are all independently adjustable.

====Takeup====
Many triggers, especially those in semi-automatic guns, will have some slack that needs to be taken in before the trigger engages the sear and begins the process of firing the gun.  This is especially prevalent in semi-automatics because the trigger has to move forward after firing to re-engage the sear, which will have been disconnected during the cycling of the action.  This takeup should be fairly short, so that the shooter's finger doesn't shift significantly on the trigger during the takeup movement.  Any shifting will result in a less than ideal angle between trigger and finger, and this can cause the gun to be pushed to the side or elevated as the trigger is pulled further.

====Release====
The release is the portion of the trigger travel where the sear is being disengaged.  Lower tension on the sear and reduced sear travel will both make the release a smooth, &quot;crisp&quot; operation (crisp meaning that there is little or no noticeable travel during release).  Too much reduction in sear engagement, and the firearm becomes subject to unintentional discharge; reducing the tension means reducing the hammer or striker spring tension, and that can lead to failure to detonate the primer and excessive lock times.  Another problem is getting the weight of the release so low that the inertia of the trigger will release the sear if the firearm is jarred.

One way to get a very light release without risking unintentional discharged is to use a two-stage trigger.  A single-stage trigger has little or no takeup; if there is takeup, it is purely due to slack in the trigger mechanism.  A two-stage trigger is designed to have a distinct takeup, with the trigger working against a significant amount of spring pressure.  At the end of the takeup travel, there is a small but noticeable increase in pull as the sear begins to disengage.  The two-stage trigger might have a pull force of several pounds force, but first and second stages differ in pull by only ounces.  As the shooter prepares to fire, enough pressure is applied to handle the takeup, or first stage.  Then the shooter pauses to finish aiming, and then the tiny amount of additional pressure is applied to overcome the release, or second stage of the pull.  This gives the handling safety of a heavier trigger pull, with most of the advantages of a light, crisp single-stage trigger.

====Overtravel====
Overtravel is the travel made by the trigger after the sear is released.  Generally, when the sear releases, there is a noticeable reduction in the force required to move the trigger.  Since the shooter has already applied enough force to release the sear, the sudden reduction in pressure causes the trigger to move back rapidly&amp;mdash;far more rapidly than the shooter can react to the change.  Since this happens at the most critical moment of firing, and happens too fast for the shooter to react, this is the most difficult aspect of the trigger pull for the shooter to overcome through technique alone.  The best way of dealing with overtravel is to not allow it.  An adjustable stop placed just past the point of sear release will stop the movement of the trigger, preventing the sudden release in tension and the subsequent movement.  This stop needs to be adjustable, since normal wear on the sear and trigger components will change the point of release slightly, and the overtravel stop will need to be adjusted periodically to compensate.  Overtravel is most critical on pistols, where the inherent instability of the shooter's grip combined with the heavier trigger pulls encountered can result in deviations measurable in degrees of arc.

===Other usability issues===
The location of the various controls for a firearm can have a significant effect on accuracy.  The most vital is, as one would expect, the trigger.  The trigger should be easy to reach, so the user doesn't have to stretch or strain to reach it.  The trigger placement should also cause the finger to naturally lie along the trigger in the best position to pull it&amp;mdash;for most guns that would be with the trigger centered in the pad of the tip of the trigger finger.  The exception to this is double action triggers, where most people shoot best with the trigger at the first joint of the finger.  

Other controls can have a positive or negative on the user's comfort and consistency.  Any controls that interfere with the user's grip, or cause discomfort due to poor positioning can cause the user to lose concentration or rush a shot, leading to a miss.  A well located safety can help a shot in cases, such as hunting, where the firearm is carried with the safety on.  A well designed breech, whether it be bolt action, lever action, or even a single shot design, can speed up reloading time, giving more time to concentrate on aiming a successive shot.  Semiautomatic]designs should eject fired cases away from the shooter&amp;mdash;for example, nothing destroys the concentration quite like a hot 10mm Auto case down the back of one's shirt.

Another issue that is not strictly related to the gun design, but does certainly apply to fitting the gun to the user is recoil.  A heavy recoiling caliber can hurt to shoot.  If the shooter is not comfortable with the recoil of the gun and cartridge combination they are firing, they will anticipate the pain, which can cause them to flinch before the shot is fired.  This is a very common problem, and can be demonstrated by the classic &quot;ball and dummy&quot; drill, where live and dummy ammunition are mixed together, so that the shooter doesn't know ahead of time if a given pull of the trigger will fire the gun or not.  If there is any movement of the gun when a dummy is fired, it indicates the user is anticipating the recoil and would have pulled the shot off target.  If, even when focusing on good technique, a shooter still flinches on the dummy shots, then it is time to look at methods for reducing felt recoil.  A padded grip or buttplate, a muzzle brake, a heavier gun, a lighter cartridge, or a combination of those items can go a long way to reducing the felt recoil, improving the user's confidence, and eliminating the anticipation.

==Tolerances==
Tolerances between moving parts are very important when it comes to maintaining a high level of consistency.  Loose parts will tend not to fit together the same way every shot, and those differences can result in poor accuracy.  This does not mean that tolerances should be as tight as possible, however.  Firearms are generally used outdoors, and even modern smokeless powder leaves some residual soot in the gun.  Dust, moisture, and soot will build up on the moving parts, and if there isn't sufficient allowance for some buildup then parts that should lock into place won't lock anymore, and parts that should slide smoothly will become stiff.  As Mickhail Kalashikov, designer of the AK-47, said in reference to his creation, &quot;Best is the enemy of good enough&quot;.  The AK-47 is a military rifle, designed to be used by often poorly trained, conscripted troops, in all weather and all seasons.  By allowing plenty of room around the moving parts, Kalashnikov created a rifle that on its best day might shoot under 5 minutes of arc, but will shoot under conditions that will cause most other firearms to fail miserably.  The M16, on the other hand, is often criticized for unreliability under extreme circumstances, but most are capable of 2 minutes of arc or better, with match grade examples shooting along with some of the most accurate rifles in the world, with samples often producing groups of 0.25  minute of arc at ranges of under 200 yards.  Picking the right balance between accuracy and reliability depends entirely on the situation in which the gun will be used.  For a gun used only for shooting targets, the preference will be to trade reliability for accuracy; for a defensive weapon, reliability is far more important.  For a sport hunting rifle, the balance will be somewhere in the middle.

===Sight to barrel alignment===
One of the most obvious areas where tolerances affect accuracy, especially in semiautomatic pistols, is the sight-to-barrel fit.  Since one or both of the sights are often located on the slide of the pistol, which moves independently from the barrel, having the slide and barrel lock up consistently is very important.  Since free and easy movement of the slide is also important for reliability, production guns often err on the side of a loose tolerance.  Aftermarket barrels are often machined slightly oversized, so that careful removal of metal is needed in areas critical to the lockup.  This allows the gunsmith to carefully match the barrel to the slide, providing as tight a lockup as desired for the proper balance of accuracy and reliability.  Scoped pistols add an additional level of difficulty, as the scopes are often mounted to the frame, which is independent of both slide and barrel in the common short recoil design.  In this case, the slide must be fitted to the frame, then the barrel to the slide.  It is for this reason that competition quality pistols are often 2 or 3 times the price of the mass-produced versions.

Sight-to-barrel alignment also applies to some rifles, particularly the Ruger 10/22.  Since the barrel slips into the receiver rather than threading in, the junction is relatively flexible, especially when the barrel heats and expands, pushing against the wooden stock.  Since scopes are generally mounted on the receiver, special care must be taken to minimize the effects that barrel heating can have on this joint.  Another approach is to use a cantilever mount, which mounts directly to the barrel, and has a bar that extends over the receiver.  This bar may bolt to the receiver, adding strength to the joint, or may float entirely above it, with the scope mounted to the bar rather than the receiver.

===Bolt to barrel fit===
When a cartridge is fired, the pressures in the case can range from 10,000 to 65,000 psi (70&amp;ndash;450 MPa, 700&amp;ndash;4,500 bar) for common cartridges.  The case, usually made of brass, expands under the pressure of firing to fit the chamber tightly.  If the case is loose in the chamber before firing, this will cause a potentially significant change in the chamber volume, which will have an impact on the pressure curve.  The sudden pressure can also cause a loose bolt to shift back, which will also change the effective chamber volume and thus the pressure curve.  The initial shape of the pressure curve can have a profound effect on the behavior of the cartridge.  For example, the 357 SIG cartridge, which has a very short neck to hold the bullet in place, has been observed to show significant case deformation due to serious overpressure by the bullet being pushed just 1/8&quot; too deep in the case.  This shows how much pressures can change with even a small reduction in effective chamber volume; while the effects of an increase aren't nearly as dangerous, they can cause accuracy problems.

To achieve the best possible bolt-to-barrel fit in a bolt action rifle, lapping compound is applied to the locking lugs of the bolt, then the bolt is locked in place with a dummy cartridge in the chamber.  The dummy case pushes the bolt back, causing the lugs to lock up firmly.  The lapping compound will quickly smooth out any high spots, and provide a smooth, solid surface for the bolt to lock into.  For best results when firing the rifle, cases that have previously been fired in the rifle are reloaded, and are resized only at the neck, so the case will fit into the chamber as tightly as possible.  This prevents any space at the shoulder of the chamber for the case to expand into.  This solution is generally only viable for bolt action rifle and pistols, since the bolt action provides enough leverage to push the tight fitting cartridge into the chamber.  While semiautomatic and other designs can benefit from a good bolt to barrel fit, they do not have the power to cam a neck-sized cartridge into place, and so full length resized cases must be used.

===Movement under recoil===
Upon firing, a significant amount of momentum is transferred to the firearm in reaction to the acceleration of the bullet.  While this may only accelerate the rifle to a speed measurable in inches per second, that force is applied in milliseconds.  This sudden acceleration is eventually transferred to the user, whose flexible body absorbs and dissipates the energy.  Even transfer of this momentum must be consistent to achieve the best accuracy, because the momentum transfer is well under way before the bullet exits the barrel.

With rifles, the big issue is the fit between stock and barrel.  The stock is a significant part of the mass of the rifle, and if it shifts relative to the barrel and/or action, then it changes how the rifle reacts to the recoil.  This concern is addressed by bedding the action.  When an action is bedded, portions of the action and the corresponding portions of the stock are made to fit together very precisely.  In pillar bedding, this is done by machining metal (usually aluminum) pillars that perfectly match mating spots on the barreled action.  The pillars are then epoxied into the stock, and the barreled action screwed down tightly to the pillars.  The other method, far more accessible to the do-it-yourself user, is glass bedding.  In this method, material is removed from the stock around the critical areas (generally where the screws attach action to stock) and then these sections are dammed off with a soft substance like clay.  These areas are then filled with a mix of epoxy and fiberglass or other high strength filler.  The barreled action, covered in a suitable mold release agent, is then screwed into the action and left while the epoxy cures.  If all goes well, the result, after cleanup, will be a stock that contains a perfect impression of the barreled action - of course, if all doesn't go well, the user ends up with the action glued to the stock, which generally means destroying the stock to remove the action.  Some die-hard accuracy shooters who consider a barrel with more than 1,000 rounds through it &quot;worn out&quot; will go so far as to intentionally glue the barreled action to the stock, with the intent of tearing it up when the barrel must be replaced. This makes it impossible to disassemble the rifle without destroying components, so most shooters are not willing to go to that extreme.

To explain the importance of movement under recoil in pistols, first consider the following paradox.  Take a given pistol and cartridge combination, say a 45 Colt firing a 200 grain (13 g) bullet at 900 feet per second (270 m/s). After adjusting the sights so the pistol hits point of aim at 50 feet (15 m) with that load, switch to a 350 grain (23 g) bullet at 750 feet per second (230 m/s). Where does the round impact relative to the point of aim with the new cartridge?  Logic says that the slower bullet will drop more during its longer flight, and hit lower than the lighter, faster bullet.  In reality, it is far more likely that the slow, heavy bullet will hit higher than the fast light bullet.  The reason for this is that the slow, heavy bullet produces about 50% more recoil than the light fast bullet. Since the barrel sits far above the pistol's  center of mass, the recoil will torque the pistol so as to raise angle of the barrel.  Unless the pistol is clamped firmly into a vise, there will be insufficient force to resist this torque.  The phenomenon of &quot;limp wristing&quot; a pistol, that is, holding it so loosely that the cycling of the action will fail, is widely observed and well documented.  While not as obvious, the firearm begins to shift in the user's grip before the bullet exits the barrel, and so can impact accuracy.  Choosing a grip that allows the user to firmly hold the gun, especially against the rotation of recoil, can help ensure consistency.

===Bore characteristics===
Bullet-to-barrel fit is, as one would expect, very important to accurate shooting.  A bullet that does not fit tightly in the bore will let gas escape, causing erratic velocities, and will tumble in the bore so that it exits at an angle, which is likely to cause tumbling.  In addition, the shape of the bore and the rifling can have quite an impact as well.

==Harmonics==
While the barrel of a firearm may seem very stiff and resistant to significant vibrations, the force of an igniting cartridge, which goes from zero pressure to 10,000 to 60,000 lbf/in² (70&amp;ndash;400 MPa, 700&amp;ndash;4,000 bar) or more in less than a millisecond, creates enough force to make the barrel ring like a tuning fork at its natural frequency.  It has been experimentally shown that such ringing can open groups up several minutes of arc, especially with long, thin barrels that ring at lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than short, thick barrels.  Harmonics don't really have an impact with handguns, since the barrels are far shorter and thus inherently far stiffer than rifle barrels.  Most target rifles have larger diameter barrels, appropriately called &quot;heavy barrels&quot;; some go so far as to have no taper at all along their length, and these are called &quot;bull barrels&quot;.  The large diameter barrels reduce the amplitude very significantly, but at the expense of a lot of weight.  Sporting rifles and rifles made for target matches that have a maximum rifle weight cannot afford to have a barrel that heavy, and legal and internal ballistics considerations set a minimum practical length.  For these rifles, alternate methods of dealing with harmonics must be used.

No method can completely eliminate the effects of harmonics, and because of that, an accurate rifle attempts to make the harmonics as consistent as possible.  This is generally done by &quot;free floating&quot; the barrel.  This is done by opening up the stock channel under the barrel so that there is a small amount of space free--the general rule of thumb is enough to slide a business card between stock and barrel.  This will allow the barrel to ring at the same frequency even when the barrel heats and expands, or when the stock swells and contracts with changes in humidity.  Some rifles, particularly the Ruger 10/22, shoot even better with a small amount of upward force on the barrel near the end of the stock.  In the case of the 10/22, this is due to the weak barrel to receiver junction, which is not strong enough to allow a free floated barrel.  On other rifles (often .22 Long Rifle calibers) they just shoot better that way, even though the pressure isn't needed to support the barrel.

===Stiffness without weight===
One method commonly used is to use a fluted barrel.  A fluted barrel is made by cutting shallow longitudinal grooves, called flutes, in the outside of a heavy barrel.  This process removes weight, but retains the larger diameter of the original heavy barrel.  A fluted barrel is generally stiffer than a solid barrel of the same weight, but not quite as stiff as the original heavy barrel.  Fluted barrels are often favored for their ability to cool faster, as the flutes increase the surface area and thus the ability of the barrel to transfer heat to the air.

A fairly recent innovation is the composite barrel, called an &quot;ultra-light bull barrel&quot;, or in some cases a &quot;tensioned barrel&quot;.  These are made by turning a steel barrel down to the minimum diameter suitable for the internal ballistics of the cartridge&amp;mdash;generally a very aggressive taper from the breech end, flattening out towards the muzzle.  The resulting barrel is obviously too light to be at all accurate, and looks too fragile to carry its own weight, but fulfills the requirement of containing the pressure of the propellant.  Over this skinny barrel is placed a cylindrical sleeve the diameter of a typical bull barrel for the rifle in question.  This sleeve is generally made from either carbon fiber composite or aluminum, and may contact the steel barrel (now called a liner) along its entire length, or only at breech and muzzle.  Generally, the sleeve is held on by threading the barrel and attaching a nut on the end.  The nut is then tightened down, tensioning the liner and compressing the sleeve.  When compressed, the sleeve becomes even stiffer than it originally was.  The resulting barrel is far lighter than a solid steel barrel of the same diameter (often half the weight or less), and is comparable or even superior in stiffness and accuracy.  The downside to these barrels is that they require more effort to manufacture than a standard heavy or bull barrel, and are thus generally more expensive.

===Barrel and load tuning===
The other approaches to dealing with harmonics take the opposite view--rather than trying to eliminate the harmonics, they are embraced and used.  For these methods, it is essential that the barrel be free floating, or bedded in a soft, flexible bedding material, so that it is allowed to vibrate freely.  The goal of tuning is to have the bullet exit at the extreme end of the vibration, be it top, bottom, or side.  This is the point at which the barrel is moving the slowest, so the angular dispersion of the bullets due to the vibrations will be minimized.  These methods work best with long, thin barrels, since these barrels vibrate at the lowest frequency and therefore have the widest &quot;sweet spot&quot; when tuned correctly.  Since long, thin barrels tend to be the least accurate &quot;out of the box&quot;, the improvements that can be made by tuning are highly dramatic.  It is not uncommon to see group size cut in half or more with a properly tuned combination.

The first and oldest method is tuning the load to the rifle.  This is a trial and error process, and can be quite time consuming.  A large number of loads are chosen, either by handloading or by purchasing a wide range of commercial ammunition.  Each load is fired at a target, and the total spread of the rounds measured.  The group with the smallest spread is then considered the &quot;tuned&quot; load for that rifle.  This approach has its drawbacks, especially when rimfire cartridges are involved, as they cannot be reloaded and the user is limited to commercially available choices.  Even when reloading, it is possible that the load chosen may be unsuitable for the desired purpose; the bullet weight needed for best accuracy may be too light for heavy game, or too heavy to generate the flat trajectory needed for varmint shooting.

The other method involves tuning the barrel to a given load.  Since it is not practical to shave off or weld metal back onto the barrel, tuning the barrel involves having adjustable parts that can change the harmonics of the barrel.  The most popular of these is the adjustable barrel weight.  These are mounted either on the muzzle (lightest and most effective) or near the muzzle (shorter overall length) of the barrel.  They can be moved back and forth along the length of the barrel and locked rigidly in place, and the position of the extra mass changes the frequency of the barrel--further out gives a lower frequency.  The Browning BOSS system is such a tuner, and mounts to the muzzle end of a specially threaded barrel.  The BOSS weight has markings similar to a micrometer plus a locking nut, so it can be dialed into a given location and locked in place.  The advantage of this system is that the barrel can be tuned to a given load and that tuning recorded; that allows the rifle to be tuned to any number of different loads, and with a quick turn of a dial, the tuning for a given load can be recalled.

The disadvantage to a tuning weight is that it adds either bulk or length to the barrel, which many shooters dislike.  Another system for tuning works by selectively damping the barrel, and it can be completely hidden in the stock.  These systems use an adjustable pressure point mounted in the stock, pushing up on the barrel.  A small screw is exposed, usually on the muzzle end of the stock, that slides a plastic block forwards and backwards along the barrel.  This plastic block is mounted so that there is a significant amount of pressure up on the barrel; one product suggests a pressure of about 7 to 10 pounds (30 to 45 N).  Once in place and pressing upwards on the barrel, moving the pressure block back and forth over the range of an inch or two will damp vibrations in the barrel to differing degrees.

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Muggle Studies''''', an optional course, is the Wizarding view of how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]] live, and the techniques they use to circumvent their lack of magic.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This course is apparently taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charity Burbage|Charity Burbage]] for the first six years that Harry is in school. The course, specifically designed to teach Wizards how to get along with Muggles. will be required for any Wizarding career which involves liaison with Muggles, including, almost certainly, Ministry jobs.

After Professor Burbage's disappearance, it is taught by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], under whose guidance the course seems to have become a diatribe against Muggles, in the best propaganda tradition, teaching how non-Magical people are dirty and behave like animals.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] takes this course in her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|third year]] at Hogwarts. As Hermione is Muggle-born, it seems unlikely that she would need to learn about Muggles; but it seems her intent is to learn about how Wizards see and interact with Muggles, rather than to learn about Muggles as such. At the end of this year, despite achieving a mark of over three hundred percent for the course, she decides to drop the course so as to have a humanly possible course load.

== Analysis ==

A certain amount of humour is created in the series by the Wizarding world's residents and their inability to understand Muggle artifacts and techniques. We see this first in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and his problems dealing with the Muggle train system. It continues with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley's]] infatuation with electricity, the Weasley family's odd attempts to deal with the telephone and postal system, and the odd assortments of Muggle clothing worn by wizards trying to pass as Muggles at various points in the story. Against this, we have to consider that a significant part of the Wizarding population has either sprung from purely Muggle environs, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] did, or were raised in households with at least one Muggle parent, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] was. 

Given the above, we must wonder what the point of the Muggle Studies course is. Clearly, even wizards who take that course are not completely able to fit into Muggle society; a wizard as intelligent as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] apparently feels that plum is a good colour for a suit when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 13|visiting a Muggle orphanage]]. Additionally, it seems that the Weasley children are able to wear Muggle styles without difficulty, despite being raised in an almost entirely Wizarding milieu; at least, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 6|when Harry first sees them]], he does not remark anything odd about them except for the fact that one of them has an owl in his luggage.

We don't actually ever see this class, as it is one of the classes Hermione takes separately from the Trio, so what we know about the course is necessarily limited. From the name of the course, and the way wizards educated (presumably) by this or similar course-work behave in Muggle society, we have to guess that Muggle Studies amounts to an anthropological overview of Muggle society and technology, probably out of date to some extent, rather than a course on how to conceal oneself in the Muggle world.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One must wonder, to some extent, why the author chose to create this course, as we never see it taught and it seems to be somewhat ineffective. It seems clear, however, that it is a useful part of a wizard's education. The school years covered by the story, ages 11 to 17, form a critical part of the young human's understanding of the world outside the family home and the opportunities for gainful employment, so there should be at least an introduction to every field of endeavour in the outside world. Muggles, of course, make up a large majority of the population, and the Wizarding world cannot exist in complete isolation, so at least some of the Wizarding world is involved with Muggles, and clearly this course is intended to lay the groundwork for that class of career.

In the context of our story, however, its role is much smaller. None of the Trio plan a career in Muggle relations, so the course, introduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], is initially introduced only so that Hermione can receive top scores for the one year, and then drop it for lack of time without materially changing her educational future. After that, its only mention is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 1|murdering the professor of the course]] for daring to publish something that disagreed with his own opinion. The latter mention is, of course, little to do with the course, and primarily intended to show Voldemort's inhumanity. Professor Burbage is sacrificed because a professor of Muggle Studies is most likely to write a sympathetic article about Muggles, and also to highlight the fact that Hogwarts and its occupants are not invulnerable.

This page provides additional tips on how to change the Citroën Berlingo Electrique motor brushes.

The motor brushes are a key element of the Berlingo and failure of the units can cause significant damage to the motor and may also cause damage to the very expensive controller.
It is therefore recommended that brushes are changed at regular intervals defined in the [[../|service manual]].
{{clear}}

==Brush suppliers==
[[File:Citroën Berlingo Electrique Brush.jpg|128px|right]]

It is recommended that only genuine Citroen brushes are used. These units are expensive but are; manufactured to tight tolerances, made with specially hard wearing carbon and finished (with serated bearing services) to provide quick bedding-in and therefore minimal impact on the commutator.

The genuine Citroen supplied brushes seem to be supplied by http://www.schunkgraphite.com 

http://www.schunkgraphite.com/ supplied Marc Boden. Did not have groves for bedding in.
{{clear}}

==Required tools==
[[Image:Goose_neck_torch.jpg|128px|right]]

The following tools are recommended:
*8 and 10 mm socket.
*10mm ring spanner
*Miniature goose neck pen light taped as shown.
{{clear}}

==Remove old brushes==
Follow instructions supplied with the brushes.

==Inspect brush container==
[[Image:Commutator_protector.jpg|128px|right]]

Once the old brush has been removed.  Inspect the brush container for signs of spark erosion, between the brush container and the commutator.  This may obstruct the movement of the brush and result in further sparking and possible motor/controller damage.  If erosion is present it may be necessary to remove the (possibly very hard) material as follows:
*make up a commutator protector using sheet metal (ideally steel) as shown on right (damaging the commutator is very costly problem to rectify).
*insert the (long part of the ) protector between the brush holder and commutator
*using a drill with a Dremel bit to very carefully remove any burrs or obstructions
*continually check that the protector is still in place and performing its job
{{clear}}

==Check brush is inserted and seated correctly==
Insert the brush with the slopping face aligned with the commutator.  This can be checked after the brush has been inserted by checking the slope on the back of brush is opposite to the slope on commutator end.

Once the brush is inserted check that it moves freely and seats solidly on the commutator.
Use the miniature goose neck pen light taped as shown to verify brush is seated correctly.
*insert the goose neck behind the brush
*lift the brush a little to see the light between the brush and commutator
*release the brush and check that the light is obscured.

==Finish off==
Follow instructions supplied with the brushes.

==Introduction==

Celestia can be started either by clicking on its icon or by typing a command into a terminal window. Under Windows, the terminal window is often called a DOS window or CMD window.

A typical command to run Celestia might be
 cd Celestia
 ./Celestia

The command line can optionally include the following qualifiers. These qualifiers are different depending on which command interface Celestia was built for.
Each command qualifier (aka switch) should be prefixed by two hyphens
==Windows command qualifiers==



* --dir &lt;tt&gt;&lt;path&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 

:Change root celestia directory to &lt;path&gt;
* --fullscreen 

:Start Celestia in fullscreen mode
* --once 

:Send the command line to a running instance of Celestia. If no running instance exists, a new one is started.
* --url &lt;tt&gt;&lt;url&gt;|&lt;filename&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 

:Start in the given &lt;url&gt; or if the parameter is the name of a script file, execute &lt;filename&gt;. 
* --verbose &gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;filename&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 

:Write debug messages to &lt;filename&gt; (Although --verbose can only write to a file, the redirection &lt;b&gt;&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is required.)

==gtk command qualifiers==

* --conf

:Use alternate configuration file 
* --dir

:Use alternate installation directory 
* --extrasdir

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creativity''' is the ability to make something new that is also useful or valued by others (Gardner, 1993)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). ''Creative minds.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. The “something” can be an object (like an essay or painting), a skill (like playing an instrument), or an action (like using a familiar tool in a new way). To be creative, though, the object, skill, or action cannot simply be bizarre or strange; it cannot be new without also being useful or valued. It also cannot result simply by accident. If a person types words or letters at random that happen to form a poem by chance, the result may be beautiful, but it would not be creative by the definition above. Viewed this way, creativity includes a wide range of human experience that most of us, if not everyone, have had at some time or other (Kaufman &amp; Baer, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J. &amp; Baer, J. (2006). ''Creativity and reason in cognitive development.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The experience is not restricted to just a few geniuses, nor just to those working in specific fields or activities like art or the composing of music.

Especially important for teachers are two facts. The first is that an important kind of creativity is creative thinking, the generation of ideas that are new as well as useful, productive, and appropriate. The second is that creative thinking can be stimulated by teachers’ efforts. One way to do so, for example, is to encourage students’ divergent thinking—ideas that are open-ended and leads in many directions (Torrance, 1992; Kim, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;MA: MIT Press.
Torrance, E. (1992). ''Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.'' Bensenville, IL: Scholastic Testing Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K. (2006). Is creativity unidimensional or multidimensional? Analysis of Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. ''Creativity Research Journal, 18''(1), 251-259.&lt;/ref&gt;. Here are some open-ended questions—questions with many possible right answers:

* How many uses can you think of for a cup?
* Draw a picture that somehow incorporates all of these words: cat, fire engine, and banana.
* What is the most unusual use you can think of for a shoe?

Note that answering these questions creatively depends partly on having already acquired knowledge about the objects to which the questions refer. In this sense divergent thinking depends partly on its converse, convergent thinking, which is focused, logical reasoning about ideas and experiences that leads to specific right answers. At least up to a point, then, rewarding students’ convergent thinking—as schoolwork often does by emphasizing mastery of content—has the paradoxical effect of making students’ creative or divergent thinking possible (Sternberg, 2003; Runco, 2004; Cropley, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. (2003). ''Wisdom, intelligence, and creativity synthesized.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Runco. M. (2004). Divergent thinking, creativity, and giftedness. In R. Sternberg (Ed.), ''Definitions and conceptions of giftedness,'' pp. 47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cropley, A. (2006). In praise of convergent thinking. ''Creativity Research Journal, 18''(1), 291-404.&lt;/ref&gt;.  But beyond that point—the point, that is, where students have acquired “enough” prior knowledge—divergent thinking may not happen unless teachers explicitly encourage students explicitly to use it, and in general show students that they value it.

Whether in school or out, creativity seems to flourish best when the creative activity is its own intrinsic reward, and a person is relatively unconcerned with what other people think of the results. Whatever the activity—composing a song, writing an essay, organizing a party, or whatever—is more likely to be creative if the creator focuses on and enjoys the activity in itself, and thinks relatively little about how others may evaluate the activity (Brophy, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, J. (2004). ''Motivating students to learn, 2nd edition.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. Unfortunately, this requirement of creativity can sometimes pose a challenge for teachers. Why? Because not only are teachers supposed to evaluate students’ learning of particular ideas or skills, but they often have to do so within the restricted time limits of a semester or school year. In spite of these constraints, though, creativity still can be encouraged in classrooms at least some of the time (Claxton, Edwards, &amp; Scale-Constantinou, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Claxton, G., Edwards, L., &amp; Constantinou, V. (2006). Cultivating creative mentalities: A framework for education. ''Thinking Skills and Creativity, 1''(1), 57-61.&lt;/ref&gt;. Students may, for example, have to be assessed on how well they understand and use particular vocabulary. But the assessment does not have to happen constantly; there can also be times to encourage students to experiment with vocabulary creatively through writing poems, making word games, or in other thought-provoking ways. Sooner or later across the week, term, or school year, learning content and experimenting or playing with content can both find a place. In fact one of these activities can often support the other. We return to this point later in this chapter, when we discuss student-centered strategies of instruction such as cooperative learning and play as a learning medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Somewhere between open-ended, creative thinking and the focused learning of content lies problem solving, the analysis and solution of tasks and situations that are somewhat complex or ambiguous and that pose difficulties, inconsistencies, or obstacles of some kind (Mayer &amp; Wittrock, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. &amp; Wittrock, M. (2006). Problem-solving transfer. In D. Berliner &amp; R. Calfee (Eds.), ''Handbook of Educational Psychology,'' pp. 47-62. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;. Problem solving is needed, for example, when a physician analyzes a chest X-ray: the photograph of the chest is far from clear and requires skill, experience, and resourcefulness to decide which foggy-looking blobs on the X-ray to ignore, and which to interpret as real physical structures (and real medical concerns). Problem solving is also needed when a grocery store manager has to decide how to improve the sales of a product: should she put it on sale at a lower price, or increase publicity for it, or both? And will these actions actually increase sales enough to pay for their costs?

Problem solving happens in classrooms, too, when teachers present tasks or challenges that are in some way complex or for which the path to a solution is not straightforward or obvious. The responses of students to such problems, as well as the strategies that teachers use to assist them, show some of the key features of problem solving when it happens in school. Consider this example—and especially students’ responses to it. We have numbered and named the paragraphs to make it easier to comment on them afterwards:


:''Scene #1: A Problem To Be Solved''
:''The teacher gave these instructions: “Can you connect all of the dots below using only four straight lines?” She drew the following display on the chalkboard:''

:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''

:''The problem itself and the procedure for solving it seemed very clear: simply experiment with different arrangements of four lines. But two volunteers who tried doing it at the board were unsuccessful. Several others worked at it at their seats, but also without success.''


:''Scene #2: Coaxing Students To Reframe the Problem''
:''When no one seemed to be getting it, the teacher asked, “Think about how you’ve set up the problem in your mind—about what you believe the problem is about. For instance, have you made any assumptions about how long the lines ought to be? Don’t stay stuck on one approach if it’s not working!”''


:''Scene #3: Alicia Abandons a Fixed Response''
:''After the teacher said this, Alicia did indeed think about how she saw the problem. “The lines need to be no longer than the distance across the square,” she said to herself. So she tried several more solutions, but none of them worked either.''

:''The teacher walked by Alicia’s desk and saw what Alicia was doing. She repeated her earlier comment: “Have you assumed anything about how long the lines ought to be?”''
:''Alicia stared at the teacher blankly, but then smiled and said, “Hmm! You didn’t actually say that the lines could be no longer than the matrix! Why not make them longer?” So she experimented again using oversized lines and soon discovered a solution:''

:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''

:[Note: Displaying this solution will require a graphic here using lines—not sure yet how to do this on a Wiki.]


:''Scene #4: Willem’s General Strategy: Assume It Is a Trick Question''
:''Meanwhile, Willem worked on the problem. As it happened, Willem loved puzzles of all kinds, and had had ample experience with them. He had not, however, ever seen this particular problem. “It must be a trick,” he said to himself, because he knew from experience that problems posed in this way often were not what they first appeared to be. He mused to himself: “Think outside the box, they always tell you…” And that was just the hint he needed: he drew lines outside the box by making them longer than the matrix and soon came up with this solution:''

:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''

:[Note: Use same solution as Alicia’s but rotated 90 degrees clockwise.]


:''Scene #5: Rachel Recalls a Specific Strategy Learned Previously''
:''When Willem and Alicia began work, Rachel took one look at the problem and knew the answer: she had seen this problem before, though not for a long time and she could not at first remember what the solution was. She had also seen other drawing-related like it, and knew that their solution always lay with making the lines longer, shorter, or differently angled than first expected. After staring at the dots briefly, she wrote down a solution even before Alicia or Willem had begun serious work on theirs:''

:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''
:::''*	*	*''

:[Note: Use same solution as Alicia’s but rotated 180 degrees (i.e. rotated 90 degrees from Willem’s as well).]

This story illustrates several common features of problem solving (though not all of them). Consider these four features in particular: the structure or constraints set by the problem, the effect of structure on how to solve a problem, mental obstacles to solving problems, and common techniques for solving problems.

====Well-structured versus Ill-structured Problems====
Problems vary in how well they provide information needed to solve the problem, and in how many rules or procedures might contribute to a solution. A well-structured problem provides much or all of the information needed and can in principle be solved using relatively few clearly understood rules. Classic examples are the word problems often taught in math lessons or classes: everything you need to know is contained within the stated problem and the solution procedures are relatively clear and precise. An ill-structured problem has the converse qualities: the information is not necessarily within the problem, solution procedures are potentially quite numerous, and a multiple solutions are likely (Voss, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Voss, J. (2006). Toulmin’s model and the solving of ill-structured problems. ''Argumentation, 19''(3), 321-329.&lt;/ref&gt;. Extreme examples are problems like “How can the world achieve lasting peace?” or “How can teachers insure that students learn?”

By these definitions, the nine-dot problem is relatively well-structured—though not completely. Most of the information needed for a solution is provided in Scene #1: there are nine dots shown and instructions given to draw four lines.  But not all necessary information was in fact given: it turned out (Scene #2: “A Hint”) that students needed to consider lines that were longer than implied in the teacher’s original statement of the problem. Students had to “think outside the box,” in this case literally.

====Heuristics and Algorithms====
Not only do problems vary in how completely they are structured, but so do solution procedures. An algorithm is a set procedure for solving a particular kind of problem in a particular way, like the procedures for multiplying or dividing two numbers or the instructions for using a computer (Leiserson, et al., 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Leiserson, C., Rivest, R., Cormen, T., &amp; Stein, C. (2001). ''Introduction to algorithms.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Algorithms work best when a problem is very well-structured and there is no question about whether the algorithm is appropriate for the problem. In that situation it pretty much guarantees a correct solution. They do not work well, however, with ill-structured problems, where they are ambiguities and questions about how to proceed or even about precisely what the problem actually is. In those cases it is more effective to use heuristics, which are general strategies—rules of thumb—that often work or that may provide partial solutions. When beginning research for a term paper, for example, a useful heuristic is to scan the library catalogue for titles that look relevant. There is no guarantee that that this strategy will yield the books you most need for the paper, but the strategy works enough of the time to make it worth trying.

In the nine-dot problem, most students began in Scene #1 with a simple algorithm that can be phrased like this: “Draw one, then draw another, and another, and another.” Unfortunately this simple procedure did not produce a solution, so they had to find other ways to find a solution. Two of the alternatives are described in Scenes #3 (for Alicia) and 4 (for Willem). Of these, Willem’s response resembled a heuristic the most: he knew from experience that a good general strategy that often worked for such problems was to suspect a deception or trick in how the problem was originally stated. So he set out to question what the teacher had meant by the word line, and came up with a solution as a result.

====Common Obstacles to Solving Problems====
The example also illustrates two common problems that sometimes happen during problem solving. One of these is '''functional fixedness''': a tendency to regard the functions of objects or ideas as fixed (German &amp; Barrett, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;German, T. &amp; Barrett, H. (2005). Functional fixedness in a technologically sparse culture. ''Psychological Science, 16''(1), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;. Over time, we might get so used to one particular purpose for an object that we overlook other possible uses. We may think of a dictionary, for example, as always “just” something to verify spellings and definitions, but it also can function as a gift, a doorstop or a footstool. For students working on the nine-dot matrix problem, the notion of a line was also initially fixed; they assume it something that connected dots but could not extend beyond the dots.

Functional fixedness is also a form of '''response set,''' the tendency for a person to frame or think about each subsequent problem in a series in the same way as the previous problem, even when doing so is not appropriate. In the example of the nine-dot matrix described above, students often tried one solution after another, but each solution was constrained by a set response not to extend any line beyond the matrix. Similarly, an even more complex example of response set is illustrated in [[Figure 8-1]], which is about a classic problem of filling water jars to specified levels (Luchins &amp; Luchins, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Luchins, A. &amp; Luchins, E. (1994). The water-jar experiment and Einstellung effects. ''Gestalt Theory: An International Interdisciplinary Journal, 16''(2), 101-121.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Both functional fixedness and response set are pitfalls or obstacles in problem representation, the way that a person understands and organizes information provided in a problem. If information is misunderstood or used inappropriately, then mistaken solutions are likely—if indeed the problem can be solved at all. With the nine-dot matrix problem, for example, understanding the instruction to draw four lines as meaning “draw four lines entirely within the matrix” means that the problem simply  could not be solved.

But this is not the only kind of misunderstanding or misrepresentation possible. Consider this problem: “The number of water lilies on a lake doubles each day. Each water lily covers exactly one square foot. If it takes 100 days for the lilies to cover the lake exactly, how many days does it take for the lilies to cover exactly half of the lake?” If you think that the size of the lilies affects the solution to this problem, you have not represented the problem correctly. The information about lily size is not relevant to the solution, and only serves to distract from the truly crucial information, that the lilies double their coverage each day. (The answer, incidentally, is that the lake is half covered in 99 days; can you think why?)

====Strategies To Assist Problem Solving====
Just as there are common obstacles that often happen in all sorts of problem solving, there are also strategies that often help or support the process, regardless of the content specific in the problem (Thagard, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, R. (2005). ''Mind: Introduction to Cognitive Science, 2nd edition.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. One helpful strategy is ''problem analysis''—identifying parts of the problem and working on the parts separately. Analysis is especially useful when a problem is complex. Consider, for example, this ill-structured problem: “Devise a plan to improve bicycle transportation in the city.” With a problem like this, try identifying its parts or component subproblems, such as 1) installing bicycle lanes on busy streets, 2) educating cyclists and motorists to ride safely, 3) fixing potholes on streets used by cyclists, and 4) revising traffic laws that interfere with cycling. Each component is itself a separate problem, and the solution of each contributes, but is not equivalent to, a solution to the original, larger problem.

Another helpful strategy is ''working backward,'' from a final solution to the originally stated problem. This approach is especially helpful when a problem is well-structured but also has misleading elements when approached in a forward or normal direction. The water lily problem described above is a good example: starting with when all the lake is covered (Day 100), ask what day would it therefore be half covered (answer: by the terms of the problem, it would be the day before, or Day 99). Working backward in this case encourages reframing the extra information in the problem (i.e. the size of each water lily) as merely distracting, not as crucial to a solution.

A third helpful strategy is ''analogical thinking''—using knowledge or experiences with similar features or structures to help solve the problem at hand (Bassok, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Bassok, J. (2003). Analogical transfer in problem solving. In Davidson, J. &amp; Sternberg, R. (Eds.). ''The psychology of problem solving.'' New York: Cambridge University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;. In devising a plan to improve bicycling in the city, for example, an analogy of cars and bicycles is helpful in thinking of solutions: improving car driving requires many of the same measures (improving the roadways, educating drivers) as improving bicycling. Even solving much simpler, more basic problems than this is helped by using analogies. A first-grade student can partially decode unfamiliar printed words by analogy to words he or she has learned already. If the child cannot yet read the word screen, for example, he can note that part of this word looks similar to words he may already know, such as seen or green, and from this observation derive a clue about reading the word screen. Teachers can assist this process, as you might expect, by suggesting reasonable, helpful analogies for students to consider.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Major Instructional Strategies and Their Relationships==
Because the forms of thinking just described—critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving—are broad and educationally important, it is not surprising that educators have identified a lot of strategies to encourage their development. There are so many possibilities, in fact, that just keeping them all in mind—let alone choosing among them—can be difficult without a framework for organizing them. One such framework is shown in [[Figure 8-2]], which visually classifies thirteen major instructional strategies according to two (somewhat approximate) dimensions. The first dimension is how much an instructional strategy is student-centered as compared to teacher directed. The second is how much a strategy depends on interaction and activity of groups as compared to individuals. The terms in the figure are all discussed in the rest of this chapter, but brief definitions of them are also listed in [[Table 8-1]]. As you will see later in this chapter, this two-way classification is not very precise, but it does give a useful overview of the major choices available for planning and carrying out instruction. And as you will also see, the more important of the two dimensions in [[Figure 8-2]] is the first one—the extent to which an instructional strategy is directed by the teacher or initiated by students. We take a closer look at this dimension in the rest of this chapter.

===Teacher-Directed Instruction===
As the name implies, teacher-directed instruction is any strategy initiated and guided primarily by the teacher. It includes the classic expository method of lecturing (simply telling or explaining important information to students) and of assigning reading from texts. But teacher-directed instruction also includes strategies that call for more active responses from students, such as encouraging students to relate new information to prior knowledge, or to elaborate on new knowledge. Whatever their precise form,  however, teacher-directed instructional methods include a lot of organizing of information on behalf of students, even when they also expect students to do some organizing work of their own. Sometimes teacher-directed methods are therefore thought of as transmitting knowledge from teacher to student—though in ways that are as clear and efficient as possible, and that often also require mental work on the part of the student.

====Lectures and Readings====

Lectures and readings are traditional staples of educators, particularly when teaching older students (including university students!). At their best, they are the good examples of pre-organized information, so that the student only has to remember what was said in the lecture or written in the text in order to begin understanding it (Exley &amp; Dennick, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Exley, K. &amp; Dennick, R. (2004). ''Giving a lecture: From presentation to teaching.'' New York: Routledge-Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;. The problem with lectures and readings, however, is the ambiguity of the responses which they require: listening and reading are by nature quiet and stationary, and do not in themselves indicate whether a student is comprehending, or even attending to the material. Educators often describe the problem by saying that “students are too passive” during lectures or when reading. But passivity can just as easily be attributed to the readings themselves or to the teachers who do the lecturing. Books just sit still, after all, unless someone makes an effort to read them, and a person lecturing may sometimes talk too much without noticing students’ responses (or lack thereof).

=====Advance Organizers=====
But in spite of such problems, there are strategies for making lectures and readings effective. Some of them amount to being especially careful about organizing information for students, while others turn some of the organizational task over to students themselves. An example of the first approach is the use of advance organizers—brief overviews or introductions to new material before the material itself is presented (Ausubel, 1978)&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, D. (1978). In defense of advance organizers. ''Review of Educational Research, 48''(2), 251-157.&lt;/ref&gt;. Textbook authors (including ourselves) often try deliberately to use periodic advance organizers to introduce new sections or chapters in the text. When part of a lecture, advance organizers are usually created by the teacher herself in the form of brief introductory remarks, or possibly as diagrams illustrating relationships among the key ideas about to be explained (Robinson, et al., 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, D., Corliss, S., Bush, A., Bera, S., &amp; Tomberlin, T. (2003). Optimal presentation of graphic organizers and text. ''Educational technology research and development, 51''(4), 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;. Whatever their form, advance organizers partially organize the material on behalf of the students, so that they know where to put it, so to speak, as they learn it in more detail.

=====Recalling and Relating Prior Knowledge=====
Another strategy for improving teacher-directed instruction is to encourage students to relate the new material to prior familiar knowledge. When one of us [[User talk:Klseifert|(KelvinLeeSeifert)]] first learned a foreign language (in his case French), for example, he often noticed similarities between French and English vocabulary. A French word for picture, for example, was image, spelled exactly as it is in English. The French word for splendid was splendide, spelled almost the same as in English, though not quite. Relating the French vocabulary to English vocabulary helped in learning and remembering the French. 

As children and youth become more experienced as students, they tend of their own accord to relate new information to previously learned information more frequently and automatically (Goodwin, 1999; Oakhill, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, L. (1999). Spontaneous comprehension monitoring strategies of college freshmen and college seniors. In B. Palmer (Ed.), ''College reading: Perspectives and practices.'' Carrolton, GA: The College Reading Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oakhill, J., Hartt, J., &amp; Samols, D. (2005). Levels of comprehension monitoring in good and poor readers. ''Reading and Writing, 18''(7-9), 657-686.&lt;/ref&gt;.But teachers can also facilitate students’ use of this strategy. When presenting new concepts or ideas, the teacher can relate them to previously learned ideas deliberately and frequently—essentially modeling the memory strategy that students must eventually use for themselves. In a science class, for example, she can say “This is another example of…, which we studied before”; in social studies she can say “Remember what we found out last time about the growth of the railroads? We saw that…”

If students are relatively young or are struggling academically, it helps to remind them explicitly to draw on their prior knowledge. Teachers can periodically ask questions like, “What do you already know about this topic?” or “How will your new knowledge about this topic change what you know already?” Whatever the age or maturity of students, connecting new with prior knowledge is not always easy without help from someone more knowledgeable or expert—usually the teacher. When first learning algorithms for multiplication, for example, students may not spontaneously see how multiplication is related to the addition processes that they probably learned previously. But if a teacher takes time to explain the relationship and to give students time to explore it, then the new skill--multiplication--may be learned more easily.

=====Elaborating and Extending Information=====
Elaborating and extending new information means asking questions about the new material, guessing at ideas that may follow logically from the information given, and thinking of additional, unstated relationships among the new concepts. Such strategies are closely related to the recalling of prior knowledge discussed above: they enrich the new information and connect it to other knowledge. In this sense elaboration and extension make the new learning more meaningful and seem less arbitrary.

Teachers can help students to use elaboration and extension by modeling these behaviors themselves. A teacher can interrupt her own explanation of an idea, for example, by asking how it relates to other ideas, or by speculating about where the new concept or idea may lead. A teacher can also encourage students explicitly to do the same, and even give students questions to guide their elaborations. When giving examples of a concept, for example, a teacher hold back from thinking of all of the examples herself, and instead ask students to think of additional examples. Or when a reading includes descriptions of examples, teachers can instruct students to find or make up additional examples of their own.

=====Organizing New Information=====
There are many ways to organize new information, and some of them are especially well to teacher-directed instruction. A common way is to ask students to outline information read in a text or heard in a lecture. Outlining works especially well when the information is already organized hierarchically to some extent into main topics, each with supporting subtopics or subpoints. Outlining is basically a form of the more general strategy of taking notes, or writing down key ideas and terms from a reading or lecture. Research studies find that that the precise style or content of notes is less important that the quantity of notes taken: more detail is usually better than less (Ward &amp; Tatsukawa, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Ward, N. &amp; Tatsukawa, H. (2003). A tool for taking class notes. ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 59''(6), 959-981.&lt;/ref&gt;. Written notes help both by making a student think about the material while writing it down, and by providing permanent clues that help remind a student about the material later. These benefits are especially helpful when students are relatively inexperienced at learning in general (as in the earlier grade levels), or relatively inexperienced about a specific topic or content in particular. By the same token, of course, such students may need more guidance than usual about what and how to write notes. In elementary school, for example, it can be helpful for the teacher  to provide a note-taking guide, like the one shown in [[Table 8-2]].

In learning expository material, another helpful strategy—one that is more visually oriented—is to make concept maps, or diagrams of the connections among concepts or ideas. [[Figure 8-3]] shows concept maps made by two people that graphically depict how a key idea, child development, relates to learning and education. One of the maps was drawn by a classroom teacher and the other by a university professor of psychology. They suggest possible differences in how the two individuals think about children, learning, and children’s development. Not surprisingly, the teacher gave more prominence to practical concerns (for example, classroom learning and child abuse) and the professor gave more prominence to theoretical ones (for example, Erik Erikson and Piaget). The differences suggest that these two individuals may be thinking about somewhat different ideas when they use the same term, child development. Such a difference has the potential to create misunderstanding between them (Seifert, 1999; Super &amp; Harkness, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, K. (1999). ''Reflective thinking and professional development: A primer.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Super, C. &amp; Harkness, S. (2003). Metaphors of development. ''Human Development, 46''(1), 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt;. The concept maps also suggest, however, what each person might need to learn in order to achieve better understanding of the other person’s thinking and ideas.

====Mastery Learning====
This term refers to an instructional approach in which all students learn material to an identical, high level, even if some students require more time than others to do so (Gentile, 2004). In mastery learning the teacher directs learning, though sometimes only in the indirect sense of finding, writing, and orchestrating...[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Mastery Learning|(read more...)]]

[[Cookbook:Pumpkin|Pumpkins]] are unavailable most of the time in some countries. An excellent substitute for all uses is made from the following:

==Ingredients==
* 1kg (approx. 2 lbs) mixed [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and [[Cookbook:Swede|swede]]
* 500g (approx. 1 lb) plain yogurt

==Procedure==
#Puree the vegetable mix until smooth
#Add the yogurt.

Use in place of pumpkin.

==Note==
* Frozen carrot and swede mix makes this a very easy substitution.
* Puree thoroughly to obtain a smooth puree.
* The ingredients can be added whole to foods that will be pureed later.
* Other winter squashes may also be used as substitutes for pumpkin

Chapter 8 is now entirely posted in its basics. A serious problem exists, however, re the missing tables. Some of these are relatively important to the &quot;messages&quot; of the chapter--more important than in previous chapters. [[User:Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]] 15:09, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

== Sequencing and &quot;levels&quot; of headings ==

I now find the &quot;levels&quot; of headings and links between them a bit confusing. Time to look seriously at how to reorganize them more sensibly. The problem is related to the &quot;isolation&quot; I sometimes perceive between webpages, even if they are linked. I can't assume that readers will read pages in a predictable sequence, as happens with a print book (at least it happens sometimes ). So tying sections of chapters together becomes a new sort of challenge--how to indicate it with the relatively short space of a single web page. I don't care if readers actually read pages in sequence; I only want to keep them from  feeling &quot;lost&quot; because there is so much material.

The same issue probably is happening in some of the other chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rounding vs. truncation ==

When resampling a digital signal, doesn't rounding produce a result that is identical in practice to truncation? The only difference between the two is a 1/2 sample group delay. And no, linear interpolation is not the most complex, most precise practical scheme. Cubic, quintic, and higher interpolations are used in some cases. --[[User:Damian Yerrick|Damian Yerrick]] 21:48, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:Poor writing on my part; I was trying to say that it was the best of the three. I think rounding is more accurate because, for instance, a fractional jump calculated to 1.9 will be rounded to 2 rather truncated to 1 which is &quot;further&quot; from the desired position of the read pointer. [[User:Damien Karras|Damien Karras]] 17:16, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

::I just happened upon this page, and was about to add exactly what Damain Yerrick said years ago; Damian Karras: Rounding is equivalent to adding 0.5 and truncating, so the only difference between the two is a phase shift of Pi/table_length radians. Since you can't hear that phase shift in a free running oscillator, you can't consider it as error in the practical sense. I also thought it was a bit much to say that linear interpolation is &quot;much more computationally demanding&quot;—it's a modest increment, so some of that hyperbole should go (at least the &quot;much&quot;). And at that point it's worth at least mentioning that higher order interpolation methods further improve precision at the cost of increased computational overhead.—[[User:Earlevel|Earlevel]] ([[User talk:Earlevel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Earlevel|contribs]]) 09:46, 5 February 2012 (UTC)

== Wavetables ==

&quot;Wavetables are popular in digital synthesis applications because accessing a block of memory is computationally faster than calculating values using mathematical operations.&quot; Disagree—wavetables are not computationally faster. Take a (naive) sawtooth wave, for instance, as described earlier on the page. For the wavetable version, you need to create that same sawtooth, essentially, then use it to look up the corresponding wavetable entry. Wavetables are popular because of flexibility (the wavetable can hold any static waveform without change in the playback code, and it's easier to have control over aliasing by controlling the harmonic complexity of the waveform—something that is difficult with naive wave generation).[[User:Earlevel|Earlevel]] ([[User talk:Earlevel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Earlevel|contribs]]) 18:14, 5 February 2012 (UTC)

== Using wavetables ==

&quot;Digital systems, especially mixers that combine several synthesized or recorded signals, are designed to work at a fixed sampling rate and to make sudden changes to it is once again inefficient and extremely hard to program.&quot; If the hardware supports it—which it must or this wouldn't be in discussion—programming is extremely efficient and easy. The real reason is that you can't multiplex the oscillator—you can't generate several independent oscillators (or other functions) at the same time.[[User:Earlevel|Earlevel]] ([[User talk:Earlevel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Earlevel|contribs]]) 18:26, 5 February 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Book Redundancy ==

What kinds of redundancy are we talking about? within a single book, or across multiple books? A book is supposed to be relatively self-contained. That means that  the book needs to discuss the basics before it can move on to more advanced topics. To that effect, I'm certain that many books need to &quot;review&quot; certain topics (like newton's laws). Notice also that many books have different audiences and different prerequisties. This means that you can't consolidate all the review material because many books are trying to discuss the same topic in different ways. 

However, if you find that many books share a common basis, that is that they cover the same kinds of materials in the same way, it would be acceptable to separate out this material into a single book, and then link your new book to all the old books that use it. For instance, if you wanted to write a book about &quot;Physics Basics&quot;, and then use that as a prerequisite for other physics books, that would probably be fine. If you have doubt about something, ask me and I can give you some advice.

As to my user page, you are more then welcome to copy anything that you see on it. It is a result of a large amount of hard work on my part (perhaps too much). You are more then welcome to re-use some of the templates that I have created. Some templates, such as those that are highly specific to my own userspace, have been restricted from being included into other user pages. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:58, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Incorrect Image ==

Which image on that page is not correct? Since those images look an aweful lot like ordinary tables, maybe you can delete the image entirely and just replace it with a table containing the correct information. Otherwise, if you can send me a description of what precisely is wrong with it, maybe i can take a stab at it myself. let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:10, 11 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Momentum ==

Momentum is a construct of physics defined as the product of mass and velocity. Although it is just a construct, it is very useful as it has some very interesting properties, like being conserved in most interactions. In 4 dimension spacetime employed by relativity, it is also shown to belong with energy and other basic constructs that are conserved in interactions. Mathematically, it is represented by p.

== Impulse ==

Impulse is simply the change in momentum, and is represented by I when used in mathematics. It is hardly ever used, and mostly only to demonstrate the concept. We will deal with it with forces in the next page.

* '''Time''' - frequently referred to as 't' and generally measured in seconds (s), but any units of  time are fine, e.g. hours, minutes. 
See [[Advanced A-level Mathematics/Space and Time#Time|Time]] for a reasonable definition - or look at your watch for a while. This is time passing....

* '''Distance''' - frequently referred to as 'd' and generally measured in meters (m). Also known as length.
This is how far away one object is from a specified reference point. The reference point may be another object or the origin (insert link). 

* '''Speed''' - frequently referred to as 's' and generally measured in meters per second (m/s), but any units of measurement and time are fine, e.g. km/h, feet/minute.

This is how fast an object is travelling - i.e. how much distance an object has moved in a given time. Direction is not relevant for speed - but q.v. velocity. Speed is a scalar (link).

* '''Velocity''' - frequently referred to as 'v' and generally measured in meters per second (m/s), but again  any units of measurement and time are fine, e.g. km/h, feet/minute. 

This is how fast an object is travelling in a given direction- i.e. how much distance an object has moved in a given time. Direction is relevant for velocity - but q.v. speed. Velocity is a vector (link) in that it has speed plus direction (so more than one [[Advanced A-level Mathematics/Space and Time#Co-ordinates|co-ordinate]] is required to define the velocity). 

* '''Acceleration''' - frequently referred to as 'a' and generally measured in meters per second squared (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but again  any units of measurement and time are fine, e.g. km/h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, feet/minute&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 

This is the rate of change in velocity over time 

* '''Mass''' - frequently referred to as 'm' and generally measured in kilogrammes(kg). 
Mass is the amount of matter in an object. It is not the same as weight, except when the object is under the influence of gravity. Specifically an object always has mass, but for example in space it will have no weight. 

* '''[[Advanced A-level Mathematics/Momentum and Impulse|Momentum]]'''

Also needs to cover :  moments of inertia and force and ....(feel free to add suggestions).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Sharksteeth-castlehain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Collecting fossilized shark's teeth is an easy way to begin collecting fossils. They are often found in abundance on public beaches. The teeth shown here were collected in Castle Hain, North Carolina, and are from the Eocene and Cretaceous divisions.]]

'''Fossil collecting''' can be a very relaxing and rewarding hobby. There are no special rules about where one may find fossils, and you can find fossils in many places where sedimentary rocks are exposed, such as clays, shales, limestones, and sandstones. Only certain sedimentary Rock (geology)|rocks will yield fossils, and they are often concentrated along particular bedding planes within the rocks.

== Finding fossils ==
Fossils are not to be found in areas of igneous rock (except in some beds between lava flows). In rocks which have undergone metamorphism, they are usually so distorted that they are difficult to recognize or have been destroyed completely.

Establishing the age and type of the rocks in your area with the aid of a geological map (usually available from your local state or national geological survey also on USGS, United States geological service, web site) will provide you with an idea as to what types of fossils to expect. Most libraries should have local geological guide books, but, a word of caution: they may be out-of-date. Many hours have often been spent trying to locate a quarry that has since been filled in.

There are a large number of well known fossil collecting localities worldwide, and at some of these classic localities fossils have been recovered for a long time. Many such sites are recorded in geological guide books and other sources of literature. At such localities fossils are almost sure to be found, but  generations of fossil collectors will have collected there before.

A visit to your local museum is often useful too. However, one should take into account that many of the inspiring specimens in museum collections may have been collected a long time ago, often when the site was in prime condition.

You may also consider joining a rock and mineral club, paleontological or natural history society. Up-to-date information from other collectors is usually the best, and often such clubs and societies have access to private collecting sites that would not otherwise be accessible. Supervised parties are usually allowed to collect fossils in quarries, whereas individuals may be discouraged from doing so. The staff at operating quarries will often know where the best spots for collecting fossils are.

Artificial exposures, such as road cuttings or quarries, can often be good collecting spots, along with continually eroding river or coastal exposures. Coal mining operations often yield excellent fossil plants, but the best ones are to be found not in the coal itself but in the associated sedimentary rock deposits called coal measures.

In hilly regions the best sections are often those exposed at the sides of streams that have cut into the bedrock.

Wave washed sea cliffs and foreshore exposures are often good places to search for fossils, but always be aware of the state of the tides in the area. Never take chances by climbing high cliffs of crumbling rock or clay (many have died attempting it).

Exposures of softer rocks, such as clays and sands, can be good collecting spots. However inland sections tend to degrade rapidly, becoming overgrown, and are lost forever.

== Collecting ethics ==
Wherever you decide to collect fossils you should always seek permission from the land owner or authorities first. Thoughtless or unreasonable behavior on the part of one collector may mean that access to a particular site in the future is refused to others. Irresponsible behavior while out collecting may also put yourself and others at risk. Always refill any holes dug.

Hammering the rocks in national parks and other areas of natural beauty is often discouraged and in most cases is illegal, so '''please be considerate'''. In this way fossils will still be there for future generations to appreciate.

== Field collecting ==
Do not hammer at rock outcrops aimlessly, and never leave rock fragments scattered over fields or roads. The irresponsible destruction of an outcrop in search of one or two fossils is not welcomed. Fossils should be collected sparingly, and preferably without the use of a hammer.

Often the best fossils are those which have been Weathering|weathered out of the rock over a long period of time. They may be visible on the surface of the rock, or among the loose scree at the foot of an outcrop. Searching for fossils on the ground is largely a matter of patience and a keen eye.

It is always better to leave a fossil in the field rather than try to dig it out in a hurry using the wrong tools, you could damage or destroy a valuable scientific find. Collecting is often a matter of personal judgement; consider the scientific value of the fossil and whether it would otherwise be damaged or destroyed by erosion. If you have found a fossil on the ground surface you know that it was exposed by erosion. Further erosion will not enhance the fossil. Would it be better to collect the specimen now, or return at a later time with the appropriate tools? Many online sites can be found to describe preferred collecting tools and methods for the fossils in which you are interested. If you think that the removal of the specimen is essential, then do it. Otherwise, contact an authority at a local university or club who can help you.

== Equipment ==
It is important to have the right kind of field equipment when looking for fossils, and safety should always be an important concern.

A hard hat is essential to protect you from loose stones that may be dislodged from cliffs above, but remember that this will not protect you from larger falling rocks. Hard hats are normally a requirement in operational quarries.

Safety goggles and protective gloves are also essential. Rocks can be sharp and dangerous, safety goggles will protect your eyes from chips while hammering, and gloves will protect your hands.

You should always dress appropriately for collecting trips, taking into account the climate and terrain of the area. Sturdy footwear, such as walking or hiking boots with steel toes, are usually a must. In general, wear old clothes because you will almost certainly get dirty and/or wet. A hand-lens is also important as it will enable you to recognize fine details in both the rocks and fossils they contain.

A hammer, chisel and wrapping materials are the basic equipment required for fossil collecting, along with a stout rucksack or canvas bag for carrying your equipment and your fossil finds. 

Remember that the steel of many ordinary hammers is too soft for use on most type of rock. The steel may splinter and the flying fragments may cause injury, not only to the person using the hammer, but to his or her companions as well. Always strike with the hammer away from the body.

The head of a geological hammer or rock pick is made from specially hardened steel designed for use on rocks. The head is either firmly attached to a wooden shaft, or the hammer have the head and the shaft formed from one piece of steel. The head has a square face at one end, while the other end either tapers to a point of has a straight chisel edge. The point of such picks are not meant for striking rock directly, but for tapping rock (such as shale) open along planes and for prying. The hammer end is meant for striking.

In dry climates shrinkage can be a problem with hammers which have a wooden shaft, the wood may shrink so that the head becomes loose. If you do not have a wedge to force into the wooden shaft, soaking the head of the hammer in water will swell the wood and should keep the head on the handle.

A convenient weight for a general purpose geological hammer or rock pick is around 1 kg (2 to 3 pounds). For breaking very hard rocks one may need a hammer of between 3 and 6.5 kg (7 and 14 pounds) in weight, with a correspondingly longer and thicker shaft. A hammer that is too heavy is tiring to use and results in unsafe work.

For extracting fossils from harder rocks, a sturdy mallet and cold steel chisels may also be  required. Usually one needs a range of chisels in size from small ones with a sharp edge of about 1 cm (quarter of an inch), to much larger and heavier chisels. A broad-bladed chisel is often very useful for splitting rocks along their bedding plane.

Knowing the type of rocks on which one will be working is useful so that one can select the appropriate tools and not have to carry any unnecessary weight.

Different types of rocks will break differently and a beginner should put in a little practice, getting the feel for a particular type of rock before he or she starts hammering out fossils. It is all too easy to ruin a specimen with one ill-placed blow of a hammer.

Extracting a specimen that is embedded in solid rock may prove to be a long and difficult process. Before attempting to extract a specimen, the collector should make sure that it is feasible to remove it without destroying or damaging it. Be sure to leave sufficient rock beneath the specimen to protect it from fracturing; excess matrix can always be trimmed once you get the specimen home.

For soft sediments and unconsolidated deposits, such as sands, silts and clays, a spade and a flat-bladed trowel or stout bladed knife may be the most useful tools for clearing the area around a fossil. Brushes are also useful for removing loose sediment from around fossils. Also, '''a word of caution''': whenever grinding or chipping rock beware that the rock dust created can be very harmful to the lungs. Always take appropriate measures, such as using a mask or respirator, when doing anything with rocks that create dust.

Use a sieve to separate fossils from sands and gravels. Usually a smaller mesh is required in order to avoid losing small fossils. One practical difficulty with using sieves in the field is that they easily become clogged, especially when the material sieved has a high moisture content. However, under dry weather conditions the more durable fossils, such as teeth and bones, can be quickly and easily sieved out of loose sands. Remember that shaking the sieve is always liable to damage or destroy fragile fossils.

If there is water available, such as on a beach or next to a stream, the material containing the fossils can be sieved wet and the matrix gradually washed away. Wet sieving is a technique that is frequently used for the collection of small mammalian fossils, and by using this technique even the smallest specimens may be recovered. Any fossils you will thus obtain create a more balanced representation of the fossils present at that particular locality. Alternatively a block of matrix with the fossils inside may be dug out and taken home for treatment indoors. To do this use a flat-bladed trowel, or stout bladed knife, and simply carve away the surrounding sediment. Once free, carefully wrap the matrix block containing the specimen before taking it home.

Before setting out on an expedition, ask other collectors who are familiar with the area where you intend to collect exactly what tools are needed.

== Preservation and documentation ==
Always record field notes, such as the locality, types of rock, and fossils seen in a sturdy notebook using waterproof ink. A long tape measure is useful to record the levels of the beds in which you find fossils, and a camera may also be useful for taking photographs of fossils ''in situ''. Detailed field notes are an essential part of your records, both from the point of view of keeping an accurate account of your collecting activities, and as an indispensable aid in the subsequent identification of your finds. Your field notes may in time be the only reference to a collecting area that later becomes destroyed by erosion or by the spread of urban areas. It often helps to make sketches of the site, particularly if the fossils are found in certain distinct bands or horizons within the rocks. Accurate notes will enable you to readily identify such horizons on your return trips.

Having collected fossils it is essential that they are adequately protected from damage while they are being transported home. Each fossil or piece of rock containing a fossil should be carefully wrapped. Here newspaper, paper towels, sticky tape, polythene bags and an assortment of small boxes or tins will all prove to be useful.

The more fragile specimens will need the greatest protection, such as packing them in a tin or box lined with a soft material such as cotton or wool.

All specimens collected should be labeled in the field with the details of the locality where they were found. The easiest and safest way to do this is to write the details in your field notebook along with a number for each specimen, a corresponding number can then be written on the wrapping used for each specimen or on a ticket or scrap of paper included with the wrapping.

If you do not label the specimens as they are collected and wrapped there is a distinct danger that errors will be made in the localities from which the fossils were collected, especially if they are not unpacked for some time after they were collected. The value of any fossil that does not have accurate locality details is greatly reduced.

Maps and a compass/clinometer or GPS receiver will assist you in finding fossil locations and assist you in recording your field notes.

Occasionally, large fragile specimens may need to be surrounded and supported using a jacket of plaster before their removal from the rock. This will protect the fossil and prevent it from shattering. In this case clean the fossil and expose as much of it as possible. Then cover the exposed surface with a separator (wet paper or plastic film is suitable), followed by layers of plaster bandage. Once the plaster has hardened you can lift the fossil out of the surrounding rock, and then repeat the plastering process on the underside of the specimen.

      <comment>/* The Spars */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Attaching the Sidewalls ==

The sidewalls will sit on the trailer frame and will be bonded to the wooden bed that is already bolted to the frame.  Polyurethane glue is used to glue the sidewalls to the bed.  Some builders use wood screws mainly to hold the sidewall while it dries.  

[[Image:Important-3.svg|10px|left]]However, the polyurethane glue, as good as it is, '''is really only gluing the top ply of the plywood'''.  It is unlikely the glue will fail, but the plywood could fail.  It does not take that much force to strip the top ply off plywood, especially if the plywood has been compromised by the elements.

[[Image:Teardrop wall attach1.jpg|thumb|Sidewall attached with polyurethane glue and bolts]]
So in addition to having the sidewall sit on top of the frame and polyurethane glued to the bed, it is a good idea to put 3.5 inch bolts through the sidewalls and through the wooden bed's wooden frame (made from 2x2s) with some big flat washers.  Position the bolts about a foot apart.  

Its really just a matter of having someone help you position the sidewall, drill the holes for the bolts, then take the sidewall down and coat the mating surfaces with polyurethane glue, and reposition and assemble with the bolts.  Let dry overnight. You can use the wooden scraps cut off the sidewall profile as temporary bracing to hold the sidewalls up.

== The Spars ==
[[Image:Teardrop spars1.jpg|thumb|Installing spars]]
[[Image:Teardrop spars2.jpg|thumb|Installing spars]]
Spars are simply the 2x2 pine wooden braces that will be placed across the roof line.  These are polyurethane glued in place and held with wood screws.  Standard 2x2s that you get from the lumber yard are usually pretty ugly and rough, so you might want to take the time to rip the sides of the 2x2s with a table saw so that you have nice looking spars.  This is especially true if you decide not to have an interior ceiling.

You need to take a few items into consideration when locating the spars:
* Roof seams - The 5.2mm luan only bends well across the narrow dimension (across the 4 ft dimension on a 4x8 sheet).  So you are looking at a seam every 4 feet.  You should plan on attaching your first sheet to the front of the wooden bed frame (front of the trailer), so from the bottom of the wooden bed up 4 feet is the end of your first roofing sheet.  A spar has to run under the center of this spot. Continuing up and back, you'll need spars centered under each seam.
* Curves - There needs to be multiple spars to support the front curve. This is a tight curve and even though the edges of the roofing luan will be attached to the sidewall's curved profile, the luan will tend to flatten out in the middle if there is not enough support.  So going around the curve you want spars about every 6 to 8 inches.  Spars can be farther apart on the flatter parts of the roof.
* Roof Vent - You need a couple of spars to support the edges of the roof vent and you might as well frame it in at this point.
* Hatch Hinge - Finally, at the rear you want to put 2 spars adjacent to each other to support the hatch hinge.

So the process is to carefully measure and mark where your spars should be. Then counter sink holes through the sidewalls. Finally, apply polyurethane glue and screw the spars in place.  You can then fill the counter sinks with wood filler.
[[Image:Teardrop_woodscrews.jpg|thumb|On right:Sidewall to Spar screws. On left: Luan roofing screws.]]
‎

== Laying the Luan ==

[[Image:Teardrop laying the luan.jpg|thumb|right|Laying the Luan]]
This is actually one of the easier jobs. Unfortunately you will not be able to use the full 4'x8' sheet of luan for your roof unless your trailer is really narrow (like 46&quot;).  The reason is that the luan bends in the narrow direction not the long direction. This means cutting a 49&quot; or 50&quot; piece from the 4'x8' sheet and wasting the rest. You want the luan to overhang the sides.  Unless you are a top notch woodworker and cut the sides perfectly identical and attached them so they are perfectly square, there is little chance of cutting a piece of luan such that it will line up on the sides - so we won't even try.  Not to mention the glue and bending will consume all of your attention; you don't want to have to focus on lining up the sides too.



[[Image:Info icon.svg|30px|left]]

If you recall in the previous section, the front radius should not be smaller than 20&quot; in order to bend the luan around it.  The larger the radius, the easier time you will have with the roof.  At exactly 20&quot; radius, the Author did actually snap a piece of 5.2 luan in half. The Author ended up fastening the luan at the top with screws then &quot;just&quot; starting the next row of screws and carefully tightened the entire row of screws incrementally (in a round-robin fashion) to slowly bend the luan over the curve.  Hence the recommendation to consider a 25&quot; or even a 30&quot; diameter curve if you want to avoid any issues.


You can cut the first piece of luan and start from the bottom front and work up and around to the back. Dry fit the first piece. The luan should line up square on the bottom front and the top of the luan edge should fall squarely in the middle of one of the spars - because that's how you planned it when fastening the spars. We don't care about the side edges of the luan as long as they are overhanging.

[[Image:Teardrop luan roof overhang.jpg|thumb|right|Luan overhanging the sidewalls waiting to be trimmed off]]

If everything looks good, remove the luan and apply polyurethane glue to the edges of the side walls and to the spar faces that contact the roof.  Again place the luan so that it is lined up on the bottom and start a screw in the middle of the bottom spar.  Check that the top still lines up to fall in the middle of the spar, then put in the remainder of the screws horizonally across the bottom.  I used 7 screws across for each spar including two edge screws that went into the side walls.

You repeat this process to cover the entire roof. Clean off any excess glue and let dry.  You can then use a router with a laminate trimming bit (with flush ball bearing guide) to trim off the over hang.

== Other Options ==

[[Image:Info icon.svg|30px|left]]
There are other ways of constructing the roof.  Many builders will install the interior roof paneling prior to the external roof. This allows them to easily slide the interior paneling through the spars to get it inside the trailer - a necessity on teardrop trailers constructed with a permanent galley. In addition they may join (glue) the entire interior paneling set together on a flat surface first. This is done to avoid seam covers on the inside and to facilitate bending around the interior curves.  Also, once the interior is attached, builders may run wiring and insulate the cavities prior to putting on the roof.

Another alternative is to use 1/8 inch luan (hard to find) or paneling for the roof and apply 2 layers. This is typical on some styles where the curves are tight.

Furthermore, many woody builders take up the challenge of not using screws. They use lots of clamps and nylon straps to hold the luan as the glue dries. This has the advantage of a smoother outer skin. 

With the build method we are using, the areas in-between the screws will not be perfectly flush with the area around the fastener and there is no built-in galley so getting materials inside the trailer through the back is not an issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Although physical MAC addresses are permanent by design, several mechanisms allow modification, or &quot;spoofing&quot;, of the MAC address that is reported by the operating system. This can be useful for privacy reasons, for instance when connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot, or to ensure interoperability. Some internet service providers bind their service to a specific MAC address; if the user then changes their network card or intends to install a router, the service won't work anymore. Changing the MAC address of the new interface will solve the problem. Similarly, some software licenses are bound to a specific MAC address. Changing the MAC address in this way is not permanent: after a reboot, it will revert to the MAC address physically stored in the card.

Other methods of changing the MAC address are permanent; at least one network card manufacturer bundles networking hardware with software that allows the user to change the MAC address. These network cards usually come with a bootable CD-ROM that executes a utility that permits the user to change the MAC address burned into the EEPROM. When a hardware-based solution is not utilized, the user who intends to change the MAC address must instead rely on a software-based solution. The appropriate software solution is dependent on the operating system installed on the computer. Various software-based solutions are described below.

As a MAC address can be changed, it can be unwise to rely on this as a single method of authentication. IEEE 802.1x is a standard better suited to authenticating devices at a low level.

== Overview ==

'''''Wilkie Twycross''''' is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] instructor from the Ministry of Magic.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Wilkie Twycross, an oddly insubstantial wizard, starts teaching Apparition to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s year group in February. It is a twelve-week course, and the expectation is that at the end of that time, any young Wizard taking the course would be able to pass their Apparition test. The cost of the course is 12 Galleons.

As is only to be expected, as the course progresses, Mr. Twycross is made fun of by many of the wizards taking his course. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], in particular, has unkind words for him and his teaching.

Chiles en nogada! 

&lt;big&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/big&gt; read carefully first then prepare (this is a spicy food)

==Ingredients==

* raisins
* peaches, about 6-9
* apples,about 5-7
* pears, about 4-6
* pepper poblano, about 10-15
* 10 eggs
* flour (a cup)
* Ground meat about one pound
* almonds about 20-30 (peeled)

&lt;big&gt;HINT:&lt;/big&gt;or if left in the watter for long time the skin falls off

==Procedure==
# Cut the almonds in four pieces or two and peel all the fruit and chop it up in very tiny pieces. Leave it aside
# Fry the ground meat in a pan with garlic and salt (to taste) in low flame with a spoon of oil.
# When the meat is cooked, in the same pan put the fruit and the raisins in and fry for about 4 minutes. After leave it to cool off.
# Put the poblano peppers on the stove and let them get toasted.
# After toasting them put the peppers in water and cut them on one of the long sides. Wash away the veins and the dark toasted spots on them.
# After, stuff with the fruit and the ground meat.
# Crack open the 10 eggs but only pour the whites. Beat until it puffs up. After add the flower and the yolk beat until it reaches a yellowish point.
# Dip the whole pepper in the yellowish content that you just prepared and put in a pan to fry until light brown. Do repeatedly until done with all the peppers

Put aside for step two


=Nogada=

That is the white content that is poured on the top of the pepper and gives it a fascinating taste!

==Ingredients==

*walnuts (about a pound) -it's better if they are already peeled or just put them in water and let them stay there overnight then taking the skin off is easier.
*half a cup of rum (liquor is optional)
*milk (5 cups) 
*white cheese (5-6 slices)

==Procedure==
#Put the walnuts, milk, cheese, and rum in the blender for about a minute. After it will look white if done right
#Pour on the peppers and enjoy!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">SwisTrack uses a list of so-called &lt;b&gt;components&lt;/b&gt; to process images. Each component is in charge of a specific processing step, e.g. image acquisition, background subtraction, thresholding, or blob detection. Getting the right result is a matter of putting the right components together - in the right order, of course. Each component can be configured, and SwisTrack provides a great interface to do this in real time, while showing all intermediate processing results.

This page tells you how to add and remove components, and how to configure them. If you want to know what components you should use for your task, have a look at the [[SwisTrack/Examples|examples]] section. A reference of all components is available on the [[SwisTrack/Components|component list]] page.

== Main Window ==

The main window of SwisTrack consists of three parts:

* The &lt;b&gt;main display&lt;/b&gt; in the center shows the current frame that is being processed. The frame can be displayed at (almost) all processing steps.
* The &lt;b&gt;component list&lt;/b&gt; at the bottom shows the currently selected components and their status. At the right of this list, you'll find two buttons to add or remove components, and two buttons to change the order of the components.
* The &lt;b&gt;configuration panel&lt;/b&gt; at the right allows you to configure the selected component.

In addition, SwisTrack shows a [[SwisTrack/The Timeline|timeline]] at the very bottom of the window.

[[Image:MainWindow-Empty.png||SwisTrack's main window]]

== Editing the Component List ==

To add a component, click the &lt;b&gt;plus (+)&lt;/b&gt; button on the right of the component list. A dialog will appear and allow you to select a component. Note that the available components are grouped by their category, and you'll often need a component of each category, in the order the categories are listed here.

Components are added to the end of your component list. To move them up and down, use the arrow buttons on the right side. To remove the selected component, simply click on the &lt;b&gt;minus (-)&lt;/b&gt; button.

The component list consists of several columns which indicate the type and the state of the component. Next to the name of the component, a few columns are filled with &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;'s, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;'s and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;'s. Each of these columns corresponds to a &lt;b&gt;channel&lt;/b&gt; (or a data structure), and the letters have the following meaning:
* &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;: The component is writing to this channel.
* &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;: The component is modifying (reading, then writing) this channel.
* &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;: The component reads from this channel, but doesn't change anything there.
Obviously, you first have to write something to a channel before you can read or modify it. Hence, if you look through each columns, all &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;'s and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;'s should be below the &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;'s. If this isn't the case, then you either forgot to add a component or placed the components in the wrong order.

In the column right after the component name, you may also see some &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;'s. These components include a trigger mechanism (which may be active or not), i.e. they tell SwisTrack when to process the next frame. A setup must have at least one trigger.

== Configuring and Testing your Setup ==

Once your component list contains a valid setup, you can process one frame by pressing the &lt;b&gt;Step&lt;/b&gt; button in the toolbar. This invokes each component in the order they are listed and displays the selected image (i.e. the output of the selected component). Once the frame is processed, the component list indicates the duration of each component, and perhaps error messages. (If you just added some components, it is quite likely that one or the other component will raise an error. You may have to configure them first.) Whenever an error occurs, SwisTrack stops the execution of the frame at that point and doesn't call the subsequent components.

When clicking on a component, SwisTrack displays its configuration panel on the right side of the window. You can now modify the settings and watch how this affects the image. Whenever you change a value, SwisTrack automatically performs a step - hence your modification becomes immediately visible on the screen.

As an advice, start at the top of your component list and configure the components in the order of execution. As the configuration heavily depends on component itself, refer to the online component documentation (link on the top of the configuration panel) for the meaning of each parameter.

While the &lt;b&gt;Step&lt;/b&gt; button processes one frame, the &lt;b&gt;Run&lt;/b&gt; button processes frames continously. In i&gt;run&lt;/i&gt; mode, the trigger components (those with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; next to their name) say when the next frame shall be processed. If you don't have any trigger component in your setup, add a &lt;i&gt;Timer Trigger&lt;/i&gt; component to configure the processing speed.

Finally, the &lt;b&gt;Reset&lt;/b&gt; button allows you to reset all components. Most of the time, SwisTrack finds out automatically when the setup must be restarted (especially when you change the configuration of a component), but there are cases where you want to that explicitely. When you hit the &lt;b&gt;Reset&lt;/b&gt; button, all components are adviced to completely reset their internal state and reload the configuration. This zeroes the frame counter and deletes the track history, for example.

== Running an Experiment ==

Once your setup is properly configured and working, you probably want to use it for your experiments. This is where the &lt;b&gt;Productive&lt;/b&gt; button enters the game.

Before you start your experiment, activate the &lt;b&gt;Productive&lt;/b&gt; button. This resets all components and starts them in productive mode. At the end of your experiment, simply hit the &lt;b&gt;Productive&lt;/b&gt; button again to release it and switch back to testing mode.

Productive mode has two main differences as compared to testing mode:
* In productive mode, SwisTrack &lt;i&gt;never resets the components automatically&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, only a subset of the configuration parameters are available any more, namely those which do not change the processing completely. For example, you can still adjust the exposure time of a camera, but you cannot change from color to grayscale mode. In addition, it is not possible to add, remove or reorder components in productive mode.
* Output components only write data to the file during productive mode. Hence, your the files contain the data of your experiments only. (Some other components also make slight differences between testing and productive mode. Refer to the [[SwisTrack/ComponentList|component documentation]] for details.)

== More Information ==

Now that you know the basics, you may want to have a closer look at the following chapters:

      <text xml:space="preserve">SwisTrack 4 is available under the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License (GPLv3)]. This license grants you the right to freely use it for your research or industrial application. On the other hand, whenever you extend or modify SwisTrack, you have to make your changes (derived work) available to the public.

The development of SwisTrack is indeed a collaborative effort and involves several research labs and researchers. Take part in this collaborative effort and help improving SwisTrack!

== Components ==

If you implement a component that somebody else may find useful, send it to the SwisTrack maintainers for inclusion in the SwisTrack main branch. This not only allows other labs to use your work, but also makes it easier for your and your fellow researchers to install SwisTrack in a new setup.

== Examples ==

Do you use SwisTrack for something out-of-the-ordinary? Did you run fancy experiments using SwisTrack? Did you interface SwisTrack with another program/system?

Write a wikibook page about your setup and send the files (SwisTrack configuration, scripts, source code, ...) to the [[SwisTrack/Developers/Mailing list| SwisTrack developer mailing list]] for inclusion in the SwisTrack main branch.

== Spread the Word ==

Let your fellow researchers know about SwisTrack, and show them how easy it is to track your robots, animals or other agents!
* [[File:SwisTrack_4_Poster_IROS_2008.pdf]] (Poster, IROS 2008 conference)


If you use SwisTrack for your research experiments, mention SwisTrack in your publication and include a reference to the SwisTrack wikibook.

== Bugs? Wishes? Ideas? ==

We are always open for bugs reports, wishes or ideas. Feel free to contact the current maintainer, or send an email to the [[SwisTrack/Developers/Mailing list|swistrack-devel]] mailing list.

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== Todays work! ==

Very helpful indeed - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Bugs ==

I love the look of the bugs page - Wikijunior has such quality to it.  I run a &quot;bot&quot; that can do things like change or add categories, check for typos and layout etc.  I'd be happy to help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
:If/when you work out a category structure let me have the details and I'll happily place them on the pages in a semi auto way - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:54, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
:Just let me know &amp; I'll do it as soon as I can - I have a &quot;soft&quot; spot for Wikijunior's quality and presentation --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

== Visual Basic Classic ==

Please don't just summarily delete images that have no copyright info.  It would be more efficient to notify the author first by adding an entry to the talk page of the author so that he or she can make an attempt to rectify the situation.  Then if nothing happens after a week or so of course carry on and delete.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:I've responded to this directly --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Hi ==

As I have been in touch with you about some bits I hope you won't mind me approaching you about something specific.  While vandalism is not the issue here that it is on Wikipedia we do still have a level of vandalism that needs tackling often by Admins as there are fewer users here than Wikipedia.  One of the tools that allows us to tackle vandals more easily is Checkuser.  This means that we can see the IP address a registered user has vandalised from and see if this may have happened before (it often has).  To get these rights required 25 affirmative votes which on a small wiki is not easy. A hard
working Admin is looking for just two more votes to get this.  If you would like to look at this then go here
[[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#SBJohnny_.28talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.7C_logs. 29]] and you are welcome to vote.  I must stress that you are under no pressure at all to do so and if you decide not to that is fine.  I do hope you do not mind me contacting you in this way - thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:And thanks for responding - I felt it was a bit cheeky but I hoped you would say no if you felt it - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

== Bots ==

OK - this is someone who &quot;uses&quot; things rather than necessarily understands them!  In practice there is far more on Wikipedia about bots too (I'm from there originally).  The one I use is [[w:AWB]].  There is quite a variety of things it can do from very basic typos and formatting, through adding or taking away categories through to quite advanced &quot;search &amp; replace&quot;.

On WP the use of semi auto bot type software is quite carefully controlled, here far less so (AWB can be run auto but I generally review changes before accepting them and run on an ordinary user account that would have to be the way).  However I have a bot account [[user:Herbys bot]] so I can run auto if I want (a bot account has to be approved).  I know there are folks who have &quot;written their own&quot; (Whiteknight for example) but tha is beyond me.

Enough waffle I guess - better if you have particular queries to get back to me again (&amp; you are welcome to do so).  I intend running the bot later today on basic cleanup stuff.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikijunior New Title Votes ==

Are you aware that you voted in an old Wikijunior new title vote?  The page you voted on was for the last few months of 2006.  Now you should vote on: [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter/2007-1st Quarter Vote]] [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Er, it seems that that wasn't the correct page either.  That vote finished on 31/Dec 2006.  I'll try to find the link for the current vote. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:47, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Try this page: [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter/2007-2nd Quarter Vote]]



== Re: My Bot ==

My &quot;bot&quot; essentially consists of a set of library modules, written in Perl. I have all the basic functionality written to edit pages (download text, upload changes, etc), and I'm working to expand on that functionality with a set of higher-level modules and client programs. At the moment, most of my programs are semi-automated, but the ability is there to make programs that are fully-automated as well. I haven't done any development on it at all recently, but I am going to be working on it more in the future. I hope this answers your questions --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

== Very odd indeed ==

When I'm bored I look into that - think you must have got caught up in some vandalism.  Should be ok now.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:09, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== Images ==

Bit late for me but if you don't get a good answer you'll get something from me tomorrow - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
::Further to my bit in the Staff lounge this may &quot;illuminate&quot; things a little more -[http://tools.wikimedia.de/~gunther/adminaktivitaet.php?dbname=enwikibooks_p].  If you have queries let me know (I probably asked the same things a fairly short time ago &lt;g&gt;) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:17, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

==Layout of New Bugs Main Page==

Hey Urbane User I just checked out the new userpage, and it looks very great in my opinion, I like the new layout it's nice and neat, and easier to look around in (especially the contents), so great job on it! [[User:Avenue of Covina|Avenue of Covina]] 04:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

== Sig ==

Not totally sure I understand you.  For the sig (I can almost do it blindfold - better than my normal typing!) if I don't type it I use the button on the editor (if you have .js enabled).  While you could template it you would have to type something to get the template (I'm guessing you have the sig set up in &quot;preferences&quot;).  Get back to me won't you (adopted or otherwise! - btw I see timezones as another issue with adoption - there are some folk I never see and some I always see?) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;;align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
:OK - to me &quot;Welcome&quot; consist of a copy and paste of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; which I find fairly automatic.  I confess I frequently use a text scratch pad which will have stuff like that it (used to have spedy deleted with frequently used reasons but I deleted then now!).  Equally I often do a batch at a time - for example take 500 on RC, exclude anons ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;hideanons=1&amp;limit=500]) and cast me eye over for red talk pages (sneaky if that put something on themselves!).  Then using tabbed browsing open them all up for a copy &amp; paste session?? Let me know - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Language project Freestyle ==

Welcome on board! I have recently set up the basic pages and templates for the project. You can access its main page following this link: [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Freestyle Freestyle].

Generally, there are two ways of creating new articles for this project: either you write an article from scratch or you adapt an actual text from [http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page English Wikinews]. All kinds of topics are welcome, e. g. breaking news, politics, gossip, texts about the English language and its dialects... choose what you thinkg might be interesting for a foreign reader.

Try to adapt your style of writing to the grade (beginner, mediocre, advanced) you write for. Here are some criteria that might be helpful:
* Beginner: short (100-120 words), easy grammar (present, straight sentences, no conditional), mostly day-by-day vocabulary. Suggested topics: breaking news, gossip, ...
* Mediocre: medium (150-200 words), mediocre grammar (present, past, future, easy conditional sentences). Suggested topics: usual daily press talk, ...
* Advanced: long (150-400 words), everything is allowed. Suggested topics: politics, art, literature, ...

I suggest we proceed thus: choose a topic, write an article and post it to the site http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Freestyle/TEXTTITLE, replacing TEXTTITLE by the headline of your article. Please provide the sources from which you have compiled the text. If possible, also provide a suitable picture from [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons]. Let me know when you have finished, then I will see to the formatting and annotating. Later on, I can show you how to do the basic formatting (headline, picture, date, sources) yourself. If you have questions, contact me at any time. --[[User:Bitbert|Bitbert]] 14:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Vandalism ==

[[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]] or [[Wikibooks:Administrators' noticeboard]] are both fine - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
:OK - dealt with but always feel free to revert stuff yourself - look at the history and edit the one before the vandalism.  Equally look at [[Wikibooks:Template messages/User talk namespace]] to find the messages you vcan places to warn people against vandalism - works quite often - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== Please notify users whose images you tag ==

I noticed that you tagged [[User:Willem Bol|Willem Bol]]'s image [[:Image:At class waves.jpg]]. Thank you for catching that! May I please ask, however, that you notify users whose images you tag. It is very helpful to them; and many times, they get your notice and appropriately tag the image right away! Just use &amp;#123;{subst:[[Template:image copyright|image copyright]]|Image:Image_name.ext}}   &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; Thank you! [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 22:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

== Image delinking and [[Freeware]] ==

I wanted to ask if you could please stop deleting red image links from pages, especially in this book. We have several people who are working hard on the image problem, tagging images, tracking down users, and sorting through years of backlog. I know that you have participated in this project some as well, so I hope you can understand the importance of this request. 

Once we get the image situation figured out, you can go back to business as usual. Thank you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

:No worries. Everybody wants to help out, but sometimes different people &quot;help&quot; in contradictory ways. I know that you are a good helper, and I don't want to see your hard work get undone by our other good helpers. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== AdnanSa ==
Thank you for nice words :) I shell try develop wikibooks on bosnian language, especialy books for kids, so I don't think I'll contribute much on this wiki, but who knows :) Maybe one day. [[User:AdnanSa|AdnanSa]] 16:03, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

== Main page ==

I have started a discussion about this at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Changes_to_main_page]] where it suggests [[Wikibooks:Nearly_complete]] as a main page. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:38, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

I agree with your comments on the staff lounge. The change to the Main Page that has turned it into a Library Catalogue looks like a retrograde step. It needs an admin to change it to something more relevant (See [[Main Page/test]]) [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== NoEditSection ==

Hi... this tag makes the blue &quot;edit&quot; link above the header sections on a page disappear. (I have no idea why it's used, but that's what it does :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:52, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
:Hi - apologies for the delay in the reply - I've been away for a few days. You seem to have had an answer to the query and I can only confirm what Johnny said - it prevents someone adding a section to a page via a top &quot;+&quot; tab.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== Alphabetizing ==

Thanks. Makes things easier to find. ;P --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Page deletion ==

I know that we can track down blanked pages, but it does help out if you can leave the {{tl|delete}} tags on the pages if you think they need to be deleted.  I tracked down some pages you blanked, but had earlier marked them for speedy delete.

Anyway, thank you for trying to help out Wikibooks in your own way, and this sort of page cleanup is certainly helpful and important.  Keep up the effort here!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== Popups ==

:I can change your username if you want, just let me know what the new user name should be. In the database, all users are identified by a unique ID number, and all your contributions are attributed to that number, not to any particular user name. To that effect, when your name is changed, your entire contribution history will be updated to use your new name and not your old one. Besides the signatures you've posted in discussions, there will be almost no record at all that this username ever existed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:33, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

Hi Urbane,

I read your Wikijunior Bug. Very impressed and interested in knowing more about your experience related to this particular book project (Wikijunior Bug) I'm current a doctoral student at Indiana University. My advisor and I, we are starting a Wikibook study regarding to online authors' beliefs and perceptions (motivation to write a Wikibook, beliefs about the knowledge of the topic, previous experience and success in writing a Wikibook, and ability to help coordinate the Wikibook project and interact with other authors). We would love to invite you to participate in this study. Your input to this study will be greatly appreciated. If you agree to participate, please leave me a message or send me an email. (My email is cl17@indiana.edu.) We'll schedule a one hour interview with you at your convenience by phone or by email (email interview). Thank you very much again. inkeys

World War II is the winner. I am nervous about launching a book with so little support. (Particularly so because I myself have little interest in working on it.) But the system is what it is. This is one of the reasons I'm lobbying for changing this so that we just launch books whenever there are enough people who have expressed support, (and we don't launch books when there is not enough support.) We probably need to see if we can get some support from outside [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:World_War_II Wikipedia World War II talk] might be a good place to ask for help. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:36, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

== Questions Regarding Pre-university courses ==

Hi Urbane, I've started doing a little writing for the Primary School Mathematics course, which seems much more like a book than a course.  

I've noticed three courses in the Pre-university courses section of the Wikiversity:School of Mathematics page

Basic Mathematics (numbers, arithmetic, fractions, decimals)
 
Primary School Mathematics (numbers, arithmetic, pre-algebra) 

High School Mathematics (algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus) 

The Primary School Mathematics course specifies on the first page that it is &quot;not for students but for parents and teachers&quot;.  I understood this to mean that the reader should have some competency in math and so I created and started writing what I thought the content of the '''Primary School Mathematics''' pages should be in an &quot;Overview&quot; chapter.  However, I then noticed that the High School Mathematics course (in the '''same''' category of courses, is intended to actually '''teach''' the various subjects of mathematics.

I see a problem here.  Actually, I'm not sure that the Primary School Mathematics &quot;course&quot; is really a course at all. I see it more as an aid to teachers and parents in understanding how the new math is taught.

It makes very little sense to me that the course should be to teach Primary school mathematics.  Surely any adult (with very, very few exceptions) that is able to parse its pages has these basic math skills, so I am treating the book as more of a pedagogical treatise for the layman and/or the teacher whose specialty is not mathematics.  Am I going about this wrong?

If you are unable to help me with these questions, can you please point me in the right direction?  Thanks [[User:Leightwing|Leightwing]] 21:43, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

Please remember to substitute for [[Template:no license]]. Otherwise it will always say &quot;to be deleted on or after&quot; and then some date a week from whenever you view it.

Also, if you use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:nld}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; it will automatically enter the date for you - it's a lot faster! Thanks for all the image tagging you do.

== PDF ==

I saw your question on withinfocus's talk page. This might be worth discussing in the staff lounge. I don't think including the GFDL license tag on the page would be enough. While the text is required to be released under the GFDL, images are not. I believe while it would be a pain to do, you or someone else would need to verify that the PDF file is actually based on a book here, that the GFDL is properly included within the file, that all images used are released under a free image license and include the license information within the file, and all attribution/required information by each license is properly included. I think it would be necessary to delete it if all that is not meet. Perhaps a new template is needed for including on pages within the Image namespace for pdf files that have had all that verified. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:15, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

I noticed your msg on JWSchmid's talk page concerning this image.

I've replaced nld with {{tlx|GFDL-self}} and removed the copyright notice from JWSchmid's talk page.

If you find any other images which describe what terms they releasing under, such as GFDL, just go ahead and rm the nld template if there is one and add the appropriate license. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:59, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

I'll always block for a week at least, if I can find more info ([http://tools.wikimedia.de/~luxo/contributions/contributions.php?lang=en with this maybe]) then longer.

== Untagged / Unlicensed Images ==

I don't know if you've noticed yet, since it depends some on your browser's cache, your cache preferences on Wikibooks, and what skin your using, but there may be two links called &quot;untagged&quot; and &quot;unlicensed&quot; that show up now on user pages, that you may find useful in your quest to deal with images and other files missing copyright information and license tags. The untagged link shows any files uploaded by the user that haven't been tagged, not even with {{tlx|nld}}. The second shows uploads by that user which have been tagged with {{tlx|nld}}. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:58, 16 September 2007 (UTC)

Hello.  I am new to Wikibooks so I am unsure what I need to do to make everything alright with my page.  I am a student at Virginia Tech who is working on a project for class in accordance with one of the authors, Dr. Fox.  Please let me know what I need to do so my page is not deleted.

:I've now acted on the information provided and tagged it as a copyvio with a termination date of about a week. You or [[User:Urbane]] or anyone that has time and disposition could attempt to get the permission from UNESCO (I don't perceive that as improbable, since it falls on the dictates of the organization to enable such uses, I have provided information on were to look for it on the VfD page).

== ETD Guide Cvio Question ==

I have a couple questions about the how to correctly get copyright permissions.  Myself and Dr. Edward Fox are getting in contact with UNESCO and am positive that it won't be a problem.  However, being as there are multiple authors in this piece of work, is permission from UNESCO enough or do we need permission from all authors as well?

Also, being as this is something that we would like to have continually updated over the years but also keep the integrity of the work in the ETD guide, is there any way to lock editing of this ETD guide wiki to only certain users?  Please let me know as soon as you get the chance.  Thank you. --[[User:Kmill56]]

Dear Ed,

Nice to hearing from you. 

It is with pleasure that UNESCO grants permission to publish the Guide
on Wikibooks.

Best wishes

Importance: High

Hi!

I'm resending the msg below to be sure it reaches you.

Please see 
 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Guide_for_Electronic_Theses_and_Dissertations
It will look bad for UNESCO and NDLTD etc. if we cannot get the label
removed:
   POSSIBLE COPYRIGHT VIOLATION

Can you please send me a written permission statement allowing NDLTD to
make available the Guide through wikibooks (and possibly have parts in
wikiversity and wikipedia, to promote interest and visibility)?

It is important that:

* students working on this now be able to proceed, since there is now
only about a month left in our semester,

* we have this as a way to update and keep the Guide current, on into
the future, to support ongoing growth of ETD activities.

We thank you for your time and assistance!

Sincerely, Ed Fox (Executive Director, NDLTD)

PS We hope you are well!

Hi!

How are you?

It has been a while since we have been in touch.

First, I should thank you again for all your support with regard to ETD
activities worldwide!

Second, I should ask if there are other things going on at UNESCO that
might relate that we should discuss?

Third, I wonder if you can provide a written permission statement
allowing the making of an updated version of the ETD Guide accessible
through wikibooks (see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page).  I have
some people ready to work on this now, but the wikibooks people won't
allow us to proceed without written permission.

We look forward to your comments. Many thanks, Ed

Are the licensing issues for this taken care of? I thought you had received an email, but it required verification? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:11, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

=== from [[m:User talk:Sj]] ===

Hi Sj,

I saw you listed on the OTRS page. I am an administrator over at Wikibooks and I was wondering if you could answer a question that i need answering. The book [[b:The Guide for Electronic Theses and Dissertations]] is not currenly licensed under the GFDL, it is copyrighted. The owners have expressed an interest in allowing the book to be used on wikibooks. However, they are not entirely sure how to do this. 

Upon holding conversations with other user's and contributors to the wikimedia projects, I am under the impression that there are two key ways of making this happen. The first involves the copyright holder altering the copyright notice on their website, the other involves the OTRS system, through the permissions channel. However, i am not familiar with the OTRS system and before i can explain how it works to the copyright owner, I need to know myself.
: I would recommend that they clearly state the new license on their website, preferably with a scan of a signed document that can be uploaded there and on wikibooks itself.  They could also email the same image to the permissions mailing list.  

Would the copyright owner need to send an email directly to the OTRS channel, or could correspondance be forwarded from myself? What exactly needs to be sent in the email outlining permission? Where exactly would permission need to be sent? etc...

If you could please mull over these questions and get back to me as soon as possible, it would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Urbane,

I removed so much information on the learning theories webpage because I posted on a wrong page. I was supposed to post information on the WebQuests in ESL/EFL contexts page, not on the main page.

== Username change ==

Hi Reece. Would you like me to make a full name change for you?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Tables=
[[Image:EMPLOYEE Table (Database).PNG|left]]

A [[w:Table (database)|table]] is the basic persist structure of a relational database.  A table contains a list of columns which define the table's structure, and a list of rows that define the table's data.  Each column has a specific type and generally size.  The standard set of relational types are limited to basic types including numeric, character, date-time, and binary (although most modern databases have additional types and typing systems).  Tables can also have constraints that define the rules which restrict the row data, such as primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints.  Tables also have other artifacts such as indexes, partitions and triggers.

A typical mapping of a persist class will map the class to a single table.  In JPA this is defined through the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Table.html @Table]&lt;/code&gt; annotation or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; XML element.  If no table annotation is present, the JPA implementation will auto assign a table for the class. The JPA default table name is the name of the class (minus the package) with the first letter capitalized.  Each attribute of the class will be stored in a column in the table.

===Example mapping annotations for an entity with a single table===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
@Table(name=&quot;EMPLOYEE&quot;)
public class Employee {
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example mapping XML for an entity with a single table===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;EMPLOYEE&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=Advanced=

Although in the ideal case each class would map to a single table, this is not always possible.
Other scenarios include:
* [[#Multiple tables |Multiple tables]] : One class maps to 2 or multiple tables.
* [[Java Persistence/Advanced Topics#Filters |Sharing tables]] : 2 or multiple classes are stored in the same table.
* [[Java Persistence/Inheritance |Inheritance]] : A class is involved in inheritance and has an inherited and local table.
* [[Java Persistence/Advanced Topics#Views |Views]] : A class maps to a view.
* [[Java Persistence/Advanced Topics#Stored procedures |Stored procedures]] : A class maps to a set of stored procedures.
* [[Java Persistence/Advanced Topics#Partitioning |Partitioning]] : Some instances of a class map to one table, and other instances to another table.
* [[Java Persistence/Advanced Topics#Replication |Replication]] : A class's data is replicated to multiple tables.
* [[Java Persistence/Advanced Topics#History |History]] : A class has historical data.

These are all advanced cases, some are handled by the JPA Spec and many are not.  The following sections investigate each of these scenarios further and include what is supported by the JPA spec, what can be done to workaround the issue within the spec, and how to use some JPA implementations extensions to handle the scenario.

==Multiple tables==
[[Image:Emp Tables (Database).PNG|left]]
Sometimes a class maps to multiple tables.  This typically occurs on legacy or existing data models where the object model and data model do not match.  It can also occur in inheritance when subclass data is stored in additional tables.  Multiple tables may also be used for performance, partitioning or security reasons.

JPA allows multiple tables to be assigned to a single class.  The &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/SecondaryTable.html @SecondaryTable]&lt;/code&gt; and SecondaryTables annotations or &lt;code&gt;&lt;secondary-table&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements can be used.  By default the &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; column(s) are assumed to be in both tables, such that the secondary table's &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; column(s) are the primary key of the secondary table and a foreign key to the first table.  If the first table's &lt;code&gt;@Id&lt;/code&gt; column(s) are not named the same the &lt;code&gt;[https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/PrimaryKeyJoinColumn.html @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;primary-key-join-column&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be used to define the foreign key join condition.

In a multiple table entity, each mapping must define which table the mapping's columns are from.  This is done using the &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;@Column&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@JoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; annotations or XML elements.  By default the primary table of the class is used, so you only need to set the table for secondary tables.  For inheritance the default table is the primary table of the subclass being mapped.

===Example mapping annotations for an entity with multiple tables===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
@Table(name=&quot;EMPLOYEE&quot;)
@SecondaryTable(name=&quot;EMP_DATA&quot;,
                pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;ID&quot;)
               )
public class Employee {
    ...
    @Column(name=&quot;YEAR_OF_SERV&quot;, table=&quot;EMP_DATA&quot;)
    private int yearsOfService;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name=&quot;MGR_ID&quot;, table=&quot;EMP_DATA&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;ID&quot;)
    private Employee manager;
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example mapping XML for an entity with multiple tables===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity name=&quot;Employee&quot; class=&quot;org.acme.Employee&quot; access=&quot;FIELD&quot;&gt;
    &lt;table name=&quot;EMPLOYEE&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;secondary-table name=&quot;EMP_DATA&quot;&gt;
        &lt;primary-key-join-column name=&quot;EMP_ID&quot; referenced-column-name=&quot;ID&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/secondary-table&gt;
    &lt;attributes&gt;
        ...
        &lt;basic name=&quot;yearsOfService&quot;&gt;
            &lt;column name=&quot;YEAR_OF_SERV&quot; table=&quot;EMP_DATA&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/basic&gt;
        &lt;one-to-one name=&quot;manager&quot;&gt;
            &lt;join-column name=&quot;MGR_ID&quot; table=&quot;EMP_DATA&quot; referenced-column-name=&quot;ID&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/one-to-one&gt;
    &lt;/attributes&gt;
&lt;/entity&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

With the &lt;code&gt;@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt; the name refers to the foreign key column in the secondary table and the referencedColumnName refers to the primary key column in the first table.  If you have multiple secondary tables, they must always refer to the first table.  When defining the table's schema typically you will define the join columns in the secondary table as the primary key of the table, and a foreign key to the first table.  Depending how you have defined your foreign key constraints, the order of the tables can be important, the order will typically match the order that the JPA implementation will insert into the tables, so ensure the table order matches your constraint dependencies.

For relationships to a class that has multiple tables the foreign key (join column) always maps to the primary table of the target.  JPA does not allow having a foreign key map to a table other than the target object's primary table.  Normally this is not an issue as foreign keys almost always map to the id/primary key of the primary table, but in some advanced scenarios this may be an issue.  Some JPA products allow the column or join column to use the qualified name of the column (i.e. &lt;code&gt;@JoinColumn(referenceColumnName=&quot;EMP_DATA.EMP_NUM&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, to allow this type of relationship.  Some JPA products may also support this through their own API, annotations or XML.

==Multiple tables with foreign keys==
[[Image:Emp Add Tables (Database).PNG|left]]
Sometimes you may have a secondary table that is referenced through a foreign key from the primary table to the secondary table instead of a foreign key from the secondary table to the primary table.  You may even have a foreign key between two of the secondary tables.  Consider having an &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt; table where &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; refers to &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt; through an &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS_ID&lt;/code&gt; foreign key, and (for some strange reason) you only want a single Employee class that has the data from both tables.  The JPA spec does not cover this directly, so if you have this scenario the first thing to consider, if you have the flexibility, is to change your data model to stay within the confines of the spec.  You could also change your object model to define a class for each table, in this case an Employee class and an Address class, which is typically the best solution.  You should also check with you JPA implementation to see what extensions it supports in this area.

One way to solve the issue is simply to swap your primary and secondary tables.  This will result in having the secondary table referencing the primary tables primary key and is within the spec.  This however will have side-effects, one being that you now changed the primary key of your object from &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS_ID&lt;/code&gt;, and may have other mapping and querying implications.  If you have more than 2 tables this also may not work.

Another option is to just use the foreign key column in the &lt;code&gt;@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&lt;/code&gt;, this will technically be backward, and perhaps not supported by the spec, but may work for some JPA implementations.  However this will result in the table insert order not matching the foreign key constraints, so the constraints will need to be removed, or deferred.

It is also possible to map the scenario through a database view.  A view could be defined joining the two tables and the class could be mapped to the view instead of the tables.  Views are read-only on some databases, but many also allow writes, or allow triggers to be used to handle writes.

Some JPA implementations provide extensions to handle this scenarios.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Provides a proprietary API for its mapping model &lt;code&gt;ClassDescriptor.addForeignKeyFieldNameForMultipleTable()&lt;/code&gt; that allows for arbitrary complex foreign keys relationships to be defined among the secondary tables.  This can be configured through using a &lt;code&gt;@DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; annotation and &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; class.

==Multiple table joins==
[[Image:Emp Adds Tables (Database).PNG|left]]
Occasionally the data model and object model do not get along very well at all.  The database could be a legacy model and not fit very well with the new application model, or the DBA or object architect may be a little crazy.  In these cases you may require advanced multiple table joins.

Examples of these include having two tables related not by their primary or foreign keys, but through some constant or computation.  Consider having an &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; table and an &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt; table, the &lt;code&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt; table has an &lt;code&gt;EMP_ID&lt;/code&gt; foreign key to the &lt;code&gt;EMPLOYEE&lt;/code&gt; table, but there are several addresses for each employee and only the address with the &lt;code&gt;TYPE&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;&quot;HOME&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is desired.  In this case data from both of the tables is desired to be mapped in the &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; object.  A join expression is required where the foreign key matches and the constant matches.

Again this scenario could be handled through redesigning the data or object model, or through using a view.  Some JPA implementations provide extensions to handle this scenarios.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Provides a proprietary API for its mapping model &lt;code&gt;DescriptorQueryManager.setMultipleTableJoinExpression()&lt;/code&gt; that allows for arbitrary complex multiple table joins to be defined.  This can be configured through using a &lt;code&gt;@DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; annotation and &lt;code&gt;DescriptorCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; class.

==Multiple table outer joins==
Another perversion of multiple table mapping is to desire to outer join the secondary table.  This may be desired if the secondary may or may not have a row defined for the object.  Typically the object should be read-only if this is to be attempted, as writing to a row that may or may not be there can be tricky.

This is not directly supported by JPA, and it is best to reconsider the data model or object model design if faced with this scenario.  Again it is possible to map this through a database view, where an outer join is used to join the tables in the view.

Some JPA implementation support using outer joins for multiple tables.

:[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] : This can be accomplished through using the Hibernate &lt;code&gt;@Table&lt;/code&gt; annotation and set its &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.  This will configure Hibernate to use an outer join to read the table, and will not write to the table if all of the attributes mapping to the table are null.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]], [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : If the database supports usage of outer join syntax in the where clause (Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server), then the multiple table join expression could be used to configure an outer join to be used to read the table.

==Tables with special characters and mixed case==
Some JPA providers may have issues with table and column names with special characters, such as spaces.  In general it is best to use standard characters, no spaces, and all uppercase names.  International languages should be ok, as long as the database and JDBC driver supports the character set.

It may be required to &quot;quote&quot; table and column names with special characters or in some cases with mixed case.  For example if the table name had a space it could be defined as the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
  @Table(&quot;\&quot;Employee Data\&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Some databases support mixed case table and column names, and others are case insensitive.  If your database is case insensitive, or you wish your data model to be portable, it is best to use all uppercase names.  This is normally not a big deal with JPA where you rarely use the table and column names directly from your application, but can be an issue in certain cases if using native SQL queries.

==Table qualifiers, schemas, or creators==
A database table may require to be prefixed with a table qualifier, such as the table's creator, or its' namespace, schema, or catalog.  Some databases also support linking a table on other database, so the link name can also be a table qualifier.

In JPA a table qualifier can be set on a table through the &lt;code&gt;schema&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt; catalog &lt;/code&gt; attribute.  Generally it does not matter which attribute is used as both just result in prefixing the table name.  Technically you could even include the full name &quot;schema.table&quot; as the table's name and it would work.  The benefit of setting the prefix in the schema or catalog is a &lt;i&gt;default&lt;/i&gt; table qualifier can be set for the entire persistence unit, also not setting the real table name may impact native SQL queries.

If all of your tables require the same table qualifier, you can set the default in the orm.xml.

===Example mapping annotations for an entity with a qualified table===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
@Entity
@Table(name=&quot;EMPLOYEE&quot;, schema=&quot;ACME&quot;)
public class Employee {
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example mapping XML for default (entire persistence unit) table qualifier===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity-mappings&gt;
    &lt;persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
        &lt;persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
            &lt;schema name=&quot;ACME&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
    &lt;/persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
    ....
&lt;/entity-mappings&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example mapping XML for default (orm file) table qualifier===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entity-mappings&gt;
    &lt;schema name=&quot;ACME&quot;/&gt;
    ...
&lt;/entity-mappings&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Mastery Learning===
This term refers to an instructional approach in which all students learn material to an identical, high level, even if some students require more time than others to do so (Gentile, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, R. (2004). Assessing fundamentals in every course through mastery. In M. Achacoso &amp; Marilla Sviniki (Eds.), ''New Directions in Teaching and Learning, Volume 100,'' pp. 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt;. In '''mastery learning''' the teacher directs learning, though sometimes only in the indirect sense of finding, writing, and orchestrating specific modules or units for students to learn. In one typical mastery learning program, the teacher introduces a few new concepts or topics through a brief lecture or teacher-led demonstration. Then she might give an ungraded assignment or test immediately in order to assess how well students have learned the material, and which children still need help with it. The students who have already learned the unit are given enrichment activities. Those needing more help are provided with individual tutoring or with additional self-guiding materials that clarify the initial content; they work until they have in fact mastered the content (hence the name mastery learning). At that point students take another test or do another assignment to show that they have in fact learned the material to the expected, high standard. When the system is working well, therefore, all students can in principle end up with the highest scores or grades, although some usually take longer to do so than others.

As you might suspect, mastery learning poses two challenges. The first is ''ethical'': is it really fair to give enrichment only to faster students and remediation only to slower students? This practice could deteriorate into continually rewarding the fast with interesting enrichment material, while continually punishing the slow with repetitious material. In using the approach, therefore, it is important to make all materials interesting, whether enrichment or remedial. It is also important to make sure that the basic learning goals of each unit are truly important—even crucial—for everyone to learn, so that even slower individuals spend their time well. 

The other challenge of mastery learning is more ''practical'': the approach makes strong demands for detailed, highly organized curriculum. If the approach is to work, the teacher must either find such a curriculum, write one herself, or assemble a suitable mixture of published and self-authored materials. However it is created, the end result has be a program filled with small units of study as well as ample enrichment and remedial materials. Sometimes these practical requirements can be challenging to provide. But not always; some subjects (like mathematics) lend themselves to detailed, sequential organization especially well. In many cases, too, commercial publishers have produced curricula already organized for use as a mastery learning program (Fox, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E. J. (2004). ''The personalized system of instruction: A flexible and effective approach to mastery learning.'' San Diego: Elsevier Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Direct Instruction===
Sometimes this term serves as a synonym for teacher-directed instruction, but more often direct instruction refers to a relatively scripted version of mastery learning, meaning that it not only organizes the curriculum into small modules or units, but it also dictates how teachers should teach, including even the words they should speak while teaching (Adams &amp; Engelmann, 1996; Magliaro, Lockee, &amp; Burton, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Adams, G. &amp; Engelmann, S. (1996). ''Research on direct instruction: 25 years beyond DISTAR.'' Seattle, WA: Educational Achievement Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magliaro, S., Lockee, B., &amp; Burton, J. (2005). Direct instruction revisited: A key model for instructional technology. ''Educational technology research and development, 53''(4), 41-55.&lt;/ref&gt;. The organization and teaching scripts are based on a mix of ideas from behaviorism and cognitive theories of learning. In keeping with behaviorism, for example, the teacher is supposed to praise students immediately and explicitly when they give a correct answer. In keeping with cognitive theory, on the other hand, she is supposed to state learning objectives in advance of teaching them (providing a sort of mini-advance organizer), and provide frequent reviews of materials and checks on how well students are learning. The teacher is also supposed to introduce material in small, logical steps, giving individuals plenty of time to practice.

Direct instruction programs share one of the challenges of other mastery learning programs: because they hold all students to the same high standard of achievement, they must deal with differences in how long students require to reach the standard. But direct instruction has another challenge of its own. Such programs often rely on small-group interaction more heavily than do other mastery learning programs, and use self-guiding materials comparatively less. The good news about this difference is that direct instruction works especially well with younger students (especially kindergarten through third-grade), who may have limited literacy skills. The challenge is that heavy use of face-to-face group interaction makes it impractical to use direct instruction with an entire class, or for the entire school day. Nevertheless, within these limits, research has found direct instruction to be very effective in teaching basic skills such as early reading and arithmetic (Adams &amp; Engelmann, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Adams, G. &amp; Engelmann, S. (1996). ''Research on direct instruction: 25 years beyond DISTAR.'' Seattle, WA: Educational Achievement Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Madeline Hunter’s Effective Teaching Model===
Many teacher-directed strategies have been combined by Madeline Hunter into a single, relatively comprehensive approach that she calls '''mastery teaching''' (not to be confused with the related term mastery learning) or the '''effective teaching model''' (M. Hunter, 1982; R. Hunter, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M. (1982). ''Mastery teaching: Increasing instructional effectiveness in elementary and secondary schools.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R. (2004). ''Madeline Hunter’s mastery teaching.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Important features of the model are summarized in [[Table 8-X.]] As you can see, its features span all phases of contact with students—before, during, and after lessons or activities. 

What happens before a lesson actually begins? Like many other forms of teacher-directed instruction, the effective teaching model requires curricula and learning goals that are tightly organized and inter-related, yet divisible into small parts, ideas, or skills. In teaching about photosynthesis, for example, the teacher (or at least her curriculum) needs to identify the basic elements that contribute to this process, and how they relate to each other. With photosynthesis, the elements include the sun, plants, animals, chlorophyll, oxygen produced by plants and consumed by animals, and carbon dioxide that produced by animals and consumed by plants. The roles of these elements also need to be identified and expressed at a level appropriate for the students. With advanced science students, oxygen, chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide may be expressed as part of a complex chemical reaction; with first-grade students, though, they may be expressed simply as parts of a process akin to breathing, called respiration.

Once this analysis of the curriculum has been done, teachers using the effective teaching model make the most of the lesson time by creating an anticipatory set, which is an activity that focuses or orients the attention of students to the upcoming content. Creating an anticipatory set may consist, for example, of posing one or more questions drawing on students’ everyday knowledge or on knowledge of prior lessons. In teaching about differences between fruits and vegetables, the teacher could start by asking, “If you are making a salad strictly of fruit, which of these would be OK to use: apple, tomato, cucumber, or orange?” (Answer: all of them!) As the lesson proceeds, information needs to be offered in short, logical pieces, using language as familiar as possible to the students. Examples should be plentiful and varied: if the purpose is to define and distinguish fruits and vegetables, for example, then defining features should be presented singly or at most just a few at a time, with several clear-cut examples presented of each feature. Sometimes models or analogies also help in explaining examples, and can be used. A teacher can say, “Think of a fruit as a sort of ‘decoration’ on the plant, because if you pick it, the plant will go on living.” Models can also mislead students, however, if they are not used thoughtfully, since they may contain features that differ from the original concepts. In likening a fruit to a decoration, for example, students may overlook the essential role of fruit in plant reproduction, or think that lettuce qualifies as a fruit, since picking a few lettuce leaves does not usually kill a lettuce plant.

Throughout a lesson, the teacher repeatedly checks for understanding by asking questions that call for active thinking on the part of students. One way is to require all students to respond somehow, either with an actual choral response (speaking in unison together) or with a non-verbal signal like raising hands to indicate answers to questions. In teaching about fruits and vegetables, for example, a teacher can ask, “Here’s a list of fruits and vegetables. As I point to each one, raise your hand if it’s a fruit, but not if it’s a vegetable.” Or she can ask, “Here’s a list of fruits and vegetables. Say together what each on is as I point to it; you say ‘fruit’ or ‘vegetable’, whichever applies.” Even though some students may hide their ignorance by letting more knowledgeable classmates do the responding, the general level or quality of response can still give a rough idea of how well students as a group are understanding. General checks can be supplemented, of course, with questions addressed to individuals, or with questions to which individuals must respond briefly in writing. A teacher can ask everyone, “Give me an example of one fruit and one vegetable,” and then call on individuals to answer. Or she can say, “I want everyone to make a list with two columns, one listing all the fruits you can think of and the other listing all the vegetables you can think of.”

As a lesson draws to a close, the teacher arranges students to engage in further independent practice. The point of this practice is not primarily to explore new material or ideas, but to consolidate or strengthen the recent learning. At the end of a lesson about long division, for example, the teacher can make a transition to independent practice by introducing a set of additional problems similar to the ones she explained during the lesson. After working one or two with the students, she can turn the rest of the task over to the students to practice on their own. But note a proviso. For students to be fully focused and motivated, such practice has to be organized into small, meaningful amounts and students’ understanding has be checked by the teacher frequently. Even when students need a lot of practice, therefore, a long set of practice problems needs to be broken up initially into small subsets of problems, and either written or oral feedback offered in between subsets.

===What Are the Limits of Teacher-Directed Instruction?===
Whatever the grade level, most of the subjects usually taught in schools have at least some features or parts that benefit from direct instruction. Even activities or skills intended to foster creativity can benefit from a direct approach at certain times: learning to draw, paint, or write a poem, for example, requires learning techniques that may be easier to learn if presented sequentially in relatively small units. Research supports the usefulness of teacher-directed instruction, when it is designed well and implemented as intended, for a variety of educational contexts (Rosenshine &amp; Mesister,1995; Good &amp; Brophy, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenshine, B., &amp; Mesister, C. (1995). Direct instruction. In L. W. Anderson (Ed.), ''International encyclopedia of teaching and teacher education'' (pp. 143-149). Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good, T. &amp; Brophy, J. (2004). ''Looking in classrooms, 9th  edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;, and teachers themselves tend to support the approach in principle (Demant &amp; Yates, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Demant, M. &amp; Yates, G. (2003). Primary teachers’ attitudes about direct instruction. ''Educational psychology, 23''(5), 483-489.&lt;/ref&gt;.

But there are limits to its usefulness. Some are the practical ones that we have pointed out already. Teacher-directed instruction, whatever the form, requires a well-organized curriculum, or at least requires well-organized units of instruction, in advance of when students are to learn. Such curricula or units may not always be available, and it may not always be realistic to expect busy teachers to devise their own. Other limits of teacher direction, however, have more to do with the very nature of learning. Some critics argue, for example, that organizing material on behalf students encourages students to be passive—an ironic, but clearly undesirable side effect (Kohn, 2000, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2000). ''The schools our children deserve: Moving beyond traditional classrooms and “tougher standards.”'' Boston: Mariner Books.
Kohn, A. (2006). ''The homework myth.'' Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Lifelong Books.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to this criticism, the mere fact that a curriculum or unit of study is constructed by a teacher (or by a curriculum writer) implies to some students that they should not seek information actively on their own, but wait for it to arrive from elsewhere. In support of this argument, critics point to the fact that teacher-directed instructional approaches sometimes contradict their own premises by including tasks requiring students to do a bit of conceptual organization of their own. This happens, for example, when a Mastery Learning program provides enrichment material to faster students to work on independently; in that case the teacher may be involved in the enrichment activities only minimally.

Considerations like these have led to additional instructional approaches that are rely more explicitly on students themselves to seek and organize their own learning. In the next section of [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]], we discuss some of these options. As you will see, student-centered models of learning do tend to solve certain problems of teacher-directed instruction, but they also can have problems of their own.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Student-centered models of learning''' shift some of the responsibility for directing and organizing learning from the teacher to the student. Being student-centered does not mean, however, that a teacher gives up organizational and leadership responsibilities completely. It only means a relative shift in the teacher’s role, toward one with more emphasis on guiding students’ self-chosen directions. As we explained earlier in this chapter, teacher-directed strategies do not making taking over responsibility for students’ learning completely; no matter how much a teacher structures or directs learning, the students still have responsibility for working and expending effort to comprehend new material. By the same token, student-centered models of learning do not mean handing over all organizational work of instruction to students. The teacher is still the most knowledgeable member of the class, and still has both the opportunity and the responsibility to guide learning in directions that are productive.

As you might suspect, therefore, teacher-directed and student-centered approaches to instruction may overlap in practice. You can see the overlap clearly, for example, in two instructional strategies commonly thought of as student-centered, independent study and self-reflection. In independent study, as the name implies, a student works alone a good deal of the time, consulting with a teacher only occasionally. Independent study may be student-centered in the sense that the student may be learning a topic or skill—an exotic foreign language, for example—that is personally interesting. But the opposite may also be true: the student may be learning a topic or skill that a teacher or an official school curriculum has directed the student to learn—a basic subject for which the student is missing a credit, for example. Either way, though, the student will probably need guidance, support, and help from a teacher. In this sense even independent study always contains elements of teacher-direction.

Similarly, self-reflection refers to thinking about beliefs and experiences in order to clarify their personal meaning and importance. In school it can be practiced in a number of ways: for example by keeping diaries or logs of learning or reading, or by retelling stories of important experiences or incidents in a student’s life, or by creating concept maps like the ones described earlier in this chapter. Whatever form it takes, self-reflection by definition happens inside a single student’s mind, and in this sense is always directed by the student. Yet most research on self-reflection finds that self-reflection only works well when it involves and generates responses and interaction with other students or with a teacher (Seifert, 1999; Kuit, Reay, &amp; Freeman, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, K. (1999). ''Reflective thinking and professional development: A primer.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuit, J., Reay, G., &amp; Freeman, R. (2001). Experiences of reflective teaching. ''Learning in High Education, 2''(2), 128-142.&lt;/ref&gt;. To be fully self-reflective, students need to have access to more than their existing base of knowledge and ideas—more than what they know already. In one study about students’ self-reflections about cultural and racial prejudices (Gay &amp; Kirkland, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. &amp; Kirkland, K. (2003). Developing cultural critical consciousness and self-reflection in preservice teacher education. ''Theory into Practice, 42''(3), 181-187.&lt;/ref&gt;, for example, the researchers found that students tended to reflect on these problems in relatively shallow ways if they worked on their own. It was not particularly effective to write about prejudice in a journal than no one read except themselves, or to describe beliefs in a class discussion in which neither the teacher nor classmates commented or challenged the beliefs. Much more effective in both cases was for the teacher to respond thoughtfully to students’ reflective comments. In this sense the use of self-reflection, like independent study, required elements of teacher-direction to be successful.

How might a teacher emphasize students’ responsibility for directing and organizing their own learning? The alternatives are numerous, as they are for teacher-directed strategies, so we can only sample some of them here. We concentrate on ones that are relatively well known and used most widely, and especially on two: inquiry learning and cooperative learning.

===Inquiry Learning===
'''Inquiry learning''' stands the usual advice about expository (lecture-style) teaching on its head: instead of presenting well-organized knowledge to students, the teacher (or sometimes fellow students) pose thoughtful questions intended to stimulate discussion and investigation by students. The approach has been described, used, and discussed by educators literally for decades, though sometimes under other names, including inquiry method (Postman &amp; Weingartner, 1969)&lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. &amp; Weingartner, C. (1969). ''Teaching as a subversive activity.'' New York: Delacorte Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, discovery learning (Bruner, 1960/2006)&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1960/2006). ''The process of education, Revised Edition.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;, or progressive education (Dewey, 1933; Martin, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1933). ''How we think.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, J. (2003). ''The education of John Dewey.'' New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. For convenience, we will stay with the term ''inquiry learning.''

The questions that begin a cycle of inquiry learning may be posed either by the teacher or by students themselves. Their content depends not only on the general subject area being studied, but also on the interests which students themselves have expressed. In elementary-level science, for example, a question might be “Why do leaves fall off trees when winter comes?” In high-school-level social studies, it might be “Why do nations get into conflict?” The teacher avoids answering such questions directly, even if asked to do so. Instead she encourages students to investigate the questions themselves, for example by elaborating on students’ ideas and by asking further questions based on students’ initial comments. Since students’ comments can not be predicted precisely, the approach is by nature flexible. The initial questioning helps students to create and clarify questions which they consider worthy of further investigation. Discussing questions about leaves falling off trees, for example, can prompt students to observe trees in the autumn or to locate books and references that discuss or explain the biology of tress and leaves.

But inquiry is not limited to particular grade levels or topics. If initial questions in a high school social studies class have been about why nations get into conflict, for example, the resulting discussions can lead to investigating the history of past wars and the history peace-keeping efforts around the world. Whether the topic is high school social studies or elementary school biology, the specific direction of investigations is influenced heavily by students, but with assistance from the teacher to insure that the students’ initiatives are productive. When all goes well, the inquiry and resulting investigations benefit students in two ways. The first is that students (perhaps obviously) learn new knowledge from their investigations. The second is that students practice a constructive, motivating way of learning, one applicable to a variety of problems and tasks, both in school and out.

===Cooperative Learning===
Even though inquiry-oriented discussion and investigation benefits when it involves the teacher, it can also be useful for students to work together somewhat independently, relying on a teacher’s guidance only indirectly. Working with peers is a major feature of cooperative learning (sometimes also called collaborative learning). In this approach, students work on a task in groups and often are rewarded either partially or completely for the success of the group as a whole. Aspects of cooperative learning have been part of education for a long time; some form of cooperation has always been necessary to participate on school sports teams, for example, or to produce a student-run school newspaper. What is a bit newer is using cooperative or collaborative activities systematically to facilitate the learning of a range of educational goals central to the academic curriculum (Prince, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Prince, M. (2004) &quot;Does Active Learning Work? A Review of the Research,&quot; ''Journal of Engineering Education, 93'':3, 223-231.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Even though teachers usually value cooperation in students, circumstances at school can sometimes reduce students’ incentives to show it. The traditional practice of assessing students individually, for example, can set the stage for competition over grades, and cultural and other forms of diversity can sometimes inhibit individuals from helping each other spontaneously. Strategies exist, however, for reducing such barriers so that students truly benefit from each other’s presence, and are more likely to feel like sharing their skills and knowledge. Here, for example, are several key features that make cooperative learning work well (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1998; Smith, et al., 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. &amp; Johnson, R. (1998). ''Learning together and alone, 5th edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K., Sheppard, S., Johnson, D., &amp; Johnson, R. (2005). Pedagogies of engagement: Classroom-based practices. ''Journal of Engineering Education, 94''(1), 87-103.&lt;/ref&gt;:

* ''Students need time and a place to talk and work together.'' This may sound obvious, but it can be overlooked if time in class becomes crowded with other tasks and activities, or with interruptions related to school (like assemblies) but not to the classroom. It is never enough simply to tell students to work together, only to leave them wondering how or when they are to do so.

* ''Students need skills at working together.'' As an adult, you may feel relatively able to work with a variety of partners on a group task. The same assumption cannot be made, however, about younger individuals, whether teenagers or children. Some students may get along with a variety of partners, but others may not. Many will benefit from advice and coaching about how to focus on the tasks at hand, rather than on the personalities of their partners. 

* ''Assessment of activities should hold both the group '''and''' the individuals accountable for success.'' If a final mark for a project goes only to the group as a whole, then freeloading is possible: some members may not do their share of the work and may be rewarded more than they deserve. Others may be rewarded less than they deserve. If, on the other hand, a final grade for a group project goes only to each member’s individual contribution to a group project, then overspecialization can occur: individuals have no real incentive to work together, and a cooperative may deteriorate into a set of smaller individual projects (Slavin, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. (1994). ''Cooperative learning: Theory, research, and practice, 2nd edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* ''Students need to believe in the value and necessity of cooperation.'' Collaboration will not occur if students privately assume that their partners have little to contribute to their personal success. Social prejudices from the wider society—like racial bias or gender sexism, for example—can creep into the operations of cooperative groups, causing some members to be ignored unfairly while others are overvalued. Teachers can help reduce these problems in two ways: first by pointing out and explaining that a diversity of talents necessary for success on a group project, and second by pointing out to the group how undervalued individuals are contributing to the overall project (Cohen, Brody, &amp; Sapon-Shevin, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, E., Brody, C., &amp; Sapon-Shevin, M. (2004). ''Teaching cooperative learning.'' Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

As these comments imply, cooperative learning does not happen automatically, and requires monitoring and support by the teacher. Some activities may not lend themselves to cooperative work, particularly if every member of the group is doing essentially the same task. Giving everyone in a group the same set of arithmetic problems to work on collaboratively, for example, is a formula for cooperative failure: either the most skilled students do the work for others (freeloading) or else members simply divide up the problems among themselves in order to reduce their overall work (overspecialization). A better choice for cooperative task is one that clearly requires a diversity of skills, what some educators call a '''rich group work task''' (Cohen, Brody, &amp; Sapon-Shevin, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, E., Brody, C., &amp; Sapon-Shevin, M. (2004). ''Teaching cooperative learning.'' Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Preparing a presentation about medieval castles, for example, might require
:# writing skill to create a report,
:# dramatic skill to put on a skit, and
:# artistic talent to create a poster.
Although a few students may have all of these skills, more are likely to have only one, and they are therefore likely to need and want their fellow group members’ participation.

===Examples of Cooperative and Collaborative Learning===
Although this description may make the requirements for cooperative learning sound somewhat precise, there are actually a variety of ways to implement it in practice. [[Table 8-3]] summarizes several of them. As you can see, the strategies vary in the number of many students they involve, the prior organization or planning provided by the teacher, and the amount of class time they normally require.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Given the somewhat general nature of curriculum frameworks and guides, how do you choose and formulate actual learning objectives? Basically there are two approaches: either start by selecting content or topics that what you want students to know (the cognitive approach) or start with what you want students to do (the behavioral approach). In effect the cognitive approach moves from the general to the specific, and the behavioral approach does the opposite. Each approach has advocates, as well as inherent strengths and problems. In practice teachers often combine or alternate between them in order to give students some of the advantages of each.

===From General to Specific: Selecting Content Topics===
The cognitive approach assumes that teachers normally have a number of long-term, general goals for students, and it begins with those goals. It also assumes that each student work toward long-term, general goals along different pathways and using different styles of learning. Because of these assumptions, it is necessary to name indicators, which are examples of specific behaviors by which students might show success at reaching a general learning goal. But it is neither desirable nor possible for a list of indicators to be complete—only for it to be representative (Gronlund, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Gronlund, N. (2004). ''Writing instructional objectives for teaching and assessment, 6th edition.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;. Consider this example from teaching middle-school biology. For this subject you might have a general goal like the following, with accompanying indicators:

:''Goal: ''
::''The student will understand the nature and purpose of photosynthesis.''
:''Indicators:''
::''1) Explains the purpose of photosynthesis and steps in the process''
::''2) Diagrams steps in the chemical process''
::''3) Describes how plant photosynthesis affects the animal world''
::''4) Writes a plan for how to test leaves for presence of photosynthesis''
::''5) Makes an oral presentation explaining the experiment in #4.''

Using a strictly cognitive approach to planning, therefore, a teacher’s job has two parts. First she must identify, find, or choose a manageable number of general goals—perhaps just a half dozen or so. (Sometimes these can be taken or adapted from a curriculum framework document such as discussed earlier.) Then the teacher must think of a handful of specific examples or behavioral indicators for each goal—just a half dozen or so of these as well. The behavioral indicators clarify the meaning of the general goal, but are not meant to be the only way that students might show success at learning. Then, at last, thoughtful planning for individual lessons or activities can begin. This approach works especially well for learning goals that are relatively long-term—goals that take many lessons, days, or weeks to reach. During such long periods of teaching, it is impossible to specify the exact, detailed behaviors that every student can or should display to prove that he or she has reached a general goal. It is possible, however, to specify general directions toward which all students should focus their learning, and to explain the nature of the goals with a sample of well-chosen indicators or examples (Popham, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, J. (2002). ''What every teacher should know about educational assessment.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The cognitive, general-to-specific approach is reasonable on the face of it, and in fact probably describes how many teachers think about their instructional planning. But critics have argued that indicators used as examples may not in fact clarify the general goal enough; students therefore end up unexpectedly—as Casey Stengel said at the start of this chapter—“someplace else.” Given the general goal of understanding photosynthesis described above, for example, how are we to know whether the five indicators that are listed really allow a teacher to grasp the full meaning of the goal? Put differently, how else might a student show understanding of photosynthesis, and how is a teacher to know if that student’s achievement is s a legitimate display of understanding? To some educators, grasping the meaning of goals from indicators is not as obvious as it should be, and in any case is prone to misunderstanding. The solution, they say, is not to start planning with general goals, but with specific behaviors that identify students’ success.

===From Specific to General: Behavioral Objectives===
Compared to the cognitive approach, the behavioral approach to instructional planning reverses the steps in planning. Instead of starting with general goal statements accompanied by indicator examples, it starts with the identification of specific behaviors—concrete actions or words—that students should perform or display as a result of instruction (Mager, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Mager, R. (2005). ''Preparing instructional objectives, 3rd edition.'' Atlanta, GA: Center for Effective Performance.&lt;/ref&gt;. Collectively, the specific behaviors may describe a more general educational goal, but unlike the indicators used in the cognitive approach, they are not a mere sampling of the possible specific outcomes. Instead they represent ''all'' the intended specific outcomes. Consider this sampling of behavioral objectives:

:''Objectives: Learning to use in-line roller blade skates (beginning level)''
::''1. Student ties boots on correctly.''
::''2. Student puts on safety gear correctly, including helmet, knee and elbow pads.''
::''3. Student skates 50 feet on level ground without falling.''
::''4. Student stops on demand within a ten-foot distance, without falling.''

The objectives listed are not merely a representative sample of how students can demonstrate success with roller-blading. Instead they are behaviors that ''every'' student should acquire in order to meet the goal of using roller blades as a beginner. There simply are no other ways to display learning of this goal; getting 100% on a written test about roller blading, for example, would not qualify as success with this goal, though it might show success at some other goal, such as verbal knowledge about roller blading. Even adding other skating behaviors (like “Student skates backwards” or “Student skates in circles”) might not qualify as success with this particular goal, because it could reasonably argued that the additional skating behaviors are about skating at an advanced level, not a beginning level.

In the most commonly used version of this approach, originated by Robert Mager (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Mager, R. (2005). ''Preparing instructional objectives, 3rd edition.'' Atlanta, GA: Center for Effective Performance.&lt;/ref&gt;, a good behavioral objective should have three features. First, it should specify a behavior that can in fact be observed. In practice this usually means identifying something that a student does or says, not something a student thinks or feels. Compare the following examples; one names a behavior to be performed, but the other names a thinking process that cannot, in principle, be seen:

:''Behavioral Objective:''
::''The student will make a list of animal species that live in the water but breathe air, and a separate list of species that live in the water but do not require air to breathe.
:'''''Not''' Behavioral Objective:''
::''The student will understand the differences between fish and mammals that live in the water.''

The second feature of a good behavioral objective is that it ''describes conditions of performance'' of the behavior. What are the special circumstances to be provided when the student performs the objective? Consider these two examples:

:''Special Condition of Performance Is Specified:''
::''Given a list of 50 species, the student will circle those that live in water but breathe air, and underline those that live in water but do not breathe air.''
:''A Special Condition of Performance Is '''Not''' Specified:''
::''After three days of instruction, the student will identify species that live in water but breathe air, as well as species that live in water but do not breathe air.''

The first objective names a special condition of performance—that the student will be given a particular kind of list to work from—which is not part of the instruction itself. The second objective appears to name a condition—“three days of instruction.” But the condition is really simply what the teacher will do (she will instruct), not something specific to students’ performance.

The third feature of a good behavioral objective is that it ''specifies a minimum level or degree of acceptable performance''. Consider these two example:

:''Specifies Minimum Level:''
::''Given a list of 50 species, the student will circle all of those that live in water but breathe air, and underline all of those that live in water but do not breathe air. The student will do so within fifteen minutes.''
:''Does '''Not''' Specify Minimum Level:''
::''The student will circle names of species that live in water but breathe air, and underline those that live in water but do not breathe air.''

The first objective specifies a level of performance—100% accuracy within 15 minutes. The second objective leaves this information out (and incidentally it also omits the condition of performance mentioned on the left).

Behavioral objectives have obvious advantages because of their clarity and precision. They seem especially well suited for learning that by nature can be spelled out explicitly and fully, such as when a student is learning to drive a car, to use safety equipment in a science laboratory, or install and run a particular computer program. Most of these goals, as it happens, also tend to have relatively short learning cycles, meaning that they can be learned as a result of just one lesson or activity, or of just a short series of them at most. Such goals tend not to include the larger, more abstract goals of education. In practice, both kinds of goals—both the general and the specific—form a large part of education at all grade levels.

===Finding the Best in Both Approaches===
When it comes to teaching and learning the large or major goals, then, behavioral objectives can seem unwieldy. How, a teacher might ask, can you spell out all of the behaviors involved in a general goal like becoming a good citizen? And how could you name in advance the numerous conditions under which good citizenship might be displayed, or the minimum acceptable level of good citizenship expected in each condition? Specifying these features seems impractical at best, and at times even undesirable ethically or philosophically. (Would we really want any students to become “minimum citizens”?) Because of these considerations, many teachers find it sensible to a compromise between the cognitive and behavioral approaches. Here are some features that are often part of a compromise:

# When planning, think about BOTH long-term, general goals AND short-term, immediate objectives. A thorough, balanced look at most school curricula shows that they are concerned with the general as well as the specific. In teaching elementary math, for example, you may want students to learn general problem solving strategies (a general goal), but you may also want them to learn specific math facts (a specific objective). In teaching Shakespeare’s plays in high school, you may want students to be able to compare the plays critically (a general goal), but doing so may require that they learn details about the characters and plots of the major plays (a specific objective). Since general goals usually take longer to reach than specific objectives, instructional planning has to include both time frames.
# Plan for what students do, not what the teacher does. This idea may seem obvious, but it is easy to overlook it when devising lesson plans. Consider that example again about teaching Shakespeare. If you want students to learn the details about Shakespeare’s plays, it is tempting to plan objectives like “Summarize the plot of each play to students, or “Write and hand out to students an outline of the plays.” Unfortunately these objectives describe only what the teacher does, and makes the assumption (often unwarranted) that students will remember what the teacher says or puts in writing for them. A better version of the same objective should focus on the actions of students, not of teachers—for example, “Students will write a summary, from memory, of each of the major plays of Shakespeare.” This version focuses on what students do instead of what the teacher does. (Of course you may still have to devise activities that help students to reach the objective, such as providing guided practice in writing summaries of plays.)
#To insure diversity of goals and objectives when planning, consider organizing goals and objectives by using a systematic classification scheme of educational objectives. At the beginning of this section we stated that there is a need, when devising goals and objectives, for both the specific and the general. Actually a more accurate statement is that there is a need for goals and objectives that refer to a variety of cognitive processes and that have varying degrees of specificity or generality. One widely used classification scheme that does so, for example, is one proposed fifty years ago by [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 9: Instructional Planning/Taxonomies of Educational Objectives|Benjamin Bloom]] (1956)&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives.'' New York: David McKay Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and revised recently by his associates (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, L. &amp; Krathwohl, D. (2001). ''A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing.'' New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are some people who are blessed with a perfect singing voice and excellent coordination, and they sing and play the guitar like breathing. For other people, attempting to sing a single note causes them to immediately lose the rhythm.

This section is intended to help people who already play the guitar and gives advice on how to incorporate vocals into their performance .

==General Tips==

'''Just keep singing.''' The worst thing you can do is stop, because stopping teaches you to stop, and only singing teaches you to sing.
'''Start simple.''' Pick a song with simple chord progressions and simple, on-beat strumming patterns. Start with a very slow tempo and gradually speed up after a successful try.

==Other Artist's Songs==

First learn to play the song really well. Listen and sing along with the song, over and over again. After you have a good handle on both the singing and guitar part, try putting them together. If this still proves too difficult having both parts memorized, you may try just playing the guitar while listening to the song, focusing your mind on listening to the words as closely as you can until you can think about the words while playing. This could take away some of the multitasking confusion prevalent in first attempts. 

If multitasking is not the issue but certain songs are still a challenge, practice playing and singing the song without reference to the original, and when you are sure that you have memorised the lyrics and chord changes, practice along to the original version. Sometimes doing this will help you master the harder sections.

Be sure to keep a copy of the words nearby while you are learning, in case you forget a line or two. It is better to stumble through a few lines and keep the song going rather than stopping in mid verse to try to remember something.

==Your Own Songs==
After writing the first few lines of a song and with an idea of how you'd like the song to be (having the basic chords and lyrics ), the next step is to explore the possibilities. The idea is to try different tones and melodies. When singing we can stretch words to fill up some space. change any words and chords, or if creating a version of a known tune, add a chord (or word), later you can decide which one sounds better. Sometimes we subconsciously create music that is a copy of our favourite artist; there's nothing wrong with this. After all, some of the greatest names in music founded their early careers with covers of the music of their heroes. After some progress show it to your friends and ask them for some opinions. Sometimes we may also forget the melody or chords, so a good tip is to record it. You don't need a professional studio, just a normal microphone and a computer will suffice. With regards to lyrics during songwriting, if a word doesn't sit well, look for a synonym. Most of the time, it's the best solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Taxonomies of Educational Objectives===
When educators have proposed taxonomies of educational objectives, they have tended to focus on one of three areas or domains of psychological functioning: either students’ cognition (thought), students’ feelings and emotions (affect), or students’ physical skills (psychomotor abilities). Of these three areas, they have tended to focus the most attention on cognition. The taxonomy originated by Benjamin Bloom, for example, deals entirely with cognitive outcomes of instruction.

====Bloom’s Taxonomy====
In its original form, Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives referred to forms of cognition or thinking, which were divided into the six levels (Bloom, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives.'' New York: David McKay Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Table 9-5]] summarizes the levels, and offers two kinds of examples—simple ones based on the children’s story “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” and complex ones more typical of goals and objectives used in classrooms. The levels form a loose hierarchy from simple to complex thinking, at least when applied to some subjects and topics. When planning for these subjects it can therefore be helpful not only for insuring diversity among learning objectives, but also for sequencing materials. In learning about geography, for example, it may sometimes make sense to begin with information about specific places or societies (knowledge and comprehension), and work gradually toward comparisons and assessments among the places or societies (analysis and synthesis).

Such a sequence does not work well, however, for all possible topics or subjects. To learn certain topics in mathematics, for example, students may sometimes need to start with general ideas (like “What does it mean to multiply?”) than with specific facts (like “How much is 4 x 6?”) (Egan,2005)&lt;ref&gt;Egan, K. (2005). ''An imaginative approach to teaching.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;. At other times, though, the reverse sequence may be preferable. Whatever the case, a taxonomy of cognitive objectives, like Bloom’s, can help to remind teachers to set a variety of objectives and to avoid relying excessively on just one level, such as simple recall of factual knowledge (Notar, et al., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Notar, C., Wilson, J., Yunker, B., &amp; Zuelke, D. (2004). The table of specifications: Insuring accountability in teacher-made tests. ''Journal of Instructional Psychology, 31''(3).&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Bloom’s Taxonomy Revised====
A few years ago two of Benjamin Bloom’s original colleagues, Linda Anderson and David Krathwohl, revised his taxonomy so as to clarify its terms and to make it more complete (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001; Marzano, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Marzano, R. (2006). ''Designing a new taxonomy of educational objectives.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, L. &amp; Krathwohl, D. (2001). ''A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing.'' New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;. The resulting categories are summarized and compared to the original categories in [[Table 9-6]]. As the chart shows, several categories of objectives have been renamed, and a second dimension added that describes the kind of thinking or cognitive processing that may occur. The result is a much richer taxonomy than before, since every level of objectives can now take four different forms. Remembering, for example, can refer to four different kinds of memory: memory for facts, for concepts, for procedures, or for metacognitive knowledge. [[Table 9-6]] gives examples of each of these kinds of memory.

====Taxonomies of Affective Objectives and Psychomotor Objectives====
Although taxonomies related to affect, or the feelings and emotions of students, are used less commonly than cognitive taxonomies for planning instruction, various educators have constructed them. One of the most widely known was also published by colleagues of Benjamin Bloom and classifies affect according to how committed a student feels toward what he is learning (Krathwohl, Bloom, &amp; Masia, 1964/1999)&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D., Bloom, B., &amp; Masia, B. (1964/1999). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Affective Domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Table 9-7]] summarizes the categories and gives brief examples. The lowest level, called receiving, simply involves willingness to experience new knowledge or activities. Higher levels involve embracing or adopting experiences in ways that are increasingly organized and that represent increasingly stable forms of commitment.

Taxonomies related to abilities and skills that are physical, or psychomotor, have also been used less widely than affective taxonomies, with the notable exception of one area of teaching where they are obviously relevant: physical education. As you might expect, taxonomic categories of motor skill extend from simple, brief actions to complex, extended action sequences that combine simpler, previously learned skills smoothly and automatically (Harrow, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;Harrow, A. (1972).'' A taxonomy of the psychomotor domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;. One such classification scheme is shown in [[Table 9-7]]. An example of a very basic psychomotor skill might be imitating the action of throwing a ball when modeled by someone else; an example of the latter might be performing a ten-minute gymnastics routine which the student has devised for himself or herself. Note, though, that many examples of psychomotor skills also exist outside the realm of physical education. In a science course, for example, a student might need to learn to operate laboratory equipment that requires using delicate, fine movements. In art classes, students might learn to draw, and in music they might learn to play an instrument (both are partly motor skills). Most first-graders are challenged by the motor skills of learning to write. For students with certain physical disabilities, furthermore, motor skill development is an important priority for the student’s entire education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Students as a Source of Instructional Goals==
So far our discussion of instructional planning has described goals and objectives as if they are selected primarily by educators and teachers, and not by students themselves. The assumption may be correct in many cases, but there are problems with it. One problem is that choosing goals and objectives for students, rather than by students, places a major burden on everyone involved in education—curriculum writers, teachers, and students. The curriculum writers have to make sure that they specify standards, goals, and objectives are truly important for students to learn (what if it really does not matter, for example, whether a science student learns about the periodic table of the elements?). Teachers have to make sure that students actually become motivated to learn the specified goals and objectives, even if the students are not motivated initially. And students have to master pre-set goals and objectives even if they might not have chosen them personally. Some critics of education have argued that these requirements can be serious impediments to learning (Kohn, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (1999). ''The schools our children deserve.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;. The problems are widespread and especially noticeable in two forms of teaching. One is with the youngest students, who may especially lack patience with an educational agenda set by others (Kohn, 1999; Seitz, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2004). Challenging students, and how to have more of them. ''Phi Delta Kappan,86''(3), 184-194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seitz, H. (2006). The plan: building on children’s interests. ''Young Children, 61''(2), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt;. The other is with culturally diverse classrooms, where students and their families may hold a variety of legitimate, but unconventional expectations about what they should learn (J. Banks &amp; C. Banks, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. &amp; Banks, C. (2005). ''Multicultural education: Issues and perspectives, 5th edition.'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In response to concerns like these, some educators advocate planning instruction around goals set or expressed either by students themselves or by the cultures or communities with which students identify. Their suggestions vary in detail, but can be organized into two broad categories: 1) emergent curriculum and 2) multicultural and anti-bias curriculum.

===Emergent Curriculum===
An emergent curriculum is one that explicitly builds on interests expressed by students, rather than goals set by curriculum writers, curriculum documents, or teachers. As you might suspect, therefore, instructional planning for an emergent curriculum does not have the same meaning that the term has had in the chapter up to now. Instead, since an emergent curriculum by definition unfolds spontaneously and flexibly, students’ interests may be predictable, but usually very far in advance (Peterson, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, E. (2002). ''A practical guide to early childhood curriculum: Linking thematic, emergent, and skill-based planning to children’s outcomes, 2nd edition.'' Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;. Suppose, for example, that a first-grade teacher plans a unit around Halloween, and that as one of the activities for this unit she reads a book about Halloween. In listening to the book, however, the students turn out to be less interested in its Halloween content than in the fact that one of the illustrations in the book shows a picture of a full moon partially hidden by clouds. They begin asking about the moon: why it is full sometimes but not other times, why it rises in different places each month, and whether the moon really moves behind clouds or whether the clouds actually do the moving. The teacher encourages their questions and their interest in moon astronomy. Over the next days or weeks, she arranges further activities and experiences to encourage students’ interest: she sets aside her original plans about Halloween and finds books about the moon and about how the solar system works. She invites a local amateur astronomer to visit the group and talk about his observations of the moon. Several children build models of the moon out of papier-mâché. Some find books describing trips of the space shuttles to the moon. Others make a large mural depicting a moonscape, and so on; the original goals about Halloween are not so much rejected, as set aside or forgotten in favor of something more immediately interesting and motivating.

While these activities could in principle happen because of recommendations from a curriculum document, the key point about emergent curriculum is that they happen for a very different reason: they activities happen and the goals emerge because the ''children'' want them. A teacher’s challenge is therefore not planning activities that match predetermined curriculum goals or objectives, but to respond flexibly and sensitively as students’ interests become known and explicit. Teachers’ responsiveness is facilitated by two practices that are especially prominent when a teacher adopts an emergent approach to curriculum. The first is careful, continuous observation of students. The teacher watches and listens, and may keep informal written records of students’ comments and activities. The information allows her to respond more effectively to the interests they express, and at the same time it provides a type of assessment of students’ progress—information about what the students are actually learning.

A second strategy that facilitates teachers’ success is curriculum webbing, a process of brainstorming connections among initiatives suggested by students and ideas suggested by the teacher. In some cases webs can be created jointly with students by brainstorming with them about where their current interests may lead. In other cases they can be created independently by the teacher’s own reflections. In still others, when a classroom has more than one adult responsible for it, they can be created jointly with fellow teachers or teacher assistants. The latter approach works especially well in preschool, kindergartens, or special education classrooms, which often have more than one adult responsible for the class (Vartuli &amp; Rohs, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Vartuli, S. &amp; Rohs, J. (2006). Conceptual organizers of early childhood curriculum content. ''Early Childhood Education Journal, 33''(4), 231-237.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Figure 9-1]] illustrates a curriculum web made jointly by two teachers who team-taught a double-size classroom of preschool and kindergarten students.

To some, emergent curriculum may seem like a formula for curriculum and management disasters. But the approach has often proved quite successful, particularly in early childhood education and the earliest grade levels of elementary school (Seitz, 2006; Wurm, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Wurm, J. (2005). ''Working in the Reggio way.'' St. Paul, MN: Redleaf Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seitz, H. (2006). The plan: building on children’s interests. ''Young Children, 61''(2), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt;. Something akin to emergent curriculum is quite possible, in principle, even with older students. In Chapter 8, for example, we described a high school program in which students began with problems and experiences that were personally relevant, and discussed the problems with classmates to formulate research problems which they then studied more formally and systematically (Hawkins, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, J. (2006). Accessing multicultural issues through critical thinking, critical inquiry, and the student research process. ''Urban Education, 41''(2), 169-141.&lt;/ref&gt;. In essence this strategy created an emergent curriculum analogous to the ones described above for young children. What the high school students studied was not predetermined, but emerged from their own expressed interests.

===Multicultural and Anti-Bias Education===
A '''culture''' is an all-encompassing set of values, beliefs, practices and customs of a group or community—its total way of life. Cultures may be shared widely, even by much if not all of an entire nation, or they may be shared by relatively few, such as a small community within a large city. Sometimes the term culture is even applied to the way of life of an individual family or of a specialized group in society; some might argue, for example, that there is a culture of schooling shared by teachers, though not necessarily by all students. 

Because culture by definition touches on all aspects of living, it is likely to affect students’ perspectives about school, their ways of learning and their motivations to learn. The differences go beyond obvious differences in holidays, language, or food preferences. In some cultures, for example, individuals keep good eye contact with someone to whom they are speaking, and expect the same from others. In other cultures, such behavior is considered intrusive or overly aggressive, and avoiding eye contact while speaking is considered more respectful. Or another example: in some cultures it is expected that individuals will be punctual (or on time), whereas in others punctuality is considered overly compulsive, and a more casual approach to time is the norm. Students regularly bring differences like these to school, where they combine with expectations from teachers and other school staff, and contribute indirectly to differences in achievement and satisfaction among students.

To be fully effective, therefore, instructional planning has to take into account the diversity in students’ cultural backgrounds, whether the differences are observable or subtle. It also has to work deliberately to reduce the social biases and prejudices that sometimes develop about cultural differences. Multicultural education and anti-bias education are two terms referring to these purposes. Their meanings often overlap significantly, depending on the context or on who is using the terms. Generally, though, the first term—multicultural education—has somewhat more to do with understanding the differences among cultures. The latter term—anti-bias education—has more to do with on overcoming social prejudices and biases resulting from cultural differences. For convenience in this chapter, we will use the single term '''multicultural education''' to refer to both understanding differences and overcoming prejudices.

Fully effective multicultural education has several features. The most obvious and familiar one is ''content integration:'' the curriculum uses examples and information from different cultures to illustrate various concepts or ideas already contained in the curriculum (Vavrus, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Vavrus, M. (2002). ''Transforming the multicultural education of teachers.'' New York: Teachers’ College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. In studying holidays, for example, an elementary-school teacher includes activities and information about Kwanza as well as Christmas, Hanukah, or other holidays happening at about the same time. In studying the Civil War, for another example, a middle-years teacher includes material written from the perspective of African-American slaves as well as of Southern landowners. In teaching language arts, students learn basic vocabulary of any non-English languages spoken by some members of the class.

But there is more to multicultural education than integrating content from diverse cultures.  Among other features, it also requires an ''equity pedagogy,'' which refers to the effort to allow or even encourage, a variety of learning styles—styles at which students may have become skillful because of their cultural backgrounds (Crow, 2005; C. Banks &amp; J. Banks, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Crow, C. (2005). ''Multicultural education: Equity pedagogy on perspectives and practices of secondary teachers.'' Unpublished doctoral dissertation. Waco, TX: Baylor University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks, C. &amp; Banks, J. (1995). Equity pedagogy: An essential component of multicultural education. ''Theory into Practice, 34''(3), 152-158.&lt;/ref&gt;. In elementary language arts, for example, there may be more than one “best” way to tell a story. Should a student necessarily have to tell it alone and standing in front of the whole class, or might the student tell it jointly with a friend or in a smaller group? And in learning to write a story, is legitimate variety also possible there? Should a written story necessarily begin with a topic sentence that announces what the story is about, or can it save a statement of topic for the ending or even it leave it out altogether in order to stimulate readers to think? The best choice is related in part to the nature and purpose of the story, of course, but partly also to differences in cultural expectations about story telling. Choosing a story form also points toward another feature of multicultural education, the knowledge construction process, which is the unstated, unconscious process by which a cultural group creates knowledge or information. The popular media, for example, often portray Hispanic-Americans in ways that are stereotypical, either subtly or blatantly (Lester &amp; Ross, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Lester, P. &amp; Ross, S. (2003). ''Images that injure: Pictorial stereotypes in the media.'' Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;. A fully multicultural curriculum finds way to call these images to the attention of students and to engage them in thinking about how and why the images oversimplify reality.

Yet there is even more to a fully multicultural education. In addition to content integration, equity pedagogy, and knowledge construction, it ''fosters prejudice reduction''--activities, discussions and readings that identify students’ negative evaluations of cultural groups (Jacobson, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, T. (2003). ''Confronting out discomfort: Clearing the way for anti-bias in early childhood.'' Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;. The activities and discussions can of course take a somewhat philosophical approach—examining how students feel in general, what experiences they remember having involving prejudice, and the like. But they can also take a more indirect and subtle form, as when a teacher periodically speaks in a student’s native language as a public sign of respect for the student. Gestures and discussions like these are especially effective if they contribute to the fifth element of multicultural education, empowering the school and social structure, in which all teachers and staff members find ways to convey respect for cultural differences, including even during extra-curricular and sports activities. A sports team or a debate club should not be limited to students from one cultural background and exclude those from another—or more subtly, accept everyone but give the more desirable roles only to individuals with particular social backgrounds. To the extent that cultural respect and inclusion are school-wide, teaching and learning both become easier and more successful, and instructional planning in particular becomes more relevant to students’ needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Enhancing Student Learning through a Variety of Resources==
Whether instructional goals originate from curriculum documents, students’ expressed interests, or a mixture of both, students are more likely to achieve the goals if teachers draw on a wide variety of resources. As a practical matter, this means looking for materials and experiences that supplement—or occasionally even replace—the most traditional forms of information, such as textbooks. Precisely what resources to use depend on factors unique to each class, school, or community, but they might include one or more of the following.

===The Internet as a Learning Tool===
The Internet has become a fixture of modern society, and it offers a huge variety of information on virtually any topic, including any school subject and any possible grade level from kindergarten through university. At the time of writing this book (2007), about two thirds of all households in the United States and Canada have at least some sort of Internet access, and virtually 100% of public and private schools have some access (Parsad &amp; Jones, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Parsad, B. &amp; Jones, J. (2005). ''Internet access in U.S. public schools and classrooms: 1994-2003.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;. These circumstances make the Internet a potential major resource for teachers and students—a virtual library many times larger than even the largest physical (or “bricks and mortar”) libraries in the world.

But the vastness of the Internet is not entirely a blessing. A major problem is that the sheer volume of information available, which can sometimes make searching for a specific topic, article, or document overwhelming and inefficient. The newer search engines (such as [[http://www.google.com Google]] can help with this problem, though they do not solve it completely. When searching the term photosynthesis, for example, Google and other similar search engines return over six million Web pages that discuss or refer this topic in some way! If a teacher is planning a unit about photosynthesis, or if a student is writing an essay about it, which of these Web pages will prove most helpful? Choosing among Web pages is a new, somewhat specialized form of computer literacy, one that can be learned partially by trial-and-error online, but that also benefits from assistance by a teacher or by more experienced peers (Ragains, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Ragains, P. (2006). ''Information literacy instruction that works.'' New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Another problem with the Internet is inequity of access. Even though, as we mentioned above, virtually all schools now have access of some sort, the access is distributed quite unevenly across communities and income groups (Skinner, Biscope, &amp; Poland, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, H., Biscope, S., &amp; Poland, B. (2003). Quality of Internet access: Barriers behind Internet use statistics, ''Social Science and Medicine, 57''(5), 875-880.&lt;/ref&gt;. For one thing, the large majority of Web pages are posted in English, and this fact naturally poses a challenge for any students who still learning to read or write English. For another, schools vary widely in how much Internet service they can provide. In general, well-to-do schools and those in cities provide more access than those located in less well-off areas or in rural areas—though there are many exceptions. A richly endowed school might have an Internet connection in every classroom as well as multiple connections in a school library or in specialized computer rooms. Students as well as faculty would be able to use these facilities, and one or more teachers might have special training in Internet research to help when problems arise. At the other extreme, a school might have only a few Internet connections for the entire school, or even just one, located in a central place like the library or the school office. Usage by students would consequently be limited, and teachers would essentially teach themselves how to search the Internet and how to troubleshoot technical problems when they occur.

In spite of these problems, the Internet has considerable potential for enhancing students’ learning, precisely because of its flexibility and near universality. Some of the best recent successes involve the creation of a learning commons (sometimes also called an information commons or teaching commons), a combination of a website and an actual, physical place in a school or library that brings together information, students and teachers so that both (though perhaps especially students) can learn (Haas &amp; Robertson, 2004; Beagle, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Haas, L. &amp; Robertson, J. (Eds). (2004). ''The information commons.'' Washington, D.C.: Association of Research Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beagle, D. Bailey, R., &amp; Tierney, B. (2004). ''The information commons handbook.'' New York: Neal-Shuman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;. A learning commons includes an online library catalogue and online Internet service, but it also offers other services: online information and advice about study skills, for example, as well as access to peer tutors and support groups, either online or in person, that can help with difficulties about writing or doing assignments. As you might suspect, using a learning commons effectively sometimes requires reorganizing certain features of teaching and learning, chiefly toward greater explicit collaboration among students and teachers.

===Using Local Experts and Field Trips===
Two other ways of enhancing learning include bringing local experts to the classroom and taking the class on field trips outside the classroom. Both of these strategies help to make learning more vivid, as well as more relevant to the particular community and lives that students lead.

====Local Experts====
Classroom visits by persons with key experience can often add a lot to many curriculum subjects and topics. In one tenth-grade science class studying environmental issues, for example, the teacher invited the city forester, the person responsible for the health of trees planted in city parks and along city boulevards. The forester had special knowledge of the stresses on trees in urban environments, and was able to explain and give examples of particular problems that had occurred and their solutions. In a second-grade class with many Hispanic students, on the other hand, a teacher aide was able to serve as an expert visitor by describing her memories of childhood in a Spanish-speaking community in New Mexico. Later she also recruited an older Hispanic friend and relative to the class to describe their experiences growing up in Central America. She also acted as their English-Spanish interpreter. In all of these examples, the experts made the learning more real and immediate. Their presence counteracted the tendency to equate school learning with book-based knowledge—a common hazard when basing instructional planning primarily on curriculum documents.

====Field Trips====
In addition to bringing the world to the classroom by inviting visitors, teachers can do the converse: they can take the classroom to the world by leading students on field trips. Such trips are not confined to any particular grade level. In the early grades of elementary school, for example, one common goal of the curriculum is to learn about community helpers—the police, firefighters, store owners, and others who make a community safe and livable. As indicated already, representatives of these groups can visit the class and tell about their work. But the class can also visit the places which these people tell about: a police station, a fire hall, a local retail store, and the like. Such trips offer a more complete picture of the context in which community professionals work than is possible simply from hearing and reading about it. The benefits are possible for older students as well. In learning about water-borne diseases as part of a biology class, for example, one middle-school class took a field trip to the local water-treatment facility, where staff members explained where the town’s water came from and how the water was cleaned to become drinkable at any tap.

From a teacher’s point of view, of course, there are certain risks about arranging classroom visitors or field trips. One is that a visitor may turn out not to communicate well with children or young people—he or she may assume too much prior knowledge, for example, or veer off the chosen topic. Another problem is that field trips often require additional funds (for admission fees or to pay for a bus), and require support from additional adults—often parents—to supervise of students outside of school. Some of these problems are by-passed by arranging “virtual” field trips and hearing from “virtual” visitors: using computer software or media to show students places and activities which they cannot visit in person (Clark, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. (2006). Longitudinal conceptual change in students’ understanding of thermal equilibrium: An examination of the process of conceptual restructuring. ''Cognition and Instruction, 24''(4), 467-563.&lt;/ref&gt;. Generally, though, a computer-based experience cannot with a real trip or visitor in vividness, and the benefits of actual, in-person field trips and visitors often therefore outweigh the challenges of arranging them.

====Service Learning====
Still another way to enhance learning is to incorporate service learning, which is activity that combines real community service with analysis and reflection on the significance of the service (Johnson &amp; O’Grady, 2006; Thomsen, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. &amp; O’Grady, C. (Eds.). (2006). ''The spirit of service: Exploring faith, service, and social justice in higher education.'' Bolton, MA: Anker Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen, K. (2006). ''Service-learning in grades K-8: Experiential learning that builds character and motivation.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin.&lt;/ref&gt;. Picking up trash in an urban streambed, for example, is a community service which students can perform. To transform this service into service learning, students also need to note and reflect on the trash that they find; talk and write about the ecological environment of the stream and of the community; and even make recommendations for improving the local environment. To accomplish these objectives, service learning activities should not be sporadic, nor used as a punishment—as when a teacher or principal assigns trash pick-up as an after-school detention activity.

Under good conditions, service learning enhances instructional plans both morally and intellectually. Morally, it places students in the role of creating good for the community, and counteracts students’ perception that being “good” simply means complying with teachers’ or parents’ rules passively. Intellectually, service learning places social and community issues in a vivid, lived context. The environment, economic inequality, or race relations, for example, are no longer just ideas that people merely talk about, but problems that people actually act upon (Dicklitch, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Dicklitch, S. (2005). Human rights—human wrongs: Making political science real through service-learning. In D. Butin (Ed.), ''Service-learning in higher education: Critical issues and directions.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;.

As you might suspect, though, making service learning successful is not automatic. For one thing, service learning lends itself well only to certain curriculum areas (for example, community studies or social studies). For another, some students may initially resist service learning, wondering whether it benefits them personally as students (Jones, Gilbride-Brown, &amp; Gasiorski, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Jones, S., Gilbride-Brown, J., &amp; Gasiorski, A. (2005). Getting inside the “underside” of service-learning: Student resistance and possibilities. In D. Butin (Ed.), ''Service-learning in higher education: Critical issues and directions''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;. And for another, some service projects may inadvertently be invented only to benefit students, without adequate consultation or advice from community members. Bringing food hampers to low-income families may seem like a good idea to middle-class students or instructors, but some families may perceive this action less as a benefit than as an act of charity which they therefore resent. But none of these problems are insurmountable. Evaluations generally find that service learning, when done well, increases students’ sense of moral empowerment as well as their knowledge of social issues (Buchanan, Baldwin, &amp; Rudisill, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, A., Baldwin, S., &amp; Rudisill, M. (2002). Service learning as scholarship in teacher education. ''Educational Researcher 32''(8), 28-34.&lt;/ref&gt;. Like many other educational practices, insuring success with service learning requires doing it well.

      <comment>/* Set the project start date */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating a basic schedule ==


=== Overview ===
In this section you'll do the following:
* Create a new blank project (mpp file)
* Indicate the overall project start date
* Capture phases, tasks and milestones
* Create dependencies between tasks
* Use the Gantt Wizard to markup tasks on the critical path in red


=== Create a new blank project ===

Launch the application (Start &gt; All programs &gt; Microsoft Project)
The application launches with a new blank project open by default.
[[image:MSProject Application.GIF|none|thumb|80px|[[Media:MSProject Application.GIF|actual size]]]] 

[[image:tst.png|thumb|50px|[[Media:tst.png|actual size]]]] 

If there is not blank project open, you can create a new one (File &gt; New... &gt; Blank Project)

Save the file before continuing. (File &gt; Save as...)

=== Set the project start date===

Use the project information dialogue box to specify the Project Start date and ensure the project gets schedule from the start date. Let's imagine today is 1 Jan 2010 and you're planning this project for February so you want all tasks by default to start on 1 Feb 2010.

=== Enter project stages===
Click in the first line in the Task Name column. Do not type in your project title in line one, this is already contained in a line 0 which is currently just not displaying. By default, the first line in the task sheet should be numbered 1. 

Let's assume that we're doing a systems development project and we are going to specify the stages of the project. Initially, you enter the stages as normal tasks. Type &quot;Initiation&quot; in the task name field and hit Return to move down. Continue to do this for the following stages: Planning, Requirements, Design, Develop, Test and Deploy. Note that the duration column reads &quot;1 day?&quot; for all the tasks because we have not specified a duration.

Compare your screen with the image below before continuing.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:MSProject_Initial_Tasks.GIF|none|thumb|50px|[[MSProject_Initial_Tasks.GIF|actual size]]]] --&gt;

=== Insert tasks into stages===
To specify that the initiation stage will consist of 2 sub tasks, click on row down on planning and press the &quot;Insert&quot; key on your keyboard twice to create 2 blank lines above planning (below Initation. Enter the following tasks below Initiation: Create project charter, Create business case.
Select the 2 sub tasks by dragging over them and click on the green indent button (circled in red below).
Notice how the 2 tasks now fall under Initiation and the Initiation task now turns into a Summary task which appears bold and has a different bar type on the chart.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:MS Project Inserting and indenting.GIF|none|thumb|50px|[[MS Project Inserting and indenting.GIF|actual size]]]] --&gt;


=== Specify task durations===
Let's assume you estimate the project charter will take 4 days. You have no idea how long the business case will take and you'll need to first speak to the person who will be doing it but for now you want to enter a &quot;guesstimate&quot; of 5 days.

Click in the duration cell next to the task name &quot;Create project charter&quot; and type &quot;4&quot; and hit Return. You'll see project automatically assumes the duration as 4 days.
Now type in &quot;5?&quot; and hit return. The question mark tells project that the duration entered is a &quot;guesstimate&quot; and that it needs to be confirmed at a later stage. Compare your screen with the one below.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:MS Project Enter durations.GIF|none|thumb|50px|[[MS Project Enter durations.GIF|actual size]]]] --&gt;

Note on the Gantt chart how project assumes that all tasks can run concurrently.


=== Link tasks===

To indicate that the project charter must first be completed before the business case can start you need to link the tasks in such a way that Project Charter is the predecessor and business case is the sucessor. The easiest way is to Select the tasks (make sure you select top down in this case). Compare your screen with the one below.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:MS Project Linking tasks.GIF|none|thumb|50px|[[MS Project Linking tasks.GIF|actual size]]]] --&gt;

Note on the Gantt chart how the business case task now &quot;waits&quot; for the charter to finish before.





=== Format the Gantt chart to show critical tasks in red ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creating Bridges Among Curriculum Goals and Students’ Prior Experiences==
To succeed, then, instructional plans do require a variety of resources, like the ones discussed in the previous section. But they also require more: they need to connect with students’ prior experiences and knowledge. Sometimes the connections can develop as a result of using the Internet, taking field trips, or engaging in service learning, particularly if students are already familiar with these activities and places. More often than not, though, teachers need to find additional ways to connect curriculum with students’ experiences—ways that fit more thoroughly and continuously into the daily work of a class. Fortunately, such techniques are readily at hand; they simply require the teacher to develop a habit of looking for opportunities to use them. Among the possibilities are four that deserve special mention:
* modeling behavior and modeling representations of ideas,
* activating prior knowledge already familiar to students,
* anticipating preconceptions held by students, and
* providing guided and independent practice, including its most traditional form, homework.

===Modeling===
The term modeling can mean either a demonstration of a desired behavior or a representation of an important theory, idea, or object. Each of these meanings can link curriculum goals with students’ prior knowledge and experience. 

====Modeling as a Demonstration====
In the first meaning, modeling refers to performing or demonstrating a desired new behavior or skill, as when a teacher or classmate demonstrates polite behaviors or the correct solution to a math problem. In this case we say that the teacher or classmate models the desired behavior, either deliberately or in the course of other ongoing activity. Students observe the modeled behavior and (hopefully) imitate it themselves. Research repeatedly shows that modeling desired behaviors is an effective way to learn new behaviors, especially when the model is perceived as important (like the teacher), similar to the learner (like a student’s best friend), or has a warm, positive relationship with the learner (like the teacher or the student’s friend) (Bandura, 2002; Gibson, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (2002). Social cognitive theory in cultural context. ''Journal of Applied Psychology: An International Review, 51,'' 269-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, S. (2004). Social learning (cognitive) theory and implications for human resources development. ''Advances in Developing Human Resources, 6''(2), 192-210.&lt;/ref&gt;. Modeling in this sense is sometimes also called observational learning. It has many of the same properties as the classic operant conditioning discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]], except that reinforcement during observational learning is witnessed in others rather than experienced by the learner directly. Watching others being reinforced is sometimes called vicarious reinforcement. The idea is that if, for example, a student observes a classmate behave politely with the teacher and then sees the classmate receive praise for the behavior (vicarious reinforcement), the student is more likely to imitate the polite behavior that he saw. As in classic operant conditioning, furthermore, if the student observes that politeness by classmates is ignored (extinction or no reinforcement), then the student is much less likely to imitate the politeness. Worse yet, if the student observes that negative behaviors in others lead to positive consequences (like attention from peers), then the student may imitate the negative behaviors (Rebellon, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Rebellon, C. (2006). Do adolescents engage in delinquency to attract the social attention of peers? An extension and longitudinal test of the social reinforcement hypothesis. ''Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 43''(4), 387-411.&lt;/ref&gt;. Cursing and swearing, and even bullying or vandalism, can be reinforced vicariously, just as can more desired behaviors.

Modeling—in this first sense of a demonstration—connects instructional goals to students’ experiences by presenting real, vivid examples of behaviors or skills in a way that a student can practice directly, rather than merely talk about. There is often little need, when imitating a model, to translate ideas or instructions from verbal form into action. For students struggling with language and literacy, in particular, this feature can be a real advantage.

====Modeling as Simplified Representation====
In a second meaning of modeling, a model is a simplified representation of a phenomenon that incorporates the important properties of the phenomenon. Models in this sense may sometimes be quite tangible, direct copies of reality; when I was in fourth grade growing up in California, for example, we made scale models of the Spanish missions as part of our social studies lessons about California history. But models can also be imaginary, though still based on familiar elements. In a science curriculum, for example, the behavior of gas molecules under pressure can be modeled by imagining the molecules as ping pong balls flying about and colliding in an empty room. Reducing the space available to the gas is by making the room smaller, causes the ping pong balls to collide more frequently and vigorously, and thereby increases the pressure on the walls of the room. Increasing the space has the opposite effect. Creating an actual room full of ping pong balls may be impractical, of course, but the model can still be imagined.

Modeling in this second sense is not about altering students’ behavior, but about increasing their understanding of a newly learned idea, theory, or phenomenon. The model itself uses objects or events that are already familiar to students—in this example simple balls and their behavior when colliding—and in this way supports students’ learning of new, unfamiliar material. Not every new concept or idea lends itself to such modeling, but many do: students can create models of unfamiliar animals, for example, or of medieval castles, or of ecological systems. Two-dimensional models—essentially drawings—can also be helpful: students can illustrate literature or historical events, or make maps of their own neighborhoods. The choice of model depends largely on the specific curriculum goals which the teacher needs to accomplish at a particular time.

===Activating Prior Knowledge===
Another way to connect curriculum goals to students’ experience is by activating prior knowledge, a term that refers to encouraging students to recall what they know already about new material being learned. Various formats for activating prior knowledge are possible. When introducing a unit about how biologists classify animal and plant species, for example, for example, a teacher can invite students to discuss about how they already classify different kinds of plants and animals. Having highlighted this informal knowledge, the teacher can then explore how  the same species are classified by biological scientists, and compare the scientists’ classification schemes to the students’ own schemes. The activation does not have to happen orally, as in this example; a teacher can also ask students to write down as many distinct types of animals and plants that they can think of, and then ask students to diagram or map their relationships—essentially creating a concept map like the ones we described in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies|Chapter 8]] (Gurlitt, et al., 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Gurlitt, J., Renkl, A., Motes, M., &amp; Hauser, S. (2006). How can we use concept maps for prior knowledge activation? ''Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Learning Sciences,'' 217-220.&lt;/ref&gt;. Whatever the strategy used, activation helps by making students’ prior knowledge or experience conscious and therefore easier to link to new concepts or information.

===Anticipating Preconceptions of Students===
Ironically, activating students’ prior knowledge can be a mixed blessing if some of the prior knowledge is misleading or downright wrong. Misleading or erroneous knowledge is especially common among young students, but it can happen at any grade level. A kindergarten child may think that the sun literally “rises” in the morning, since she often hears adults use this expression, or that the earth is flat because it obviously looks flat. But a high school student may mistakenly believe that large objects (a boulder) fall faster than small ones (a pebble), or that a heavy object dropped (not thrown) from a moving car window will fall straight down instead of traveling laterally alongside the car while it falls.

Because misconceptions are quite common among students and even among adults, teachers are more effective if they can anticipate preconceptions of students wherever possible. The task is twofold. First the teacher must know or at least guess students’ preconceptions as much as possible in advance, so that she can design learning activities to counteract and revise their thinking. Some preconceptions have been well-documented by educational research and therefore can in principle be anticipated easily—though they may still sometimes take a teacher by surprise during a busy activity or lesson (Tanner &amp; Allen, 2005; Chiu &amp; Lin, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, K. &amp; Allen, D. (2005). Approaches to biology teaching and learning—understanding the wrong answers: Teaching toward conceptual change. ''Cell Biology Education, 4,'' 112-117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chiu, M. &amp; Lin, J. (2005). Promoting 4th-graders’ conceptual change of their understanding of electrical current via multiple analogies. ''Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 42''(4), 429-464.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Table 9-8]] lists a few of these common preconceptions. Others may be unique to particular students, however, and a teacher may only by able to learn of them through experience—by listening carefully to what students say and write and by watching what they do. A few preconceptions may be so ingrained or tied to other, more deeply held beliefs that students may resist giving them up, either consciously or unconsciously. It may be hard, for example, for some students to give up the idea that girls are less talented at math or science than are boys, even though research generally finds this is not the case (Hyde &amp; Linn, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, J. &amp; Lynn, M. (2006). Gender similarities in mathematics and science. ''Science, 314''(5799), 599-600.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The second task when anticipating preconceptions is to treat students’ existing knowledge and beliefs with respect even when they do include misconceptions or errors. This may seem obvious in principle, but it needs remembering when students persist with misconceptions in spite of a teacher’s efforts to teach alternative ideas or concepts. Most of us—including most students—have reasons for holding our beliefs, even when the beliefs do not agree with teachers, textbooks, or other authorities, and we appreciate having our beliefs treated with respect. Students are no different from other people in this regard. In a high school biology class, for example, some students may have personal reasons for not agreeing with the theory of evolution associated with Charles Darwin. For religious reasons they may support explanations of the origins of life that give a more active, interventionist role to God (Brumfiel, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Brumfiel, G. (2005). Intelligent design: Who has designs on your students’ minds? ''Nature, 434,'' 1062-1065.&lt;/ref&gt;. If their beliefs disagree with the teacher’s or the textbook, then the disagreement needs to be acknowledged, but acknowledged respectfully. For some students (and perhaps some teachers), expressing fundamental disagreement respectfully may feel awkward, but it needs to be done nonetheless.

===Guided Practice, Independent Practice, and Homework===
So far, we have focused on bridging the goals or content of a curriculum to events, beliefs, and ideas from students’ lives. In studying human growth in a health class, for example, a teacher might ask students to bring photos of themselves as a much younger child. In this case a concept from the curriculum—human growth—then gets related to a personal event, getting photographed as a youngster, that the student finds meaningful.

But teachers can also create bridges between curriculum and students’ experiences in another way, by relating the process of learning in school with the process of learning outside of school. Much of this task involves helping students to make the transition from supervised learning to self-regulated learning—or put differently, from practice that is relatively guided to practice that is relatively independent.

====Guided Practice====
When students first learn a new skill or a new set of ideas, they are especially likely to encounter problems and make mistakes that interfere with the very process of learning. In figuring out how to use a new software program, for example, a student may unknowingly press a wrong button that prevents further functioning of the program. In translating sentences from Spanish into English in language class, for another example, a student might misinterpret one particular word or grammatical feature, and this one mistake may cause many sentences to be translated incorrectly. And so on. So students initially need guided practice—opportunities to work somewhat independently, but with a teacher or other expert close at hand prevent or fix difficulties when they occur. In general, educational research has found that guided practice helps all learners, but especially those who are struggling (Bryan &amp; Burstein, 2004: Woodward, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, T. &amp; Burstein, K. (2004). Improving homework completion and academic performance: Lessons from special education. ''Theory into Practice, 43''(3), 213-219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, J. (2004). Mathematics education in the United States: Past to present. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities, 37,'' pp. 16 - 31.&lt;/ref&gt;. A first-grade child has difficulty in decoding printed words, for example, benefits from guidance more than one who can decode easily. But both students benefit in the initial stages of learning, since both may make more mistakes then. Guided practice, by its nature, sends a dual message to students: it is important to learn new material well, but it is also important to become able to use learning without assistance, beyond the lesson where it is learned and even beyond the classroom.

Guided practice is much like the concepts of the zone of proximal development (or ZPD) and instructional scaffolding that we discussed in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process|Chapter 2]] in connection with Vygotsky’s theory of learning. In essence, during guided practice the teacher creates a ZPD or scaffold (or framework) in which the student can accomplish more with partial knowledge or skill than the student could accomplish alone. But whatever its name—guided practice, a ZPD, or a scaffold—insuring the guidance is successful depends on several key elements: focus on the task at hand, asking questions that break the task into manageable parts, reframing or restating the task so that it becomes more understandable, and giving frequent feedback about the student’s progress (Rogoff, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B. (2003). ''Cultural nature of human development,'' Chapter 7, “Thinking with the tools and institutions of culture,” pp. 236-281.&lt;/ref&gt;. Combining the elements appropriately takes sensitivity and improvisational skill—even artfulness—but these very challenges are among the true joys of teaching.

====Independent Practice====
As students gain facility with a new skill or new knowledge, they tend to need less guidance and more time to consolidate (or strengthen) their new knowledge with additional practice. Since they are less likely to encounter mistakes or problems at this point, they begin to benefit from independent practice—opportunities to review and repeat their knowledge at their own pace and with fewer interruptions. At this point, therefore, guided practice may feel less like help than like an interruption, even if it is well-intentioned. A student who already knows how to use a new computer program, for example, may be frustrated by waiting for the teacher to explain each step of the program individually. If a student is already skillful at translating Spanish sentences into English in a language class, it can be annoying for the teacher to “help” by pointing out minor errors that the student is likely to catch for herself.

By definition, the purpose of independent practice is to provide more self-regulation of learning than by definition happens in guided practice. It implies a different message for students than is conveyed by guided practice, a message that goes beyond the earlier one: that it is now time to take more complete responsibility for own learning. When all goes well, independent practice is the eventual outcome of the zone of proximal development created during the earlier phase of guided practice described above: the student can now do on his or her own, what originally required assistance from someone else. Or stated differently, independent practice is a way of encouraging self-determination about learning, in the sense that we discussed this idea in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 6: Student Motivation|Chapter 6]]. In order to work independently, a student must set his own direction and monitor his own success; by definition, no one can do this for him.

====Homework====
The chances are that you already have experienced many forms of homework in your own educational career. The widespread practice of assigning review work to do outside of school is a way of supplementing scarce time in class and of providing independent practice for students. Homework has generated controversy throughout most of its history in public education, partly because it encroaches on students’ personal and family-oriented time, and partly because research finds no consistent benefits of doing homework (Gill &amp; Schlossman, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Gill, B. &amp; Schlossman, S. (2004). Villain or savior? The American discourse on homework, 1850-2003. ''Theory into practice, 43''(3), 174-181. &lt;/ref&gt;. In spite of these criticisms, though, parents and teachers tend to favor homework when it is used for two main purposes. One purposes is to review and practice material that has already been introduced and practiced at school; a sheet of arithmetic problems might be a classic example. When used for this purpose, the amount of homework is usually minimal in the earliest grades, if any is assigned at all. One educational expert recommends only ten minutes per day in first grade at most, and only gradual increases in amount as students get older (Cooper &amp; Valentine, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, H. &amp; Valentine, J. (2001). Using research to answer practical questions about homework. ''Educational Psychology, 36''(3), 143-153.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The second purpose for supporting homework is to convey the idea of schoolwork  being the “job” of childhood and youth. Just as on an adult job, students must complete homework tasks with minimal supervision and sometimes even minimal training. Doing the tasks, furthermore, is a way to get ahead or further along in the work place (for an adult) or at school (for a child). One study in which researchers interviewed children about these ideas, in fact, found that children do indeed regard homework as work in the same way that adults think of a job (Cornu &amp; Xu, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Corno, L. &amp; Xu, J. (2004). Homework as the job of childhood. ''Theory into Practice, 43''(3), 227-233.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the children’s minds, homework tasks were not “fun,” in spite of teachers’ frequent efforts to make them fun. Instead they were jobs that needed doing, much like household chores. When it came to homework, children regarded parents as the teachers’ assistants—people merely carrying out the wishes of the teacher. And like any job, the job of doing homework varied in stressfulness; when required at an appropriate amount and level of difficulty, and when children reported having good “bosses” (parents and teachers), the job of homework could actually be satisfying in the way that many adults’ jobs can be satisfying when well-done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I see now that my way of sectioning chapters into manageably sized webpages has the disadvantage of concealing some of the content on the opening page(s)--i.e. subsections are not currently evident to a reader unless the reader actually goes and checks out the parent section.

A possible remedy is to post a &quot;detailed table of contents&quot; somewhere, and constantly refer readers to it. This was my original intent with the opening page of each chapter, but the sectioning challenges got ahead of me. Maybe a better place for a detailed table of contents would be at or near the page for the &quot;brief&quot; table of contents?

      <comment>/* Using Antivirus Software */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Basic Computer Security|{{{{BOOKNAME}}/{{CHAPTERNAME}}}}}} 
Whilst the list of malware that can infect your computer looks daunting, there are several relatively simple steps that you can take to prevent being infected by these nasty pieces of software.

== Dealing With Viruses ==

Unfortunately in the web climate of today sticking even to trusted websites can leave you wide open to virus attacks. Staying away from dodgy websites will prevent most virus infections, but there will always be one or two viruses that find their way on to your system, with the ability to cause untold amounts of damage.

However, viruses can be easily combated by installing and using a reputable antivirus package. Antivirus programs are essential but choosing the right one can be just as important as having one. 

Generally commercial antivirus products tend to perform best at keeping your computer free from infection. Some recommended antivirus packages are (in no particular order):
*Symantec's Norton Antivirus
*McAfee Antivirus
*Steganos Antivirus 
though there are many other commercial packages that will do just as good a job.

There are also several free anti-virus packages that will protect you from a variety of threats. Two of the most well known offerings are AVG Antivirus and Avast Antivirus.

=== Using Antivirus Software ===

Once antivirus software is installed, it should dramatically increase your computer's defences against malware. However, it is important to ensure that it is set up to scan for and defend against all viruses.

Although the features between different packages may be similar, the methods for enabling and disabling them will vary wildly.

To ensure that you are as protected, you can be make sure that you enable everything that looks useful. Words to look out for are 'heuristics', 'bloodhound', 'proactive defense' and 'registry guard' or anything that sounds similar. Also set the scan security level to highest possible to ensure that nothing is missed. This will elongate scan times but will ensure that as few viruses as possible are missed. Also tell your antivirus to scan inside archives.

If you are unsure how to set up your antivirus product refer to the documentation that came bundled with it or the companies website.

=== Scanning for Viruses ===

For most users scanning once a week should be sufficient to protect your computer from damage. Ideally you should scan your computer every few days, especially if you are accessing internet banking services on a daily basis. Try and scan your computer as often as possible, but don't go crazy with it, adjust the frequency of scans to the level of internet activity on your computer.

=== Dealing with Trojan Horses ===

Generally trojan horses will be found and removed by your anti-virus software.

==Overview==
*Rare malignancy of vascular origin
**Soft tissue sarcoma ~1% of all malignancies
**Angiosarcoma ~2% of soft tissue sarcomas
*Clinically heterogenous, and can occur anywhere in the body
**~1/3 cutaneous
**~1/4 soft tissue
**Rest miscelaneous locations
*Thought to arise from vascular endothelium
*Unlike other sarcomas, may present as multifocal disease, and spread to LNs and distantly
*Typically have an aggressive course, with difficulty clearing surgical margins, and with frequent local and distant failure
*Treatment is challenging, and requires multidisciplinary approach

==Pathogenesis==
*Thought to originate from vascular endothelium
**Cell marker studies are consistent with lymphocyte differentiation but ultrastructural characteristics are consistent with blood vessel differentiation (PMID 3104187)
*Vascular endothelial factor D ([[w:VEGF|VEGF-D]]) (PMID 14746640) and [[w:Angiopoietin|angiopoietin 2]] (PMID 15149523) significantly elevated compared to controls 
*Fas ligand (w:Fas_ligand|Fas-L) is detected in &gt;70% tumors (PMID 11549589), and number of Fas-L positive cells correlates inversely with survival. This suggests that Fas-L positive tumor cells may induce apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and thus blunt immune response
*Frequently develops in areas previously treated with radiation (e.g. breast) or with chronic lymphedema [[w:Stewart-Treves_syndrome|Stewart-Treves syndrome]]
**Median time from RT 8.6 years in one series (PMID 15166970), and risk increases with dose
*Pathology
**Distinguished from [[w:hemangioma|hemangioma]] by presence of &quot;collagen dissection patterns&quot;, anastomoses, and papillary formation
**Early lesions may in fact present as benign hemangiomas
**Most present as intermediate or high grade lesions, but typically have an aggressive course
**Well differentiated tumors are composed of well-formed, irregular vascular channels (sinusoids) anastomosing together, lined by atypical cells (64%)
**Poorly differentatied tumors may contain only pleomorphic spindle cells with subtle vascular lumens, or may still contain vaso-formative areas
**Grade is not a prognostic factor

*'''Mass General Hospital; 2007''' (1980-2006) PMID 17356953 -- &quot;Treatment and outcome of 82 patients with angiosarcoma.&quot; (Abraham JA, Ann Surg Oncol. 2007 Jun;14(6):1953-67.)
**Retrospective. 82 patients (32 cutaneous, 22 deep tissue/organs, 10 RT or lymphedema, 8 bone, 7 non-RT breast). 
**Primary disease: 46 patients, all treated with surgery, 67% RT and 27% chemo. 5-year DSS 60%. Negative prognosis: intermediate/high grade, RT- or lymphedema-related
**Advanced disease: 36 patients, 36 palliative surgery, 78% RT, 58% chemo. Median survival 7 months. Cutaneous tumors better prognosis
**Conclusion: Aggressive surgical resection with RT for close margins or worrisome pathology can result in long-term survival. Advanced disease poor prognosis

*'''UCLA; 1996''' (1955-1990) PMID 8635113 -- &quot;Angiosarcoma. A report of 67 patients and a review of the literature.&quot; (Mark RJ, Cancer. 1996 Jun 1;77(11):2400-6.)
**Retrospective. 67 patients. Median F/U 2.5 years)
**Outcome: 2-year DFS 44% and 5-year DFS 24%. 81% LR component
**5-year DFS: surgery + RT 43% vs. surgery +/- CT 17% (SS)
**Conclusion: Surgery + RT offers best chance for long term control; chemo undefined


==Cutaneous Angiosarcoma==
===Overview===
*Typically presents on scalp or face
*Optimal treatment has not been defined due to rarity, but probably includes primary resection with wide margins, followed by adjuvant RT
*RT recommendations from PMID 17023791
**Consider dose 45-50 Gy subclinical disease, 60-65 Gy for adjuvant treatment, and 70-75 Gy for gross disease
**Risk of LN mets is probably 10-20%, therefore consider elective nodal RT
**Consider [[Radiation_Oncology/Total_Scalp|total scalp irradiation]] due to need for very wide margins
*Docetaxel and paclitaxel appear to have some activity in palliative setting


===Presentation===
*Patients tend to be older, white, and male
*Lesion that resembles a &quot;spreading bruise&quot;, variable color from blue, purple, to red
*May be gravity dependent, and be brought on for example by washing hair in a sink
*Nodular component often develops with time
*Usually asymptomatic, but may develop bleeding or ulceration
*Typically more extensive than suggested by physical findings


===Diagnosis===
*&quot;Head-Tilt&quot; maneuver, where patient is asked to place his/her head below the level of the heart for 10 seconds. The involved area becomes markedly violaceous and engorged (PMID 17224545)
*MRI to define extent of primary tumor
*Consider CT to detect regional node mets
*Biopsy necessary to obtain diagnosis, but grading may be difficult (PMID 16359536)
*There is no specific AJCC Staging; please see Staging for [[Radiation_Oncology/Soft_tissue_sarcoma#Staging|soft tissue sarcoma]], with understanding that angiosarcoma grade is not prognostic


*'''Hamamatsu; 2005''' (Japan) PMID 16272865 -- &quot;Magnetic resonance imaging findings of angiosarcoma of the scalp.&quot; (Isoda H, J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2005 Nov-Dec;29(6):858-62.)
**8 patients with angiosarcoma of the scalp. 
**Outcome: tumors well enhanced on both contrast T1 with fat saturation and T2 with fat saturation. In 4/8 patients tumors were larger than on inspection
**Conclusion: MRI useful for determining extent

*'''Institut Curie; 2003''' (France) PMID 12951681 -- &quot;Cytohistologic correlations in angiosarcoma including classic and epithelioid variants: Institut Curie's experience.&quot; (Klinanienko J, Diagn Cytopathol. 2003 Sep;29(3):140-5.)
**Retrospective. FNA and histology review of 29 tumors in 23 patients
**Conclusion: Accurate tumor typing difficult, particularly in low-grade angiosarcoma


===Outcomes===
*'''Japan; 2005''' (1988-2002) PMID 15817349 -- &quot;Angiosarcoma of the scalp treated with curative radiotherapy plus recombinant interleukin-2 immunotherapy.&quot; (Ohguri T, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Apr 1;61(5):1446-53.)
**Retrospective. 20 patients treated with RT and recombinant [[w:Interleukin_2|IL-2]]. RT dose median 70 Gy
**Outcome: median OS 3 years, 5-year DSS 40%; 70% developed recurrence, 50% local component
**IL-2 resulted in significanly less DM
**Conclusion: RT + rIL-2 is effective, need additional studies

*'''Multi-institutional; 2004''' PMID 15153886 -- &quot;Cutaneous angiosarcoma: a case series with prognostic correlation.&quot; (Morgan MR, J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004 Jun;50(6):867-74.)
**Retrospective. 4 institutions. 47 patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma (breast, prior-RT, or prior lymphedema excluded). Average age 75 years, men 3:1, 96% head and neck. Follow up range 0.5-5 years
**Histology: anastomosing dissecting sinusois lined by atypical cells (64%), diffuse epithelioid/spindle cell proliferation (15%), mixed (21%). Average depth of invasion 2.9 mm (1.8-6 mm), average size 5.3 cm (1-9 cm)
**5-year outcome: LR 84%, OS 34%; most patients died with widespread pulmonary, cardiac, and/or brain mets. 
**Negative predictors: large diameter (&gt;5 cm), depth (&gt;3 mm), high mitotic rate, SM+
**Conclusion: poor prognosis

*'''Michigan; 2003''' (1975-2002) PMID 14534889 -- &quot;Cutaneous angiosarcoma of the scalp: a multidisciplinary approach.&quot; (Pawlik TM, Cancer. 2003 Oct 15;98(8):1716-26.)
**Retrospective. 29 patients with scalp lesions only. 75% pT2, 76% high grade. 97% surgery but only 21% SM-. RT given as wide-field in 79% including all patients with SM-. Median F/U 1.5 years
**Outcome: median OS 2.4 years; negative prognosis: older patients and T2 disease. RT prolonged time to local recurrence
**Conclusion: surgery first option, post-op RT should be employed routinely

*'''MD Anderson; 1995''' (1970-1989) PMID 8625109 -- &quot;Cutaneous angiosarcoma of the head and neck. A therapeutic dilemma.&quot; (Morrison WH, Cancer. 1995 Jul 15;76(2):319-27.)
**Retrospective. 14 patients with scalp (n=11) and upper face (n=3). Surgery in 7, chemo in 10. Median RT dose 60 Gy (50-66) microscopic and 55-75 Gy macroscopic
**5-year outcome: LR control microscopic 40% vs. 24% macroscopic; infield control 80% vs. 55%; 5-year OS 50% vs. 13% (overall 29%)
**Conclusion: RT effective for local disease, especially if R0/R1 disease

*'''St. John's Hospital; 1987''' (London, UK) PMID 3104187 -- &quot;Angiosarcoma of the face and scalp, prognosis and treatment.&quot; (Holden CA, Cancer. 1987 Mar 1;59(5):1046-57.)
**Retrospective. 72 patients with angiosarcoma of face and scalp. 
**5-year OS: 12%; half died within 15 months of presentation
**Prognostic factors: larger lesions (&gt;10cm); location, age, gender, appearance not significant
**Radical RT (wide-field electrons) resulted in good local control; 2 patients developed pulmonary disease 10 years later

===Chemotherapy===
*'''Kobe; 2007''' (2003-2006) PMID 17582627 -- &quot;Docetaxel: A therapeutic option in the treatment of cutaneous angiosarcoma: report of 9 patients.&quot; (Nagano T, Cancer. 2007 Aug 1;110(3):648-51.)
**Retrospective. 9 patients given docetaxel 25 mg/m2 QW x8 weeks. 6 had RT, 4 surgery, and  IL-2
**Outcome: 2 CR, 4 PR. Severe radiation dermatitis in 3/9
**Conclusion: docetaxel has activity and may suppress lung mets

*'''MSKCC; 1999''' (1992-1998) PMID 10570428 -- &quot;Paclitaxel in the treatment of patients with angiosarcoma of the scalp or face.&quot; (Fata F, Cancer. 1999 Nov 15;86(10):2034-7.)
**Prospective. 9 patients with AS of scalp or face. 6 prior RT. 3 metastatic, 6 unresectable or recurrent. paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (also 90 and 250) Q3W
**Outcome: 4 CR, 4 PR. Median duration of response 5 months
**Toxicity: neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy
**Conclusion: paclitaxel as single agent has substantial activity

==Section IV Logical Reasoning==
'''Question 08'''&lt;br&gt;
Common sense tells you that the argument is not entirely true since they still teach Latin and Greek in high school and college. People still learns hieroglyphics to read Egyptian inscriptions. The task here is to find a choice that best describes the weakness in the argument. Here is a rephrase of the paragraph.

Knowing ancient Greek is essential for reading original Greek texts. “Most” (but not necessarily all!) Greek are translated into English so we can just read English translations of Homer and Plato.  So ancient historian wannabes don’t need to learn Greek anymore.

The weakness of the argument is that there maybe a small number of the texts that have not been translated. The argument did not preclude this possibility since it did not say all ancient historical documents have been translated.  

'''(A) Correct.''' Knowing ancient Greek is not always necessary since we have an English translation of Iliad and Odyssey. But there may be a few works that were not translated. It is too strong to say it is no longer necessary to learn the languages. Watch out for extreme words like “never”&lt;br&gt;
(B) Incorrect. The passage does not treats the fact as an opinion.  False.&lt;br&gt;
(C) Incorrect. The conclusion is NOT a restatement of the evidence. The evidence is “most are translated into English” and “we can read them in English”. The conclusion is “therefore, we don’t need to learn the original languages.”&lt;br&gt;
(D) Incorrect. There is no expert judgement here.&lt;br&gt;                                      
(E) Incorrect. all the evidences are consistent. No problem here.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The next thing we need to look at to properly read the plot is the key. Lets look at our example again.

Scores of Our Last Math Test

 6|446
 7|02668
 8|022244888
 9|026
 
 9|2 = 92%

The key in this case is:
 9|2 = 92%

What does the key tell us? It tells us, that in this case, the data we are looking at are percentages. It is always important to know what you are looking at, and not just be a robot and read numbers off of a plot. Now that we understand the title and the key, we know that by reading the data off of our plot, we are reading off grades in percentages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Redundancy in Expressions ===

 let $r := if ($x = 1) then true() else false();
better as

OR for a sequence of items

OR another possible for a sequence
  (&lt;test/&gt;,&lt;test/&gt;,&lt;default/&gt;)[not(position() = last() and not(last() = 1))]

any number of cascaded defaults can be handled this way.

compare with 'COALESCE' in SQL

Halvah (alva) is an/a asian/turkish/east-european/middle eastern food made mostly from sugar and sesame seed (taan, tahan or tahini halvah). Several varieties of halvah are made from only sugar and flour. Most varieties of Halvah from the Balkan peninsula.

Indian varieties include a base of shredded carrot, chickpea flour, or cream of wheat.</text>

      <comment>/* Stock Split */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Equity Securities==
A corporation can create capital by offering shares of the corporation to the public.  These shares are Equity Securities, or stocks.
When a corporation wants to sell equity securities it first applies for a charter that states the par-value and the number of authorized shares.
Here is an outline of the types of shares:

*Authorized 
**Issued
***Treasury
***Outstanding
**Unissued

Stocks may either be common stock or preferred stock.
Holders of Common Stock enjoy the following rights as part owner of the corporation:
*The right to a certificate
*A share of profits in the form of dividends, when and if paid
*The right to attend shareholder meetings and to vote on matters, particularly election of the board of directors
*The right to transfer or sell their shares of the stock
*Access to information about the corporation like financial statements
*Pre-emptive offer of newly issued stocks proportionate to their current holdings.

Dividends may either be in the form of cash paid to the share holder, additional shares, or some combination of both. If the dividend is paid in shares, each shareholder's percent ownership remains the same since all shareholders receive equal dividend shares for each share owned. Dividends paid in shares increase the number of outstanding shares, but not the par-value.  Dividends are paid to common stock holders after all debts are paid, and after dividends are paid to shareholders of preferred stock.

==Preferred Stock==

Owners of Preferred Stock have a priority claim to any remaining assets in bankruptcy after creditors (for example, bondholders) have been paid, but before any payments are available to common stockholders. Preferred shares also may have a guaranteed dividend, and sometimes offer superior voting powers to common shareholders. It is important to individually review the rights attached to a corporation's preferred shares as additional rights vary significantly from company to company. Some preferred shares have no voting rights at all, or may not offer guarantee dividends.

Dividends paid to preferred stockholders are usually at a fixed rate based on the par-value, and can be cumulative, meaning that if a dividend was not paid for some reason that dividend will accumulate and must be paid in arrears when the funds become available.
Preferred stock can also be convertible to a fixed amount of common stocks.  It can also be callable, meaning the corporation can call or buy back preferred shares. Also preferred stocks can participate in dividends paid to common shareholders.

==Stock Split==

A corporation can propose to the share holders to split the stock in order to make the stock more affordable to investors.  Shareholders have the option to vote for or against the split.  If the split proposal passes, then the number of outstanding shares increases proportionate to the ratio of the split.  Say for a 2:1 split, then each shareholder would get an additional share, thus doubling the number of outstanding shares.  The new shares come from the original authorized shares that were unissued.  Splitting a stock, say 1:2, would reduce the share price to half the pre-split value, and it also would split the par-value of the shares.
A stock can also have a reverse split.  This would make the stock more attractive to investors if the share value was low.  Reverse splits reduces the number of outstanding shares and the par-value proportionate to the split ratio, say 1:2 for example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Selecting Appropriate Assessment Techniques, Part 1: High Quality Assessments==
For an assessment to be high quality it needs to have good validity and reliability as well as absence from bias. 

===Validity===
'''Validity''' is the evaluation of the &quot;adequacy and appropriateness of the interpretations and uses of assessment results” for a given group of individuals (Linn &amp; Miller, 2005, p. 68)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. &amp; Miller, M. (2005). ''Measurement and assessment in teaching.&quot;  Columbus, OH: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, is it appropriate to conclude that the results of a mathematics test on fractions given to recent immigrants accurately represents their understanding of fractions? Is it appropriate for the teacher to conclude, based on her observations, that a kindergarten student, Jasmine, has Attention Deficit Disorder because she does not follow the teachers oral instructions? Obviously in each situation other interpretations are possible – that the immigrant students have poor English skills rather than mathematics skills, or that Jasmine may be hearing impaired.
  
It is important to understand that validity refers to the ''interpretation'' and ''uses'' made of the results of an assessment procedure, not of the assessment procedure itself. For example, making judgments about the results of the same test on fractions may be valid if the students all understand English well. A teacher concluding from her observations that the kindergarten student has Attention Deficit Disorder may be appropriate if the student has been screened for hearing and other disorders (although the classification of a disorder like ADD cannot be made by one teacher). Validity involves making an overall judgment of the degree to which the interpretations and uses of the assessment results are justified. Validity is a matter of degree (e.g., high, moderate, or low validity) rather than all-or none (e.g. totally valid vs. invalid).

Three sources of evidence are considered when assessing validity - content, construct and predictive. '''Content validity''' is associated with the question: How well does the assessment include the content or tasks it is supposed to?  For example, suppose your educational psychology instructor devises a mid-term test and tells you this includes chapters one to seven in the text book.  Obviously, all the items in test should be based on the content from educational psychology, not your methods or cultural foundations classes. Also, the items in the test should cover content from all seven chapters and not just chapters three to seven  -  unless the instructor tells you that these chapters have priority. 

Teachers’ have to be clear about their purposes and priorities for instruction before they can begin to gather evidence related content validity. Content validation determines the degree that assessment tasks are relevant and representative of the tasks judged by the teacher (or test developer) to represent their goals and objectives. It is important for teachers to think about content validation when devising assessment tasks and one way to help do this is to devise a Table of Specifications. An example, based on Pennsylvania’s State standards for grade 3 geography, is in [[Table 10-1]]. In the left hand column is the instructional content for a 20-item test the teacher has decided to construct with two kinds of instructional objectives: identification and uses or locates. The second and third columns identify the number of items for each content area and each instructional objective. Notice that the teacher has decided that six items should be devoted to the sub area of geographic representations- more than any other sub area. Devising a table of specifications helps teachers determine if some content areas or concepts are over-sampled (i.e., there are too many items) and some concepts are under-sampled (i.e., there are too few items).

'''Construct validity''' is more complex than content validity evidence. Often we are interested in making broader judgments about student’s performances than specific skills such as doing fractions. The focus may be on constructs such as mathematical reasoning or reading comprehension. A construct is a characteristic of a person we assume exists to help explain behavior. For example, we use the concept of test anxiety to explain why some individuals when taking a test have difficulty concentrating, have physiological reactions such as sweating, and perform poorly on tests but not in class assignments. Similarly mathematics reasoning and reading comprehension are constructs as we use them to help explain performance on an assessment. Construct validation is the process of determining the extent to which performance on an assessment can be interpreted in terms of the intended constructs and is not influenced by factors irrelevant to the construct. For example, judgments about recent immigrants’ performance on a mathematical reasoning test administered in English will have low construct validity if the results are influenced by English Language skills that are irrelevant to mathematical problem solving.  Similarly, construct validity of end-of-semester examinations is likely to be poor for those students who are highly anxious when taking major tests but not during regular class periods or when doing assignments. Teachers can help increase construct validity by trying to reduce factors that influence performance but are irrelevant to the construct  being assessed. These factors include anxiety, English language skills, and reading speed. 

A third form of validity evidence is called '''criterion-related validity'''.  Selective colleges use the ACT or SAT among other criteria to choose who will be admitted because these standardized tests help predict freshman grades, i.e., have high criterion-related validity. Some K-12 schools give students math or reading tests in Fall semester in order to predict which are likely to do well on the annual State Tests administered in Spring semester and which students are unlikely to pass the tests and so will need additional assistance. If the tests administered in Fall do not predict students’ performances accurately then the additional assistance may be given to the wrong students illustrating the importance of criterion-related validity. 

===Reliability===
'''Reliability''' refers to the ''consistency'' of a measurement (Linn &amp; Miller 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. &amp; Miller, M. (2005). ''Measurement and assessment in teaching.&quot;  Columbus, OH: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;. Suppose Mr. Garcia is teaching a unit on food chemistry in his 10th grade class and gives an assessment at the end of the unit using test items from the teachers’ guide. Reliability is related to questions such as: How similar would the scores of the students be if they had taken the assessment on a Friday or Monday? Would the scores have varied if Mr. Garcia had selected different test items, or if a different teacher had graded the test? An assessment provides information about students by using a specific measure of performance at one particular time. Unless the results from the assessment are reasonably consistent over different occasions, different raters, or different tasks (in the same content domain) confidence in the results will be low and so cannot be useful in improving student learning.   

Obviously we cannot expect perfect consistency. Students’ memory, attention, fatigue, effort, and anxiety fluctuate and so influence performance. Even trained raters vary somewhat when grading assessment such as essays, a science project, or an oral presentation. Also, the wording and design of specific items influence students’ performances. However, some assessments are more reliable than others and there are several strategies teachers can use to increase reliability:

# ''Assessments with more tasks or items typically have higher reliability.'' To understand this, consider two tests one with five items and one with 50 items. Chance factors influence the shorter test more than the longer test. If a student does not understand one of the items in the first test the total score is very highly influenced (it would be reduced by 20 %). In contrast, if there was one item in the test with 50 items that were confusing, the total score would be influenced much less (by only 2%). Obviously this does not mean that assessments should be inordinately long, but, on average, enough tasks should be included to reduce the influence of chance variations.
# ''Clear directions and tasks help increase reliability.'' If the directions or wording of specific tasks or items are unclear, then students have to guess what they mean undermining the accuracy of their results.
# ''Clear scoring criteria are crucial in ensuring high reliability.'' In a later section of this chapter we describe strategies for developing scoring criteria for a variety of types of assessment.
 
===Absence of Bias=== 
Bias occurs in assessment when there are components in the assessment method or administration of the assessment that distort the performance of the student because of their personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, or social class (Popham, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2005). ''Classroom Assessment: What teachers need to know.''  Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;. Two types of assessment bias are important: offensiveness and unfair penalization. An assessment is most likely to be ''offensive to a subgroup of students'' when negative stereotypes are included in the test. For example, the assessment in a health class could include items in which all the doctors were men and all the nurses were women. Or a series of questions in a social studies class could portray Latinos and Asians as immigrants rather than native born Americans. In these examples, some female, Latino or Asian students are likely to be offended by the stereotypes, and this can distract them from performing well on the assessment.

''Unfair penalization'' occurs when items disadvantage one group not because they may be offensive but because of differential background experiences. For example, an item for math assessment that assumes knowledge of a particular sport may disadvantage groups not as familiar with that sport (e.g., American football for recent immigrants). Or an assessment on team work that asks students to model their concept of a team on a symphony orchestra is likely to be easier for those students who have attended orchestra performances - probably students from affluent families. Unfair penalization does not occur just because some students do poorly in class. For example, asking questions about a specific sport in a Physical Education class when information on that sport had been discussed in class is not unfair penalization as long as the questions do not require knowledge beyond that taught in class that some groups are less likely to have.   

It can be difficult for new teachers teaching in multiethnic classrooms to devise interesting assessments that do not penalize any groups of students. Teachers need to think seriously about the impact of students’ differing backgrounds on the assessment they use in class. Listening carefully to what students say is important as is learning about the backgrounds of the students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Selecting Appropriate Assessment Techniques, Part 2: Types of Teacher-made Assessments==
One of the challenges for beginning teachers is to select and use appropriate assessment techniques. In this section we summarize the wide variety of types of assessments that classroom teachers use. First we discuss the informal techniques teachers use during instruction that typically require instantaneous decisions. Then we consider formal assessment techniques that teachers plan before instruction and allow for reflective decisions. 

===Teachers’ Observation, Questioning, and Record Keeping===
During teaching, teachers not only have to communicate the information they planned but also continuously monitor students’ learning and motivation in order to determine whether modifications have to be made (Airasian, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Airasian, P. W.  (2004). ''Classroom Assessment: Concepts and Applications 3rd ed.''  Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;. Beginning teachers find this more difficult than experienced teachers because of the complex cognitive skills required to improvise and be responsive to students needs while simultaneously keeping in mind the goals and plans of the lesson (Borko &amp; Livingston, 1989). The informal assessment strategies teachers most often use during instruction are observation and questioning. 

====Observation====
Effective teachers observe their students from the time they enter the classroom. Some teachers greet their students at the door not only to welcome them but also to observe their mood and motivation. Are Hannah and Naomi still not talking to each other? Does Ethan have his materials with him? Gaining information on such questions can help the teacher foster student learning more effectively (e.g. suggesting Ethan goes back to his locker to get his materials before the bell rings or avoiding assigning Hannah and Naomi to the same group).  

During instruction, teachers observe students’ behavior to gain information about students’ level of interest and understanding of the material or activity. Observation includes looking at non-verbal behaviors as well as listening to what the students are saying. For example, a teacher may observe that a number of students are looking out of the window rather than watching the science demonstration, or hear students making comments in their group indicating they do not understand what they are supposed to be doing. Observations also help teachers decide which student to call on next, whether to speed up or slow down the pace of the lesson, when more examples are needed, whether to begin or end an activity, how well students are performing a physical activity, and if there are potential behavior problems. Many teachers find that moving around the classroom helps them observe more effectively because they can see more students from a variety of perspectives. However, the fast pace and complexity of most classrooms makes it difficult for teachers to gain as much information as they want.  

====Questioning====
Teachers ask questions for many instructional reasons including keeping students’ attention on the lesson, highlighting important points and ideas, promoting critical thinking, allowing students’ to learn from each others answers, and providing information about students’ learning. Devising good appropriate questions and using students’ responses to make effective instantaneous instructional decisions is very difficult. Some strategies to improve questioning include planning and writing down the instructional questions that will be asked, allowing sufficient wait time for students to respond, listening carefully to what students say rather than listening for what is expected, varying the types of questions asked, making sure some of the questions are higher level, and asking follow-up questions. 

While the informal assessment based on spontaneous observation and questioning is essential for teaching, there are inherent problems with the validity, reliability and bias in this information. The problems are summarized in [[Table 10-2.]] 

====Record Keeping====
Keeping records of observations improves reliability and can be used to enhance understanding of one student, a group, or the whole class interactions. Sometimes this requires help from other teachers. For example, Alexis, a beginning science teacher is aware of the research documenting that longer wait time enhances students’ learning (e.g., Rowe, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, M. B. (2003). Wait-time and rewards as instructional variables, their influence on language, logic and fate control: Part one-wait time. ''Journal of Research in Science Teaching, #40 Supplement,'' S19-32.&lt;/ref&gt;, but is unsure of her behaviors so she asks a colleague to observe and record her wait times  during one class period. Alexis learns her wait times are very short for all students so she starts practicing silently counting to five whenever she asks students a question. 

Teachers can keep ''anecdotal records'' about students without help from peers. These records contain descriptions of incidents of a student’s behavior, the time and place the incident takes place, and a tentative interpretation of the incident. For example, the description of the incident might involve Joseph, a 2nd grade student, who fell asleep during the mathematics class on a Monday morning. A tentative interpretation could be the student did not get enough sleep over the weekend, but alternative explanations could be the student is sick or is on medications that make him drowsy. Obviously additional information is needed and the teacher could ask Joseph why he is so sleepy and also observe him to see if he looks tired and sleepy over the next couple of weeks.

Anecdotal records often provide important information--better than informal memories--but they take time to maintain, and are difficult to keep objective. For example, after seeing Joseph fall asleep the teacher may now look for any signs of Joseph’s sleepiness – ignoring the days he is not sleepy. Also, it is hard for teachers to sample a wide enough range of data for their observations to be highly reliable. 

Teachers also conduct more formal observations especially for students with special needs who have IEP’s. An example of the importance of informal and formal observations in a preschool follows: 

:''The class of the preschool in a suburban neighborhood of a large city has eight special needs students and four students - the peer models - who have been selected because of their well developed language and social skills. Some of the special needs students have been diagnosed with delayed language, some with behavior disorders, and several with autism.  The students are sitting on the mat with the teacher who has a box with sets of three “cool” things of varying size (e.g. toy pandas) and the students are asked to put the things in order by size, big, medium and small. Students who are able are also requested to point to each item in turn and say “This is the big one,” This is the medium one,” and, “This is the little one.” For some students, only two choices (big and little) are offered because that is appropriate for their developmental level. The teacher informally observes that one of the boys is having trouble keeping his legs still so she quietly asks the aid for a weighted pad that she places on the boy’s legs to help him keep them still.  The activity continues and the aide carefully observes students behaviors and records on IEP progress cards whether a child meets specific objectives such as, “When given two picture or object choices, Mark will point to the appropriate object in 80% of the opportunities.”  The teacher and aides keep records of the relevant behavior of the special needs students during the half day they are in preschool.  The daily records are summarized weekly and if not enough observations have been recorded for a specific objective the teacher and aide focus their observations more on that child, and if necessary, try to create specific situations that relate to that objective. At end of each month the teacher calculates whether the special needs children are meeting their IEP objectives.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Teachers commonly assess students using questions and items that are multiple choice, matching, and true/false. In '''selected response items''', students choose a response provided by the teacher or test developer, rather than construct one in their own words or by their own actions. Selected response items do not require that students recall information, but only that they recognize the correct answer. Tests with these items are called objective because the results are not influenced by scorers’ judgments or interpretations and so are often machine scored. Eliminating potential errors in scoring increases the reliability of tests but teachers who only use objective tests are liable to reduce the validity of their assessment because objective tests are not appropriate for all learning goals. Effective assessment for learning as well as assessment of learning must be based on aligning the assessment technique to the learning goals and outcomes.  For example, if the goal is for students to conduct an experiment then they should be asked  to do that rather that than being asked about conducting an experiment.    

====Common Problems====
Selected response items are easy to score, but hard to devise. As a result, teachers often do not spend enough time constructing items. Common problems include these:

1. ''Unclear wording in the items''
:* Example: &quot;True or False: Although George Washington was born into a wealthy family, his father died when he was only 11, he worked as a youth as a surveyor of rural lands, and later stood on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York when he took his oath of office in 1789).&quot;
2. ''Cues that are not related the content being examined.''
:* A common clue is that all the true statements on a true/false test or the corrective alternatives on a multiple choice test are longer than the untrue statements or the incorrect alternatives. 
3. ''Using negatives (or double negatives) the items.''
:* Example: “True or False: None of the steps made by the student was unnecessary.” 
:* A better item:  &quot;True or False:  All of the steps were necessary” Students often do not notice the negative terms or find them confusing so avoiding them is generally recommended. However, since standardized tests often use negative items, teachers sometimes deliberately include some negative items to give students practice in responding to that format.
4. ''Taking sentences directly from textbook or lecture notes.''
:* Removing the words from their context often makes them ambiguous or can change the meaning. For example, a statement from [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 3: Student Development|Chapter 3]], taken out of context, suggests ''all'' children are clumsy “Similarly with jumping, throwing and catching: the large majority of children can do these things, though often a bit clumsily.” The fuller quotation makes it clearer that this sentence refers to 5 year olds:  &quot;For some fives, running still looks a bit like a hurried walk, but usually it becomes more coordinated within a year or two. Similarly with jumping, throwing and catching: the large majority of children can do these things, though often a bit clumsily, by the time they start school, and most improve their skills noticeably during the early elementary years” If the abbreviated form was used as the stem in a true/false item, it would be misleading.

5. ''Avoid Trivial Questions''
:* Example: &quot;Jean Piaget was born in what year?&quot;
::a)	1896
::b)	1900
::c)	1880
::d)	1903
: While it important to know approximately when Piaget made his seminal contributions to the understanding of child development, the exact year of his birth (1880) is ''not'' important.

====Strengths and Weaknesses of Selected Response Items====
All types of selected response items have a number of strengths and weaknesses. '''True/false items''' are appropriate for measuring factual knowledge such as vocabulary, formulae, dates, proper names, and technical terms. They are very efficient as they use a simple structure that students can easily understand, and take little time to complete. They are also easier to construct than multiple choice and matching items. However, students have a 50% probability of getting the answer correct through guessing so it can be difficult to interpret how much students know from their test scores. Examples of common problems that arise when devising true/false items are in [[Table 10-3]].
	
In '''matching items,''' two parallel columns containing terms, phrases, symbols, or numbers are presented and the student is asked to match the items in the first column with those in the second column. Typically there are more items in the second column to make the task more difficult and to ensure that if a student makes one error they do not have to make another. Matching items most often are used to measure lower level knowledge such as persons and their achievements, dates and historical events, terms and definitions, symbols and concepts, plants or animals and classifications. An example with Spanish language words and their English equivalents is below: 

:''Directions: On the line to the left of the Spanish word in Column A write the letter of the English word in Column B that has the same meaning.''

	Column A          Column B 

	___  	1.	Casa          A.	Aunt

	___	2.	Bebé          B.	Baby

	___	3.	Gata          C.	Brother

	___	4.	Perro         D.	Cat 

	___	5.	Hermano       E. 	Dog

                                      F.  	Father

                                      G.  	House 

While matching items may seem easy to devise, it is actually hard to create homogenous lists--lists in which all items are truly comparable.  Other problems with matching items and suggested remedies are in [[Table 10-3.]] 
'''Multiple-choice items''' are the most commonly used type of objective test items because they have a number of advantages over other objective test items. Most importantly, they can be adapted to assess &quot;higher&quot; levels of thinking such as application, and not simply to &quot;lower&quot; levels such as factual knowledge. The first example below assesses knowledge of a specific fact, whereas the second example assesses application of knowledge.

:''Who is best known for their work on the development of the morality of justice?''
::a)	Erikson
::b)	Vygotsky
::c)	Maslow
::d)	Kohlberg

:''Which one of the following best illustrates the law of diminishing returns?''
::a)	A factory doubled its labor force and increased production by 50%
::b)	The demand for an electronic product increased faster than the supply of the product
::c)	The population of a country increased faster than agricultural self sufficiency
::d)	A machine decreased in efficacy as its parts became worn out 

There are several other advantages of multiple choice items.
* Students have to recognize the correct answer not just know the incorrect answer as they do in true/false items.
* The opportunity for guessing is reduced because four or five alternatives are usually provided whereas in true/false items students only have to choose between two choices.
* Multiple choice items do not need homogeneous material as matching items do.

But creating good multiple choice test items is difficult and students (maybe including you) often become frustrated when taking a test with poor multiple choice items. Three steps have to be considered when constructing a multiple choice item: formulating a clearly stated problem, identifying plausible alternatives, and removing irrelevant clues to the answer. Common challenged faced in each of these steps are summarized in [[Table 10-3.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Formal assessments sometimes also include '''constructed response items,''' in which students are asked to recall information and create an answer, not just recognize if the answer is correct. Constructed response items can be used to assess a wide variety of kinds of knowledge, but here we discuss just two major kinds: completion (or ''short answer'' or ''short response'') and extended response.
===Completion and Short Answer===
Completion and short answer items ones that can be answered in a word, phrase, number, or symbol. These items essentially vary only in whether a problem is presented as a statement or a question. For example:  
:*''Completion: The first traffic light in the US was invented by…………….''
:*''Short Answer: Who invented the first traffic light in the U.S.?''
Completion or short answer items are often used in mathematics tests. For example:
:''3 + 10 = …………..?''
:''If  x = 6, what does  x(x-1) =……….''
:''Draw the line of symmetry on the following shape...''

A major advantage of such items is they that they are easy to construct. However, apart from their use in mathematics they are unsuitable for measuring complex learning outcomes and are often difficult to score. Completion and short answer tests are sometimes called ''objective,'' because they are intended to have only one correct answer and thereby reduce variability in scoring. Unless the question is phrased very carefully, however, there is often a variety of correct answers.  For example, consider this item:
:*''Where was President Lincoln born?....................''

The teacher may expect the answer “In a log cabin,” but other correct answers are also “on Sinking Spring Farm,” “in Hardin County” or in “Kentucky.”  Common errors in these items are summarized in [[Table 10 – 4]].

===Extended Response===
'''Extended response items''' are used in many content areas and answers may vary in length from a paragraph to several pages. Questions that require longer responses are often called ''essay questions.'' Extended response items have several advantages, the most important of which is their adaptability for measuring complex learning outcomes. Because the items also require students to write, they also therefore give teachers a way to assess writing skills. A commonly cited advantage to these items is their ease in construction; however, carefully worded items that are related to learning outcomes and assess complex learning are hard to devise.  Well-constructed items phrase the question so the task of the student is clear. Often this involves providing hints or planning notes. In the first example below the actual question is clear not only because of the wording but because of the format (i.e., it is placed in a box).  In the second and third examples planning notes are provided: 

:'''''Example 1:'''  Grade 3 Mathematics&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Standards Achievement Test ,2006; http://www.isbe.state.il.us/assessment/isat.htm)
&lt;/ref&gt;
: The owner of a bookstore gave 14 books to the school.  The principal will give an equal number of books to each of three classrooms and the remaining books to the school library. How many books are left?''

:''Show all your work on the space below and on the next page. Explain in words how you found the answer. Tell why you took the steps you did to solve the problem.''



:'''''Example 2:'''   5th grade science: The Grass is Always Greener''&lt;ref&gt;Washington State 2004 assessment of student learning  http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/WASL/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Jose and Maria noticed three different types of soil, black soil, sand, and clay, were found in their neighborhood. They decided to investigate the question, “How does the type of soil (black soil, sand, and clay) under grass sod affect the height of grass?”''

:''Plan an investigation that could answer their new question. In your plan, be sure to include:''
::*''Prediction of the outcome of the investigation''
::*''Materials needed to do the investigation''
::*''Procedure that includes:''
:::*''logical steps to do the investigation''
:::*''one variable kept the same (controlled)''
:::*''one variable changed (manipulated)''
:::*''any variables being measure and recorded''
:::*''how often measurements are taken and recorded''

:'''''Example 3:'''  Grades 9-11 English: Writing Prompt''&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Measure of Annual Growth in English http://www.isbe.state.il.us/assessment/image.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Some people think that schools should teach students how to cook. Other people think that cooking is something that ought to be taught in the home. What do you think? Explain why you think as you do.''
::''Planning notes: Chose One:''
:::*''I think schools should teach students how to cook''
:::*''I think cooking should l be taught in the home''
:::*''I think cooking should be taught in ……………………………..because………''

A major disadvantage of extended response items is the difficulty in reliable scoring. Not only do various teachers score the same response differently but also the same teacher may score the identical response differently on various occasions. A variety of steps can be taken to improve the reliability and validity of scoring:
# Teachers should begin by writing an outline of a model answer. This helps make it clear what students are expected to include.
# A sample of the answers should be read. This assists in determining what the students can do and if there are any common misconceptions arising from the question.
# Teachers have to decide what to do about irrelevant information that is included (e.g., is it ignored or are students penalized) and how to evaluate mechanical errors such as grammar and spelling.
# A point scoring or a scoring rubric should be used. In point scoring components of the answer are assigned points. For example, if students were asked:

:''What are the nature, symptoms, and risk factors of hyperthermia?''
::''Point Scoring Guide:''
::''Definition (natures) 			2 pts''
::''Symptoms (1 pt for each) 		5 pts''
::''Risk Factors (1 point for each)	5 pts''
::''Writing 				3 pts''

This system provides some guidance for evaluation and helps consistency but point scoring systems often lead the teacher to focus on facts (e.g., naming risk factors) rather than higher level thinking that may undermine the validity of the assessment if the teachers’ purposes include higher level thinking. A better approach is to use a scoring rubric that describes the quality of the answer or performance at each level.  

===Scoring Rubrics===
Scoring rubrics can be holistic or analytical.  In '''holistic scoring rubrics''', general descriptions of performance are made and a single overall score is obtained.  An example from grade 2 Language Arts in Los Angeles Unified School District classifies responses into four levels: not proficient, partially proficient, proficient and advanced (see [[Table 10–5]]). 

'''Analytical rubrics''' provide descriptions of levels of student performance on a variety of characteristics. For example, six characteristics used for assessing writing developed by the NorthWest Regional Education Laboratory (NWREL) are&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwrel.org/assessment/toolkit98/traits/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Ideas and Content 
* Organization 
* Voice 
* Word Choice 
* Sentence Fluency 
* Conventions
Holistic rubrics have the advantages that they can be developed more quickly than analytical rubrics. They are also faster to use as there is only one dimension to examine. However, they do not provide students feedback about which aspects of the response are strong and which aspects need improvement. This means they are less useful for assessment for learning. An important use of rubrics is to use them as teaching tools and provide them to students before the assessment so they know what knowledge and skills are expected. 

Teachers can use scoring rubrics as part of instruction by giving students the rubric during instruction, providing several responses, and analyzing these responses in terms of the rubric. For example, use of accurate terminology is one dimension of the science rubric in [[Table 10-6[[.  An elementary science teacher could discuss why it is important for scientists to use accurate terminology, give examples of inaccurate and accurate terminology, provide that component of the scoring rubric to students, distribute some examples of student responses (maybe from former students), and then discuss how these responses would be classified according to the rubric. This strategy of assessment for learning should be more effective if the teacher
# emphasizes to students why using accurate terminology is important when learning science rather than how to get a good grade on the test (we provide more details about this in the section on motivation later in this chapter);
# provides an exemplary response so students can see a model; and
# emphasizes that the goal is student improvement on this skill not ranking students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Performance Assessments===
In '''performance assessments,''' students complete a specific task while teachers observe the process or procedure (e.g., data collection in an experiment) as well as the product (e.g., completed report) (Popham, 2005; Stiggens, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2005). ''Classroom Assessment: What teachers need to know.''  Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiggins, R. J. (2002). Assessment crisis: The absence of assessment FOR learning. ''Phi Delta Kappan, 83''(10), 758-765.&lt;/ref&gt;. The tasks that students complete in performance assessments are not simple (in contrast to selected response items) and might include the following:
* Playing a musical instrument
* Athletic skills
* Artistic creation 
* Conversing in a foreign language
* Engaging in a debate about political issues 
* Conducting an experiment in science 
* Repairing a machine 
* Writing a term paper 
* Using interaction skills to play together
These examples all involve complex skills, but show that the term ''performance assessment'' is used in a variety of ways. For example, the teacher may not observe all of the process (e.g., she sees a draft paper but the final product is written during out-of-school hours); essay tests are therefore often considered examples of performance assessments (Airasian, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;
Airasian, P. W.  (2000). ''Classroom Assessment: A concise approach 2nd ed.''  Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, in some performance assessments there may be no clear product (e.g., the performance may be group interaction skills).
   
Two related terms, ''alternative assessment'' and ''authentic assessment'', are sometimes used instead of performance assessment, but they have different meanings&lt;ref&gt;Airasian, P. W.  (2004). ''Classroom Assessment: Concepts and Applications 3rd ed.''  Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;.  '''Alternative assessment''' refers to tasks that are not pencil-and-paper and while many performance assessments are not pencil-and paper tasks some are (e.g., writing a term paper, essay tests). '''Authentic assessment''' is used to describe tasks that students do that are similar to those in the “real word.” Classroom tasks vary in level of authenticity. For example, for a Japanese language class taught in a high school in Chicago conversing in Japanese in Tokyo is highly authentic – but only possible in a study abroad program or trip to Japan.  Conversing in Japanese with native Japanese speakers in Chicago is also highly authentic, and conversing with the teacher in Japanese during class is moderately authentic. Much less authentic is a matching test on English and Japanese words. In a language arts class, writing a letter (to an editor) or a memo to the principal is highly authentic as letters and memos are common work products. However, writing a five-paragraph paper is not as authentic as such papers are not used in the world of work. However, a five paragraph paper is a complex task and would typically be classified as a performance assessment. 

====Advantages and Disadvantages====
There are several advantages of performance assessments.
#The focus is on complex learning outcomes that often cannot be measured by other methods.
#Performance assessments typically assess process or procedure as well as the product. For example, the teacher can observe if the students are repairing the machine using the appropriate tools and procedures as well as whether the machine functions properly after the repairs.
#Well-designed performance assessments communicate the instructional goals and meaningful learning clearly to students.  For example, if the topic in a 5th grade art class is one-point perspective the performance assessment could be drawing a city scene that illustrates one point perspective&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanford-artedventures.com&lt;/ref&gt;. This assessment is meaningful and clearly communicates the learning goal. This performance assessment is a good instructional activity and has good content validity - common with well designed performance assessments.

One major disadvantage with performance assessments is that are typically very time consuming for students and teachers. This means that fewer assessments can be gathered so if they are not carefully devised fewer learning goals will be assessed – which can reduce content validity. State curriculum guidelines can be helpful in determining what should be included in a performance assessment. For example, Eric, a dance teacher in a high school in Tennessee learns that the state standards indicate that dance students at the highest level should be able to do demonstrate consistency and clarity in performing technical skills by&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tennessee.gov/education/ci/standards/music/dance912.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;:

# performing complex movement combinations to music in a variety of meters and styles.
# performing combinations and variations in a broad dynamic range.
#demonstrating improvement in performing movement combinations through self-evaluation
#critiquing a live or taped dance production based on given criteria.

Eric devises the following performance task for his 11th grade modern dance class. In groups of 4-6, students will perform a dance at least 5 minutes in length. The dance selected should be multifaceted so that all the dancers can demonstrate technical skills, complex movements, and a dynamic range (Items 1-2). Students will videotape their rehearsals and document how they improved through self evaluation (Item3). Each group will view and critique the final performance of one other group in class (Item 4).  Eric would need to scaffold most steps in this performance assessment. The groups probably would need guidance in selecting a dance that allowed all the dancers to demonstrate the appropriate skills; critiquing their own performances constructively; working effectively as a team, and applying criteria to evaluate a dance.  

Another disadvantage of performance assessments is they are hard to assess reliably, which can lead to inaccuracy and unfair evaluation. As with any constructed response assessment, scoring rubrics are very important. An example of holistic and analytic scoring rubrics designed to assess a completed product are in [[Tables 10-5]] and [[Table 10-6]].  A rubric designed to assess the process of group interactions is in [[Table 10-7]]. This rubric was devised for middle grade science but could be used in other subject areas when assessing group process. In some performance assessments several scoring rubrics should be used. In the dance performance example above Eric should have scoring rubrics for the performance skills, the improvement based on self evaluation, the team work, and the critique of the other group. Since devising a good performance assessment is obviously complex, it may help if you: 
* Create performance assessments that require students to use complex cognitive skills. Sometimes teachers devise assessments that are interesting and that the students enjoy but do not require students to use higher level cognitive skills that lead to significant learning. Focusing on high level skills and learning outcomes is particularly important because performance assessments are typically so time consuming.
* Ensure that the task is clear to the students. Performance assessments typically require multiple steps so students need to have the necessary prerequisite skills and knowledge as well as clear directions. Careful scaffolding is important for successful performance assessments. 
* Specify expectations of the performance clearly by providing students scoring rubrics during the instruction. This not only helps students understand what it expected but it also guarantees that teachers are clear about what they expect. Thinking this through while planning the performance assessment can be difficult for teachers but is crucial as it typically leads to revisions of the actual assessment and directions provided to students. 
* Reduce the importance of unessential skills in completing the task. What skills are essential depends on the purpose of the task. For example, for a science report, is the use of publishing software essential? If the purpose of the assessment is for students to demonstrate the process of the scientific method including writing a report, then the format of the report may not be significant. However, if the purpose includes integrating two subject areas, science and technology, then the use of publishing software is important. Because performance assessments take time it is tempting to include multiple skills without carefully considering if all the skills are essential to the learning goals. 

==Portfolios==
“A portfolio is a meaningful collection of student work that tells the story of student achievement or growth” (Arter, Spandel, &amp; Culham, 1995, p. 2)&lt;ref&gt;Arter, J., Spandel, V., &amp; Culham, R. Portfolios for assessment and instruction. ''ERIC Digest #388890&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;.  Portfolios are a purposeful collection of student work not just folders of all the work a student does. Portfolios are used for a variety of purposes and developing a portfolio system can be confusing and stressful unless the teachers are clear on their purpose.

When the primary purpose is assessment '''for''' learning, the emphasis is on student self-reflection and responsibility for learning. Students not only select samples of their work they wish to include, but also reflect and interpret their own work. Portfolios containing this information can be used to aid communication as students can present and explain their work to their teachers and parents. Portfolios focusing on assessment '''of''' learning contain students’ work samples that certify accomplishments for a classroom grade, graduation, state requirements etc. Typically, students have less choice in the work contained in such portfolios as some consistency is needed for this type of assessment. For example, the writing portfolios that 4th and 7th graders are required to submit in Kentucky must contain a self reflective statement and an example of three pieces of writing (reflective, personal experience or literary, and transactive).  Students do choose which of their pieces of writing in each type to include into the portfolio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kde.state.ky.us/KDE/Instructional+Resources/Curriculum+Documents+and+Resources/Student+Performance+Standards/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Portfolios can be designed to focus on '''student progress''' or current accomplishments. For example, audiotapes of English language learners speaking could be collected over one year to demonstrate growth in learning. Student progress portfolios may also contain multiple versions of a single piece of work. For example, a writing project may contain notes on the original idea, outline, first draft, comments on the first draft by peers or teacher, second draft, and the final finished product. If the focus is on current accomplishments, only recent completed work samples are included.
  
Portfolios can focus on documenting student activities or '''highlighting important accomplishments.''' ''Documentation'' portfolios are inclusive, containing all the work samples rather than focusing on one special strength, best work, or progress. In contrast, ''showcase portfolios'' focus on best work. The best work is typically identified by students as one aim of such portfolios is that students learn how to identify products that demonstrate what they know and can do. Students are not expected to identify their best work in isolation but also use the feedback from their teachers and peers.
 
A final distinction can be made between a ''finished'' portfolio -such as used to for a job application - versus a ''working'' portfolio that typically includes day-to-day work samples. '''Working portfolios''' evolve over time and are not intended to be used for assessment of learning. The focus in a working portfolio is on developing ideas and skills so students should be allowed to make mistakes, freely comment on their own work, and respond to teacher feedback.  '''Finished portfolios''' are designed for use with a particular audience and the products selected may be drawn from a working portfolio. For example, in a teacher education program, the working portfolio may contain work samples from all the courses taken. A student may develop one finished portfolio to demonstrate she has mastered the required competencies in the teacher education program, and a second finished portfolio for her job application.
 
====Advantages and Disadvantages====
Portfolios used well in classrooms have several advantages. They provide a way of documenting and evaluating growth in a much more nuanced way than selected response tests can. Also, portfolios can be integrated easily into instruction, i.e. used for assessment for learning. Portfolios also encourage student self-evaluation and reflection, as well as ownership for learning. Using classroom assessment to promote student motivation is an important component of assessment for learning which is considered in the next section.

But there are some major disadvantages of portfolio use. Good portfolio assessment takes an enormous amount of teacher time and organization. The time is needed to help students understand the purpose and structure of the portfolio, decide which work samples to collect, and to self reflect. Some of this time needs to be conducted in one-to-one conferences. Reviewing and evaluating the portfolios out of class time is also enormously time consuming.  Teachers have to weigh if the time spend is worth the benefits of the portfolio use.
# Evaluating portfolios reliability and eliminating bias can be even more difficult than in a constructed response assessment because the products are more varied. The experience of the state-wide use of portfolios for assessment in writing and mathematics for 4th and 8th graders in Vermont is sobering. Teachers used the same analytic scoring rubric when evaluating the portfolio. In the first two years of implementation samples from schools were collected and scored by an external panel of teachers. In the first year the agreement among raters (i.e., inter-rater reliability) was poor for mathematics and reading; in the second year the agreement among raters improved for mathematics but not for reading. However, even with the improvement in mathematics the reliability was too low to use the portfolios for individual student accountability (Koretz, Stecher, Klein &amp; McCaffrey, 1994). When reliability is low, validity is also compromised because unstable results cannot be interpreted meaningfully. 

If teachers do use portfolios in their classroom, the series of steps needed for implementation are outlined in [[Table 10- 8]].  If the school or district has an existing portfolio system these steps may have to be modified.

== Who Wrote this Book? ==

This book, like all books on Wikibooks, has been written by ordinary users, just like you. Any person who visits Wikibooks can edit almost any page at any time. Some of the users are experienced Wikibooks veterans. Some are just passersby, fixing small grammar or spelling errors as they read. You can help to write this book, and you can choose how much you want to help and in what way. You can fix errors that you see, or you can add entire lessons that you've learned from your own experience here, or you can start and write whole books. If you have questions about using Wikibooks, [[Wikibooks:Reading Room|ask]]! When you've learned the answers, you can write them down in this book for future users and readers.

=== Feedback ===

One of the best tools in the writing process here on Wikibooks is feedback from readers. If you are a new user and have learned from this book, we would be happy to hear about it. Also, if you find certain portions confusing, or even know of certain information that is missing, we would like to hear about that too. One of the best places to provide feedback about this book is at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|assistance reading room]]. When leaving a question or comment, include a link to the book page in question, and discuss what you liked, what you didn't like, and what you think can be improved.

== How Is this Book Set up? ==

This book is arranged by job. Wikibookians tend to assume different roles when they visit Wikibooks. The vast majority of our visitors are readers, who want to learn for free. Some Wikibookians help fix problems, like spelling and grammar or formatting errors. We call this second group &quot;Editors&quot;. Other Wikibookians actually create new books and generate new content. These people, are called &quot;Writers&quot; or &quot;Authors&quot;. Other Wikibookians keep watch over the website, performing cleanup and organizational tasks and taking on responsibilities that other users don't. This last group is known as  the Wikibooks &quot;Administrators&quot;. 

People who come to Wikibooks don't always fall into just one category but can be a combination of some or all of the above groups. Some people perform tasks that are entirely different from all those listed above. Most tasks at Wikibooks can be very similar to the four listed above though, so this book will divide the material into those four groups. Just remember that even though this book breaks up our users into four primary roles, this is just a simplification and not a reality. You should feel free to perform any helpful tasks (and there are a lot to choose from!) at Wikibooks.

The first section provides an introduction to Wikibooks, and an overview of what this project is and how it works. The second section is devoted to quick-start guides for various audiences.

=== A Note on Form ===

This book uses a pretty simple organizational format that other books can feel free to copy. The decisions that the authors of this book have made are not the only way or even the best way to do things, however. It's good to follow existing examples when creating your own books, but keep in mind that there is no single &quot;right way&quot; to do things, and different books may have very different needs.

This book is specifically intended to be printable, so is held to a particular standard that other books on Wikibooks do not need to follow. The internet makes available a number of technologies such as interactivity and multimedia that cannot be translated easily into a printed medium. Even though this book is focused on being printable, other books on Wikibooks are not limited by that restriction and can make use of various technologies to improve their educational benefits.

Beyond being a good example, this book aims to be a good resource for readers who are new to Wikibooks or merely curious about it. If you have feedback about this book, or would like to make changes and improvements, remember that this is a wiki and anybody is free to edit it at any time. This may seem like an unbelievable concept, but throughout the following chapters we are going to talk about how the editing process works and how easy it really is to get involved.

== What is Wikibooks? ==
Wikibooks is a collaborative book authoring website, where users from all over the world work together to write textbooks and other types of instructional books on many topics. It is a Wikimedia project, operated by the same group of people who run Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation. You can edit this page, and almost all pages like it, at any time. That is the basic principle of Wikibooks. Anyone can edit it.

=== History ===
The Wikibooks project was started in 2003, and has since become one of the largest free e-book websites in the world. More information about Wikibooks can be located in the information page [[Wikibooks:Welcome]]. In the early history of the project there were many high and low points, but more recently things have begun to even out. Wikibooks has a large volume of books on a variety of different subjects, and a vibrant community of volunteers to write and maintain them all. 

=== Collaborative Community ===
Wikibooks is a completely volunteer online collaborative community. Many members of Wikibooks are anonymous in that they have not provided much, if any, information about themselves. Wikibooks does not have a government nor any form of centralized decision-making body. Instead, all decisions are decided by the community via ''discussion, compromise, and consensus''. All changes are implemented by our hardworking volunteers. Let's reiterate: anybody can edit nearly any page at any time, often anonymously, and there is no central governing body to keep everything running smoothly. How, it can be wondered, does the project function at all? How do we keep everything running smoothly, much less make progress?

The secret is the dedicated volunteer community, a community that we are going to discuss in great detail in the section '''The Wikibooks Community'''.

== What is Wikimedia? ==
The Wikimedia Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation that oversees the operations of Wikibooks, Wikipedia, and a variety of other projects. Some of these projects are:

*[[v:|Wikiversity]]
*[[s:|Wikisource]]
*[[n:|Wikinews]]
*[[q:|Wikiquote]]
*[[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]

== What is Wiki? ==
The word &quot;Wiki&quot; is derived from the Hawaiian word &quot;WikiWiki&quot;, which means &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;. A wiki is a program that lets users generate content quickly. On almost every page in a wiki, there will be an edit button. Clicking on the edit button allows any user anywhere in the world to modify the contents of the page, and add new content. Some wiki websites restrict who can edit pages, but Wikibooks does not.

== Wikitext ==
Pages in Wikibooks are written in a special format called &quot;Wikitext&quot;.  Wikitext is very similar in many respects to HTML, and several pages are written using a combination of Wikitext, HTML, and CSS. 

The benefit to Wikitext is that it's very simple and quick to write.  A large amount of formatting can be accomplished with a very small amount of effort.  Also, the Wikitext helps to keep features on Wikibooks, such as page section titles and other formatting, standardized.  The section [[Using Wikibooks|The Wikibooks Editor]] will focus on using Wikitext.

== Inclusion Criteria ==
Wikibooks has specific criteria for the inclusion of new materials. The name &quot;Wiki'''books'''&quot; is a bit of a misnomer in the sense that this project does not allow all books to be hosted. On the contrary, only the small subset of instructional non-fiction books are allowed to be hosted here. Traditionally the term used was &quot;textbook&quot;, although blurring of the definition led to the current standing that wikibooks allows &quot;Textbooks, manuals, and other instructional texts&quot;. The final interpretation of whether or not a particular book belongs on Wikibooks is left up to the community.

It is worth noting that Wikibooks overlaps considerably with the [[v:|Wikiversity]] sister project. Materials that are outside the scope of Wikibooks may very well be suitable at Wikiversity. 

Wikibooks also puts a premium on creating material, not just hosting material. While we do allow materials to be donated by authors, we always insist that the material must be editable. Also, '''historical works''' that are no longer under copyright should '''not''' be posted to Wikibooks, but instead should go to [[s:|Wikisource]].

== Who Makes Decisions? ==

If anybody can edit any page, who decides what goes where? Who keeps things in order? Who prevents this whole website from descending into total chaos?

The simple answer to all these questions is ''you''. You, as an editor can help to keep things in operational order, so that everybody can share and enjoy Wikibooks. 

The long answer is that people who edit Wikibooks form a type of community, a social group of people who want the project to grow and improve. It is through collaboration with the community that we develop a series of policies and guidelines that all Wikibookians agree to follow, in order to keep the process running smoothly. With a username, you can join this community too, and help to keep everything in proper working order.

== How are Decisions Made? ==

Wikibooks doesn't operate in a way that is similar to regular governments or groups with set leadership patterns. Simply put, Wikibooks doesn't have any official leaders, although there are always members who do take on informal leadership roles. Often, the best way to lead others into doing something is to do it yourself and set a good example.

Complicated decisions on Wikibooks are made by the community as a whole through a method called &quot;consensus&quot;. Consensus is when the community discusses a situation, finds compromise, and comes to a general agreement on a proper course of action. Notice that this isn't the same as majority voting. Wikibooks is not a democracy, and we rarely vote. Even on occasions when we do cast votes, they are informal votes, used as a general way to measure consensus. A 51% majority never wins a discussion; you need to find compromise and get everybody, or almost everybody, to come to an agreement.

Why do we say &quot;almost everybody&quot;? Sometimes, people get angry and can just be unreasonable. If you can't be mature and work towards compromise, other people just won't listen to what you have to say. Other times — and this is something we especially appreciate and encourage — people who are in the minority tend to &quot;stand aside&quot;. This means that a person will say &quot;This is not what I want, but I will not stop the community from moving forward&quot;. Being respectful in this way never goes unnoticed, and it's precisely the users who take this option when necessary who are the most appreciated. After all, we may not always agree, but by being respectful and courteous, we can always improve and make forward progress.

== The Reading Room ==

The central point for discussion and participation at Wikibooks is the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]], a collection of discussion rooms where people are free to ask questions, and discuss various topics.

=== History ===

The '''Staff lounge''' was a page nearly as old as the Wikibooks project itself. Created in 2003, it was a single discussion page where all topics were discussed. The single-page structure of the staff lounge was unwieldy, and the page often became very large, a point that was brought up frequently.

The [[WB:AN|Administrator's Noticeboard]] was created in October 2006 as a separate discussion and notification area specific to Wikibooks Administrators. [[Special:Import]] had recently been enabled, and the Noticeboard was designed to be a centralized location where people could ask for help from admins. 

In February 2007, the Staff lounge was broken into various sub-discussion rooms, including [[WB:RR/G|General Chat]], [[WB:PROJECT|Project Chat]], and [[WB:TECH|Technical Chat]]. A room specifically for new users and new book projects, the [[WB:HELP|New Books and Users Chat]] was created in June 2007.

In October 2007, the Staff lounge was renamed the '''Reading Room'''. The Administrator's Noticeboard and the Bulletin Board were merged into the new discussion area in an effort to make finding and participating in discussions easier.

== Discussion Rooms ==

There are several discussion rooms in the Reading Room, each with a particular theme. Often the line between them is a little blurry, so there are few hard rules about what kinds of topics can be in which rooms. 

;[[WB:Reading room/General|General]]: A discussion area for all discussions that relate to Wikibooks, but which do not necessarily fit into any of the other discussion rooms. When in doubt, post your messages/questions/comments to this room.  A place where new users can introduce themselves.
;[[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]]: Not a true discussion area, the bulletin board is a place where you can post announcements about important events.
;[[WB:Reading room/Projects|Projects]]: A page to discuss and collaborate on various projects, such as books, organization, cleanup, and maintenance.
;[[WB:Reading room/Proposals|Proposals]]: A place to suggest improvements to Wikibooks, to its policies, methods, or any other area.
;[[WB:Reading room/Assistance|General Assistance]]:A place where Wikibookians can help each other solve problems encountered while contributing to books or otherwise taking part in the Wikibooks community. 
;[[WB:Reading room/Technical Assistance|Technical Assitance]]: A place to get assistance on technical issues, such as wikitext, javascript, mediawiki, as they relate to Wikibooks. A good place to request help from people who are proficient wikitext editors or computer programmers.
;[[WB:AA|Administrative Assistance]]: The place to report vandalism, request help from admins, or report problems. Most admins keep this page on their watchlists, and if you ask for help here you will usually get it quickly.

== Posting a New Message ==

All the Reading Room discussion areas have a link at the top that says &quot;Post a Comment&quot;. Clicking on this link will open an edit window where you can write a comment or question to post on the page. Make sure you:
#Give your post an appropriate title
#Sign your name with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Using Wikibooks/Page}}

== Finding Books ==

There are a number of methods for finding books on Wikibooks. We will discuss some of the methods here on this page.

== Search ==

The Wikibooks interface includes a search tool on the left-hand side of the page. Type in a subject that you want to search for and click {{key|name=Search}}. This will display a screen filled with books and book pages that contain that search term.

Another option, if you know the title of the book you want to find or think you know it, is to type in the title of the book and click {{key|name=Go}}. The go button will take you to the page if it exists, or else it will take you to the search page.

Some books exist for common topics, such as [[Algebra]], [[Biology]], or [[Rhetoric]]. Typing in a common subject name may very well take you to a book on that subject.

=== Subject Pages ===

Wikibooks has experimented with a number of organizational methods in the past, some of which turned out to be very unwieldy or difficult to use for a number of reasons. Instead of using an existing organizational method like a library would use, we use a custom system that's designed to work well with our wiki software. 

Wikibooks uses a series of &quot;Subject Pages&quot;, the start of which is [[Subject:Major Subjects]]. From that page, you can easily navigate to books based on subject, reading level, audience, and other metrics. Every subject page will contain a list of books in that subject, a list of sub-topics, and possibly a few other lists as well.

=== Google Search ===

== Card Catalog Office ==

Like ordinary libraries, Wikibooks has a [[WB:CCO|card catalog office]] (CCO) that we use to keep our books organized.  The CCO keeps books organized using a variety of methods, including by subject, by Dewey Decimal Classification, by Library of Congress classification, and alphabetically by book title. There is a link to the CCO in the &quot;'''navigation'''&quot; box (typically located on the left-hand side of the page). Click the link that says &quot;[[WB:CCO|browse]]&quot; to go to it.

Books on Wikibooks are broken down by [[WB:SUBJECT|subjects]]. There are 8 major subject areas: [[Subject:Computing|Computing]], [[Subject:Engineering|Engineering]], [[Subject:Humanities|Humanities]], [[Subject:Mathematics|Mathematics]], [[Subject:Miscellaneous|Miscellaneous]], [[Subject:Science|Science]], [[Subject:Social sciences|Social sciences]], and [[Subject:Standard curricula|Standard curricula]]. In addition, there is also a page for [[Subject:Help|Help books]]. Each major subject contains several subtopics. Each subject page displays a brief summary of the subject, a list of books related to the subject, a list of related subjects, a list of featured books, a link to a Wikipedia page on the topic, and other useful information as well. There are many different subject pages on Wikibooks, and more are created on a regular basis.

=== Subjects ===
[[Image:Wikibooks structure.svg|right|400px]]

The subject pages are an important navigational tool for finding books. The subject pages can be accessed from [[Subject:Major Subjects]]. From there, you can navigate through the subtopics to find books that you are interested in. Books are listed by the subject material, but they are also listed in other ways as well. Here are some ways that a book can be listed in the subject pages:

#By [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels|reading level]]
#By [[Wikibooks:Featured books|book status]] 
#Whether the book has a print version, a PDF version, or both.
#Books for particular audiences, such as [[Wikijunior]] books for children.

{{-}}

== Featured Books ==

Clicking the &quot;[[WB:FB|Featured Books]]&quot; link on the left side of the page in the &quot;navigation&quot; box will take you to the list of featured books on Wikibooks. Featured books aren't perfect, but they are some of the best that we have to offer, and are good examples of what a new book can be. 

If you find a book that you particularly like, and want to see it listed as a featured book, you can [[WB:FBN|nominate it]]. The Wikibooks community will discuss it, and if they agree in general, the book will be promoted to featured status.

== Taking it With You ==

Many book authors set their books up with a '''print version''', a '''PDF version''' or a '''collection'''. These are useful tools for saving an entire book to your hard drive, or for printing out a book for use offline. In this chapter we're going to talk about all these options and how they are used.

== Print Versions ==

A print version is a combination of all the book's pages, loaded into one webpage and specially formatted for printing. Print versions for large books might take a long time to load in your browser, especially if you are on a slow connection. Some print versions are so big that they've been broken up into several pages to prevent overloading the server or the browser.

Print versions, unlike PDF versions, will automatically update when one of the included pages is updated. This means that a print version will always display the most recent version of all the pages in the book. Print versions are designed to look good when printed, but might not look very good in your browser. To make sure you see what it's supposed to look like, use the &quot;Print preview&quot; option in your browser before printing.

If a book has a print version, there will usually be a notice on the main page of that book about it. If there is no notice, there probably isn't a print version available. If there is no print version and you would like there to be one, you can ask the authors to create it for you, or you can jump in and do it yourself. We will discuss how to make print versions in '''The Wikibooks Author''' ([[Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs]]).

== PDF Versions ==

Some book authors go the extra mile and produce a PDF version of their book. PDF versions can be saved to your hard drive, and can be opened in a PDF reader, such as Adobe Acrobat or OpenOffice.org. PDF files are a little more difficult to create, and they are not easy to update when changes are made on the wiki. The benefit is that they are easy to save, and tend to look very nice and consistent when reading on the computer or when printed.

Because PDF versions are difficult to create, a PDF version might not be up to date with the current text of the book on Wikibooks. For the most up to date version, you should check back on Wikibooks to see if there have been any changes.

== Collections ==

Wikibooks has a special software extension called the '''collections extension'''. With the collections extension, you can create groups of pages called &quot;collections&quot;. In most cases, the pages in a book are used to create these collections, although there is no rule about this: You can pick and mix pages from multiple books together in a collection, if you want.

On the left-hand side of your screen there is a box with links in it that says &quot;create a book&quot;. The links in this box can be used to create collections of pages, or to load a saved collection. We will discuss how to create and use collections in more detail in '''The Wikibooks Author'''.

Once you have created a collection, or loaded a premade one, you can go to [[Special:Collection]] to see various options. You can save your collection, you can download it in PDF or ODT format, or you can have it printed by our print-on-demand partner [http://www.pediapress.com PediaPress]. PediaPress will print and bind your collection into a book and mail it to you for a reasonable price. A portion of proceeds from these book sales goes to the WMF. Unfortunately, none of our authors get any royalties for these books, that helps to keep the cost down for students who need them cheap!

For more information about Collections, see the relevant chapters in '''The Wikibooks Author''' ([[Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs#Collections Extension]]), or visit [[Help:Collections]].

== Wikibooks in Class ==

Books on Wikibooks are textbooks, and are ultimately designed to provide a free quality alternative to traditional printed textbooks. This is a major benefit to schools and students that cannot afford traditional textbooks.

It should come as no surprise then that some teachers around the world print and use Wikibooks in the classroom. 

Books on Wikibooks are generally in a state of construction. Books are never &quot;complete&quot;, because they can always be updated, improved, expanded, reformatted. However some of our better books, such as our featured books, are good enough that they should be useable in a classroom.

=== Finding A Textbook On Wikibooks ===

Finding a free textbook to use for a class on Wikibooks is similar to the process of finding a book to use from a traditional book publisher. First suitable titles must be found from the catalog. Once found, books need to be read and evaluated to see if they are consistent with your class plans. Then, the book needs to be obtained for the students.

Finding books on Wikibooks is easy, and has been the subject of one of our previous chapters. Keeping in mind that many of our books are in active development, the first best place to look for a new book will be at our list of [[WB:FB|featured books]]. These are the books that the Wikibooks community thinks are the highest quality. These aren't the only books in a usable condition, of course, just the best of those.

Books in a higher state of maturity tend to have printable versions, PDF versions, or collections. Lists of books with these features will be visible at [[:Category:Books with print version]], [[:Category:Books with PDF version]], and [[:Category:Books with Public Collections]].

Conversely, visiting [[Subject:Major Subjects]] will allow you to navigate to your particular subject. Most subject pages will contain lists of books in that subject that are featured, or that have printable versions in one of our standard formats.

=== Evaluating A Wikibook ===

Wikibooks has a new software feature called &quot;Flagged Revisions&quot;, or &quot;flaggedrevs&quot; for short. The Flaggedrevs extension allows each page on the website to be evaluated in terms of its content, its accuracy, and its coverage. When looking at a book, see if the page has been rated previously, and if it has see what other reviewers think about it. Obviously the opinions of the teacher will be more important than those of random internet strangers, but reviews can give a good idea about what other people think about the pages, and what features other people think are important.

As you're evaluating the book, feel free to submit a few page reviews of your own, if you are able. We will discuss the reviewer permissions and processes in a later chapter. Also, feel free to post reviews, questions, or comments on the associated talk pages. This way any problems that you find can be addressed and resolved by other volunteer editors at a later time. Remember that books that aren't perfect for your application ''yet'' might very well become perfect for you in the future, if you're willing to write reviews, post suggestions, and maybe make a few edits yourself.

=== Printing and Distributing a Wikibook ===

Once you have a book selected for use in your class, you are going to need a way to distribute that book to your students. You could just give them the URL of the book, but that's a naive approach: The book could change on a daily basis, which could make your lesson plans difficult to follow. Plus, your students could be making changes that affect the quality of material that other students see. What you need to do is get a stable version of the book that you and your class can rely on. There are a few methods to do this:

#Permanent Links: On the left hand side of the screen, you may need to scroll down to see it, is a link that says &quot;Permanent link&quot;. Clicking this will take you to the current specific revision of the page. This revision is preserved in the website database and is never changed. If you go to this link, the page will always look exactly the same even if additional edits or changes are made. 
#PDF Versions: Some books have a pre-made PDF version that is uploaded to the server. These PDF files are not going to change once you download them, but they also won't reflect any additions or improvements that have been made to the book.
#Collections PDF: From a page collection, the software can automatically create a PDF or ODT file for download based on the most recent versions of the pages in the collection. This means that edits, additions, and improvements that you make will be reflected in the generated PDF file. With a collection loaded, go to [[Special:Collection]] and click the &quot;download&quot; button.
#Collections Print-on-Demand: PDF versions and permanent links are nice if your class has good access to a computer and the internet. However, sometimes it's better to just have a printed book that the students can bring with them into class without needing to bring their computer too. For these cases, Wikibooks has a print-on-demand feature through our publishing partner PediaPress. With a collection loaded, click &quot;Order this book&quot; at [[Special:Collection]] to order a copy (or 30) from PediaPress.

== Class and Group Projects ==

Traditionally, books are just static sources of information written in one particular way which may not be very helpful to all students in your class. Instead of teaching from a &quot;Dead&quot; or &quot;Static&quot; book, consider using Wikibooks as an interactive learning resource instead. Several groups and classes have successfully used Wikibooks to host interactive book-writing projects. These class projects are very common on Wikibooks, and our members do everything they can to encourage them. Students from one class can write books for students in future classes, so it's a powerful tool to spread knowledge.

=== Why use a Wikibooks-based Project? ===

Wikibooks makes a very attractive platform for class and group projects for a number of reasons:

#Not completely insulated: On Wikibooks, you're using the &quot;real&quot; internet, and have the possibility to interact with real people on it in constructive ways. We're relatively insulated from the bad parts of the internet because of our strict focus on educational goals. Learning how to work in very diverse groups, with people from other countries and cultures, is a very good thing in addition to your primary learning objectives.
#Helpful community: At wikibooks, we have a large number of volunteer editors who will be willing to help your project succeed. We can help fix problems, improve formatting, and make helpful suggestions along the way. With a little bit of input and feedback, you can create a higher-quality result than you might be able to otherwise.
#Integrated monitoring: MediaWiki, the software that runs Wikibooks, has a number of features for keeping track of people and their edits. On Wikibooks, you can view the complete contribution history of each student, and determine when they are making their edits, and what quality each individual edit has. You can see how students are communicating together on talk pages, and you can see how pages dynamically improve as a result of these interactions.
#Easy to use: The wikitext markup at Wikibooks is relatively small but powerful, and the vast majority of editing that you and your class will want to do will be simple to implement. Wikitext is much easier than standard HTML, but the two are mixable if more power of expression is needed.

=== Picking a Project ===

Picking a project for students to do is almost as difficult as doing the project itself. Many teachers underestimate how difficult it can be to write a complete book. It's quite a daunting task! Teachers may also underestimate the amount of time it takes for students to get acclimated on the site. It's important to pick a task that students will be able to complete, so that there is a real sense of accomplishment for them at the end. Here are some suggestions:

#Improve an existing book: Take a book that's in good condition, and incrementally improve it by adding examples, images, and notes.
#Adopt a forgotten book: Find a book that's been under-developed and try to breath new life into it. Evaluate the quality of existing materials, and write your own to fill in the blanks
#Create a new book: This is the hardest task to do. Pick a subject on which Wikibooks does not have an existing book and write one. Make sure to plan it out and try to follow some of our best practices. If you need help or input, our team of volunteers is always ready to help.

=== Running a Project ===

The way you manage a project can significantly affect its success. Here are a few methods to consider:

;Every student writes a chapter:  In this situation, you will find that groups are not working until the class reaches their subject. Groups at the end of the book will do less work than groups at the beginning.
;Everybody writes a chapter together:  In this way, you can have your whole class working on the most recently discussed material. However, with many hands working on a single page, you run the risk of edit conflicts. Also, some students may fall behind because they can't find enough unique work to do that other students aren't doing first.
;Everybody writes a feature: Each student writes an individual feature of a page, the whole class works on a single page together. A feature can be an example, or a section, or a table, etc. Every student/group has a specific task to complete, but tasks will be asymmetrical.
;Students write and review: Students are in charge of writing certain pages or certain features, but are also in charge of reviewing the work of other students. This helps to promote communication and increases overall quality of the produced book. Students spend more time reviewing and less time writing, which can reduce the volume of generated material in the end.

=== Suggestions ===

Here are some miscellaneous suggestions: 

#Make sure all groups follow the writing process: Make plans, draft the material, edit, and revise. Editing and revising can continue throughout the entire project, after initial drafting has been completed. 
#Don't hesitate to break process: it's a wiki, after all. If you've drafted, edited, and revised, feel free to draft another section, or help somebody else with editing and revising.
#Keep track of contributions. Keep track of individual student contributions. Students that edit early and often are more likely to produce higher-quality materials than those that try to dump large volumes of content in a single edit.
#Use edit summaries. Every edit should have a description. What did you edit? How much did you edit? Did you write new content that needs to be reviewed, or did you review existing content?

== Errors ==

You may be here to read, but you also have the power to help if you want to. Writers aren't perfect, and sometimes when a page is written it will contain small spelling and grammar errors. You can always alert other people about the error if you want to, but it's usually easier to fix it yourself. If you find yourself fixing errors frequently, perhaps you need to progress to the section '''The Wikibooks Editor''' to learn how to fix things more efficiently.

Wikis aren't static and unchangable like ordinary printed books are: They are interactive and dynamic. Anybody can change them at any time, even ''you''. This concept may be very new to many people, so this chapter will serve as a gradual introduction to it.

== Fixing Errors ==

To fix an error that you find, click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top of your screen, find the error, correct it, and click {{key|name=Save page}}. It's an easy process, but there are a lot of complicated things that you can do on a page that aren't all self-evident. We'll save discussion about most of the complicated features for The Wikibooks Editor. Here are some tips to getting started:

# Click the &quot;[edit]&quot; link next to a heading to edit only that section. The &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top allows you to edit the whole page at once. If the page is very large, finding a single mistake in the wikitext can be difficult. If you edit only one section, however, there is less to look through and individual words or sentences will be easier to find.
# Start small! You don't need to post a whole chapter or essay to be a valuable helper here, every single little fix counts. Fix one misspelled word, or one misplaced comma.
# Click the {{key|name=Show preview}} to view your changes before you save them, to make sure you are editing the right place.
# Ignore formatting. There are lots of symbols in wikitext that might be confusing: &lt;code&gt;{ = # * ; :&lt;/code&gt;. Don't bother with these for now. Focus on the words around these symbols.

Every error that you fix improves the quality of the book, both for yourself, and also for our other readers.

== Reviewing Pages ==

Read a lot of books or pages here on Wikibooks? You might be interested in our facility to review pages. To become a reviewer, post a message (see details about this below) at [[WB:RFA]] asking to become an &quot;editor&quot;. Then, you will be able to review pages. The next chapter will discuss reviewing pages.

== Getting Help ==

Sometimes a page will have complicated formatting, and you will find yourself in over your head. Don't worry, it happens! If you feel like you do need help from an experienced editor, ask for help at [[WB:SLP|The Reading Room]]. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it - there are many volunteers around who are happy to help, and happy to teach you how to help out more as well. 

If you want to raise an issue about a page, and try to start a discussion about a possible way forward, or if you see something that needs to be changed but you don't know how to do it yourself, there are two possible options:
#Leave a note on the page's discussion page. Create a header that says, in short, what the problem is, and then describe the problem and possible solutions (if any). Other users will see this discussion and will discuss it to find a solution.
#Post a note about it at the [[WB:CHAT|Reading Room]]. This option should be used for big problems, or problems which affect many pages in a book or even many books. The Reading Rooms should not be used to discuss every small problem from every page, but can be used to alert the community to larger or more wide-spread problems. Also, this can be a useful alternative to (1) when editors of a book disagree about the proper way to fix a problem, and community input on the issue is desired.

=== Messages and Communication ===

There are lots of reasons why you might want to get in touch with another Wikibookian: To commend them for their hard work, to ask for help or guidance, to leave helpful suggestions, to discuss ideas about a book or a page, or just to say hello. Getting in touch with other wikibookians is easy, and there are several places to do it:

#User talk pages. Every user has a user talk page. If a users's screenname is &quot;JoeWikibookian&quot;, his user talk page is at &quot;User talk:JoeWikibookian&quot;. User talk pages are great places to talk to an individual user.
#Discussion pages. Every page has a discussion page. At the top of the page, click the &quot;Discussion&quot; tab. This is where you can talk about an individual page.
#Community Pages. The [[WB:RR|Reading Rooms]] are a series of pages where the community can talk about wide-spread issues. If you want to get some general input about a topic, or want to make some kind of announcement, do it there.

Leaving a message or a note on one of these pages is easy. You can click &quot;edit this page&quot;, find the appropriate place (usually at the bottom of the page), and then click {{key|name=Save page}}. Or, you can click the &quot;+&quot; tab at the top, enter a title and a message, and then click {{key|name=Save page}}. It's up to you how you want to do it, but you should explore both methods.

When you write a message on a talk or discussion page, you should always sign it with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This posts your personal signature (so people know who to respond to) and also a timestamp (so people know when the message was left).

=== Vandalism ===

Sometimes a vandal will add inappropriate material to a page, or remove all the content from a page. It can be hard work to fix this, so if you find vandalism, report it at [[WB:AN|Administrative Assistance]]. Our team of volunteers and administrators will fix the problem for you. If you want to learn how they do this, you may be interested in reading The Wikibooks Editor or The Wikibooks Administrator.

== Becoming an Editor or Author ==

Wikibookians are all volunteers, and they get to choose their roles and their level of involvement. Wikibookians who find themselves fixing errors, or adding new material are taking the first few steps to becoming an editor or an author here. It is important that you find the tasks that you want to work on, and that you do things in a way that you enjoy. If you have decided that you want to be a more active participant here at Wikibooks, there are many possible paths for you to follow.

For more tips on how to become an editor, and make Wikibooks a better place, read the section on [[../How To Edit A Wikibook/]].

For more tips on how to become an author and create new books and new book content, see [[../Contributing To An Existing Wikibook/]] and [[../Starting A New Wikibook/]].

Notice that this is not an exclusive decision, you can easily become an author and an editor, or you could find a role that is neither of the two. The important part is that you find something that you enjoy doing.</text>

== [[Editing Wikitext]] ==

We have an entire book about Wikitext editing which covers all bases, not just those that are used here at Wikibooks. Check out '''[[Editing Wikitext]]''' for more information about how to edit existing pages and create beautiful new ones.
(For a quick overview, see the [[../Wiki-Markup/]] section later in this book).

'''Why you should edit...
'''
People decide to edit Wikibooks for many different reasons, so it's tricky to try. 

Some people, while reading, find a grammar error and it annoys them; they see it and they want it to be fixed, instead of waiting for somebody else to do it. 

'''Nevertheless, it's faster and easier to just edit the page and do it yourself.''' 

Some people really want to share the things that they know and help other students to learn for free versus buying textbooks on the web. 

Some people edit because they are bored and want a constructive hobby. 

Some people edit because their teachers are grading them! 

There are even those whose job it is to create Wikis for their companies and this forces them to take a harder look at Wikis and through this they easily spot errors and feel inclined to correct them.

There are many reasons why people might edit, but the reasons don't really matter in the end. The important thing is that you are participating in the Wikibooks project, and that you have taken the first step to joining the Wikibooks community.

== How to Edit ==

Almost all pages have a link at the top that says &quot;edit this page&quot;. Click that link and it will take you to a page where you can edit and save the text of the page. We say &quot;almost all&quot; because some pages can be protected against being edited, for a variety of reasons. If a page has been protected, the &quot;edit this page&quot; link will be replaced with a &quot;view source&quot; link. You can view the source code of the text to see how it is written, but you cannot save any changes on protected pages.

When you edit a page, a text box will be displayed with the current text of the page already loaded in it. You can change or add things to the page, and when you are done, you can save it.

Clicking the {{key|name=Preview page}} button will show you a preview of the new page at the top, and will provide you with the edit window at the bottom. No changes will be saved if you preview.

Clicking the {{key|name=Save page}} button will save your changes, and display them on the page for anybody who reads it. 

If you have just made a small edit, click the check box that says &quot;This is a minor edit&quot;. This will record the edit as being a minor edit, and not one that other editors need to inspect carefully.

=== Edit Summaries ===

The text box called &quot;Summary&quot; gives you an opportunity to explain what you did and why you did it. You do not need to write a summary, but it is considered good practice. If you just make a small edit, such as a spelling or grammar edit, you can write simply &quot;copyedit&quot; or &quot;grammar&quot; or &quot;spelling&quot;. This is good enough. If you make a larger or more substantial edit try to write, briefly, what you did and why. That will help to keep other proof-readers on task when they come to check your work for errors.

When other readers and editors look at the page's history, they will only see your edit summary. This means that if a person wants to see how a page has changed, they can either read the edit summaries (if they are provided) or else they have to scan the page line-by-line looking for changes. 

Plus, an edit summary is a good way to tell whether a person is a vandal, or if they are simply a new user who may be a little confused about policy. Writing an edit summary such as &quot;I tried to fix something, but I dont know if i did it right&quot;, or even &quot;I need help!&quot; is likely to indicate that you are not a vandal, and it will also attract help from users who are watching the recent changes list.

=== Keeping Track of Edits ===

There are a variety of ways that you can keep track of edits on Wikibooks. You can keep track of your own edits, edits to a particular page, and edits made by the entire community. We will discuss those things now.

=== Recent Changes ===

All the changes made by all Wikibooks editors on all pages are listed on the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes List]]. You can reach this list by clicking on the &quot;Recent Changes&quot; link in the &quot;navigation&quot; box on the left side of the screen. Here, you will see the changes made, in reverse chronological order, with the most recent change at the top of the list. Each change will contain the title of the page edited, the name of the user (or the IP address of the person, if they are not logged in), and various other data. Some of the other data that might be included are:

;M or N:M means the edit was a minor edit. N means the edit is the first one on that page, and that the page is new.
;(+123): In parenthesis will be the number of characters have been added to or removed from the page.  If the number is small, it was likely a small edit. If the number is large, it was a major change.
;Edit Summary: The edit summary, if the person wrote one before they saved the page. Sometimes, if the person did not write a summary, an automatic one will be generated by the software.

=== My Watchlist ===

If you have an account, and if you are logged in, you have access to a personal watchlist. Your watchlist is a list of pages that you want to keep track of. When you view your watchlist, by clicking the &quot;my watchlist&quot; link at the top of the page or by going to [[Special:Watchlist]], you will see a listing of all the recent changes to the pages on your watchlist. These changes will be displayed in the same way as the edits on the recent changes list are displayed.

(If you don't have an account yet, see [[../Setting Up A User Account/]]).

There are a few ways to add a page to your watchlist. When you edit a page, there is a checkbox to &quot;Watch this page&quot;. Checking that box adds the page to your watchlist. A second way is to click the &quot;Watch&quot; tab at the top of the page. A more advanced way is to go to the list at [[Special:Watchlist/raw]], and add pages. In the raw watchlist view, you may add one page title per line, and as many pages as you want at once. However, keep in mind that spelling and capitalization count!

The Watchlist has a special feature: '''it only shows the most recent edit to each page''', not every individual edit. That means if there have been 10 edits to a page since you last checked it, your watch list will only show the most recent edit, not all 10 of them.

The '''Watchlist''' tab in [[Special:Preferences|My Preferences]] contains a number of options concerning the use of your watchlist. You can set options to automatically watch pages that you edit, or pages that you create. This can be very helpful if you are creating a new book, and want to automatically add pages to your watch list as you create them.

=== History Pages ===

Every page has an associated history page. To get to the history page, click the &quot;history&quot; tab at the top. The history tab is to the left of the &quot;edit this page&quot; link. 

The history pages allow you to keep track of how a page changes over time. The history page shows the same information that the recent changes list and the watchlist show.

The history page also lets you view old versions of a page. In the history page, click the links to the different versions to see what the page used to look like.

=== RSS and ATOM Feeds ===

The recent changes list, both to the whole Wikibooks site and to the history pages are available as RSS and ATOM feeds. Users who have RSS or ATOM aggregators may find this functionality useful.

There currently are no RSS or ATOM feeds for your personal watchlist, however. This is a known issue, and is one of the features most frequently requested from the software developers.

=== Live Edit Feed ===

Users who are familiar with IRC may be interested in watching the real-time edit feed at irc://irc.wikimedia.org/#en.wikibooks. This feed shows, in real-time, all the edits and changes that are made, as they happen. This includes all the information that appears in the recent changes list, but is constantly updated.

In addition to the live feed, several members of the wikibooks community operate various patrol bots. These bots monitor the live feed looking for suspicious edits. These bots then report suspicious edits in irc://irc.freenode.net/#vandalism-en-wb. Users who are interested in becoming active vandal fighters tend to enjoy the irc interface.

=== Watching All Pages in a Book ===

It is a common request for new authors to want to watch all pages in a given book. For some of our more prolific authors, they want to watch all pages in several books! There are several ways to accomplish this:
#Add all pages in the book to your watchlist. If you are creating a new book, go to [[Special:Preferences]] and check the box &quot;Add pages I create to my watchlist&quot;. This will automatically add all the new pages in your book to your watchlist (but will not add pages other people create, automatically). If the book is an existing book, or if other people are working on it too, you might also want to check the box &quot;Add pages I edit to my watchlist&quot;. This will automatically add pages that you edit to your watchlist. With all the pages on your watchlist, you can go to [[Special:Watchlist]] to see changes to those pages.
#Go to [[Special:RecentChangesLinked]] and type in the name of your book. If you add a forward-slash and the name of your book, you can create a direct link to this list. For example:
#* [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Algebra]]
#* [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Wikibooks:Reading room]]

== Diffs ==

A &quot;diff&quot; is a special feature that can show you the difference between two versions of a single page. When you view a diff, the changes will be displayed at the top of the page, and the page content will be displayed below. 

On the recent changes and watchlist pages, there will be a link next to each edit that says &quot;(diff)&quot;. Clicking this link will show you the diff for that edit, showing you what changes have been made to the page. If you see an edit in the recent changes or the watch list that seems suspicious, look at the diff and make sure the edit is a good one.

In the history page, you are given more options. You can use the diff feature to compare any two page versions, not just the most recent edit. In the history page, select the radio buttons for the edits you want to compare and click the button {{key|name=Compare revisions}}.

If you are editing the pages, and you want to see the diff for your edit before you save it, you can click the {{key|name=Show changes}}. This will display the diff for the page that you can examine before you save.

== Copyediting ==

One of the most valuable types of contributions are random copyedits to pages that contain errors. These edits can be short and quick, enabling editors to perform many such edits over a wide variety of pages in a short period of time.

Copyeditors all have different strategies. One way to go about it is to use [[Special:Randompage]] to travel to random pages across the wiki. This will expose the copyeditor to a large variety of different subjects and styles. However, since each book has its own style guidelines (many of which are implicit, not explicit), it is typically better for many copyeditors to use the &quot;Random Book&quot; function (on the left side of the screen, in the &quot;navigation&quot; box). This function will take the reader to the main page of a random book. From there, the copyeditor can traverse all the pages of the book, making sure that style guidelines, templates, and navigational tools are implemented in a common way.

== Adding Pages ==

These notes will explain how to add pages to a wikibook, and how to reference these pages from within the wikibook.

== Moving and Renaming Pages ==

Moving and renaming pages is a surprisingly common task. What is more surprising to many new users is how easy it is to do. Moving a page is as simple as clicking the &quot;Move&quot; tab at the top of the page. This will take you to the move-screen, where you are given the opportunity to specify the new name for the page and a short explanation for why it needs to be moved. 

A common mistake is to try and move the page to the complete URL of the page. For instance if you had a page named &quot;example&quot; and you wanted it moved into the book called &quot;My Book&quot;, you would move the page to &quot;My Book/example&quot;, not &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/My_Book/example&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

A typical example of when a page needs to be moved is when a new user creates a new page in the wrong location. All pages should either be the first page of a new book, or they should be sub-pages of an existing book. Also, all book pages should follow the proper [[WB:NC|naming convention]]. 

For more tips on *why* and *when* to rename a page, see [[../How To Structure A Wikibook/]].

=== Moving a Page into a Book ===

Moving a page into an existing book is an easy task. Click the &quot;move&quot; tab, and then enter the bookname, a forward slash, and then the page name, as such:

 BOOKNAME/PAGENAME

In the description box, say something simple such as &quot;moving to a book&quot;, and then click the {{key|name=Move page}} button.

=== Fixing the Naming Convention ===

Often times a new page will be created at &quot;BOOKNAME PAGENAME&quot;, or &quot;BOOKNAME:PAGENAME&quot;, or some other similar location that doesn't follow the proper [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy|naming convention]]. Fixing this is easy enough, all that needs to be done is the page renamed to &quot;BOOKNAME/PAGENAME&quot;, with a forward slash between the book name and the page name, instead of a colon, space, dash, or other separator. 

As a description, if you simply enter the term &quot;nc&quot;, which is short for &quot;naming convention&quot;, all other wikibooks editors will know what you did and why.

== &quot;Tagging&quot; ==

Throughout the rest of this book we're going to use the word &quot;tagging&quot; a lot. Wikibooks has a number of pre-defined templates that can be used to alert other editors and readers about good and bad things on a page. To use a template, put two curly brackets on ether side &lt;nowiki&gt;{{like this}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. That will include the text of the template at this point in the page.

Wikibooks has a number of templates that can be used on books and pages to indicate the quality of the book. To &quot;tag a page&quot; is to add an appropriate template or templates to the page so other people are aware of the same stuff you are. Some tags are good, such as those that mark new or rapidly-growing books. Some are less positive, marking books that need cleanup or expansion. Some are downright bad, like those marking a page for deletion. Here is a list of tags and what they are used for:


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

|-
| Page nominated for '''RFD''' || {{tlx|rfd}}
|-
| Page to be '''speedy deleted''' || {{tlx|Delete}} {{tlx|Impending Doom}}

== Wikitext Basics ==

Wikitext is very simple, and one of the best ways to learn is by seeing and doing. When you see a page with fancy formatting, click &quot;edit this page&quot; to see the code. Some things are self-explanatory. Some things are not.

As we mentioned before, Wikitext can often be used interchangably with HTML and CSS code. If you are not familar with HTML and CSS, some of the most advanced formatting will be difficult for you to reproduce on your own. However, do not despair! There are no deadlines, things do not need to be perfect immediately, and you have plenty of time to learn and experiment here. 

If you want to experiment with wikitext and editing, you can go to the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|Sandbox]]. The sandbox is a page where you can make edits without getting in trouble. If you have something you want to try, do it at the sandbox!

{{Info|Not enough information? We have an entire book about Wikitext that includes many detailed descriptions, many examples, and a deeper look at some of the more advanced features of wikitext. For more information, see the book [[Editing Wikitext]].}}

== Paragraphs ==

New paragraphs can be made by creating the new paragraph in the code. E.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
This code will create 2 paragraphs. This is the first.

This is the second.
&lt;/pre&gt;

will give you:

{{TextBox|
This code will create 2 paragraphs. This is the first.

This is the second.
}}

== Formatting: Bold and Italics ==
Text can be bolded or italicized to place emphasis on a certain word or phrase. To bold text, place three apostrophes (&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) before and after the word or phrase you wish to bold E.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
'''This is an incredibly bold statement'''
&lt;/pre&gt;

will give you

{{TextBox|
'''This is an incredibly bold statement'''
}}

Bolding is usually used for the first appearance of an important term, E.g. in a mathematics book you might have &quot;'''Integral calculus''' is...&quot;, followed by a definition. Another use of bolding is with entire sentences for emphasis of important information, E.g. in a chemistry book a recipe might be given for black powder, but after that there might be something like &quot;'''Don't try making this at home!'''&quot;. You can probably think of more uses for bold text, these are just some general examples.

To italicize text, place two apostrophes (&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, not to be confused with a quotation mark, &quot;) before and after the phrase you wish to italicize E.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
''This sentence looks slanty''
&lt;/pre&gt;

will give you 

{{TextBox|
''This sentence looks slanty''
}}

Italicized text can be used for adding emphasis to text when making a point, E.g. &quot;You don't ''really'' need to do this but...&quot;, where people are probably going to read the &quot;''really''&quot; with a longer sound in their head than when they see the normal &quot;really&quot;. Another use is when naming the titles of books and movies, E.g. &quot;In William Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', ...&quot;.

These two types of formatting can be combined by first putting the 3 apostrophes for bold text and then the 2 for italicized text E.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
'''''A bold Italian might write like this...'''''
&lt;/pre&gt;

creates

{{TextBox|
'''''A bold Italian might write like this...'''''
}}

This might be used to emphasize important information while providing the same effect as italics in emphasis. It can also be used if you are making an annotated text for a book. You might start you introduction with the wikitext

&lt;pre&gt;
J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, '''''The Lord of the Rings''''', was written...
&lt;/pre&gt;

and this would look like

{{TextBox|
J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, '''''The Lord of the Rings''''', was written...
}}

== Bulleted and Numbered Lists ==

To create a bulleted list, simply place an asterisk in front of every addition to the list. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Number one
*Number two
*Number three
&lt;/pre&gt;

will show up as:

{{TextBox|
*Number one
*Number two
*Number three
}}

You can also indent particular bullets. To do so, just add ''another'' asterisk to the start of a line. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
*Number one
**Number two
*Number three
&lt;/pre&gt;

will show up as:

{{TextBox|
*Number one
**Number two
*Number three
}}

Numbered lists are just as easy. Place a # sign in front of every addition, and they will be automatically numbered. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
#Number one
#Number two
#Number three
&lt;/pre&gt;

will show up as:

{{TextBox|
#Number one
#Number two
#Number three
}}

Numbered lists can also be indented. Add another # to the start of every line, like so:

&lt;pre&gt;
#Number one
#Number two
##Number two point one
##Number two point two
#Number three
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will show up as:

{{TextBox|
#Number one
#Number two
##Number two point one
##Number two point two
#Number three
}}

== Preformatted Text ==

Preformatted text is rendered in a fixed-width font like Courier, and respects literal whitespace. This is most useful for writing software code, but also comes in handy in other places where things need to be made to line up in certain ways. Normally, using tables or divs should be used to align data, but sometimes preformatted text does what you want and does it better.

 This is preformatted text. Text here will render
 exactly how it appears. If you do not add in line
 breaks when you edit this page, the text will run
 off the edge of the screen. Notice how this text
 appears in a little box? We can put text where
 we want it:

    A
              B
                        C


Fixed-width fonts are good for lining things up and displaying literal text with respect to whitespace. It's typically considered bad for readability, and can be more difficult to edit because whitespace needs to be monitored.

== Page Links ==
There are about 2 ways to link to other pages in wikibooks. One way is to simply put the URL of the page in the code E.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page
&lt;/pre&gt;

gives

{{TextBox|
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page
}}

This is a bad idea when just doing a simple link to another page in wikibooks, because it doesn't look very neat, and is more reserved for external links to other websites for references and extra reading, e.g., a wikibook on nonsense might include &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; in it's external links section for further reading.

For simple links to other pages in wikibooks, you take the part of the URL after &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/&lt;/nowiki&gt;, in the above example this would be Main_Page, and put a double pair of brackets around it, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[Main_Page]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

this makes

{{TextBox|
[[Main_Page]]
}}

Main_Page is the name of the main page of wikibooks. You might wonder why your link has an underscore in it when all the other links you've seen just have spaces. When making links, the mediawiki software replaces spaces with underscores, because page names in wikibooks, and other wikimedia projects, don't allow spaces in the page name. So you could have done the same thing with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Main Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Another thing with page names is that they always start with a capitalized first letter, and the software running wikibooks automatically converts the first letter in a link to upper case, so you could have typed &lt;nowiki&gt;[[main Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and gotten the same thing.

You're probably wondering if page names are case-sensitive now, because the lone 'P' looks out of place amongst all the other lower case characters. Well it is, so &lt;nowiki&gt;[[main Page]] and [[main page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would link to two different pages.

&lt;pre&gt;
Try clicking on [[main Page]] and [[main page]] to see the difference.
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{TextBox|
Try clicking on [[main Page]] and [[main page]] to see the difference.
}}

You're probably wondering why, if the two links are supposed to go to different pages, they instead point to the same page. This is because &lt;nowiki&gt;[[main page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; points to a page which is a '''redirect'''. So when you click on the link, you go to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_page&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but the page will be replaced with the page from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and up the top left of the page there is a little piece of text saying (Redirected from [[Main page]]). 

This is a very useful feature which makes it much easier to link to pages, because people have already thought of common page names people might try in links to link to certain pages, and have gone and created those pages as redirects, so that we little people don't need to bother ourselves with this case sensitivity stuff.

So that is how you link to a page in wikibooks. You can link to subpages as well, e.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
[[Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

gives

{{TextBox|
[[Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance]]
}}

This is pretty ugly, and just as bad as posting a URL to the page. This can be avoided by using a '''pipe''' character |. By putting a pipe character at the end of the page name, and then typing in another name after it, still inside the double brackets, you can change the text displayed for the link without changing the link. So instead of a big long link like [[Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance]], you can do

&lt;pre&gt;
[[Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance|Cleanup and Maintenance]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

which gives

{{TextBox|
[[Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance|Cleanup and Maintenance]]
}}

It doesn't matter if you want to add spaces in the link to space things out and make it more readable

&lt;pre&gt;
[[ Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance | Cleanup and Maintenance ]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

still makes

{{TextBox|
[[ Using_Wikibooks/The_Wikibooks_Editor/Cleanup_and_Maintenance | Cleanup and Maintenance ]]
}}

== New or Existing? ==

You have the urge to write. You have information that you want to share with the world. The first impulse for most new writers is to simply start a new book and start writing. However, this is not always the best idea. Wikibooks contains hundreds of books on dozens of subjects. You should check to see if there are any existing books on your subject before you start to write a new one.

Like the saying goes, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.

If there is already an existing book with a similar subject and similar goals as you want, try to contribute to that book first. It is always better to consolidate and create one good book than to separate and write many small unfinished books.

This page is going to talk about how to contribute content to existing books. However, this isn't the only task that The Wikibooks Author will want to perform. Later chapters will talk about how to create new books from scratch also.

== Book Definitions ==
[[Image:Llibri books4.JPG|right|thumb]]
A book needs a definition. The definition helps to set the goals and the directions for the book, so that all contributors can work together collaboratively. A definition should include, either explicitly or implicitly, all the following pieces of information:

;Target Audience:Who the book is written for. Certain audiences are going to have certain background information that you can use to build more advanced lessons on. Sometimes, instead of specifying a particular audience, you will want to specify particular prerequisites for your readers. If everybody starts off on the same foot, you don't need to cover as much background information in your book, and you can focus on writing new and more advanced information.
;Subject:This is self-explanatory. What topic are you writing about?
;Scope and Depth:We know what subject we are writing about, but how much of it do we want to cover? How much depth do we want to go into? How many details do we want to cover. The scope of the book defines how much of the subject we want to cover, and the depth defines how many details we want to discuss.

Two books on the same subject can have completely different definitions. If there is already a book on your subject, but with a different definition, you can start a new book. If the book already exists with the same definition, you could contribute to the existing book and not start a new one.

== Books and Communities ==

If the book doesn't have any active contributors, take charge and do what you can do to fix it up. Read any local style or formatting policies (some books go to great length to list this information), so that the content you add will fit nicely with the content that already exists in the book. It is typically better to build on and expand existing style guidelines than it is to reformat the entire book from scratch. Sometimes, major aesthetic changes can come from simply improving some of the existing book templates. Be wary of making changes to global templates, however, because those changes may affect other books in a negative way.

Many books will not have any style guidelines written down. In these cases, feel free to make any changes that you need to make to improve the book. Just keep in mind that if you undertake a project that is too large to complete, you might leave the book in worse condition than when you started.

Remember that in order to improve a book, you may need to '''be bold''' and make some substantial changes. If you need to move a page, or delete a page, or replace some content in order to make the book better, don't hesitate. Of course, if there are other editors contributing, it would be best to seek consensus before making any major changes.

=== Existing Book Community ===

[[Image:Working Together Teamwork Puzzle Concept.jpg|thumb|left]]
Wiki is a collaborative environment, and many projects that you join may have existing contributors. These contributors will all have different work schedules, activity levels, and vested interests in the book. Making massive changes to things could upset people who spent a lot of time putting them that way in the first place. 

Books with no existing community are easy to edit. You find a page and you make any changes you want. Books with an existing community are quite different, although they can be just as rewarding. When multiple people are all working on the same book, it's important to communicate and collaborate. Use other authors as a sounding board for new ideas. Improve the contributions of others, and be prepared for them to improve your work as well. You may find that the book has an emergent property, gaining a higher level of quality than it would have under only one author.

Being the sole author of a book means that the book will show all the strengths and weaknesses that you write into it. The book will contain only your perspective. It will only cover the information that you know, and will not cover information or examples that you are not as familiar with. By collaborating with other authors, the book can benefit from each author's strengths, and can avoid any of the individual weaknesses.

{{-}}

=== Consensus ===

Consensus is difficult to understand, and it's even more difficult when you and your book-writing peers are trying to pursue it yourselves. The first thing to understand is that for most issues there isn't a right or wrong answer, and most decisions are more complex than yes or no, my way or the highway. Your idea is not correct, and other competing ideas are not incorrect. No single opinion in a book is ever &quot;optimal&quot; by itself. Wiki is founded on the idea of ''emergence'', that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. Your ideas combined with the ideas of other editors, are going to be better than your ideas by themselves.

When working together don't pick one viewpoint or one perception, find a way to incorporate many. The benefit will be seen among the readers, who are all going to need a different explanation of the same concepts in order to learn. The more ideas and points of view that you can cover in your book, the better a resource the book will be.

Consensus requires an understanding of this idea of emergence. If you want the book to improve, grow, and succeed, you are all but required to listen to competing ideas and find compromises. If you don't, you are hurting the book, hurting the book community, and wasting your own time.

== Rewriting a Book ==

[[Image:Fern Hobbs profile.png|thumb|right]]

Some books on Wikibooks were created but later abandoned by their authors. These books are in various states of disrepair, and often need more than just a little bit of help to become successful. If you think that you can do much better, and that the existing book is irreparable, you can rewrite the book according to your own vision.

Notice that you should only attempt to completely rewrite a book that is in very poor condition, such as a stub. You should never try to delete and rewrite a book that has substantial content, or that has active contributors.

{{-}}

== Merging Books ==

Sometimes, two or more half-completed books can be merged together to form one book that is in much better condition. Also, when you start to write your own book, you may find that certain stub books or half-books would be better off if they were merged into your book.

Nominate book mergers with the {{tlx|Merge}}, {{tlx|Mergeto}}, and {{tlx|Mergefrom}} templates. The purpose of these templates is to alert other contributors about a possible merge. Sometimes, people may disagree with a merger for any number of reasons, and then you need to seek consensus before continuing. The merge templates should stay on the books for at least one week (preferrably longer) to ensure that contributors have plenty of time to see the templates and to participate in the discussion.

When time comes to perform a merge, redirect the old pages to the new pages, combine the book content, and ask an administrator to help merge the history pages (if needed).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Using Wikibooks/Page}}

== Advertising ==

A book is useless if nobody reads it. That isn't entirely true, there is some educational value in the editing process. However, books are meant to be read and can be the most beneficial to the largest audience if there are active readers. Since you've put in so much effort to write your new book, you want to make sure that these readers can find it. Also, you want to make sure that other editors and authors can find it, to help the book improve. Books on Wikibooks are never &quot;complete&quot;, and they can always be improved. Often times the best way to improve a book is just to get a fresh perspective on it.

In short, you need to bring more people to your book. There are several ways to advertise your book so that people will be able to find it. Some of these advertisement methods are on Wikibooks, and can be used to attract existing Wikibookians to your book. Some ways require additional creativity, but can reach a larger audience.

== Categorization Templates ==

Having a book listed in the organizational structure here at Wikibooks is very easy. When you first create a new book, add the tag {{tlx|New book}} to the top. This will give you some helpful information, and it will also cause the book to appear automatically in the [[Template:New|list of new books]]. This list is displayed in many places around Wikibooks, and your book will be immediately visible to many users.

Add your book to an appropriate subject category. To do this, use the tag {{tlx|Subjects}}. To determine which category to put your book in, browse the list at [[Subject:Major Subjects]], or ask for help at the [[WB:SLN|New Books Reading Room]]. If you categorize your book like this, people who are browsing Wikibooks will be more likely to find it.

== Featured Books ==

Want maximum exposure? The best way to get your book promoted on Wikibooks is to get it featured. Featured status isn't just something you can ask for, or something you can just do in an afternoon. It takes a lot of work, and requires your book to achieve a certain level of quality. It's impossible to say exactly what the requirements are for a book to become featured, because community standards are continually being raised. As a featured book, your book will be featured on the main page, and listed at [[WB:FB|Featured Books]].

== Blogosphere ==

Have a blog? Write about your book. If not, there are several active Wikibookians who do maintain Wikibooks-related blogs, or Wikimedia-related blogs who would be happy to advertise your book. Blogging about a book is a great way to attract attention to it, especially attention from non-Wikibookians.

== Forums and Chatrooms ==

The internet is filled with existing communities who discuss particular topics. If you have something to write about, there is probably a community of people online who are already talking about it actively. Search the internet for websites and communities that focus on the same subject as your book, and use them as a sounding board for ideas, reviewers, and potential editors. Remember that Wikibooks is open and free, and anybody can be invited to come lend their expertise. Wikibooks also make a great place for a community to store its knowledge and documentation, writings that would not have a dedicated home otherwise.

== Schools and Universities ==

If you're writing about an academic sort of subject, and if your book has reached a high level of quality, it might be useful as a classroom resource. Wikibooks are great in these situations because they are free and can be used to supplement traditional texts in the classroom.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This service is provided by the “HermesBot” bot (robot, an automated Wiki program), which is operated by user “Wikihermit”.  The ''Signpost'' deliveries will appear as messages from “HermesBot”.

This only delivers to the english wikibooks, even if you subscribe a non-English user talk page.

Do '''NOT''' sign your posts on this page.  Simply link to your user talk page.

=== Talk page delivery ===

'''NOTE:''' This will only work for '''user talk pages''' (that is, the page name must begin with “&lt;code&gt;User talk:&lt;/code&gt;”).

To get the ''Signpost'' on your user talk page, just add a link to your talk page.  For example, “&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User talk:Example]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;” (where “&lt;code&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt;” is the account name).

The MediaWiki features which alert you to new messages will be triggered by delivery.

If you prefer, you can have the signpost delivered to a subpage, by using something like “&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[User talk:Example/Signpost]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;”.  However, the “New messages” feature will not be triggered by delivery to subpages.

To sign up for delievery to the english wikipedia, please visit [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/Tools/Spamlist|there spam list]].
=== Email delivery ===

To get the ''Signpost'' via email, enter your email address [http://wikipediasignpost.com/signup.php here], then click the &quot;confirmation&quot; link in your email.</text>

== Deleting Pages ==
Deleting pages is a task that administrators do not engage in lightly. There are two ways for a page to be deleted: Through the '''[[WB:RFD|Requests for Deletion]]''' (RfD) and through speedy deletions.

=== Requests for Deletion ===
[[WB:RFD|Requests for Deletion]] is a page where Wikibookians can nominate books and pages for deletion if they don't meet the project's inclusion criteria.  The Wikibooks community will discuss the issue, and if they agree, the page can be deleted.  Over time, a number of fancy templates have been created to help manage these discussions.  While it isn't required to use these templates when discussing, or when closing the discussion, it certainly helps.  Plus, if you don't use the templates, somebody else may come along and correct you.

A request for deletion is not a majority voting process, nothing on Wikibooks truly is. There is only one real rule that needs to be followed: '''When in doubt, do not delete'''. However, this rule does not imply that a discussion needs 100% agreement in order to delete a page. An admin must not only tally the comments in favor and opposed, but must also read the rationale behind the expressed opinions. Using all this information together, the admin must come to a firm conclusion. In other words, the community may express doubts, but the deleting admin must have none.

Given the freedom of admins, there is a slim possibility that an admin may choose to delete a nominated page, despite the community being in favor of keeping that page. This is permissible, but the admin should be prepared to defend the action with solid reasoning. While possible, it is highly recommended that admins avoid this kind of vigilantism, except in the most exceptional of circumstances. 

=== Speedy Deletions ===
Some pages can be deleted quickly, without having to be nominated on [[WB:RFD|Requests for Deletion]]. These are known as speedy deletions or simply &quot;speedys&quot;. A page only qualifies as a speedy deletion if:

#It is vandalism or spam, or other useless information that is not part of a book
#If it is a user page, and that user has asked the page to be deleted
#If it is the user page of a vandal who has been blocked forever
#If the page is just a repost of a page that has already been deleted
#If the page is part of a book, and the authors of that book have agreed to delete the page 
#If the page has been nominated for RFD, and the community has decided to delete.

Use [[:Template:delete]] for speedy deletions.

If the book does not fall under one of these categories, it should be nominated at [[WB:RFD|Requests for Deletion]] instead of being speedy deleted. Notice that rule 1 above implies that the page history contains only vandalism or spam as well. If a page was useful, and was replaced with vandalism, it should be reverted instead of deleted. Before deleting, always check the page history.

The fifth rule isn't technically a &quot;speedy&quot;, but it highlights an important point: The authors of a book, if there are several of them, form a mini-community within Wikibooks. These mini-communities are empowered to make decisions about their books. In fact, we like to think that the authors of a book will understand that book well enough to make deletion decisions about pages in that book. Nobody knows a book better than it's author. If an individual page from a book is nominated for deletion, it is common practice to move that discussion to the book's talk page. When the authors there reach a decision, the page can be deleted as a speedy. In short, it's not really a speedy because there is a discussion about the page, and a discussion, etc. Once the decision is made, however, an admin can treat the page as a speedy, block the deletion if the content is found significant (especially if no consensus process occurred) or anyone can change the speedy into a general community discussion by re-tasking the &quot;speedy&quot; for a request for deletion process.

The sixth rule also doesn't sound like a speedy at all. Once a book has been slated for deletion, sometimes the {{tl|Impending Doom}} template is placed onto the page, to give the authors time to save a copy of the book. This is done as a courtesy. The {{tl|Impending Doom}} template puts the book into the speedy deletion category, and technically any admin can delete that book as a speedy upon seeing the template.

Books that don't meet the [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]], or that don't appear to be appropriate textbooks for whatever reason can be nominated for deletion at [[WB:RFD]].  The community can discuss the issue, and once a general agreement is reached, the page will be either kept or deleted (or sometimes merged with other work, or transwikied to another project).

=== Nominating for Deletion ===
When a page is nominated for deletion, mark it with {{tl|rfd}}, and create an entry at [[WB:RFD]] with the reason for nomination.  Once the community has discussed the matter, and consensus has been reached (or not), the nomination can be closed.  This makes it clear that discussion is over, and clarifies the outcome.  If the community decides to delete, replace {{tl|rfd}} with {{tl|Impending Doom}}.  If the community decides to keep, remove {{tl|rfd}} and place {{tl|rfd-survived}} on the talk page.

=== Listing Nominations on the RfD Page ===
On the RfD page, list the name of the book or page using a link (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) in the header of your rationale.  Then in the message box, type your rationale for why you believe the item in question does not satisfy the [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]]. Make sure to sign your post with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt; ~~~~ &lt;/nowiki&gt;).

=== Purpose the RfD Page ===
A discussion at &quot;Requests for Deletion&quot; is not a &quot;vote&quot; in the sense of a democracy, majority-rules decision.  Rather, debates are made until the community arrives at a consensus about what should be done about the nomination.  If no consensus can be made, a user will generally attempt to synthesize a compromise solution.

Several templates are in use for different types of comments. The {{tl|keep}} template is used when you are in favor of keeping content, and {{tl|del}} is used if you are in favor of deletion. It is highly recommended that you leave comments near your opinion because the decision is not based on majority vote but quality of argument and community consensus.

For general comments that are meant to be neutral, use the {{tl|comment}} template.

=== Viewing Deleted Pages ===
Admins can view deleted pages, and they can also view a list of a users' deleted contributions. In general, information in these pages should not be made public, unless there has been a specific request  for the information (such as on [[WB:RFU]], described below) and the page in question does not contain any sensitive or inappropriate information. Admins should be careful and cautious when viewing deleted pages, and making those pages available to other users.

=== Undeleting Pages ===
It's less common than page deletions, but there is a mechanism for undeleting pages as well. If a page has been wrongfully deleted, or if a community member wants to reexamine the deletion decision, the page can be nominated at [[WB:RFU|Requests for Undeletion]]. If the community agrees to undelete the page, an admin can undelete it.

Many times an admin will temporarily undelete a page, so that an author or reader can extract information from it. It is left to the discretion of admins whether and when to do this. A page that has been undeleted temporarily can be deleted as a speedy when it is no longer needed.

== Importing ==
Often a book can take advantage of work done on Wikibooks' sister projects. In this case, the page should be imported and merged into the book.  This is better than a simple cut and paste operation, as it brings not only the wiki markup, but also the page history. Preserving a page's history is required in order to respect the GFDL copyright terms.

=== Requesting an import ===
Non-administrator and non-importer can ask for an import on [[Wikibooks:Requests for import|this page]].

=== Using Imported Data as the Basis for a New Book or Chapter ===
If the page is to be used as the starting point, it can simply be imported into Wikibooks by using the [[Help:Importing|Import]] tool.  The page is imported into Transwiki name-space, and then moved to whatever the new book's name will be.

=== Incorporating Imported Data into an Existing Chapter ===
If the page is to be merged with an existing book chapter, things get a little more complicated. The first step is to import the page as outlined previously. The imported page can be moved from the transwiki space to the book chapter - using the same name as the existing book chapter. This will cause the existing chapter to be deleted with the imported material taking its place. The administrator can then undelete all the previous material.  At this point, any editor can take over and edit the chapter to incorporate old and new material, cutting and pasting to the heart's content. If the content was moved ''before'' this process, you'll want to copy the wiki markup of the existing page before beginning, and use it to replace the new version after undeleting.

To summarize:
* Import page
* Move imported page on top of existing chapter &amp;mdash; this will delete the existing chapter
* Undelete chapter material
* Edit (or restore to its original state)</text>

== Vandalism ==

Spam is when outside groups try to use Wikibooks as a vehicle for advertising. Spammers, often automated spam programs, insert links to external commercial websites on various pages.

Vandals are not financially motivated. They disrupt the project by adding inappropriate pages and content.

=== Types of Disruption ===

There are several common types of disruption that have occurred at Wikibooks in the past. Some of these types have been mitigated through technical measures. Some have simply become less popular for vandals over time. Others are still in occasional use. In general, Wikibooks has very low levels of spam and vandalism, especially compared to what it once had. However, it's a problem that never goes away completely and that our administrators and vandal fighters should be prepared for.

;&quot;[[m:Friends of gays should not be allowed to edit articles|Friends of gays]]&quot; vandalism: This is the type of vandalism where one immature editor makes inappropriate remarks about other people they know from offline. Often, it's considered an easy way to put an insult online in a place that looks &quot;official&quot;. This can be comments like &quot;John is gay&quot; or &quot;Sarah is a whore&quot;, and are usually inserted without much fanfare on a single page. The goal is to insult the target not to disrupt the Wikibooks project, so this type of vandalism is usually found in unpopular and rarely-visited pages that only the attacker and victim are likely to be looking at. Since the goal is not to disrupt the project, these types of vandals are not serious and do not need to be dealt with harshly.
;Image vandalism: This is where an inappropriate or pornographic image is uploaded to Wikibooks (or pre-existing images are used inappropriately), and it is added to several pages. Particularly difficult forms of this vandalism inserts the image into popular templates, which causes the inappropriate image to be displayed in many places. This type of vandalism used to be very common, however new technical measures make it less appealing for vandals. New accounts must wait 4 days before they can upload an image, precisely because of this type of vandalism.
;Page move vandalism: Page move vandalism is when the vandal renames a page to something inappropriate. A tame example would be moving [[Main Page]] to [[Main Page on Wheels!!]]. This type of vandalism used to be very common, like image vandalism. However, new technical measures such as fast reverts of page moves and requiring new users to be autoconfirmed before moving pages have helped reduce this.
;Personal Attack Vandalism: This type of vandalism represents a personal attack on one or more editors here at Wikibooks, and can be comprised of image vandalism, page move vandalism, or other types. Common targets are typically [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|admins]] and [[m:SWMT|active vandal fighters]] who have piqued a personal interest among the vandals. This type of vandalism usually occurs in the User:  and User talk: namespaces, especially on the user and user talk pages of the person being targeted.
;&quot;Is this for real?&quot; vandalism: This is a very benign type of vandalism where new and incredulous users post test edits on pages to see if wiki is real. This type of vandalism, which isn't even called &quot;vandalism&quot; in most cases, is less common then it used to be just because society has become more familiar with wikis and people are less surprised by it. These types of edits should be redirected to the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]], or to a users' page, instead of occurring in the content or discussion pages. These users are often just being curious, and shouldn't normally be blocked because of it.
;Page blanking vandalism: This is vandalism where a user deletes all or substantial portions of the content from a page. Removing ''all'' content will be obvious in [[Special:RecentChanges]] where the system will automatically insert a message that the page has been blanked; removing lots of content creates the '''(-14,528)''' alerts. Page blanking is not always vandalism, and sometimes it's a perfectly normal part of the editing and authoring process. Keep an eye out for these kinds of edits, and don't hesitate to revert them and start a discussion if you are worried.
;Edit summary vandalism: Using disruptive and inappropriate edit summaries, as part of scandalous edits or even as part of edits that otherwise look normal, is still considered vandalism. Those bad edit summary messages can be trapped in the edit history of the page forever, or until it is removed by an admin or a user with oversight access.

There are dozens of other types of vandalism, and many repeat vandals have particular signatures that can be used to identify their handiwork. However, these are some of the main types to be aware of.

== Watching For Vandalism ==

Some Wikibookians watch the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] list to try and monitor for vandalism. Other users monitor the vandalism alerts on IRC. Sometimes users will find vandalism and report them at the [[WB:AN|Administrative Assistance]] reading room. A good admin should keep these pages on their watchlist, or find another way to stay alerted about vandalism.

Many types of vandalism will become obvious on the recent changes list, such as page-move vandalism, edit summary vandalism, or page blanking.

== Fighting Vandalism ==

When fighting vandalism, the first task is to block the offending user. The length of the block depends on various factors. Once the user is blocked, you can start reverting the vandal edits.

However, if there are multiple vandals, checkuser help is going to be needed to determine where the vandals are coming from. A checkuser can determine if multiple vandal accounts are coming from the same computer and if so, block all of them at once. Another benefit to checkusers is that when a source for vandalism has been blocked, no new vandal accounts can be created from that computer. Here is a general checklist or playbook to follow when dealing with a vandal:

#Block the vandal or vandals first.
#If there are multiple vandals, post a message on [[WB:AN]] to get help from a checkuser. If no checkusers are around, the stewards can be contacted at [[meta:|Meta]] to do the job.
#If there is a lot of vandalism, request help cleaning it at [[WB:AN]] too.
#Start cleaning the vandalism by reverting all page edits made by the vandal.

If the vandal creates inappropriate pages or uploads inappropriate images as part of the vandalism, they cannot be reverted and need to be deleted. Admins can delete the page, while ordinary users can blank the page content and mark it with {{tlx|delete}}.

=== Open Proxies ===

A side note to the discussion about vandalism is the discussion about open proxies. An open proxy is an internet IP address which is available for other people to use. The result is that a person can appear to be editing from the open proxy, while concealing their real IP address. WMF policy is that open proxies should be banned indefinitely. While this isn't always ideal (there are many people who rely on open proxies for regular internet access) it does cut down on vandalism dramatically. 

Some admins choose to mass-block open proxies, some admins choose not to bother with it. Technically, an open proxy can be blocked indefinitely, but we don't make people do it if they don't want to.

== Vandalism Waves ==

Some vandals are highly determined, and may use multiple user accounts and multiple IP addresses (typically open proxies) to attack. Sometimes, these attacks can feel overwhelming. Here are some tips for getting through a difficult vandalism attack:

;Block first, revert second:This way, the vandal won't be creating more messes while you go to clean up the previous messes. Also blocked users can request to be unblocked on their user talk pages. This means that if a person is blocked in error, those blocks can be reversed.
;Use bot rollback:This advanced technique hides flood vandalism, and the reverts, from [[Special:RecentChanges]].
;Get Help:Even formidable administrators can use some support when dealing with a tricky vandal. Multiple users and admins should tackle the problem together. Ordinary users can recruit administrator help by posting a request at [[WB:AN|Administrative Assistance]] or reporting in [[WB:IRC|IRC]]. Remember that even non-admins can undo page edits or revert the page back to a good revision in the page history. The only thing admins are really needed for is blocking vandals and deleting pages.
;Watch the Recent Changes List:Some users watch the list in real time on IRC, but refreshing the [[Special:Recentchanges]] page every couple of minutes is good too. Make sure you keep track of what pages are being targeted, and where the cleanup effort is making progress.
;Temporarily protect pages:Administrators may need to protect, for a short period of time, pages which normally wouldn't be protected against editing. If a vandal  is persistently attacking one page repeatedly, protecting that page will slow the vandal down (or cause the vandal to lose interest all together). If you need to protect a page that gets heavy traffic (such as the staff lounge or other discussion pages) leave a message about the protection.

== Blocking and Unblocking ==

Blocking users is a necessary weapon in the fight against vandalism. However blocking non-vandals is something that should almost never be done, except in the most extreme circumstances. User blocks can be very disruptive and demoralizing. For that reason, except in cases of obvious vandalism or serial spam should a user be blocked. However, a block is not a one-size-fits-all solution, there are many options that can be set by the blocking admin to affect the way a block is performed.

=== Block Duration ===

The duration of a block is the most obvious option that an admin can modify. A user can be blocked for as little as a few minutes, and as long as indefinitely. When deciding a block duration, the admin should check how long similar blocks have been for in the past, and how serious was the offense. 

Users who are being disruptive but are acting like a new user (adding &quot;friends of gays&quot; vandalism, or making test edits) should be talked to first. If they don't respond to messages, they can be blocked for a short period.
If you block a user temporarily, leave a message on their talk page explaining how long the block was, why they were blocked, and what the expectations are for them to return to regular editing. Some users will just disappear after that, others will learn their lesson and become normal editors here.

Some users are not so harmless and actually make a concerted effort to disrupt the project. These types of users are &quot;vandals&quot;, and can be dealt with more suddenly and harshly. These users, who are only interested in disruption and are not experimenting, are not ever going to become normal editors and do not need to be warned or treated kindly. Accounts which have been created for the sole purpose of vandalism can be blocked indefinitely on sight without warning.

=== Block Reason ===

There is a drop-down list of the most common blocking reasons. If possible a reason should be selected from the list when a user is blocked for a common offense. Sometimes the reason why a user is blocked is not well suited to the pre-existing explanations and a custom explanation is in order. When explaining a user block, be as descriptive as you can to show why the user has been blocked. These reasons will appear in the logs so that they can be considered by future admins who might be considering an unblock request.

=== Block Options ===

There are three options when blocking users which may have a profound effect on the user. Some of these options are cryptic:

;Prevent account creation
:Preventing account creation means that if an IP address is blocked, the user will not be able to create any screennames from that IP until the block expires. This is primarily useful for when a vandal is using a series of sock-puppets from a single source IP address.
;Automatically block the last IP address used by this user, and any subsequent IPs they try to edit from
:The second option, often called &quot;autoblock&quot; is used when blocking a username when the IP address is not known. This option blocks that user, blocks the user's IP address, and any additional IP addresses that the user might try to use. This can be a very valuable vandalism fighting tool, especially when sock-puppetry is suspected and no Checkusers are available to run a check. There are two things to note about this kind of block:
:#This can cause large groups of IP addresses to be blocked automatically, including proxy addresses that are shared by many legitimate users (such as AOL shared IP addresses).
:#Each block will show up individually in the block logs, and to remove the blocks or to modify the block time, each block will have to be examined individually (this can become quite a large number).
;Prevent user from sending e-mail
:Blocked users are, by default, enabled to send email to other users. This is a useful aid in discussing a block, or requesting an unblock. However users which are blatant vandals or spammers should have this right revoked to prevent spam or vandalism emails.

=== Changing Block Parameters ===
Historically, one had to unblock and re-block a user to change the settings of the block. Recently, this was changed so administrators can change the settings without unblocking. Use the &quot;change block settings&quot; link, or simply use [[Special:Block/User]].

=== Unblock Requests ===

A user can request unblock on their user talk page. Administrators should consult the admin who placed the block, except in obvious, uncontroversial cases. An admin may, at their discretion, unblock the user or engage in a discussion with that user about the terms for being unblocked. Caution and discretion are advised, however, because many vandals use bogus unblock requests as an additional form of harassment and vandalism. Users abusing the ability to edit their talk page should have that ability revoked. Previously, this was done by full-protecting the page, but administrators can now adjust the block settings to disallow the blocked user from editing the user talk page. If abuse continues from IPs or new accounts, then protection should be placed in addition to blocking other users/IPs.

[[Special:ListUsers/checkuser|CheckUsers]] are privy to private system logs which are not accessible by the public or administrators. Blocks marked as {{tlx|checkuserblock}} or &quot;per CU&quot; etc are not to be lifted without consultation with project CheckUsers.

== Emergency: Rogue Admin ==

Possibly the worst-case scenario is a rogue admin or bureaucrat account. It has never happened on Wikibooks, but it has happened on other wikis, notably the English Wikipedia and English Wiktionary, before. Typically, this happens when an administrator's password is discovered by a vandal. It is not unheard of on Wikipedia for a regular admin to become disgruntled with the project and act out negatively as well. The vandal using the administrator's account, or the disgruntled admin, can then go on a rampage blocking ordinary users, deleting pages and unblocking other vandalism. 

Admins may unblock themselves when blocked. Bureaucrats are not able to demote an administrator, so the only help will come from the [[m:Special:ListUsers/steward|stewards]] at [[meta:|Meta]]. In the event of a rogue admin, the first and most important task is for people to request help from the stewards. Once the admin has been demoted and blocked, the cleanup effort can begin.

This scenario is a major reason why all Wikibookians, especially those with additional tools should choose a [[w:Password_strength#Guidelines_for_strong_passwords|strong password]]. If a vandal is able to get access to your account they can cause long term damage not only to the project but to your reputation as well.

Black's plan is straightforward: They want to eliminate White's pawns on d4/e5 - and after doing so, Black will find it easier
to develop the pieces of their kingside to good squares. &lt;br&gt;
Here White's most common continuation is [[/4. c3|4. c3]], in order to support their d4-Pawn.&lt;br&gt;
Now, if after 4. c3 Black plays 4...cxd4, White can simply replace their d-Pawn: 5.cxd4, and Black's position will be
just as cramped as it was before. &lt;br&gt;
However, there are some rarely played alternative variations for White:&lt;br&gt;
Both [[/4. Nf3|4. Nf3]] as well as [[/4. Qg4|4. Qg4]] have the idea of (temporarily) sacrificing the d4-pawn in order to
get some initiative on the kingside as a compensation. &lt;br&gt;
Although [[/4. dxc5|4. dxc5]] helps Black's intention of eliminating White's pawn center, this continuation has also been played by
White.

Here, after White's 4. c3, Black usually decides to increase the pressure on White's center pawns (d4/e5) by playing [[/4...Nc6|4...Nc6]]. &lt;br&gt;
Another plausible plan for Black is [[/4...Qb6|4...Qb6]], which also increases the pressure on d4, and allows the manoeuver 5...Bd7 followed by 6...Bb5. The idea is to trade Black's 'bad' bishop for White's 'good' bishop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:semi-hydro33.jpg|thumb|260px|''Cattleya'' transferred to passive hydroponics culture 5 weeks earlier. Rich development of surface roots.]]

'''Passive hydroponics''' is one of many methods to grow plants without soil. Growing medium is inert and wicking. It delivers water with fertilizer to the roots by means of ''capillary action''. Substrate contains many small air pockets and can thus deliver oxygen to the roots.  The method has been applied to orchids.

==Container==

Orchids can be planted in any non glass container. The 3-4 drainage holes are placed not at the bottom but  3-5 cm up, at the sides of the pot. The idea is to provide a water reservoir at the bottom of the container from which the medium wicks moisture to the roots.

==Popular media==

LECA (Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate) - expanded / fired clay pellets or clay pebbles , perlite, vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, gravel, charcoal, rockwool, coconut husk chips and their combinations. 

==Water==
Substrate is flushed with tepid water solution when reservoir is nearly empty. Translucent pot may help to see when it is.

==Fertilizer==

Orchids are fertilized with 1/2 to 1/4 of recommended strength of balanced inorganic fertilizer with every [[Image:Phalaenopsisse.jpg|left|thumb|280px|''Phalaenopsis'' cultured on window sill. Passive hydroponics]]watering. Container is flushed with plain water every month to prevent harmful salt build up.

==Conversion from conventional culture to passive hydroponics== 

*New medium is washed and then soaked overnight. The plant is then removed from the old pot and substrate is removed from the roots. Rotten or overlong roots are cut / trimmed away. All the roots are thorougly washed with lukewarm water.
* Some new medium is placed at the bottom of the new container.  The plant is accommodated and more new medium is put around. The pot is gently shaken, more medium is put in, more shaking and so on. Container is flushed with tepid water. The orchid is placed in the shade without fertilizing the following month.

==Which orchids can be grown?==
Most popular orchids will more or less thrive in hydroponic culture: ''Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium, Masdevallia, Phalaenopsis, Cattleya, Cymbidium, Oncidium, Dendrobiums, Epidendrums, Miltoniopsis, Pleurothallid and Zygopetalum''.  

*''Exceptions''  would be very big or &quot;thirsty&quot; plants or those whose roots must sometimes completely dry and even those that require dry rest like ''Dendrobium nobile''.

==Advantages of Passive Hydroponics==
Its simplicity and effectiveness. No guessing about watering and fertilizing, no media decomposition, practically no root rot, healthy plants, fine blooming, no moving parts, low cost, reusable media.
*In hot and dry environments passive hydroponics is beneficial since the roots stay in a high humidity chamber with some air flow.

==Disadvantages==
*The main disadvantage is sometimes need of more frequent watering, especially when plants begin to fill their pots, are big or otherwise demand lots of water. Obviously, a bigger  pot / reservoir may help.
*If the translucent container receive enough light then algae will grow on the outer layer of the potting media.  This is mainly an aesthetic concern and not a big problem indoors.
*If the medium consists of expanded clay pebbles and the plant is newly established then tipping it over may cause the spilling of the medium and plant.
*Build up of salts from fertilizer and water are not easily removed from clay substrate. Also, excess of chemicals used for pest or disease control is retained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a system?==

===Definition:===
	A system is a combination of elements forming a unitary whole.

===Examples:===
*	River or transportation system
*	System of currency
*	Comprehensive assemblage of facts, principles, and doctrines in a particular field
*	System of marking, numbering, measuring, etc.
*	University of South Carolina – composed of the main campus in Columbia and many branch campuses
*	Computer (our main interest) – includes components: memory, processor, motherboard, disk, printer, wireless adapter, etc.

Every set is not a system. In order to be a system, a set needs a sense of unity, functional relationships between its components, and/or some useful purpose. For example, a random group of items in a room would not be a system unless one of the above conditions are met.

===The elements of a system are as follows:===
*	Components: operating parts for input processing or output
*	Attributes: properties of the components that characterize the system
*	Relationships: links between components and attributes

Components are interrelated and work together toward some purpose, objective, or function. The properties and behavior of each component affect the properties of the system as a whole. For example, the speed of computer memory, the disk access time, and its capacity will all affect the overall speed of a computer. The properties of each component depend on at least one other component. For example, memory performance depends on bus speed (bandwidth). Each subset (or subsystem) of components are related in the same manner, but the system cannot be divided into independent subsets.

Often, a system has a hierarchy of components. A system is made up of components, and those components are made up of smaller components. The lower hierarchical levels are called subsystems. One example is a hard disk drive. The drive is a component of a computer, but it has multiple platters, a read/write head, a buffer, and many more smaller components.

===Systems can be classified as:===
*	Natural and man-made (human-made)
*	Physical and conceptual
*	Static and dynamic
*	Closed and open

Engineering is concerned with the economical use of limited resources in order to benefit people. This is accomplished by approaching a problem with several things in mind. In the domain of systems engineering, it is necessary to define product and system requirements as they relate to true customer needs. For example, designing an email system to meet a customer’s communication needs must be well-defined to meet those needs. Engineering also must address total systems, with all elements, from a life-cycle perspective. The overall hierarchy must be considered, including the interactions between various levels and elements at the same level. An example of this in a computer system is the memory hierarchy, composed of a 2-level cache, main memory, and virtual memory on a hard disk. It is often necessary to organize various related disciplines into one engineering effort in a timely, concurrent manner, such as separate mechanical and electrical aspects of a system. Finally, it is vital to establish a disciplined approach to a process (manage a process to get results). This includes appropriate review, evaluation, and feedback to ensure orderly and efficient progress.

===A system’s life cycle is composed of the following:===

[[Image:Compsyseng01_01.jpg]] 

An example of this process in application is as follows. Dictators in third-world countries often want to ride around in fancy cars. However, there is not much support for this preference. Filling stations are not very ubiquitous, and the economy may not support many trained mechanics for automotive repairs. So, from an engineering standpoint, this system would require much more design and money to make it viable.

[[Image:Compsyseng01_04.jpg]] 

[[Image:Compsyseng01_05.jpg]] 

===Summary of Systems Engineering:===

*	Top-down: look at the system as a whole
*	Life-cycle orientation

 1. Design, development production/construction, distribution, operation, maintenance &amp;
 support, retirement, phaseout, disposal
 2. Past emphasis on design &amp; acquisition, with little emphasis on production, operation,
 maintenance, support &amp; disposal
 3. Example: If an old computer goes to a landfill (taking up space and polluting the
 groundwater), a better design would allow the recovery of gold, lead, and other materials
 upon disposal.
*	Better definition of system requirements - Trace down customer needs to individual components
*	Interdisciplinary
 1. Systems usually require multiple disciplines
 2. Example: In the development of a computer game, a company has 3 employees – an artist,
 a musician, &amp; a programmer.

==Reliability==
===Definition===
 “Reliability is the probability of a device performing adequately for the period of time intended under the operating conditions encountered.” – NASA

===Math Model of System Reliability===
 Reliability, R(t), is the probability of a system not failing during the period [0,t].

===Experiment===
Test a large number of systems.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng17_01.jpg]] 

'''Hazard function, h(t):'''
 

'''Separate variables and integrate:'''
 

'''Summary'''
F(t) is the failure distribution function
R(t) = 1-F(t) is the reliability
f(t) is the failure density function
h(t) is the hazard function

The difference between f(t), h(t):

[[Image:Compsyseng17_03.jpg]] 

At time 2 to 3:

[[Image:Compsyseng17_02.jpg]]

===Hazard Function===

The shape of the hazard function indicates how an item ages. It has an intuitive interpretation as the amount of risk an item is subject to at a time t:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng17_04.jpg]] 

'''Increasing Hazard Function'''
This is probably the most likely situation, because items wear out or degrade with time. For example, look at mechanical items that undergo wear or fatigue, such as the rubber getting thinner on car tires over time.

'''Decreasing Hazard Function'''
In this situation, an item improves; that is, an item is less likely to fail as time passes. For example, some metals “work-harden” through continued use. Also, software may improve as bugs are removed.

'''Bathtub Shaped Failure Rate'''
This situation describes many natural systems and manufactured goods. It is a composite of 3 effects:
 *early failures due to defects
 *late failures due to wear out
 *accidents at a constant rate

[[Image:Compsyseng17_05.jpg]]
 
[[Image:Compsyseng17_06.jpg]] 

[[Image:Compsyseng17_07.jpg]] 

[[Image:Compsyseng17_08.jpg]] 

'''Human Life Characteristics'''
 
[[Image:Compsyseng17_09.jpg]] 

MTTF = 800 years corresponds to a failure rate of
	 
or 5 deaths in a population of 4000 in 1 year

===Exponential Reliability Distribution===

Recall:

This distribution is the most used reliability model. It is valid for many electronic components over most of their lifetimes, and is the basis for MIL-HDBK-217.


===Memoryless Property===

Let T = item lifetime (R.V.)
 

This is the conditional probability that a failure distribution for an item that has survived to time s is identical to a brand new item.

	 

One example of this is a fuse. A fuse fails due to a power surge, but does not weaken or degrade over time. The memoryless property, with its used-as-good-as-new assumption, is restricted in applicability. An exponential distribution is easily misapplied for the sake of simplicity:
 *statistical techniques are particularly tractable
 *can add failure rates  
 *field data often allow an estimation of only this one-parameter distribution

C provides a quick check of a data set for exponentiality

===Weibull Distribution===

Waloddi Weibull, a Swedish physicist, introduced this distribution in 1939. It is a generalization of an exponential distribution suitable for modeling lifetimes having constant, strictly increasing, and strictly decreasing hazard functions.

[[Image:Compsyseng17_10.jpg]] 

[[Image:Compsyseng17_11.jpg]] 

[[Image:Compsyseng17_12.jpg]] 

Note that the Weibull Distribution can match different phases of the bathtub curve.

'''Procedure:'''
1.	Collect the failure data.
2.	Get the best fit for the data to a Weibull distribution:

If  item is still in the burn-in phase
 *Improve supplier quality
 *Burn in the system longer
 *Be more careful while manufacturing 

At GE, light bulbs with as little as a 1% variation in their filaments lead to a 25% 
shorter lifespan.

If  attributed to random failures (accidents)
 *Make stronger components
 *Derate – use components at less than the rated value
 *Use newer technology (i.e. software control, longer-life transistors instead of vacuum tubes, etc.)
 *Make components less environmentally sensitive (i.e. better packaging)
 *NPN transistors &lt;   PNP transistors
For example, halogen and compact fluorescent bulbs use a different technology to extend life. Further, rating of incandescent long-life light bulbs may proceed as follows:

If  item is in the wear-out region
 *Use stronger, longer-lived components
 *Use newer technology, etc.
 *Use a different architecture

===Measures of System Reliability===

'''Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)''' 
This means that only about 37% of items survive more than 1 MTTF. However, this distribution has a very long tail:
	 

===Repairable Systems===
'''Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)'''
 
[[Image:Compsyseng17_14.jpg]] 

'''Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)'''
 
Note that MTBF and MTTF are often used almost interchangeably by some authors.

===Steady State Availability===

For example, if a system has only 15 minutes of downtime in a 2-year period, then
 


==Reliability Models==

For a series system:

[[Image:Compsyseng17_15.jpg]] 

The system works if A works and B works and C works and D works.
 

For example, if

	 

In terms of time,
	 

Suppose that
	 

Observe that for the constant failure rate (exponential) model, a Weibull distribution can be used:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng17_16.jpg]] 
	 
but this is much more difficult.


==Redundancy==
*Very simple
*Very appealing
*Very deceptive

Component reliability = .9

[[Image:Compsyseng18_01.jpg]] 

The system works if either component works or fails if both fail.
R = 1-P(fail)
    = 1-P(first fails &amp; second fails)
    = 1-P(first fails)P(second fails)
    = 1-P(.1)(.1)			 note independence
    = .99

===Uses of  Redundancy:===
*To increase reliability, availability
*To eliminate single points of failure
 Important in military systems
 Becoming important in commercial systems
 Important in high availability systems in which the part being repaired must be shut down
*Degradable fault tolerance


'''Another Example'''

[[Image:Compsyseng18_05.jpg]] 	 
	 
Probability of system failure = (Probability of A failing) AND (Probability of B failing)

	 

Observe that this is not exponential.

===Combined Series-Parallel Systems===

===Series-Parallel System Reduction===
Combine series or parallel component reliabilities to give an equivalent reliability and reduce the system. See the following examples:

[[Image:Compsyseng18_10.jpg]] 	 

1) reduce D, E
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_11.jpg]] 	 
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_12.jpg]] 	 

2) reduce B, C and I, F

[[Image:Compsyseng18_14.jpg]]

3) reduce II, III
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_16.jpg]]

Examine the two different configurations of the following 4-component system with identical components. The component failure rate is:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_18.jpg]] 	 
	 

'''Moral:'''
We get the greatest gain in reliability by making a system redundant at the lowest level possible. Generally, it is better to make modules redundant than to duplicate the system.

===System Design===

[[Image:Compsyseng18_19.jpg]] 	 

Make modules redundant in order to achieve reliability goals.

[[Image:Compsyseng18_20.jpg]] 	 

'''Example: AM Signal Pickup'''
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_21.jpg]] 	 

Series system:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_22.jpg]] 	 

[[Image:Compsyseng18_23.jpg]] 	 

'''Redundant Design I'''
Series-Parallel at component level:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_24.jpg]] 	 

[[Image:Compsyseng18_25.jpg]] 	 

Functional parameter will change if a component fails – probably.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_26.jpg]] 	 

'''Redundant Design II'''
Parallel Series
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_27.jpg]] 	 

[[Image:Compsyseng18_28.jpg]] 	 
Same functional parameters


Combine Outputs:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_29.jpg]] 	 

Interfaces between parallel subsystems increase complexity of design (which decreases reliability).

===Estimating Reliability===
The Parts Count reliability model assumes that the system is in series; this model underestimates the reliability of redundant systems. For redundant systems, the Parts Count model is used to estimate the reliability of the series subsystems and interfaces. Reliability is then computed while considering the redundancy structure.

Using our AM Signal Pickup example again:

Ground Mobile environment (G&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) 

Series Subsystem:
 
 


Interface :
 


System Reliability Estimate:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_30.jpg]] 	 

Simplex System:
 


Simple Redundant System (ignoring interface problem):
 
[[Image:Compsyseng18_31.jpg]] 	 

R = .9876

[[Image:Compsyseng18_32.jpg]] 	 
 

'''Note:''' In some cases the interface reliability may dominate the redundant subsystem reliability and determine the overall system reliability. In this case the simplex system may be more reliable than the redundant system.

===Non-Series/Parallel System Reduction===

[[Image:Compsyseng19_01.jpg]] 	 
 
Use decomposition:
*Find the keystone component and partition the system according to whether the keystone component is good or bad.
*The keystone component binds together the reliability structure of the system.

'''Law of Total Probability'''

Example:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_02.jpg]] 	 

Choose A as the keystone component.

If A is good:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_03.jpg]] 	 

Series/Parallel System
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_04.jpg]] 	 

If A is bad:
	 
Series System
	 

'''Convenient Notation'''

[[Image:Compsyseng19_05.jpg]] 	 

'''Notes:'''
*If the “wrong” keystone component is chosen, the component decomposition technique works, but reduction is not as extensive.
*New keystone components can be repeatedly chosen to further reduce a subsystem.

===Parallel Redundancy===

[[Image:Compsyseng19_06.jpg]] 	 
	 
This system works as long as 1 module works.
 
'''M-out-of-N System Reliability'''
 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_07.jpg]] 	 

This system works if at least M modules work.

	 

It can tolerate up to N-M failures, so

===Voting Systems===
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_08.jpg]] 	 

The Voter compares the outputs of all N modules and outputs the majority. This is called N Modular Redundancy (NMR). The NMR system will generally have an odd number of modules, so . The system works if (n+1) modules are working (it can have up to n failures), and if the voter is working.
	 
'''Simple Voter'''

[[Image:Compsyseng19_09.jpg]] 	 

'''Analog Signal or Numeric Voting'''
 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_10.jpg]] 	 

The voter compares input signals (or numeric values) and picks the middle value as its output. Normal operation is as follows:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_11.jpg]] 	 

However, error conditions may arise:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_12.jpg]] 	 

'''Note:''' Reliability calculations assume the worst case conditions:
*All modules fail in the same logical direction
*There are no compensating failures (i.e. one module becomes stuck at 1, while another is stuck at 0)

===Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)===

[[Image:Compsyseng19_13.jpg]] 	 
	 
Example:
 


'''Comparison of NMR System Reliabilities'''
 
Measure time in units of MTTF.

The following figure depicts the reliability of an NMR system for increasing N:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng19_14.jpg]] 	 

Observe:

	 

Extra hardware increases reliability for the short term but once redundancy is used up there is simply more hardware to fail and reliability decreases quickly.

For a TMR system:

	 

For redundant systems MTTF may not be an appropriate measure of reliability. It is necessary to look at R(t) in relation to mission time.

===Cascading TMR===
	
[[Image:Compsyseng20_01.jpg]] 

A voter gives a simple point of failure, so a design may triplicate the voter (TMR).
	
[[Image:Compsyseng20_02.jpg]] 

System reliability is determined by 3 parallel modules in the first stage, a voter in the last stage, and a parallel voter-module in the intermediate stage.

[[Image:Compsyseng20_03.jpg]] 

===NMR Systems===

Failed modules accumulate in an NMR system until they become the majority and the system fails. The system life can be extended by purging all of the failed modules. This can be accomplished through Hybrid Redundancy (using spares), or through Adaptive Voting (also called Change Voting). In essence, the failed module(s) must be detected first.

[[Image:Compsyseng20_04.jpg]] 
 
This system has the following attributes:
*N+S modules (S spares)
*Disagreement Detector compares the voted output with the module outputs
*Switch selects the outputs from N modules to give to the voter
*If a module fails, the Disagreement Detector tells the switch to replace the failed module with a spare one

This configuration is often used with TMR systems. If more than a few spares are switched, the complexity increases to a point where its reliability dominates the system reliability.

===N-ary Programming (TMR)===
Say we have 3 programmers write code and then vote on the results. In a TMR system, each program could execute on a completely different set of hardware. However, software is labor-intensive and very expensive to produce. N-ary programming significantly increases this cost, does not protect against specification errors, and introduces timing and coordination problems since each of the programs is not identical to the others.
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng20_05.jpg]] 

===Adaptive Voting===
In adaptive voting, the voted output is compared with the module outputs. When a module fails, it is removed along with one other module (this is to keep an odd number of modules). The voter is then changed to select the majority of the remaining modules. This approach can be combined with hybrid redundancy in order to switch good modules back in. Voting (particularly TMR) is used in many fault-tolerant, very-high-reliability computer systems.

===Standby Redundancy===

[[Image:Compsyseng20_06.jpg]] 

*Operate with A
*Switch to B when A fails
*A and B are '''&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;''' independent

In general, A and B can be different (i.e. A can be an on-line power source while B can be a generator). It should be noted that B can fail while in its standby mode, or the switch could fail. Examine the following simple case. Assume:

	 

Reliability is as follows:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng20_07.jpg]] 

	 
Recall that the above is the law of total probability.

	 

Therefore,

[[Image:Compsyseng20_08.jpg]] 
	 
A sequence of failures forms a process that starts over each time a device fails and a new one is switched in. This is called a renewal process. The time between failures is exponentially distributed,   where X is a random variable denoting the time between failures. Suppose we have n systems as follows:
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng20_09.jpg]] 

Recall that for a Poisson process,
i)	Events in non-overlapping intervals are independent
ii)	P(event in small interval h) =  
	P(no event in h) =  
iii)	The time between events, X, is exponentially distributed,  
iv)	The number of events in an interval T,n(T) has the Poisson distribution  .

Also recall (for iii) that
	  

Furthermore,

[[Image:Compsyseng20_10.jpg]] 

As you might have deduced, this sequence of failures is a Poisson process. Therefore, 

	 

For an n component system:

	 

As an overview, compare the following for 2 units:
*Standby Redundancy:  
*Parallel Redundancy:  
*Simplex System:  

 
*Standby Redundancy:  
*Parallel Redundancy:  
*Simplex System: R = p

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Markov Models==

State diagrams describe the behavior of a system. They describe all possible states of a system (object in UML) and how the state changes as a result of events that reach the system (object).

For example,

[[Image:Compsyseng02_01.jpg]] 
 
It should be noted that Markov Models treat state transitions as a stochastic process.

Let each state be defined by a random variable.
The set of random variables {x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} forms a Markov chain if the probability that the next value (state) is x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; depends only on the present value (state) x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and not on any previous values. The effect of the entire previous history on future behavior is summed up in the current state. For “discrete time” Markov chains, transitions can only occur at the integers 1,2,3… For “continuous time” Markov chains, transitions can occur at any time. This is important since the past history is specified entirely by the present state, and we cannot also specify how long a process has been in the present state.

Analytically:
P(x(t&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;) = x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; | x(t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, x(t&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;) = x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, … x(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = P(x(t&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;) = x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; | x(t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
where
t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; … &lt; t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; t&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are in some discrete state space.

Consider the discrete time Markov chain:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng02_02.jpg]] 

Observe: the sum of probabilities of leaving each city is 1.

P(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = j | x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; = i&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;) = P(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = j | x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; = i&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;).

P(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = j | x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; = i&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a one-step transition probability. The probability goes from one state E=i at step n-1 to state E=j at step n.

Let P&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(n) = probability that a system goes from state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to state E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; in n-1 steps.
Then,  is the probability that the system goes from state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to state E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; in one step and then goes from state E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; to state E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; in n-1 steps. This is called the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.

Let P(n) be a matrix. Each entry is P&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(n). If this is a matrix of n-step transition probabilities, then

	 		(called homogenous if this is independent of n)

Define P&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = P(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = j | x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; = i) as the probability that a system goes to the next state E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; given in state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. This is called the set of one-step transition probabilities.

Example:
	P&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, P&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = ¾ , P&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt; = ¼ , P&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ¾ 

	In matrix form:
	 
Let π&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = P(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = j) be the probability that the system is in state j at step n. In our example,
	 

The probability in state j at step n+1 is the probability in state i at step n and goes to state j in one step.

In vector form:
	 

In particular,
	 

For example: Let Π(0) = [0,1,0], starting in Columbia.

	 

After a long time, let

	 

Therefore,
	
	 

Example:

	 

Observe:

	 

The sum of (1) and (2) is negative (3), so therefore there is a linear dependence between the equations, and thus, there is no unique solution. We also know that π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 (i.e. the system must be in some state). This is called a normalizing condition.

Now solve:

	 

Observe:

	 

This is like flipping a coin, where r = probability of heads and 1-r = probability of tails. So, P(sequence of exactly m heads) = r&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; (1-r).

===How long does a process remain in a state i?===
Suppose the process enters state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the probability of remaining in state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; at the next step is P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;. The probability that the process leaves E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; at the next step is 1-P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;. Each time step is independent, so P(system remains in state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for exactly m additional time steps given that it has just entered state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) = (1-P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;) P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the process stays for m time steps with a probability of m*( P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; …P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaves the state on the m+1 step.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng02_03.jpg]] 

===Geometric distribution===
The average time in state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is E(time in state E):

	 

Now,  , therefore:

	 

Therefore,

	 

In short, the average time a process stays in a state before leaving is the inverse of the probability that it leaves.

Assume a watch state i for k steps and also that the system does not change state. What is the probability that the process does not leave the state on the next step?
Let y = the steps to the first departure.

	 

Thus the process is memory less – as we knew.


===Continuous Time Markov Chains===

P(x(t&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;) = j | x(t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; … x(t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = i&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = P(x(t&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;) = j | x(t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)

Recall that Markov chains are memoryless, so a transition does not depend on how long a process is in a given state.

Let τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = the amount of time in a state i. P(τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; s+t | τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; s) = h(t), which is only a function of t (not s). The function shows how long a process is in a state.

	 

Thus, exponential is the only continuous distribution that satisfies this.
Again, if we set s,t = 0, then P(τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;0) = 1, and

	 


===Defining the time-dependent transition probability===

	 
Now, consider the times s ≤ u ≤ t.
To get from state E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; at time s to E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; at time t, a process must pass through some state at time u. Therefore,

	 
This is the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, and is exactly analogous to the discrete case, but is difficult to use directly.

Recall that  

 

In the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, substitute t+h for t:

	 

Divide by h, take the limit as h approaches 0, u approaches t:

	 
This is called Kolmogorov’s forward equation.

Also,
	 
is Kolmogorov’s backward equation.

If time homogeneous transition probabilities  do not depend on initial time t but only on interval h, then q&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = q&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and = P&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(h), then
	 

 

State transition probabilities and initial distribution determine all properties of a Markov chain. Observe:

 
Divide by h, take the limit as h approaches 0, v approaches t:

 .

If time homogeneous:

 


===State classifications===

Recall that  

A state is transient if there is a positive probability that a system will not return to that state. Let X&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt; = number of visits to state i starting at state j. The expected value of X&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;, E(X&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;) is  

A state i is transient if E(X&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;) is finite. This implies that P&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;(n) approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.

A state i is recurrent if and only if starting from state j, a process returns to state i with a probability of 1. Also,   is infinite.

Consider the time it takes to reach a state i from state j for a recurrent chain.
Let f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(n) = probability of the first visit to j from i in n steps.
Let f&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;(n) = probability of the first return from i to i in n steps.
Then, the probability of ever visiting j starting from state i is:
	 
State i is recurrent if f&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, and transient if f&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1. If f&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, then the mean recurrence time is   A state is called recurrent non-null if  is finite, and recurrent null if   is infinite.

For a recurrent state i,   The period of state i,  , is the greatest common divisor of a set of positive integers n such that   A system is aperiodic if  = 1, and periodic if  &gt; 1.

[[Image:Compsyseng02_04.jpg]] 
	 
A system is absorbing if and only if P&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.

[[Image:Compsyseng02_05.jpg]] 

A Markov chain is irreducible if every state can be reached from every other state in a finite number of steps;   All states of an irreducible Markov chain are of the same type. In an aperiodic Markov chain, all states are aperiodic. If one state is periodic with period d, then all are periodic with the same period d.

===Continuous Time Markov Chains===
 
Let  = random variable = time in state i.
A Markov property means the probability of a transition cannot depend on how long the system has been in a state.

	   

Now for s=0, and   we have
	 

s = t = 0 again requires
	  

Now,
	 

Therefore, the time in state is exponentially distributed with parameter which may depend on the state.

We have seen that   = time in state i and that  
Let t be a very small increment of time h:
	 

This last equation is the probability that a system leaves a state in the next increment of time h. This can be expressed in a Taylor series:

	 

Number the states 0,1… Let  = probability of transition to a higher numbered state (birth). Let  = probability of transition to a lower numbered state (death). Only allow transitions to the next higher or lower numbered state (or stay in the same state). This is called a birth-death process.

[[Image:Compsyseng02_06.jpg]] 

Let P(n=k,t) = probability of being in state k at time t. Consider how a process can get into state n=k at time t+h.

For births: must have been in state n=k-1 and a birth occurred
	 
For deaths: must have been in state n=k+1 and a death occurred
	 
If no births and no deaths: must have been in state n=k at time t
	 

==Balance Equations==
 

===Equilibrium Balance Equations===
 

===Flow Balance===
The equilibrium balance equations can be intuitively constructed by inspection from the state transition rate diagram below.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng02_07.jpg]] 

This is similar to the state transition diagram we have already seen. In equilibrium, the rate of flow of probability into a state must equal the rate of flow of probability out of that state. Hence

	 

===Solving the Balance Equations===
 

The quantity   is called the “traffic intensity” and is usually denoted by  
	 
Recall that the queue will be unstable if jobs arrive faster than they can be served. Thus  

As we will see   determines most of the properties of interest in the queue. Note that it is determined by the ratio of the arrival and service rates and not their absolute values. Queues with equal traffic intensities can be expected to have similar properties even though their respective arrival or service rates may be quite different.

The constant P(0) is determined using the normalizing requirement, as shown below:
	 

Note the similarity of the last equation to a geometric distribution:
	 

This is the probability that there are k jobs in the queue and is shown below:

[[Image:Compsyseng02_08.jpg]] 
 
The probability that there is at least 1 job in the queue is  
This is the utilization of the server, the probability that it is busy.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng02_09.jpg]] 

==Number in the Queue==
The average number of jobs in the queue is 
 

The sum is evaluated by using the following trick: note that
 

Now since the sum of a derivative is the derivative of the sum,
 
This is shown below as   increases from 0 to 1:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng02_10.jpg]] 

The probability that there are more than some number r of jobs in the queue is
 
This is shown below for several values of  
 
[[Image:Compsyseng02_11.jpg]] 

Note that P(n≥r) decreases geometrically in  . Recall also that   is the utilization of the server. Thus for lightly utilized servers (small  ) the likelihood that there are many jobs in the queue is small. For heavily utilized servers (  near 1) the likelihood that there are a lot of jobs waiting to be served is much higher.

Let T = the average waiting time, T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = the waiting time for arrival n with n-1 customers in the system, x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = the service requirement of the ith customer (i = 1,2,…,n), x&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = the remaining service for the customer in service, and x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = the service requirement of n+1 customers.

__TOC__
==Introduction==
In reviewing the four central problems in data management, (capture, storage, retrieval, and exchange) the typical user of XML encounters recurring fundamental structural patterns that apply to all sorts of data throughout the ''storage'' and ''exchange'' phases. These patterns recur consistently because their use transcends the particular contexts in which the underlying data are processed. We call these patterns &quot;data structures&quot; (or datatypes).

In this section, we discuss a few of the most fundamental &quot;basic data structures&quot; and explain why they are useful, as well as how to work with them using XML.

We start our introduction with a simple example. Consider an ordinary grocery shopping list for a single-person household.

'''Introductory Shopping List Example:'''

    Andy's shopping list:
    * eggs
    * cough syrup(pick up for granny)
    * orange juice  
    * bread
    * laundry detergent **don't forget this**

When analyzing aspects of the information contained in this shopping list, we can make some basic generalizations:

* '''Portability:''' the shopping list can be represented and transferred easily. If necessary, it could be stored in a database and processed by custom-designed software, but it could just as easily be written on a scrap of paper;
* '''Comprehensibility:''' the shopping list is readily understood by its intended audience (in this instance, the sole person who wrote the list) and therefore needs no additional information or structure in order to be immediately usable; 
* '''Adaptability:''' if any changes become necessary (such as additions or removals to the list) there is an existing and well-known methodology for accomplishing this (e.g., in the case of a handwritten list, simply write down new entries or cross out unwanted entries).

=== The fundamental concept of basic data structures ===

Given that we have the previous example for background, we can now introduce the fundamental concept of &quot;basic data structures&quot;.

&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Information icon.svg|50px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The concept of &quot;basic data structures&quot; describes the fundamental conventions we use to ''store'' our data, so that we can more easily ''exchange'' our data. When we follow these fundamental conventions, we help to ensure the ''portability'', ''comprehensibility'' and ''adaptability'' of information.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Basic data structures defined ==
Now that we have introduced our concept of data structures, we can start with some concrete definitions, and then review those definitions in the context of our shopping list example. 

=== Overview of &quot;core&quot; data structures ===

The following terms define some &quot;core&quot; data structures&lt;ref&gt;An important note: the basic terms used here are generalizations. Although they may coincide with terms used in specific software, specific programming languages, or specific applications, these are not intended as technically precise definitions. The concepts described here are presented to help emphasize the context-neutral principle of interoperability in XML.&lt;/ref&gt; that we use throughout this chapter. This list is ordered in ascending degrees of complexity:
* '''SimpleBoolean''': Any value capable of being expressed as either &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;.
* '''SimpleString''': A contiguous sequence of characters, including both alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric.
* '''SimpleSequence''': An enumeration of items generally accessible by numeric indexing.
* '''Name-value pair''': An arbitrary singular name attached to a singular value.
* '''SimpleDictionary''': An enumeration of items generally accessible by alphanumeric indexing.
* '''SimpleTable''': An ordered arrangement of columns and rows. A SimpleTable can be classified as a &quot;composite&quot; data structure (e.g., SimpleSequence where each item in the sequence is a single SimpleDictionary).
&lt;!--* '''SimpleWorkbook''' ___blank--&gt;

An important point to remember while reviewing these &quot;core&quot; data structures is that they are ''elemental'' and ''complementary''. That is, the core structures, when used in combination, can form even more complex structures. Once the reader comes to understand this fact, it will become apparent that there is no conceivable application or data specification that cannot be wholly described in XML using nothing more than these &quot;core&quot; data structures.

&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Information icon.svg|50px]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Once we understand the &quot;core&quot; data structures, we can use them in combination to represent any conceivable kind of structured information.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Now review the &quot;Introductory Shopping List Example&quot; above. When we compare it with the &quot;core&quot; data structures that we've just defined, we can make some fairly straightforward observations:

* The entire shopping list cannot be represented using a SimpleBoolean data structure, because the information is more complex than either &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;.
* The entire shopping list ''can'' be represented using a SimpleString. 
* There may be reasons why we would not want to use a SimpleString to represent the entire shopping list. For example, we might want to transfer the list into a database or other software application and then be able to sort, query, duplicate or otherwise process ''individual items'' on the list. Treating the entire list as a SimpleString would therefore complicate our processing requirements.

=== SimpleString ===

'''Different ways to represent a SimpleString in XML:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;Example&gt;
    &lt;String note=&quot;This XML attribute contains a SimpleString.&quot;&gt;
    This XML Text Node represents a SimpleString.
    &lt;/String&gt;

    &lt;!-- This XML comment contains a SimpleString --&gt;
    &lt;![CDATA[ This XML CDATA section contains a SimpleString. ]]&gt;
&lt;/Example&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== SimpleSequence ===

'''Different ways to represent a SimpleSequence in XML:'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;Example&gt;
    &lt;!-- use a single XML attribute with a space-delimited list of items --&gt;
    &lt;ShoppingList items=&quot;bread eggs milk juice&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;!-- use a single XML attribute with a semicolon-delimited list of items 
         (this allows us to add items with spaces in them) --&gt;
    &lt;ShoppingList items=&quot;bread;cough syrup;milk;juice;laundry detergent&quot;  /&gt;

    &lt;!-- yet another way (but not necessarily a good way) 
         using multiple XML attributes --&gt;
    &lt;ShoppingList item00=&quot;bread&quot; item01=&quot;eggs&quot; item02=&quot;cough syrup&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;!-- yet another way 
         using XML child elements --&gt;
    &lt;ShoppingList&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;eggs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;milk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cough syrup&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/ShoppingList&gt;
&lt;/Example&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Name-value pair ===
=== SimpleDictionary ===
=== SimpleTable ===

====Side-by-side examples ====

'''SimpleTable (XML_Elem):'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;item&gt;eggs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;getfor&gt;andy&lt;/getfor&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;item&gt;milk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;getfor&gt;andy&lt;/getfor&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;item&gt;laundry detergent&lt;/item&gt;&lt;getfor&gt;andy&lt;/getfor&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;item&gt;cough syrup&lt;/item&gt;&lt;getfor&gt;granny&lt;/getfor&gt;&lt;notes&gt;try to get grape flavor&lt;/notes&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''SimpleTable (XML_Attr):'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr item=&quot;eggs&quot;         getfor=&quot;andy&quot;   notes=&quot;&quot;    /&gt;
    &lt;tr item=&quot;milk&quot;         getfor=&quot;andy&quot;   notes=&quot;&quot;    /&gt;
    &lt;tr item=&quot;laundry detergent&quot;  getfor=&quot;andy&quot;   notes=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
    &lt;tr item=&quot;cough syrup&quot;  getfor=&quot;granny&quot; notes=&quot;try to get grape flavor&quot;    /&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''SimpleTable (XML_Mixed):'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;item getfor=&quot;andy&quot; &gt;eggs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;item getfor=&quot;andy&quot; &gt;milk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;item getfor=&quot;andy&quot; &gt;laundry detergent&lt;/item&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;/notes&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;item getfor=&quot;granny&quot;&gt;cough syrup&lt;/item&gt;&lt;notes&gt;try to get grape flavor&lt;/notes&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Basic data structures in programming ==
To further illustrate how basic data structures apply in many different contexts, some of the basic data structures enumerated previously are examined and compared here in the context of computer programming.

For the first part of the comparison, we examine the generic terminology against that used commonly in programming languages:

* '''SimpleBoolean''': is commonly called a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; and can usually take the values &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, or other values, depending on the language.
* '''SimpleString''': commonly called a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;stringBuffer&lt;/code&gt;.
* '''SimpleSequence''': numerically indexed variables in programming are commonly represented with an &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt;.
* '''Name-value pair''': (explained in more detail below)
* '''SimpleDictionary''': these are commonly represented with a &lt;code&gt;dictionary&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code&gt;associative array&lt;/code&gt;.
* '''SimpleTable''': (explained in more detail below)

== Technical considerations ==
Now that we've introduced and discussed specific examples of the basic data structures, there are a few technical considerations that apply to all of the data structures, and are particularly important to those who may be responsible for implementing and designing XML schemas to deal with specific implementation scenarios.

* '''Exact terminology depends on context:''' Although the &quot;basic&quot; structures described here apply to many different scenarios, the terms used to describe them can overlap or conflict. For example, the term &quot;SimpleSequence&quot; as used here closely coincides with what is called an &quot;array&quot; in many programming languages. Similarly, the term &quot;SimpleDictionary&quot; is shorthand for what some programming languages call an &quot;associative array&quot;. Although this close correlation is intentional, one must always remember that the specific nuances of an application or programming language will require additional attention. Sometimes minor conflicts or discrepancies arise when one digs into the details for any specific data structure in any given project or technology.

* '''Basic structures are flexible concepts:''' Structures can be defined in terms of one another, and some structures can be applied recursively. For example, one could easily define a SimpleSequence using a SimpleString along with some basic assumptions. (e.g., a SimpleSequence is a string of alphanumeric characters where each item in the sequence is separated by one or more whitespace characters: &quot;eggs bread butter milk&quot;).

* '''Abstract structures tend to hide tricky details:''' For example, the term &quot;SimpleString&quot; describes the abstract notion of a sequence of characters (e.g., &quot;ISBN 0-596-00327-7&quot;). The abstract notion is fairly intuitive and uncomplicated. Nevertheless, the precise notation used to ''implement'' that abstract notion, and represent it in real-live working code is a different matter entirely. Different programming languages and different environments may use different conventions for representing the same &quot;string&quot;. Because of this variability, one can also recognize that the abstract notion of a &quot;SimpleString&quot; in XML is also subject to differing representations, based on the needs of any given project.&lt;!--'''Platform-specific considerations:'''--&gt;

&lt;!-- talk about benefits to be gained from &quot;canonical&quot; representation ;; talk about difficulties in &quot;unifying&quot; multiple non-normalized representations ;; talk about interop and data transport layers --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Assessment that Enhances Motivation and Student Confidence==
Studies on testing and learning conducted more than 20 years ago demonstrated that tests promote learning and that more frequent tests are more effective than less frequent tests (Dempster &amp; Perkins, 1993)&lt;ref&gt;Dempster, F. N. &amp; Perkins, P. G. (1993).  Revitalizating classroom assessment: Using tests to promote learning. ''Journal of Instructional Psychology, 20''(3) 197-203.&lt;/ref&gt;. Frequent smaller tests encourage continuous effort rather than last minute cramming and may also reduce test anxiety because the consequences of errors are reduced. College students report preferring more frequent testing than infrequent testing (Bangert-Downs, Kulik, Kulik, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Bangert-Downs, R. L.,Kulik, J. A., &amp; Kulik, C-L, C. (1991). Effects of frequent classroom testing. ''Journal of Educational Research, 85''(2), 89-99.&lt;/ref&gt;. More recent research indicates that teachers’ assessment purpose and beliefs, the type of assessment selected, and the feedback given contributes to the assessment climate in the classroom which influences students’ confidence and motivation. The use of self-assessment is also important in establishing a positive assessment climate. 

===Teachers’ Purposes and Beliefs===
Student motivation can be enhanced when the purpose of assessment is promoting student learning and this is clearly communicated to students by what teachers say and do (Harlen, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Harlen, W. The role of assessment in developing motivation for learning. In J. Gardner (Ed.). ''Assessment and learning'' (pp. 61-80). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;. This approach to assessment is associated with what the psychologist Carol Dweck (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (2000) ''Self-theories: Their role in motivation, personality, and development.''  Philadelphia, PA:  Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; calls an '''incremental view of ability''' or intelligence. An incremental view assumes that ''ability increases whenever an individual learns more.'' This means that effort is valued because effort leads to knowing more and therefore having more ability. Individuals with an incremental view also ask for help when needed and respond well to constructive feedback as the primary goal is increased learning and mastery. In contrast, a '''fixed view of ability''' assumes that some people have more ability than others and nothing much can be done to change that.  Individuals with a fixed view of ability often ''view effort in opposition to ability'' (“smart people don’t have to study”) and so do not try as hard, and are less likely to ask for help as that indicates that they are not smart. While there are individual differences in students’ beliefs about their views of intelligence, teachers’ beliefs and classroom practices influence students’ perceptions and behaviors. 

Teachers with an incremental view of intelligence communicate to students that the goal of learning is mastering the material and figuring things out. Assessment is used by these  teachers to understand what students know so they can decide whether to move to the next topic, re-teach the entire class, or provide remediation for a few students. Assessment also helps students’ understand their own learning and demonstrate their competence. Teachers with these views say things like, “We are going to practice over and over again. That’s how you get good. And you’re going to make mistakes. That’s how you learn.” (Patrick, Anderman, Ryan, Edelin, Midgley, 2001, p. 45)&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, H., Anderman, L., Ryan, A., Endelin, K., Midgley, C. (2001). Teachers' communications of goal orientations to students. ''Elementary School Journal, 102''(1), 35-58.&lt;/ref&gt;.   

In contrast, teachers with a fixed view of ability are more likely to believe that the goal of learning is doing well on tests especially outperforming others. These teachers are more likely to say things that imply fixed abilities e.g., “This test will determine what your math abilities are,” or that stress the importance of interpersonal competition, “We will have speech competition and the top person will compete against all the other district schools and last year the winner got a big award and their photo in the paper.” When teachers stress interpersonal competition some students may be motivated but there can only a few winners so there are many more students who know they have no change of winning. Another problem with interpersonal competition in assessment is that the focus can become winning rather than understanding the material.

Teachers who communicate to their students that ability is incremental and that the goal of assessment is promoting learning rather that ranking students, awarding prizes to those who did very well, or catching those who did not pay attention, are likely to enhance students’ motivation. 

===Choosing Assessments===
The choice of assessment task also influence students’ motivation and confidence.
* Assessments that have clear criteria that students understand and can meet rather than assessments that pit students against each other in interpersonal competition enhances motivation (Black &amp; Wiliam, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Black, P.,  &amp;  Wiliam,D. (2006). Assessment for learning in the classroom. In J. Gardner (Ed.).  ''Assessment and learning''(pp. 9-25).  Thousand Oaks, CA:Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is consistent with the point we made in the previous section about the importance of focusing on enhancing learning for all students rather than ranking students.
* Meaningful assessment tasks enhance student motivation. Students often want to know why they have to do something and teachers need to provide meaningful answers. For example, a teacher might say, “You need to be able to calculate the area of a rectangle because if you want new carpet you need to know how much carpet is needed and how much it would cost.” Well designed performance tasks are often more meaningful to students than selected response tests so students will work harder to prepare for them. 
* Providing choices of assessment tasks can enhance student sense of autonomy and motivation according to self determination theory (see Chapter 6).  Kym, the 6th grade teacher whose story began this chapter, reports that giving students choices was very helpful. Another middle school social studies teacher Aaron, gives his students a choice of performance tasks at the end of the unit on the Bill of Rights. Students have to demonstrate specified key ideas but can do that by making up a board game, presenting a brief play, composing a rap song etc. Aaron reports that students work much harder on this performance assessment which allows them to use their strengths than previously when he did not provide any choices and gave a more traditional assignment. Measurement experts caution that a danger of giving choices is that the assessment tasks are no longer equivalent and so the reliability of scoring is reduced so it is particularly important to use well designed scoring rubrics. Fourth, assessment tasks should be challenging but achievable with reasonable effort (Elliott, McGregor &amp; Thrash, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, A., McGregor, H., &amp; Thrash, T. (2004). The need for competence. In E. Deci &amp; R. Ryan (Eds.), ''Handbook of self-determination research'' (pp. 361-388). Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is often hard for beginning teachers to do who may give assessment tasks that are too easy or too hard because they have to learn to match their assessment to the skills of their students. 

===Providing Feedback===
When the goal is assessment for learning, providing constructive feedback that helps students know what they do and do not understand as well as encouraging them to learn from their errors is fundamental. Effective feedback should be given ''as soon as possible,'' as the longer the delay between students’ work and feedback the longer students will continue to have some misconceptions. Also, delays reduce the relationship between students’ performance and the feedback, as students can forget what they were thinking during the assessment. Effective feedback should also ''inform students clearly'' what they did well and what needs modification. General comments just as “good work- A”, or “needs improvement” do not help students understand how to improve their learning. Giving feedback to students using well designed scoring rubrics helps clearly communicate strengths and weaknesses. Obviously grades are often necessary, but teachers can minimize the focus by placing the grade after the comments or on the last page of a paper. It can also be helpful to allow students to keep their grades private making sure when returning assignments that the grade is not prominent (e.g., by not using red ink on the top page) and by never asking students to read their scores aloud in class. Some student choose to share their grades, but that should be their decision, not their teacher's.  

When grading, teachers often become angry at the mistakes that student make. It is easy for teachers to think something like, “With all the effort I put into teaching and this student couldn’t even be bothered to follow the directions or spell check!” Many experienced teachers believe that communicating their anger is not helpful, so rather than saying, “How dare you turn in such shoddy work,” they rephrase it as, “I am disappointed that your work on this assignment does not meet the standards set” (Sutton, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. E. (2004).  Emotional regulation goals and strategies of teachers. ''Social Psychology of Education,7''(4), 379-398.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Research evidence also suggests that comments such as “You are so smart” for a high quality performance can be counterproductive. This is surprising to many teachers but if students are told they are smart when the produce a good product, then if they do poorly on the next assignment the conclusion must be they are “not smart.”  More effective feedback focuses on positive aspects of the task (not the person), as well as strategies, and effort. The focus of the feedback should relate to the criteria set by the teacher and how improvements can be made. 	

When the teacher and student are from different racial/ethnic backgrounds providing feedback that enhances motivation and confidence but also includes criticism can be particularly challenging because the students of color have historical reasons to distrust negative comments from a White teacher. Research by Cohen Steele, Ross (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G., Steele, C., &amp; Ross, L. The mentor's dilemma: Providing critical feedback across the racial divide. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25''(10), 1302-1318.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that “wise” feedback from teachers needs three components: positive comments, criticisms, and an assurance that the teacher believes the student can reach higher standards.

===Self and Peer Assessment===
In order to reach a learning goal, students need to understand the meaning of the goal, the steps necessary to achieve a goal, and if they are making satisfactory progress towards that goal
(Sadler, 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, R. (1989). Formative assessment and the design of instructional systems. ''Instructional Science, 18''(2), 1573-1592.&lt;/ref&gt;. This involves self assessment and recent research has demonstrated that well designed self assessment can enhance student learning and motivation. For self assessment to be effective, students need explicit criteria such as those in an analytical scoring rubric. These criteria are either provided by the teacher or developed by the teacher in collaboration with students. Because students seem to find it easier to understand criteria for assessment tasks if they can examine other students’ work along side their own, self assessment often involves peer assessment. An example of a strategy used by teachers involves asking students to use “traffic lights” to indicate of their confidence in their assignment or homework. Red indicates that were unsure of their success, orange that they were partially unsure, and green that they were confident of their success. The students who labeled their own work as orange and green worked in mixed groups to evaluate their own work while the teacher worked with the students who had chosen red.

If self and peer assessment is used it is particularly important that the teachers establish a classroom culture for assessment that is based on incremental views of ability and learning goals. If the classroom atmosphere focuses on interpersonal competition, students have incentives in self and peer assessment to inflate their own evaluations (and perhaps those of their friends) because there are limited rewards for good work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Adjusting Instruction Based on Assessment===
Using assessment information to adjust instruction is fundamental to the concept of assessment for learning. Teachers make these adjustments “in the moment” during classroom instruction as well as during reflection and planning periods. Teachers use the information they gain from questioning and observation to adjust their teaching during classroom instruction. If students cannot answer a question, the teacher may need to rephrase the question, probe understanding of prior knowledge, or change the way the current idea is being considered.  It is important for teachers to learn to identify when only one or two students are struggling with the concept so need individual help, and when a large proportion of the class is struggling so whole group intervention is needed.  

After the class is over, effective teachers spend time analyzing how well the lessons went, what students did and did not seem to understand, and what needs to be done the next day. Evaluation of student work also provides important information for teachers. If many students are confused about a similar concept the teacher needs to re-teach it and consider new ways of helping students understand the topic. If the majority of students complete the tasks very quickly and well, the teacher might decide that the assessment was not challenging enough. Sometimes teachers become dissatisfied with the kinds of assessments they have assigned when they are grading – perhaps because they realize there was too much emphasis on lower level learning, that the directions were not clear enough, or the scoring rubric needed modification. Teachers who believe that assessment data provides information about their own teaching and that they can find ways to influence student learning have high teacher efficacy or beliefs that they can make a difference in students’ lives.  In contrast, teachers who think that student performance is mostly due to fixed student characteristics or the homes they come from (e.g., “no wonder she did so poorly considering what her home life is like”) have low teacher efficacy (Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy, &amp; Hoy, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Tschannen-Moran, M., Woolfolk-Hoy, A., &amp; Hoy, W. K. (1998). Teacher efficacy: Its meaning and measure. ''Review of Educational Research, 68,'' 202-248.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Communication with Parents and Guardians===
Clear communication with parents about classroom assessment is important – but often  difficult for beginning teachers. The same skills that are needed to communicate effectively with students are also needed when communicating with parents and guardians. Teachers need to be able to explain to parents the purpose of the assessment, why they selected this assessment technique, and what the criteria for success are. Some teachers send home newsletters monthly or at the beginning of a major assessment task explaining the purpose and nature of the task, any additional support that is needed (e.g. materials, library visits), and due dates.  Some parents will not be familiar with performance assessments or the use of self and peer assessment so teachers need to take time to explain these approaches carefully. 

Many school districts now communicate though websites that have mixtures of public information available to all parents in the class (e.g. curriculum and assessment details) as well information restricted to the parents or guardians of specific students (e.g., the attendance and grades). Teachers report this is helpful as parents have access to their child’s performance immediately and when necessary, can talk to their child and teacher quickly. 

The recommendations we provided above on the type of feedback that should be given to students also apply when talking to parents. That is, the focus should be on students’ performance on the task, what was done well and what needs work, rather than general comments about how “smart” or “weak” the child is.  If possible, comments should focus on strategies that the child uses well or needs to improve (e.g. reading test questions carefully, organization in a large project). When the teacher is white and the student or parents are minority trust can be an issue so using “wise” feedback when talking to parents may help. 

===Action Research: Studying yourself and your students===
Assessment for learning emphasizes devising and conducting assessment data in order to improve teaching and learning and so is related to action research (also called teacher research).  In [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 1: The Changing Teaching Profession and You|Chapter 1]], we described '''action research''' as studies conducted by teachers of their own students or their own work. Action research can lead to decisions that improve a teacher’s own teaching or the teaching of colleagues. Kym, the teacher we described at the beginning of [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 10: Teacher-Made Assessment Strategies|this chapter]], conducted action research in her own classroom as she identified a problem of poor student motivation and achievement, investigated solutions during the course on motivation, tried new approaches, and observed the resulting actions. In recent years, action research has become increasingly valued by educators as a way of learning about and improving their own work. It is so important, in fact, that we offer a more complete discussion of it at the end of this book, in [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 13: The Reflective Practitioner|Chapter 13]].

====Cycles of Planning, Acting and Reflecting====
Action research is usually described as a cyclical process with the following stages (Mertler, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Mertler, C. A. (2006). ''Action research: Teachers as researchers in the classroom.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Planning Stage''' Planning has three components. First, it involves ''identifying and defining a problem.'' Problems sometimes start with some ill defined unease or feeling that something is wrong and it can take time to identify the problem clearly so that it becomes a researchable question. The next step, is reviewing the related literature and this may occur within a class or workshop that the teachers are attending. Teachers may also explore the literature on their own or in teacher study groups. The third step is developing a research plan. The research plan includes what kind of data will be collected (e.g. student test scores, observation of one or more students, as well as how and when it will be collected (e.g. from files, in collaboration with colleagues, in Spring or Fall semester).
  
* '''Acting Stage''' During this stage the teacher is ''collecting and analyzing data''.  The data collected and the analyses do not need to be complex because action research, to be effective, has to be manageable.  

* '''Developing an Action Plan'''  In this stage the teacher develops a ''plan to make changes'' and ''implements the changes.'' This is the action component of action research and it is important that teachers document their actions carefully so that they can communicate them to others.  

* '''Communicating and Reflection''' An important component of all research is ''communicating information.'' Results can be shared with colleagues in the school or district, in an action research class at the local college, at conferences, or in journals for teachers. Action research can also involve students as active participants and if this is the case, communication may include students and parents. Communicating with others helps refine ideas and so typically aids in reflection. During reflection teachers/researchers ask such questions as, “What did I learn?” “What should I have done differently?” “What should I do next?” Questions such as these often lead to a new cycle of action research beginning with planning and then moving to the other steps.  

====Ethical issues—privacy and voluntary consent====
Teachers are accustomed to collecting students’ test scores, data about performances, and descriptions of behaviors as an essential component of teaching. However, if teachers are conducting action research and they plan to collect data that will be shared outside the school community then permission from parents (or guardians) and students must be obtained in order to protect the privacy of students and their families. Typically permission is obtained by an informed consent form that summarizes the research, describes the data that will be collected, indicates that participation is voluntary, and provides a guarantee of confidentiality or anonymity (Hubbard &amp; Power, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, R. S., &amp; Power, B. M. (2003). ''The art of classroom inquiry, A handbook for teachers-researchers (2nd ed.).'' Portsmith, NH: Heinemann. &lt;/ref&gt;. Many large school districts have procedures for establishing informed consent as well as person in the central office who is responsible for the district guidelines and specific application process. If the action research is supported in some way by a college of university (e.g., through a class) then informed consent procedures of that institution must be followed.   

One common area of confusion for teachers is the voluntary nature of student participation in research. If the data being collected are for a research study, students can choose not to participate. This is contrary to much regular classroom instruction where teachers tell students they have to do the work or complete the tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assigning students grades is an important component of teaching and many school districts issue progress reports, interim reports, or mid term grades as well as final semester grades. Traditionally these reports were printed on paper and sent home with students or mailed to students’ homes. Increasingly, school districts are using web-based grade management systems that allow parents to access their child’s grades on each individual assessment as well as the progress reports and final grades. 

Grading can be frustrating for teachers because it is always a compromise among many factors. In addition, report cards typically summarize in brief format a variety of assessments and so cannot provide much diagnostic information about students’ strengths and weaknesses. This means that report cards focus more on assessment ''of'' learning than assessment ''for'' learning. There are a number of decisions that have to be made when assigning students’ grades, and schools often have detailed policies that teachers have to follow. Most of the policies relate to several key questions about assessment, which we consider below.
 
===How are various assignments and assessments weighted?=== 
Students typically do a variety of assignments during a grading period such as homework, quizzes, performance assessments, etc. Teachers have to decide -  preferably before the grading period begins - how each assignment will be weighted. For example, a 6th grade math teacher may decide to weight the grades in the following manner: 

:''Weekly quizzes		35%''
:''Homework 			15%''
:''Performance Assessment 	30%''
:''Class participation 		20%''

Deciding how to weight assignments should be done carefully, since it communicates to students and parents what teachers believe is important, and also may be used to decide how much effort students will exert (e.g., “If homework is only worth 5% it is not worth completing twice a week”).  

Should social skills or effort be included?  Elementary school teachers are more likely than middle or high school teachers to include some social skills into report cards (Popham, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2005). ''Classroom Assessment: What teachers need to know.''  Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;.  These may be included as separate criteria in the report card or weighted into the grade for that subject. For example, the grade for mathematics may include an assessment of group cooperation or self regulation during mathematics lessons. Some schools and teachers endorse including social skills arguing that developing such skills is important for young students and that students need to learn to work with others and manage their own behaviors in order to be successful. Others believe that grades in subject areas should be based on the cognitive performances – and that if assessments of social skills are made they should be clearly separated from the subject grade on the report card. Obviously, clear criteria such as those contained in analytical scoring rubrics should be used if social skills are graded.  	

Teachers often find it difficult to decide whether effort and improvement should be included as a component of grades. One approach is for teachers to ask students to submit drafts of an assignment and make improvements based on the feedback they received. The grade for the assignment may include some combination of the score for the drafts, the final version, and the amount of improvement the students made based on the feedback provided. A more controversial approach is basing grades on effort when students try really hard day after day but still cannot complete their assignments well. These students could have identified special needs or be recent immigrants and have limited English skills. Some school districts have guidelines for handling such cases. One disadvantage of using improvement as a component of grades is that the most competent students in class may do very well initially and have little room for improvement – unless teachers are skilled at providing additional assignments that will help challenge these students.

Teachers often use “hodgepodge grading,” i.e., a combination of achievement, effort, growth, attitude or class conduct, homework, and class participation. A survey of over 8500  middle and high school students in Virginia  supported the hodgepodge practices commonly used by their teachers (Cross &amp; Frary, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Cross, L. H., &amp; Frary, R. B. (1999). Hodgepodge grading: Endorsed by students and teachers alike. ''Applied Measurement in Education, 21''(1) 53-72. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

===How should grades be calculated?===
Two options are commonly used: absolute gradin and relative grading. In '''absolute grading''' evaluations are assigned based on criteria the teacher has devised in advance. If an English teacher has established a level of proficiency needed to obtain an A and no student meets that level then no A’s will be given. Alternatively if every student meets the established level then all the students will get A’s. Absolute grading systems may use letter grades or pass/fail. 

In '''relative grading''' the teacher ranks the performances of students from worst to best (or best to worst) and those at the top get high grades, those in the middle moderate grades, and those at the bottom low grades. This is often described as “grading on the curve” and can be useful to compensate for an examination or assignment that students find much easier or harder than the teacher expected. However, relative grading can be unfair to students because the comparisons are typically within one class, so an A in one class may not represent the level of performance of an A in another class. Relative grading systems may discourage students from helping each other improve as students are in competition for limited rewards. In fact, Bishop (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, J. H. (1999). Nerd harassment, incentives, school priorities, and learning. In S. E. Mayer &amp; P. E. Peterson (Eds.)  ''Earning and learning: How school matters'' (pp. 231-280). Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that grading on the curve gives students a personal interest in persuading each other not to study as a serious student makes it more difficult for others to get good grades.

===What kinds of grade descriptions should be used?===
Traditionally a '''letter-grade system''' is used (e.g. A, B, C, D, F ) for each subject. The advantages of these grade descriptions are they are convenient, simple, and can be averaged easily. However, they do not indicate what objectives the student has or has not met nor students’ specific strengths and weaknesses.  Elementary schools often use a pass-fail (or satisfactory-unsatisfactory) system and some high schools and colleges do as well. Pass-fail systems in high school and college allow students to explore new areas and take risks on subjects that they may have limited preparation for, or is not part of their major. While a pass-fail system is easy to use, it offers even less information about students’ level of learning. 

A '''pass-fail system''' is also used in classes that are taught under a [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 8: Instructional Strategies/Mastery Learning|mastery-learning approach]], in which students are expected to demonstrate mastery on all the objectives in order to receive course credit. Under these conditions, it is clear that a pass means that the student has demonstrated mastery of all the objectives.

Some schools have implemented a '''checklist of the objectives''' in subject areas to replace the traditional letter grade system, and students are rated on each objective using descriptors such as Proficient, Partially Proficient, and Needs Improvement. For example, the checklist for students in a 4th grade class in California may include the four types of writing that are required by the English language state content standards&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/enggrade4.asp&lt;/ref&gt;: 

* ''Writing  narratives''
* ''Writing responses to literature''
* ''Writing information reports''
* ''Writing  summaries'' 

The advantages of this approach are that it communicates students’ strengths and weaknesses  clearly, and reminds the students and parents the objectives of the school. However, if too many objectives are included then the lists can become so long that they are difficult to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Queues==

A queue is formally defined as consisting of a server and a waiting line for customers needing service at the server. Each customer joins the queue at the end of the waiting line. As the customers at the front of the line are served those behind gradually move to the head of the line. A customer leaves as soon as it has received its service requirement from the server and the server begins to serve the next customer in line. This is illustrated below.

[[Image:Compsyseng07_01.jpg]]

A number of natural systems can be described in this way. For example, shoppers in a grocery store line up to wait for the cashier to total their groceries. Here the shoppers are the customers, the cashier is the server and the time it takes to total each shopper’s groceries is that shopper’s service requirement. Similarly, in a bank customers wait in line to reach a teller where they complete their transaction. In this case a single wait¬ing line may be used by all the tellers. In a computer system a customer is a job submitted for processing, a server is a device such as the CPU or a disk controller and the service requirement is the time the job will spend at that device. For example, if the server is the CPU the service requirement is the amount of processing the job will get; if the server is a disk con¬troller the service requirement is the time to do a disk read or write opera¬tion.

The time between when jobs join the waiting line and enter the queue and the amount of service each job requires are both given by random variables. The arrival rate is the average number of jobs that arrive per second. This is denoted by   and hence   is the average time between arrivals.

[[Image:Compsyseng07_02.jpg]] 

  and   are both used to represent the average service requirement. In a large interval T the expected number of arrivals is

	expected number arrivals in T =  

and these jobs have an average service requirement of  . Thus the expected amount of service given by the server is

	 

The fraction of time that the server is busy is its utilization. This is
	
	 

The quantity  is called the “traffic intensity” for the queue and denoted by the special symbol  :
	
	 

Note that if    is greater than 1, more jobs arrive than can be served during T. In this case the number of jobs in the waiting line will grow in¬definitely and the queue is unstable. For   only the queue having a deterministic arrival process and deterministic service requirement is stable. Due to fluctuations in the job arrivals and/or service requirements, non-deterministic queues must have   for stability. For  ,   is the probability (i.e. fraction of time) that the server is busy. Hence  is the probability that it is idle.

In studying queues, the most important questions to ask are:

 •	How long must a job wait before receiving service?
 •	How long will it stay in the queue before leaving (waiting time plus service time)?
 •	How many jobs are in the queue?
 •	What is the utilization of the server? (i.e. What fraction of the time is the server busy?)





==Finite Population Model==
In a finite population model there is a fixed number N of jobs. Jobs arrive at the queue from some source and after completing their service requirement they return to this source. This is shown below

[[Image:Compsyseng13_01.jpg]]
	 
If there are k jobs in the queue there are N-k jobs in the source. We will assume that jobs wait in the source an exponentially distributed amount of time with average  before returning to the queue and that they are independent of each other. If there are (N-k) jobs in the source then they create a Poisson input process to the queue with rate

	 

The state transition diagram for the finite population M/M/1 queue is shown below.
	
[[Image:Compsyseng13_02.jpg]]

Note that when there are N jobs in the queue there are no jobs in the source and . Thus the probability of a queue state n &gt; N is zero.

	 

The normalizing equation becomes
	
	 

Thus
	
	 

or

==Little’s Formula==

'''Small 3-variable formula:'''
	 

===Justification:===
A customer spends time w in system, and during that time   customers arrive in a steady state. This must be the average number of customers in the system (otherwise the number either grows or shrinks).

'''Formally,'''

[[Image:Compsyseng08_01.jpg]] 
 

===Little’s Formula (formal proof)===

[[Image:Compsyseng08_02.jpg]] 

 

In a system with different types of customers, Little’s Formula applies to each type separately. For example, in a priority system,

[[Image:Compsyseng08_03.jpg]] 

 

===Server utilization===

Consider the system consisting of only the server:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng08_04.jpg]] 



'''Comten Network Processor'''
packet:	2048B = 16,384 bits
line:	56Kbps
 
292.5ms = .2924 sec ≈ .3sec

Say we want to send 7 packets per second aggregate:

	 
However, recall that there is a delay at 100% utilization, 

[[Image:Compsyseng08_05.jpg]] 
 
so we may actually want to use 4 lines to further reduce the utilization rate.

===Response Time===
The average time that a job spends in the queue is found by Little’s formula:

	 

This is called the “response time” for the queue and is denoted by T. Thus using we have
	
	 

or
	
	 

This is shown below as   increases from 0 to 1.
		
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Compsyseng09_01.jpg]] --&gt; 

Note that the response time (and number in the system) remains fairly flat for less than 50% server utilization (i.e.,  ) and increases sharply as the server nears 100% utilization. This phenomenon is characteristic of nearly all queuing systems. When we attempt to run the server near its capacity (i.e.  ) the response time and number in the queue get very large. For   the system becomes unstable and the number in the queue and the response time grow indefinitely.

	 


==Stop and Wait Protocol==

[[Image:Compsyseng08_06.jpg]] 

The stop-and-wait protocol ties up the transmission line, because the time on the line is used to send a packet, and then delays until an acknowledgement is received.

===Model Communications Line===

[[Image:Compsyseng10_01.jpg]]

line = server
waiting line = messages to be sent at station
service time = transmission time 

Or, with stop-and-wait, service time = time for cycle.

[[Image:Compsyseng10_02.jpg]]

In order to increase the line speed, the service time must be reduced.

==m-Server Loss==
m-servers reject arrival if more than m are busy.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng03_01.jpg]]
 
Notice that there is no closed-form expression in this m-server loss system. Values can be calculated from the tables. This system is often used to size telephone channels, based on calling rate   and call duration


==Generalized Birth-Death Processes==
Our discussion of the M/M/1 queue can be generalized by allowing the arrival and service rates to be dependent on the state of the queue. That is, the arrival process is Poisson with parameter    and the ser¬vice requirement is exponentially distributed with parameter . The subscript n refers to the number of jobs in the queue. If the queue state is n=k the probability of an arrival is

	 

and the probability of a departure (assuming the queue is not empty) is

	 

The probability of an arrival or departure depends on the queue state only through the parameters   and  .

Because of the memoryless property of the Poisson process the probability that the queue is in state n=k at time t and that there is an arrival or a departure during an interval h given that the queue is in state k at the start of the interval are independent. Thus the state transition diagram below describes a Markov chain.

[[Image:Compsyseng11_01.jpg]]
	
The equilibrium balance equations, found by inspection, requiring that the “rate of flow of probability” out of a state equal the flow in are

	 

and again the normalizing equation is

	 

These equations could have been found more formally by considering the probabilities of an arrival, a departure and no change in an interval h as was done for the simple M/M/1 queue.
	 

and for k=l,

	 

Substituting for P(1) gives
	
	 

and in general,

	 

The constant P(0) is found using the normalizing equation. Sub¬stituting for P(k) gives
	
	 

or

	 

Combining gives the general solution 

	 

Kleinrock discusses several variations of birth-death queues in equilibrium. Two cases are especially useful in modeling computer systems. These are the “Infinite Server Queue” and the “Finite Population Model.”

==Infinite Server Queue==
In the infinite server queue there is always a free server when a job arrives at the queue.


If there are 2 jobs In the queue the service rate is   (we can think of this as the Superposition of 2 Poisson service processes each having rate  ), and if the queue is in state n=k the service rate is  . Note that this implies that the average time between service completions is
	
	 

when the queue state is n=k. It is apparent that this queuing system can also be interpreted as having a single server which lin¬early increases its service rate when more jobs are waiting for service.

For this queue,
	
	 

and the state transition diagram is

[[Image:Compsyseng12_01.jpg]]


The solution reduces to

	 

and

	 

Now
	
	 

Thus
	
	 

and combining gives

	 

The average number in the queue is

	 

or letting r = k-1 

	 
The average response time, T, is found by applying Little’s formula,  , to give:

	 

or
	
	 

This is expected since no job must wait before starting to receive service.


The infinite server queue is often used in modeling a computer system to represent a bank of user terminals or to represent a random delay which involves no queuing or conflicts between jobs.


==Queuing Networks==
===Introduction===
A queuing network is constructed by connecting the output of one queue to the input of another. This is illustrated below.

[[Image:Compsyseng14_01.jpg]]

Note that a single queue can be fed from the output of several others and that the output of a queue can be split to form input streams to several other queues. Each queue forms a “node” of the network and these can be numbered 1,2…M, where M is the number of nodes in the network. The “routing probability”   is the probability that a departure from node i of the network goes immediately to node j.

Networks of queues can be used to model systems of several interacting devices, each of which can be modeled as a queue. For example, a simple com¬puter system consisting of a CPU and disk can be represented by a 2-queue network.

[[Image:Compsyseng14_02.jpg]]
 
===Types of Networks===
A queuing network can be either “open” or “closed.” In an open network, jobs arrive at some of the nodes from an external source and can leave the network (to some absorbing destination or “sink”) from some nodes. The number of jobs in the network can vary and the source has an infinite supply. In a closed network a fixed number of jobs circulate among the nodes of the network; no new jobs enter the network and none leave.

Closed networks have been particularly successful in modeling computer systems. Two of the most widely used are the Central Server Model and the Machine Repairman Model.

===Central Server Model===
A central server queuing network is shown below.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng14_03.jpg]]

Here node 1 represents the CPU and nodes 2 through M represent the system Input/Output (I/O) devices -- usually disk controllers. Jobs are visualized as receiving service at the CPU and then being routed with probability  to I/O device i. After receiving service at the I/O device the job returns to the CPU. In this model the processing of a job by the computer system is represented by several visits of the job to the CPU and I/O devices. The path from the CPU back to itself (with probability ) represents the completion of one job in the system and the simultaneous start of another.

The central server network is especially useful for modeling the inner resources (CPU and disks) of multiprogrammed computer systems. In these systems the level of multiprogramming (number of jobs in memory simultaneously) is often limited to a small number of jobs in the interest of system efficiency. Under moderate to heavy loads the system multiprogramming level is usually at or near this limit. Thus the assumption that the number of jobs in the network is constant is a good approximation to the real system.

===Machine Repairman Model===
The machine repairman model, originally developed in operations research, is often used to represent interactive computer systems. This network, as shown below

[[Image:Compsyseng14_04.jpg]]

has one multi-server node which represents the user terminals. The other (system) nodes represent the other system resources. These may be arbitrarily connected although a variant of the central server network is often used. Jobs begin at the terminal node and then enter the system where they circulate among the system nodes before returning to the terminal node. The time from when the job leaves the terminal node until it returns is the system response tine, and the time it spends at the terminal node is called the user think time. The number of jobs in the network is the same as the number of servers at the terminal node. Hence there is no waiting for a job to begin to receive service at this queue and its service time is the same as the think time.

===Open Networks===
Open networks are most often used to model computer systems having a variable number of jobs or a constant job arrival rate. Batch processing systems and communications networks are often of this type.

==Terminal Driven Systems==
One particularly useful model for many interactive computer systems is the terminal driven system shown below.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng15_01.jpg]]

In this model the number of jobs is equal to the number of terminals (i.e., there is one job per terminal). A job is visualized as leaving the “Terminals” when the user hits a “carriage return”, circulating among the various devices in the system as it is processed, and then returning to the terminal node. The time from the job’s departure from the terminal node until its return is the system response time. The time that the job waits at the terminals (i.e., the time from a response until the next input to the system) is the user “think time”.

 Let:	 denote the rate with which jobs enter the system (system throughput);
 	R denote the system response time;
 	Z denote the user think time;
 	N denote the number of terminals (or jobs) in the System.

We now apply Little’s Formula to the SYSTEM (all red capitals) consisting of both the terminals and the System (capital S) shown below.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng15_02.jpg]]

For SYSTEM each job spends an average amount of time Z at the terminals and an average amount of time R in System giving an average amount of time Z + R in SYSTEM. It then leaves and immediately returns. The average job throughput rate is   and the number of jobs in the system is fixed at N.

Hence, by Little’s Formula:
	 
or
	 

We now seek to find bounds on the response time R, and the throughput .

Let the various devices in the System be numbered 1,2,...M, and let   be the average total amount of service a job receives from device i. Note that while a job is in the System it might actually visit device i more than once, in which case   is the sum of the amounts of service it receives on each visit. Let  be the average amount of service a job receives on each visit to device i. If  is independent of   then

	 

is the average number of visits a job makes to device i.


===Bounds on the System Response Time===

If there is only one terminal and hence only one job in the system, R is simply the sum of the amount of service the job requires from each device. This is the minimum possible response time. Hence:

	 

Since the utilization of each device cannot exceed 100% the throughput at device i,  , is at most  . Thus,
	 

and since a job visits device i an average of  times on each pass through the System,

	 

Thus,
	 

Substituting this equation into the expression for the response time yields the lower bound:
	 

To find an upper bound on R we note that the most time that a job would spend at any device i would occur if at each visit it had to wait for the other N-l jobs to get their service before it received its service. Thus,

	 	

These bounds on the response time versus the number of terminals in the system are shown below. The dotted line shows a typical system response time function.

[[Image:Compsyseng15_03.jpg]]

The region between   is often called the feasible response time region for the system. In practice, as the number of terminals is increased, the response time becomes asymptotic to the line


This is the leftmost of the lines , and the one for which   is the largest. The device corresponding to this line is called the system bottleneck and the other lines for the other devices are the potential bottlenecks due to those devices. The bottleneck and potential bottlenecks above are easily located. Observe that each is a straight line with an intercept on the horizontal (terminal) axis of  and a slope of  . Since  gets smaller as the lines progress from left to right they have the appearance of “falling down”.

===Bounds on the System Throughput===

From , for all i, we note that
	
	 

where  is the total service time at the device for which  is largest. This is the
maximum possible system throughput.

Rearranging  gives the expression for :
	
	 

We noted that with N jobs in the system  . Thus,
		
	 

Similarly, since  , we have,
	
	 

The following figure shows these bounds on the system throughput versus the number of terminals.

[[Image:Compsyseng15_04.jpg]]

===Saturation Point===
The point
	
	 

shown in the previous two figures is called the saturation point for the system. It is interpreted as follows.

With one terminal connected to the system a job is never delayed waiting for other jobs to receive their service at a device. Thus, it spends an amount of time  in the System and the throughput is  . If, as the number of terminals is increased, each job that enters the system is not delayed waiting for other jobs to be served at a device, each job will spend only an amount of time in the system. The response time will be  and the throughput will increase along the line  .

However, when the number of terminals, N, becomes equal to N*, the system throughput will have reached  and the bottleneck device will have reached 100% utilization. At that point it is “saturated”. If an additional job then enters the system, jobs can do no better than to arrive at the bottleneck device just as another job is beginning to be served. Thus, each job will have to wait a time before beginning its own service. Consequently, for each terminal added beyond N* the minimum possible response time increases by an amount and the minimum response time will increase along the line  .


===Effects of System Changes===
The bounds in the previous two figures provide insight into the behavior of a system when we start to modify its configuration.

Consider, for example, a computer system in which the processor handles the terminal I/O traffic and is the system bottleneck. Let  be the average processing time a job receives at the processor. If the processor is replaced with a faster device,   is reduced. Thus the delay,  , is reduced and the “potential bottleneck” due to the processor is moved to the right. If it moves far enough, so that another device becomes the leftmost potential bottleneck, then that device becomes the new bottleneck. If it does not move to the right of one of the other potential bottlenecks, then it remains the bottleneck but a lower response time and higher throughput can be obtained. The following figure shows the effects of these changes on the response time asymptotes.

[[Image:Compsyseng15_05.jpg]]

More interesting possibilities arise if the terminal I/O processing is unloaded onto a Front-End Processor (FEP). This also reduces   and moves the processor bottleneck to the right, but it adds a new device and corresponding new potential bottleneck to the system.

Let   be the amount of time the processor spent doing I/O. Then  is reduced by the amount . If the FEP is slower than the processor then  will be greater than  and   will be increased by the difference  - . If the FEP is faster,   will be decreased by the
amount .

If the system is heavily loaded so that the processor is the active bottleneck controlling the response time and limiting the throughput; as long as  the system throughput will increase even if the FEP is much slower than the processor. What device becomes the new system bottleneck when the processor bottleneck moves to the right depends on the values   and the other devices in the system.

[[Image:Compsyseng15_06.jpg]]

===Example:===

'''Saturate with:'''

	 

'''Questions'''
 Can we get 1 sec response time? – No.
 Can we get 2 sec response time with 30 terminals? – Yes.
 Can we get 2 sec response time with 35 terminals? – No.

The CPU is the bottleneck. Use a faster CPU to get better performance.

A faster CPU results in shorter processing time (say .75 sec).

[[Image:Compsyseng16_04.jpg]]

Results in a big performance improvement.

A faster disk…

[[Image:Compsyseng16_05.jpg]]

… is a little better, but not much.

A slightly faster CPU, v&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = .6  …
 
[[Image:Compsyseng16_06.jpg]]

… and the CPU is still the bottleneck.

However, if v&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = .4 …
 
[[Image:Compsyseng16_07.jpg]]

…then the disk is now the bottleneck, and further improvements in the CPU don’t help much.

Adding a second CPU…
 
[[Image:Compsyseng16_08.jpg]]

[[Image:Compsyseng16_09.jpg]]

The bounds model is independent of internal system structure. The model depends on total service required for a job at each device. Therefore, the bounds model can be represented as a serial system.

*Named for Siméon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840)

===Properties:===

'''Average time between events'''
 

'''Average number of events in interval'''
 

'''Memorylessness''' (very important)

 
No event in s; find probability that the next event occurs in t:

	 

 Remember: non-overlapping time intervals are independent!

One time interval is like any other, which leads to paradox. If we were to pick a point randomly, it is more likely that the point would fall in a large interval than it would fall in a small one (large intervals occupy more space on a line).
 

For Poisson arrivals, if we pick an interval at random, it will be (on average) twice as large as an average interval.

'''Events are uniformly distributed'''

==Properties of the Poisson Process==

===Average Interevent Time===
For the Poisson process the time between events has the exponential distribution. This has the density function   The expected time between events is found by integrating by parts:

 
	
The variance of the interevent time can be calculated similarly. It is
	                           
                           
Hence its standard deviation  is
	 				
				
and its coefficient of variation is
	
 	coefficient of variation = 			
			
Again expanding  in a Taylor series for small h gives
	 	

The probability of more than 1 event in h is

	 

This establishes the equivalence of properties (ii), (iii) and (iv) for the Poisson process.

===Exponential Implies Poisson===
That the exponential interevent time distribution implies a Poisson distributed number of events in an interval can be shown directly in almost the same way used to show that (iv) implied (ii).

Consider an interval T:
 
[[Image:Compsyseng04_01.jpg]]

Again
	 

The probability of exactly one event in T is the total probability of one event at y and no events in the interval (T—y) for all possible values of y.
	 
[[Image:Compsyseng04_02.jpg]]


The probability of exactly two events in T is the total probability of one event at y and one event in the interval (T—y) for all possible values of y.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng04_03.jpg]]

and in general
 .

===Average Number of Events in an Interval===
The expected number of events which occur during an interval of length T is
 

The results are not unexpected but confirm the fact that the para¬meter  for the Poisson process (or equivalently the exponential distribution) is the average event rate.


===Memoryless Property===
Supposing a time s has passed since the last event, what is the probability that the time until the next event is greater than t? This is the same as asking the probability that the time between events, X, is greater than s + t given that it is greater than s.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng04_04.jpg]]
 
Hence substituting gives
 

This is the well known memoryless property of the Poisson process. The time distribution until the next event is the same regardless of how much time has passed since the last event, and the average time until the next event is the same as the average interevent time. This property is also a direct conse¬quence of the complete randomness of the Poisson process; what happens in the interval t is independent of what has happened in the interval s.

The memoryless property of the Poisson process leads to an interesting paradox. Suppose we have a Poisson process and pick an arbitrary time t’. The average time until the next event is   and, looking backwards, the average time since the last event is also  . Thus the average time between these two events must be  . But the average interevent time is  . The paradox can be resolved by noting that the time t’ is more likely to fall in a large interevent interval than in a small one. In fact, the expected size of the interevent interval containing t’ will be twice the average.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng04_05.jpg]]

To illustrate the consequences of this paradox suppose that requests for a disk I/O operation in a computer system are exponentially distributed. We measure the time between requests by reading a clock and resetting it to zero after each read or write. If we attempt to sample this process by picking some ar¬bitrary time, t’, and then reading the clock at the next I/O operation the average value of our samples will be twice the average time between I/O operations. To sample this process correctly we would need to pick an ar¬bitrary time and then sample the time between the next two I/O operations.

[[Image:Compsyseng04_06.jpg]]

===Events Uniformly Distributed in Interval===
If we have an interval of length t and one event occurred during t, what is the probability that the event occurred during a subinterval of length s?

[[Image:Compsyseng04_07.jpg]]
 
This is the same as asking the probability that  (where X is the time from the start of the interval until the event) given that exactly one event occurred during t: . We note that if  then one event occurred during s and no events occurred during the interval (t-s). Hence

 

Now, since what happens in two non-overlapping intervals is independent, . Substituting the

Poisson distribution gives
	
	 

The probability that the event occurred during the subinterval s is	proportional to the size of the interval s. That is, the event is uniformly distributed in the interval t. This has the distribution and density functions
	
	 

where t is the length of the interval. This is shown below.

[[Image:Compsyseng04_08.jpg]]

===Superposition and Decomposition===
Suppose we have two independent Poisson processes which we designate as process 1 and process 2 and let:

 = the number of events in process 1 during an interval of length T
 = the number of events in process 2 during the same interval
 = the average event rate for process 1
 = the average event rate for process 2

The superposition of these two processes is the process having the events of both processes 1 and 2. This is shown below.

[[Image:Compsyseng04_09.jpg]]
 
What is the probability distribution for the events in the superimposed process,  ?

If r is the number of events during T in the first process, the superimposed process can have k events only if process 2 has k-r events (conditions on k events). These processes are independent. Hence for each value of r, r=0,1...k

	 

Thus the total probability of k events in the superimposed process is the sum of these probabilities, times the probability that there were r events in process 1. This is called the Law of Total Probability.
	
	 

Substituting in the Poisson distribution gives
	
	 

The last term is simply the binomial expansion of  

	 

Hence
	 

But this is simply the Poisson distribution with parameter . Furthermore, since process 1 and process 2 are independent and events during non-overlapping intervals in each process are independent, events in non-overlapping intervals of the superimposed process are independent. Hence it is also a Poisson process.

[[Image:Compsyseng04_10.jpg]]

The converse is also true. If a Poisson process is split (decomposed) into two by selecting events for the first process with probability p and events for the second process with probability q = 1-p then the two processes are independent Poisson processes with parameters   and   respectively.
 
[[Image:Compsyseng04_11.jpg]]

The superposition and decomposition properties are unique for the Poisson process and arise from its complete randomness. If two non-Poisson processes having average event rates   and  are superimposed the resulting process will have an average event rate   but it will not be Poisson nor will it, in general, be a renewal process in which the interevent times are independent and identically distributed.

===Combining Non-Poisson Processes===
However, if a large number of independent non-Poisson processes (with event rates  ) are superimposed the resulting process will be Poisson with parameter [2]

 

Actua1ly, this is precisely true only in the limit as . Again, it results from the randomness of the Poisson process. For fixed , as the number of superimposed processes is increased,  for each process must decrease. Thus events from the same non-Poisson process in the superimposed process become more and more separated making the process more and more random.


===Sampling===
The converse is also true. If events in a non-Poisson process (with average rate ) are sampled infrequently (i.e. the probability of an event being sampled, p, is small) the resulting sampled process having the event rate 

	 

will be Poisson. Again, this is precisely true only in the limit as  and  such that   remains constant.

These limiting distributions help explain the usefulness of the Poisson process in analyzing computer systems. For example, if jobs are submitted from a large number of terminals the composite job arrival rate will be the superposition of the submittal processes at each terminal. These tend to be independent. Thus if the number of terminals is large the composite process will be approximately Poisson. In practice only a few terminals are needed to make the Poisson distribution a good approximation to the actual job arrival process.

As another example [1] consider the process making page transfer requests to a disk in a virtual memory system. This is probably not very random, but if the number of disk sectors is large and if requests are directed to the sectors with equal probability the requesting process to each sector could be closely approximated by a Poisson process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While many States had standardized testing programs prior to 2000, the number of state-wide tests has grown enormously since then because NCLB required that all states test students in reading and mathematics annually in grades 3-8 and at least once in high school by 2005-6. Twenty three states expanded their testing programs during 2005-6 and additional tests are being added as testing in science is required by 2007-8. Students with disabilities and English language learners must be included in the testing and provided a variety of accommodations so the majority of staff in school districts are involved in testing in some way (Olson, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Olson, L. (2005, November 30th). State test program mushroom as NCLB kicks in. ''Education Week 25''(13) 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this section we focus on these tests and their implications for teachers and students
===Standards Based Assessment===
====Academic Content Standards====
NCLB mandates that States must develop academic content standards that specify what students are expected to know or be able to do at each grade level. These content standards used to be called goals and objectives and it is not clear why the labels have changed (Popham, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2004). America’s “failing” schools. ''How parents and teachers can copy with No Child Left Behind.'' New York: Routledge Falmer. &lt;/ref&gt;. Content standards are not easy to develop – if they are too broad and not related to grade level teachers cannot hope to prepare students to meet the standards. An example, a broad standard in reading is

:''Students should be able to construct meaning through experiences with literature, cultural events and philosophical discussion (no grade level indicated).''American Federation of Teachers, 2006, p. 6)&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of Teachers. (2006, July). ''Smart Testing: Let’s get it right. AFT Policy Brief.'' Retrieved August 8, 2006 from [[http://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2006/smarttesting/Testingbrief.pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;.
Standards that are too narrow can result in a restricted curriculum. An example of a narrow standard might be this:
:''Students can define, compare and contrast, and provide a variety of examples of synonyms and antonyms.''
A stronger standard is this:
:''Students should apply knowledge of word origins, derivations, synonyms, antonyms, and idioms to determine the meaning of words (grade 4).''(American Federation of Teachers, 2006, p. 6)&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of Teachers. (2006, July). ''Smart Testing: Let’s get it right. AFT Policy Brief.'' Retrieved August 8, 2006 from [[http://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2006/smarttesting/Testingbrief.pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The American Federation of Teachers conducted a study in 2005-6 and reported that in 32 states some of the standards in reading, math and science were weak. States had the strongest standards in science followed by mathematics. Standards in reading were particularly problematic and with one fifth of all reading standards redundant across the grades, i.e., word-by-word repetition across grade levels at least 50% of the time (American Federation of Teachers, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of Teachers. (2006, July). ''Smart Testing: Let’s get it right. AFT Policy Brief.'' Retrieved August 8, 2006 from [[http://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2006/smarttesting/Testingbrief.pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
Even if the standards are strong, there are often so many of them that it is hard for teachers to address them all in a school year. Content standards are developed by curriculum specialists who believe in the importance of their subject area so they tend to develop large numbers of standards for each subject area and grade level. At first glance, it may appear that there are only several broad standards, but under each standard there are subcategories called goals, benchmarks, indicators or objectives (Popham, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2004). ''America’s “failing” schools. How parents and teachers can copy with No Child Left Behind.'' New York: Routledge Falmer. &lt;/ref&gt;. For example, Idaho’s first grade mathematics standard contains five broad standards, including 10 goals and a total of 29 objectives (Idaho Department of Education, 2005-6)&lt;ref&gt;Idaho Department of Education (2005-6). ''Mathematics Content standards and assessment by grade level.'' Accessed November 22 2006 from [[http://www.sde.idaho.gov/instruct/standards/]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Alignment of Standards, Testing and Classroom Curriculum====
The State tests must be aligned with strong content standards in order to provide useful feedback about student learning. If there is a mismatch between the academic content standards and the content that is assessed then the test results cannot provide information about students’ proficiency on the academic standards. A mismatch not only frustrates the students taking the test, teachers, and administrators it undermines the concept of accountability and the “theory of action” that underlies the NCLB. Unfortunately, the 2006 American Federation of Teachers study indicated that in only 11 states were all the tests aligned with state standards&lt;ref&gt;American Federation of Teachers. (2006, July). ''Smart Testing: Let’s get it right. AFT Policy Brief.'' Retrieved August 8, 2006 from [[http://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2006/smarttesting/Testingbrief.pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

State standards and their alignment with state assessments should be widely available   - preferably posted on the Web sites of the States so they can be accessed by school personnel and the public. A number of states have been slow to do this. [[Table 11-1]] summarizes which states had strong content standards, tests that were aligned with state standards, and adequate documents on online. Only 11 States were judged to meet all three criteria in 2006. 

====Sampling content====
When numerous standards have been developed it is impossible for tests to assess all of the standards every year, so the tests sample the content, i.e., measure some but not all the standards every year. Content standards cannot be reliably assessed with only one or two items so the decision to assess one content standard often requires not assessing another. This means if there are too many content standards a significant proportion of them are not measured each year. In this situation, teachers try to guess which content standards will be assessed that year and align their teaching on those specific standards. Of course if these guesses are incorrect students will have studied content not on the test and not studied content that is on the test. Some argue that this is a very serious problem with current state testing and Popham, an expert on testing even said, “What a muddleheaded way to run a testing program” (2004, p. 79)&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W. J. (2004). ''America’s “failing” schools. How parents and teachers can copy with No Child Left Behind.'' New York: Routledge Falmer. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)===
Under NCLB three levels of achievement, basic, proficient and advanced, must be specified for each grade level in each content area by each state. States were required to set a time table from 2002 that insured an increasing percentage of students reach the proficient levels such that by 2013-14 every child is performing at or the proficient level. Schools and school districts who meet this timetable are said to meet adequate yearly progress (AYP).  

Because every child must reach proficiency by 2013-14 greater increases are required for those schools that had larger percentages of initially lower performing students. [[Figure 11-1]] illustrates the progress needed in three hypothetical schools. School A, initially the lowest performing school, has to increase the number of students reaching proficiency by an average of 6% each year, the increase is 3% for School B , and the increase is only 1% for School C . Also, the checkpoint targets in the timetables are determined by the lower performing schools. This is illustrated on the figure by the arrow – it is obvious that School A has to make significant improvements by 2007-8 but School C does not have to improve at all by 2007-8. This means that schools that are initially lower performing are much more likely to fail to make AYP during the initial implementation years of NCLB. 

====Subgroups and AYP====
For a school to achieve AYP not only must overall percentages of the students reach proficiency but subgroups must also reach proficiency in a process called desegregation. Prior to NCLB State accountability systems typically focused on overall student performance but this did not provide incentives for schools to focus on the neediest students, e.g., those children living below the poverty line (Hess &amp; Petrilli, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hess, F. H. Petrilli, M. J. (2006). ''No Child Left Behind Primer.'' New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;. Under NCLB the percentages for each racial/ethnic group in the school (White, African American, Latino, Native American etc.), low income students, students with limited English Proficiency, and students with disabilities are all calculated if there are enough students in the subgroup. A school may fail AYP if one group, e.g. English Language Learners do not make adequate progress. This means that it is more difficult for large diverse schools (typically urban schools) that have many subgroups to meet the demands of AYP than smaller schools with homogeneous student body (Novak &amp; Fuller, 2003). Schools can also fail to make AYP if too few students take the exam. The drafters of the law were concerned that some schools might encourage low-performing students to stay home on the days of testing in order to artificially inflate the scores. So on average at least 95% of any subgroup must take the exams each year or the school may fail to make AYP (Hess &amp; Petrilli, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Hess, F. H. Petrilli, M. J. (2006). ''No Child Left Behind Primer.'' New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

====Sanctions and AYP====
Schools failing to meet AYP for consecutive experience a series of increasing sanctions. If a school fails to make AYP for two years in row it is labeled “in need of improvement” and school personnel must come up with a school improvement plan that is based on “scientifically based research.” In addition, students must be offered the option of transferring to a better performing public school within the district. If the school fails for three consecutive years free tutoring must be provided to needy students. A fourth year of failure requires “corrective actions” which may include staffing changes, curriculum reforms or extensions of the school day or year. If the school fails to meet AYP for five consecutive years the district must “restructure” which involves major actions such as replacing the majority of the staff, hiring an educational management company, turning the school over to the state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One concern with how AYP is calculated is that it is based on an absolute level of student performance at one point in time and does not measure how much students improve during each year. To illustrate this, [[Figure 11-2]] illustrates six students whose science test scores improved from 4th to 5th grade. The circle represents a student’s score in 4th grade and the tip of the arrow the test score in 5th grade. Note that students 1, 2, and 3 all reach the level of proficiency (the horizontal dotted line) but students 4 5 and 6 do not. However, also notice that students 2, 5 and 6 improved much more than students 1, 3, and 4. The current system of AYP rewards reaching the proficiency level rather than students’ growth. This is a particular problem for low performing schools who may be doing an excellent job of improving achievement (students 5 &amp; 6) but do not make the proficiency level. The US Department of Education in 2006 allowed some states to include growth measures into their calculations of AYP. While growth models traditionally tracked the on the progress of individual students, the term is sometimes used to refer to growth of classes or entire schools (Shaul, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Shaul, M. S. (2006). ''No Child Left Behind Act: States face challenges measuring academic growth. Testimony before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Government Accounting Office.'' Accessed September 25, 2006 from [[http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-948T]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some states include growth information on their report cards. For example, Tennessee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.k-12.state.tn.us/rptcrd05/&lt;/ref&gt; provides details on which schools meet the AYP but also whether the students’ scores on tests represent average growth, above average, or below average growth within the state. [[Figure 11-3]] illustrates in a simple way the kind of information that is provided. Students in schools A, B, and C all reached proficiency and AYP but in Schools D, E, and  F did not. However, students in schools A and D had low growth, in schools B &amp; E average growth , in schools C &amp; F high growth. Researchers have found that in some schools students have high levels of achievement but do not grow as much as expected (School A), and also that in some schools, the achievement test scores are not high but the students are growing or learning a lot (School F). These are called “school effects” and represent the effect of the school on the learning of the students. 

Growth models have intuitive appeal to teachers as they focus on how much student learned during the school year – not what the student knew at the start of the school year. The current research evidence suggests that teachers matter a lot – i.e., students learn much more with some teachers than others. For example, in one study low-achieving 4th grade students in Dallas, Texas were followed for three years and 90% of those who had effective teachers passed the 7th grade math test whereas only 42% of those with ineffective teachers passed (cited in Bracey, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Bracey, G. W. (2004). Value added assessment findings: Poor kids get poor teachers.''Phi Delta Kappan, 86,'' 331- 333.&lt;/ref&gt;. Unfortunately, the same study reported that low achieving students were more likely to be assigned to ineffective teachers for three years in a row than high achieving students. Some policy makers believe that teachers who are highly effective should receive rewards including higher salaries or bonuses and that a primary criterion of effectiveness is assessed by growth models, i.e., how much students learn during a year (Hershberg, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Hershberg, T. (2004). Value added assessment: Powerful diagnostics to improve instruction and promote student achievement. ''American Association of School Administrators, Conference Proceedings.'' Retrieved August 21 2006 from [[http://www.cgp.upenn.edu/ope_news.html]]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, using growth data to make decisions about teachers is controversial as there is much more statistical uncertainty when using growth measures for a small group or students (e.g., one teacher’s students) than larger groups (e.g., all  4th graders in a school district). 

Growth models are also used to provide information about the patterns of growth among subgroups of students that may arise from the instructional focus of the teachers. For example, it may be that highest performing students in the classroom gain the most and the lowest performing students gain the least. This suggests that the teacher is focusing on the high achieving students and giving less attention to low achieving students  In contrast, it may be the highest performing students gain the least and the low performing students grow the most suggesting the teacher focuses on the low performing students and paying little attention to the  high  performing students. If the teacher focuses on the students “in the middle” they may grow the most and the highest and lowest performing students grow the least. Proponents of the value-added or growth models argue that teachers can use this information to help them make informed decisions about their teaching.  

===Differing State Standards===
Under NCLB each state devises their own academic content standards, assessments, and levels of proficiency. Some researchers have suggested that the rules of NCLB have encouraged states to set low levels of proficiency so it is easier to meet AYP each year (Hoff, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Hoff, D. J. (2002) States revise meaning of proficient. ''Education Week, 22,''(6) 1,24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. Stringency of state levels of proficiency can be examined by comparing state test scores to scores on a national achievement test called the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)&lt;ref&gt;[[http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard]].&lt;/ref&gt;. NCLB requires that states administer reading and math NAEP tests to a sample of 4th and 8th grade students every other year. The NAEP is designed to assess the progress of students at the state-wide or national level not individual schools or students and is widely respected as a well designed test that uses current best practices in testing. A large percentage of each test includes constructed-response questions and questions that require the use of calculators and other materials. 	
[[Figure 11-4]] illustrates that two states, Colorado and Missouri had very different state performance standards for the 4th grade reading/language arts tests in 2003. On the state assessment 67% of the students in Colorado but only 21% of the students in Missouri were classified as proficient. However, on the NAEP tests 34% of Colorado students and 28% of Missouri student were classified as proficient (Linn 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Linn, R. L. (2005). ''Fixing the NCLB Accountability System. CRESST Policy Brief 8.'' Accessed September 21, 2006 from [[http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/policybriefs_set.htm]]&lt;/ref&gt;. These differences demonstrate that there is no common meaning in current definitions of “proficient achievement” established by the States.

===Implications for Beginning Teachers===
:''Dr. Mucci is the principal of a suburban 4th through 6th grade school in Ohio that continues to meet AYP. We asked her what beginning teachers should know about high stakes testing by the states. &quot;I want beginning teachers to be familiar with the content standards in Ohio because they clearly define what all students should know and be able to do. Not only does teaching revolve around the standards, I only approve requests for materials or professional development if these are related to the standards. I want beginning teachers to understand the concept of data-based decision making. Every year I meet with all the teachers in each grade level (e.g. 4th grade) to look for trends in the previous year's test results and consider remedies based on these trends. I also meet with each teacher in the content areas that are tested and discuss every student's achievement in his or her class so we can develop an instructional plan for every student. All interventions with students are research based. Every teacher in the school is responsible for helping to implement these instructional plans, for example the music or art teachers must incorporate some reading and math into their classes. I also ask all teachers to teach test taking skills, by using similar formats to the state tests, enforcing time limits, making sure students learn to distinguish between questions that required an extended response using complete sentences vs. those that only requires one or two words, and ensuring that students answer what is actually being asked. We begin this early in the school year and continue to work on these skills so by Spring students are familiar with the format, and therefore less anxious about the State Test. We do everything possible to set each student up for success.&quot;''

The impact of testing on classroom teachers does not just occur in Dr. Mucci’s middle school. A national survey of over 4000 teachers indicated that the majority of teachers reported that the state mandated tests were compatible with their daily instruction and were based on curriculum frameworks that ''all'' teachers should follow. The majority of teachers also reported teaching test taking skills and encouraging students to work hard and prepare. Elementary school teachers reported greater impact of the high stakes tests: 56% reported the tests influenced their teaching daily or a few times a week compared to 46% of middle school teacher and 28% of high school teachers. Even though the teachers had adapted their instruction because of the standardized tests they were skeptical about them with 40% reporting that teachers had found ways to raise test scores without improving student learning and over 70% reporting that the test scores were not an accurate measure of what minority students know and can do (Pedulla, Abrams, Madaus, Russell, Ramos, &amp; Miao; 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Pedulla, J Abrams, L. M. Madaus, G. F., Russell, M. K., Ramos, M. A., &amp; Miao, J. (2003). ''Perceived effects of state-mandated testing programs on teaching and learning: Findings from a national survey of teachers.'' Boston College, Boston MA National Board on Educational Testing and Public Policy. Accessed September 21 2006 from [[http://escholarship.bc.edu/lynch_facp/51/]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Testing in the Canadian Provinces===
Canada has developed a system of testing in the provinces as well as national testing. Each province undertakes its own curriculum based assessments. At the elementary school level provinces assess reading and writing (language arts) as well as mathematics (also called numeracy). In the middle grades science and social studies is often assessed in addition to Language Arts and Mathematics. Summary results of these tests are published but there are no specific consequences for poor performance for schools. In addition, these tests are not high stakes for students. At the secondary school level high stakes curriculum based exit tests are common &lt;ref&gt;[[http://edudata.educ.ubc.ca/Data_Pages/PanCan.htm]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Canada has developed pan-Canada assessment programs in mathematics, reading and writing, and science that are administered to a random sample of schools across the country. These assessments are intended to determine whether, on average, students across Canada reach similar levels of performance at about the same age &lt;ref&gt;[[http://www.cmec.ca/pcap/indexe.stm]]&lt;/ref&gt;. They are not intended to provide individual feedback to students, and in this way are similar in purpose to the NAEP tests administered in the United States. 

===International Comparisons===
Along with the increasing globalization has come an interest with international comparisons in educational achievement and practices and more than 40 countries participate in two major testing initiatives. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)&lt;ref&gt;Silver, E. (1998). ''Improving mathematics in middle school: Lessons from TIMMS and related research.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; has assessed students in 4th and 8th grades three times since 1995, and will test again in 2007. The Programme for International Assessment (PISA)&lt;ref&gt; Lemke, M., Sen, A., Pahlke, E., Partelow, L., Miller, D., Williams, T., Kastberg, D., and Jocelyn, L. International Outcomes of Learning in Mathematics Literacy and Problem Solving: PISA 2003 Results From the U.S. Perspective. ''Education Statistics Quarterly, 6''(4)&lt;/ref&gt;. has assessed 15 year olds in reading, mathematical and science literacy in more than countries on three times since 2000. The items on both series of tests include multiple choice, short answer and constructed response formats and are translated into more than 30 languages. 

Policy makers are often interested in the comparison of average students’ scores across countries. For example, in 8th grade Science on the 2003 TIMMS students from Canada, United States, Hong Kong, and Australia scored significantly higher than the international average whereas students from Egypt, Indonesia, and the Philippines scored significantly below the international average&lt;ref&gt;Silver, E. (1998). ''Improving mathematics in middle school: Lessons from TIMMS and related research.'' Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt;. On the mathematics test in the 2003 PISA, 15 year old students from Hong Kong-China and Finland scored higher than students from Canada and New Zealand who in turn scores higher than  the students from United States and Spain, who in turn scored higher than the student from Mexico and Brazil (OECD, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;(OECD 2004). Learning for Tomorrow's World – First Results from PISA 2003. Accessed on September 23,  2006 from [[http://www.pisa.oecd.org/document/]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
  
Both series of tests also collect survey data from students, teachers or school principals allowing for information about instructional practices and student characteristics For example, teachers from the Philippines report spending almost twice as much time teaching science to 4th graders than in the United States (Martin, Mullis, Gonzalez, &amp; Chrostowski, (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Martin, M.O., Mullis, I.V.S., Gonzalez, E.J., &amp; Chrostowski, S.J. (2004). ''Findings From IEA’s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study at the Fourth and Eighth Grades Chestnut Hill, MA: TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center, Boston College.'' Accessed September 23, 2006 from [[http://timss.bc.edu/timss2003i/scienceD.html]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Student reports from PISA indicate that there is considerable cross-country variation in how much students feel anxiety when doing mathematics. Students in France, Italy, Japan, Korea report feeling the most anxious whereas students in Denmark, Finland and Netherlands and Sweden feel the least anxious (OECD 2004)&lt;ref&gt;(OECD 2004). Learning for Tomorrow's World – First Results from PISA 2003. Accessed on September 23,  2006 from [[http://www.pisa.oecd.org/document/]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the powerful features of SwisTrack is its real-time display, which allows you to watch the output of every component. Some components even allow you to check out input images or intermediate processing steps.

== Configuring the Display ==

When you click on a component, the display in the main window automatically switches to the output of the selected component. However, you can at any time switch to another display by clicking on the yellow title. Most components provide one display (the output), but some even provide several different displays. (Very few components actually don't provide any display. This is the case for cameras that just receive a stream of data which first has to be translated into a real image, for example.)

If your image is too big to be displayed on the screen, you can drag it with the mouse to inspect the hidden parts. You can also zoom out by clicking with the right mouse button on the image and selecting the appropriate zoom level.

== Working with Multiple Displays ==

Sometimes, it is handy to see several processing steps at the same time. To do that, choose &lt;b&gt;New Display&lt;/b&gt; from the &lt;b&gt;View&lt;/b&gt; menu. The window that appears has the same functionality as the main display, but doesn't change the display when you click on a component.

== Saving Displayed Images ==

A right-click on a display provides you two possibilities for storing the image:
* &lt;b&gt;Save displayed image as ...&lt;/b&gt; stores the image as it is displayed on the screen, i.e. with the chosen zoom level. The image is stored as a color image, no matter what type the original image was. All drawings (particles, tracks, text, ...) are retained.
* &lt;b&gt;Save original image as ...&lt;/b&gt; stores the image as it was provided by the component, in the format provided by the component. Note that tracks and particles will not appear on that image.

== Status Information ==

The black bar below the display indicates status information, such as the frame number of the size, about the displayed image.

As a side note, the displayed image is not always the last processed image. The status information shown here belong to the displayed image.

== Display Speed Considerations ==

Displaying an image on the screen requires some processing and therefore steals some CPU time. If you want to get the maximum performance out of your system, and don't need any display, then choose &lt;i&gt;No display (maximum speed)&lt;/i&gt; from the list.

Displaying an image on the screen is done in two steps:
# The component makes a copy of the image it wants to show. This time adds to the processing time (step duration) of the component.
# Once the frame is completely processed, this copy is scaled, converted into a screen image and finally rendered on the screen. This usually takes up much more time than simply copying the image, but does not add to the processing time of the component.

Giving exact numbers is impossible here, as this heavily depends on your hardware and scales almost linearly with the number of pixels of the image. In a simple scenario with not a lot of image processing, however, displaying the image accounts for a significant amount of the whole processing time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting Started ==

Try to get the leurre example running, which is in subversion and in the bundle released.  It ships with an AVI file, so you can get it running without messing around with cameras or making it work on your video.   Make sure you can use the display to see images from each stage in the pipeline. 

After that, create a pipeline of your own by selecting approximately one component from each category, which usually looks something like this: 
* Trigger component, usually timer trigger.  Optional. 
* Input component, either camera or from AVI file (for testing purposes also from image file).
* Conversion to color.
* Adaptive background subtraction.
* Thresholding.
* Binary mask, perhaps.
* Blob detection
* Calibration with TSAI
* Tracking, if desired (you get positions even without this)

Build the pipeline gradually, verifying things are working by using the display after each step.  Tune the parameters to make it work well on your video, and take a look at the examples to see the best way to set things up.

== Real-World Examples ==

The following examples may serve as a good starting point for your application. You'll find these examples with all necessary files in the &lt;i&gt;Example&lt;/i&gt; folder of SwisTrack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Design Patterns are common building blocks designed to solve everyday software issues.
Some basic terms and example of such patterns include what we see in everyday life.
Key patterns are the singleton pattern, the factory pattern, and chain of responsibility patterns.

== Factory Pattern ==

The factory pattern is a method call that uses abstract classes and its implementations, to give the developer the most appropriate class for the job.

Lets create a couple of classes first to demonstrate how this can be used. Here we take the example of a bank system.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public abstract class Transaction
{
     private string _sourceAccount;

     // May not be needed in most cases, but may on transfers, closures and corrections.
     private string _destinationAccount;
   
     private decimal _amount;
     public decimal Amount { get { return _amount; } }
   
     private DateTime _transactionDate;
     private DateTime _effectiveDate;

     public Transaction(string source, string destination, decimal amount)
     {
          _sourceAccount = source;
          _destinationAccount = destination;
          _amount = amount;
          _transactionDate = DateTime.Now;
     }

     public Transaction(string source, string destination, decimal amount, DateTime effectiveDate) : this(source, destination, amount)
     {
          _effectiveDate = effectiveDate;
     }

     protected decimal AdjustBalance(string accountNumber, decimal amount)
     {
          decimal newBalance = decimal.MinValue;

          using(Mainframe.ICOMInterface mf = new Mainframe.COMInterfaceClass())
          {
               string dateFormat = DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss&quot;);
               mf.Credit(dateFormat, accountNumber, amount);
               newBalance = mf.GetBalance( DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(1), accountNumber);
          }
          
          return newBalance;
     }
     
     public abstract bool Complete();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This Transaction class is incomplete, as there are many types of transactions:

* Opening
* Credits
* Withdrawals
* Transfers
* Penalty
* Correction
* Closure

For this example, we will take credit and withdrawal portions, and create classes for them.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class Credit : Transaction
{
     // Implementations hidden for simplicity

     public override bool Complete()
     {
          this.AdjustBalance( _sourceAccount, amount);
     }
}

public class Withdrawal : Transaction
{
     // Implementations hidden for simplicity

     public override bool Complete()
     {
          this.AdjustBalance( _sourceAccount, -amount);
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The problem is that these classes do much of the same thing, so it would be helpful, if we could just give it the values, and it will work out what class type we require. Therefore, we could come up with some ways to distinguish between the different types of transactions:

* Positive values indicate a credit.
* Negative values indicate a withdrawal.
* Having two account numbers and a positive value would indicate a transfer.
* Having two account numbers and a negative value would indicate a closure.
* etc.

So, let us write a new class with a static method that will do this logic for us, ending the name {{C sharp|Factory}}:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class TransactionFactory
{
     public static Transaction Create( string source, string destination, decimal amount )
     {
          if( string.IsNullOrEmpty(destination) )
          {
               if(amount &gt;= 0)
                    return new Credit( source, null, amount);
               else
                    return new Withdrawal( source, null, amount);
          }
          else
          {
               // Other implementations here
          }
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, you can use this class to do all of the logic and processing, and be assured that the type you are returned is correct.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class MyProgram
{
     static void Main()
     {
          decimal randomAmount = new Random().Next()*1000000;
          Transaction t = TransactionFactory.Create(&quot;123456&quot;,&quot;&quot;,randomAmount);
          // t.Complete(); &lt;-- This would carry out the requested transaction.
 
          Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0}: {1:C}&quot;,t.GetType().Name, t.Amount);
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Singleton ==

The singleton pattern instantiates only 1 object, and reuses this object for the entire lifetime of the process. This is useful, if you wish the object to maintain state, or if it takes lots of resources to set the object up. Below is a basic implementation:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class MySingletonExample
{
   private static Hashtable sharedHt = new Hashtable();

   public Hashtable Singleton
   {
     get 
      {
         return sharedHt;
      }
      // set { ; }
     // Not implemented for a true singleton
   }

   // Class implementation here..
}
 
&lt;/source&gt;

The {{C sharp|Singleton}} property will expose the same instance to all callers. Upon the first call, the object is initialised and on subsequent calls this is used.

Examples of this pattern include:
* {{C sharp|ConfigurationSettings}} (Generic settings reader)
* {{C sharp|HttpApplication}} (Application object in ASP .NET)
* {{C sharp|HttpCacheUtility}} (Cache object in ASP .NET)
* {{C sharp|HttpServerUtility}} (Server object in ASP .NET)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In today's computerized world, you might not submit a printed resume, but instead you might be asked to fax, email, or post online your resume.  This section will help you to have your resume come out looking the best it can depending upon how you need to submit it.

== Internet Submission ==

=== Emailing a Resume ===

Of all the electronic submission methods, emailing is generally the most preferred, as it is the option that, if done properly, can have the sent resume look the closest to the original. The best way to send a resume via email is to make a PDF file of your resume and attach it to your email message.  (See the [[Find Employment/Electronic Resumes#PDF Resume|PDF Resumes]] section)  

You may also wish to &quot;hedge your bets&quot; by also attaching a copy in Microsoft Word format.  And also include a copy of the resume in the body of your message.  But beware, it is often difficult to make the resume look the same in the body of your message as the original was. (See the [[Find Employment/Electronic Resumes#ASCII Resume|ASCII Resume]] section for hints about how to make it look better.)

=== Submitting a Resume on a Job Website ===

* General Job Sites
** [http://www.hotjobs.com HotJobs]
** [http://www.monster.com Monster.com]
** [http://www.careerbuilder.com CareerBuilder]
* Specific Site to Who You Are Applying for
* Get an Account
* Post Resume
** Form Process
** Copy &amp; Paste (Often ASCII)
** Upload a File (PDF, or Word, etc.)

=== Making a Web Page Resume ===

If you want to have more control of your site, but it requires more technical expertise.

* Make Site
** Word Processing App
** Web Page Design App
** Direct HTML
* Get a Host
** Free Hosts
** Paid Hosts
** Job Site Hosts? (Do any of these support full web page posting?)
* Get a URL
** URL Provided by Host
** Domain Name
** Service such as TinyURL

=== Video Resume ===

* Distribution Methods
** DVD
** &quot;Business Card&quot; CDs
** Web Sites (Examples: YouTube, CareerBuilder)

== Resume File Formats ==

=== PDF Resume ===
Given all format options, generally PDF is the best option.  This is because PDF is an open standard that most recipients will have the ability to view. Further your resume will look nearly identical to your printed resume.  Also, there are several methods of making PDF files including several free open source programs.

One free method that works with most Windows computer programs is the Open Source [[Wikipedia:PDFCreator|PDFCreator]]. If you have a different operating system, [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] is an Open Source program that can be used to create PDF files.

=== ASCII Resume ===



== Faxing a Resume ==

If given the choice, faxing is the least preferred method to get a resume to a potential employer.  But many businesses may only accept faxed resumes. Many of these will then convert the resume to a digital format using [[Wikipedia:Optical Character Recognition|OCR]].  Because this process is not perfect, a resume that looked beautiful before being sent, often may look bad after it arrives.  Further, some parts of your resume may even not go through at all.

To avoid these problems, if you are asked to fax a resume, make a separate resume from your standard one that follows the following rules:

# Do not include underlining or italics
# Do not include shaded print, underlines, boxes around text, or graphics
# Only use white paper, only use black typing
# Bullets should be the simple standard circular bullet.  Do not use fancy bullets.

Even though you resume may not look as nice as your original before faxing, it will most likely look much better than your original would have after faxing.

== Resume &quot;Business&quot; Card ==

While not strictly an &quot;electronic&quot; resume, a novel method of helping you to get a job, is to create a resume &quot;business&quot; card.  These act similar to a business card, and you should have them on you at all times, but instead of telling a person about your business, the cards tell a person about yourself.  The reason for these cards, is that you never know where you might find a job lead, it may happen at a grocery store or waiting in line for a movie.  By having a resume &quot;business&quot; card on you at all time, you are prepared for whenever opportunity strikes.

=== Creating the Resume &quot;Business&quot; Card ===
You may choose to create the cards yourself, using a desktop publishing program like Microsoft Publisher, or word processing program such as Microsoft Word, or OpenOffice.  There are also several websites that make business cards, or you can have a local company make them for you.

=== Things to Place on Your Card ===
Since a resume &quot;business&quot; card has far less room than a resume, it is critical to put the most important things on your card that best sell yourself.  The following are some suggestions:

# Your name (of course)
# Contact information, you may wish to only place an email and phone number, since there is limited room.
# Type of work you are seeking.  Keep this short, don't try to make a whole objective statement.
# Skills, or most relevant experience.  Boil down your resume to no more than 6 bullets that tell the most important things about you to a potential employer.
# Picture or graphic.  If you have a good photo of yourself, place it on your card, or if there is a piece of clip-art that represents you well, feel free to use it.

=== Other Thoughts ===
If you are printing your own resume &quot;business&quot; cards, you may wish to use both sides of the card so you can fit more information.  There are some self print business cards, that allow you to have clean edges (not perforated), but these generally can not be printed on both sides.

I saw your work on the [[Find Employment]] book. You're doing a very good job! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need any help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:05, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

:When I first saw the [[Find Employment]] book, it was only a single page and contained very little information. I had to do a lot of work to get it where it is now (breaking it up into pages, making templates, adding content, etc). Unfortunately, it's not a subject where I'm really an &quot;expert&quot;. Plus, I have lots of other projects I'm working on, and I really lost track.
:So, i'm sorry if i did anything that makes your work harder. If you need any help, or have any questions about why something is the way it is, ask me because it's probably my fault. Good luck! let me know if you need anything. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:28, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

::No worries.  I am being bold, and fixing what I can when I have time.  It will be a work in progress for a little bit of time, because I too have a lot of projects :-) Thanks for your help and support. --[[User:Jacob Walker|Jacob Walker]] 18:14, 9 October 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;available within a mile radius of almost every person in the community of Little Saigon, a Vietnamese enclave located in Orange County, California&quot; maybe yes, but this is about Vietnamese kitchen, so it should be mentioned that best phở you can get is from Hà Nội, right? Besides, there are many other places outside Orange County, California where you can get really good phở (Berlin, Germany for instance)... so maybe it would lead a little too far to list places where there is good phở available...

      <text xml:space="preserve">At at the bottom of the main window, SwisTrack displays a timeline with an evolution of its state (running, not running, productive mode, normal mode) and the frame processing steps. This not only allows you to see at a glance what Swistrack is doing, but also to find out where your CPU power is burnt.

By default, SwisTrack records all important events for approximately one second, and displays them afterwards. Hence, what you see in the timeline corresponds to what SwisTrack was doing &lt;i&gt;one second ago&lt;/i&gt;.

== Elements on the Timeline ==

The following elements are drawn on the timeline:
* The ruler in the background indicates the milliseconds (ms) from the time recording of that particular timeline has started.
* While SwisTrack is running (&lt;i&gt;Run&lt;/i&gt; button pressed), the otherwise white background changes to light gray.
* The lower third of the bar indicates whether SwisTrack is in testing mode (gray) or productive mode (green).
* The blue boxes in the middle represent the steps. Each box corresponds to the processing time of one component. The box of the selected component is highlighted in red. 
* Black vertical lines indicate leap times, but only few components set leap times.

== Changing View and Update Rate ==

The context menu that appear if you right-click on the timeline allows you zoom in and out. This is useful to check out the timings more precisely. You can also drag the timeline left and right with your mouse pointer.

The same context menu also allows you to choose between three update rates: 10 seconds, 1 second (default) and manual update. The 10 second update rate is useful when working with low trigger frequencies. The manual update option allows you to define start and end of an acquisition by double-clicking (anywhere) on the timeline. Double-clicking actually stops the acquisition to displays the acquired events, and starts a new acquisition at the same time.

Note that SwisTrack only records the first 1000 events per acquisition. Hence, when using long slow update rates, SwisTrack may display a &quot;Timeline memory exhausted.&quot; message in the timeline.

== Saving the Timeline ==

To save the timeline, right-click on the timeline and choose &quot;Save timeline as ...&quot;. The timeline is stored as a text file, with one event per line. Each event contains the following information, separated by tabs:
# Time (seconds from acquisition start, double precision)
# Type of event (string)
# Component name (string), if the event is associated with a component

== Speed Considerations ==

Recording events has a very low CPU overhead and therefore cannot be switched off. If you want to switch off drawing the timeline, simply switch to manual update mode.

Hi Emesee ... um, Remi(?),

I guess it's time to close this one. I wanted to draw your attention to the response to your &quot;keep&quot;. This material seems to be maintained by the South-African educational department. Would this satisfy your wishes to somehow keep this material? If so, would you consider changing your vote so that we can delete this unanimously?

== Epistle on Recovery Psychology Textbook Deletion ==
I wanted to say thank you on your vote of confidence regarding to deletion of the Textbook on Recovery Psychology; but it looks like as a Wikibook user I will be drinking a proverbial wiki-hemlock.  No intention was made to confuse or decieve; only an attempt to innovate.  I find it funny the numbers of BA's, BSW's, BS's, MSW's, MA's, LCSW's, PhD's, and PsyD's who are hired to work in my profession; after studying Clinical Psychology are required during their new three month job orientation and training to learn what the U.S. Presiden't New Freedom Commission on Mental Health identifies &quot;educational&quot; materials on Mental health recovery (which is as elementary as anything in an introductory general psychology textbook; but still not available in academic course materials.)  It is quite an injustice to tell anybody who graduates with honors at an educational institution and seeking a job in the mental health profession that has achieved a degree; ''Now that you are hired to work in this profession...you need to forgot what you know! Now, you have to learn this &quot;other way&quot; that is this other doctrine about &quot;recovery&quot; which will mostly contradict what you learned in school, to qualify you for work in this profession.'' I find this absurd and pathetic, I know for a fact that the best of the best minds graduating in clinical psychology are absolutely unemployable in the current U.S. Mental health industry...all because of the &quot;Toe-May-toe and Ta-Mat-o&quot;--[[User:Recovery Psychology|recoverypsychologist]] ([[User talk:Recovery Psychology|talk]]) 22:06, 10 January 2009 (UTC)</text>
