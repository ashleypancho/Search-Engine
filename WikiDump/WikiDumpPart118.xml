== New/Better Idea ==

Could you delete my pages [[Easy Thai]] and [[Hylian]]? I realized that I don't know the languages and that Hylian isn't even fully developed as a conlang. I'm thinking that better would be a page on alphabets if the real book doesn't explain it so well. Thanks in advance Master lan &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Master lan|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 12:02, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
:I've done as you've requested.  Sorry it didn't work out.  [[Lojban Made Easy]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]] in your &quot;Made EZ&quot; series of books still remain and can be developed further.  I wish you well on whatever you choose to work on next. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:24, 2 May 2010 (UTC)

== Sorry about the categories ==

I often forget to check it, and every time I see you correcting me I cringe, I hope at least that you aren't doing it by hand and you have some automated script that check recent edited pages, if not I'm extremely sorry and am willing to work on providing some sort of automated solution. Are you doing it by hand ? If so do you know on a similar script that can be changed to provide automation to the correction ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:37, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
:The only script I've ever used here has been Twinkle, and that's only for tagging pages.  I've heard of AutoWikiBrowser, but that's not going to provide the proper category if it just uses the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which won't sort the subpages, but works fine on Wikipedia.  Every &quot;+category&quot; edit in my contributions history has been by hand.  I check the new pages daily to ensure they've been categorized.  I wish there were a way to add {{tl|BookCat}} to every new page creation's textbox automatically before people start adding the content, but I'm not aware of a way to have that done. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:10, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
== Graphs ==

I was looking at the graph you posed in the reading room a few minutes ago, I was wondering if you knew offhand if any of the other projects also peaked in 2006.  I suppose I am curious if it is a wikibooks phenomenon, an &quot;everything except wikipedia&quot; phenomenon, or a wikimedia phenomenon.  Do you know offhand? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:43, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
:I can't find how I got to the chart I posted before originally, but I can do one better and link to the stats broken down to an even smaller scale (by month) per project.
:*[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikinews/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm#3 Wikinews peaked in Nov 2006 and Jun 2007]
:*[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikiquote/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm#3 Wikiquote peaked in Mar 2007]
:*[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikisource/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm#3 Wikisource peaked in Nov 2007]
:*[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wiktionary/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm#3 Wiktionary peaked in Apr 2008]
:*[http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm#3 Wikibooks peaked in Jul 2006] (we peaked earliest)

:*[http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/ChartsWikipediaEN.htm#3 Wikipedia peaked in Mar 2007] (but has held steady)
:Of note is that some of these peaks do not reflect the overall average, where the projects have held steady at an edit rate below the peak. Most of them are flukes and do not represent the pinnacle of a continuing rise.  Wikibooks, though, does have a situation where the peak represents a point after a period of increasing contributions.  I think getting a statistical trend would be more helpful. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:10, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
== Greetings and Apologies ==

Hi, sorry I left Bookmarklets orphaned as you noted.  I ran out of time and was intending to finish when I got back on.  I'm pleasantly surprised to see someone guarding these pages.  I hope to build them up in the coming weeks, as I have a couple friends who have become my JavaScript students and I hope to get their help with explaining JavaScript in small chunks.  As implied [[Talk:JavaScript#Is_anyone_going_to_do_any_work_on_this_book.3F|here]], I hope to use the [[wikia:javascript|JavaScript Wiki]] as the reference counterpart to this book.  If you have any questions or input I'm all ears. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 07:58, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

== [[Template:LOC]] ==

Hi!

Do you know what was the criteria for choosing only those classes of LOC classification which are in the template? [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]18:44, 11 May 2010 (UTC)
:Well, keep in mind that it was all settled even before I got here, but they appear to correspond with the subcategories of [[:Category:Library of Congress]].  I don't think it would be too much trouble to add further subclassifications if needed; the most effort required would be reclassifying existing books into more fine-grained classifications. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:54, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[Talk:The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Q&amp;A]] restored.  Notice that it has a speedy tag in place with Swift stating it should be deleted, transwikied, or moved.

:: The speedy rationale didn't cite speedy deletion criteria, the discussion cited didn't cover the tagged page and Swift (who had nothing to do with those speedy tags other than to remove similar ones from a couple of other pages) never stated that it should be deleted. I suggested it but left it to the book contributors. This page should never have been speedily deleted. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:26, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

== Missed a couple pages on a recent move ==

[[Advanced Structural Analysis - CAE LinuxAdvanced Structural Analysis - CAE Linux/Part I - Theory/Philosophy of Structural Analysis|This page]] and [[Advanced Structural Analysis - CAE LinuxAdvanced Structural Analysis - CAE Linux/Part I - Theory/Materials and Their Properties|this one]] (links piped because they're long) seemed to be missed in a recent move of the other [[Advanced Structural Analysis]] pages. They were probably formed by a mispiped redlink at some point in the past and not having the right prefix got missed. The first page seems to at least have some content, but was already recreated post-move, so I'm unsure how to proceed here. (Both links are [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned]] and thus came up under my [[User:Xerol/Cleanup#Miscellaneous_Cleanup_Tasks|war on orphans]].) Since you performed the moves and deletes I think you'll have a better idea of what to do than myself. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 04:32, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
:Took care of them by merging their histories.  As for orphaned pages, with the subject pages, a book's book-specific category should include a link to the book's main page, which is why books only listed on subject pages are not necessarily orphaned. Many of the &quot;orphaned&quot; books will be listed on a subject page but not have a book-specific category with link due to the fact that they are only a single page, undeserving of a category. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
::I've just recently noticed that; last time I was very active (2008ish) there were non-category pages which had lists of books. For now I'm collecting a list of the technically orphaned pages on my userspace (there were only 451 orphans in total when I started, and less than a fifth have been 'unresolvable' for these reasons thus far) and I'm thinking of putting them into a special catalog page (along with some other stubs and abandonments) such as Wikibooks:Orphanage or :Adoption Agency, just basically a place for the links to reside and something a little more visible than the Pages needing attention category. I think the main reason a lot of these pages have been abandoned (some haven't had significant edits since 2006 (and some might even be RFDed for this)) is that they're so hard to get to. Proper categorization helps, but it only goes so far. Once I finish rounding up the orphans I'm going to start improving on some of them, and perhaps push for a sitewide project to expand or purge a lot of the ancient stubs. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 13:53, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
:::From my own experience observing RFDs, people are reluctant to delete stubs if they provide a meaningful outline, no matter how old they may be.  I'm sympathetic to your goals, however.  By the way, have you taken an in-depth look at how the categories and subject pages interrelate and glanced at the [[WB:CCO|card catalog office]]?  They've undergone significant changes since May 2009, when you last contributed before your recent comeback. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:00, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
::::I've started to go through and just look at what's included in the root pages of various books to get a feel for how it works. I guess it works well enough, it's just a bit arduous of a task for new editors and looks like it's taking dedicated people just to keep up with it. Finding the right categories for different topics (especially in DDC and LOC indices) is the worst of it, and even then it's not that hard, it just looks hard (which is enough to turn some people away).
::::Thing is, a lot of the pages don't look like they have much of a future as a ''textbook'', regardless of how good of an outline they are (or in some cases how much content they already have). A lot of the pages would work very well as ''reference'' pages in the back of a more established book, and maybe the best way to go about those is to collect them together and use them as jumping points for broader-subject books.

:::::Might [[Research on Tibetan Languages: A Bibliography]] be an example of your last point?  I do agree on the DDC/LOC classifications, and [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#DDC.2FLOC_Classifications|proposed]] that they be removed to lower the barrier to entry for newcomers.  I have to say that it's good to see someone else taking a big-picture look at things and cleaning up. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:16, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
::::::Yeah, pretty much exactly what I was talking about. You can hit &quot;random book&quot; ten times and find at least one, and usually more, every time. Almost seems like there needs to be a project that's &quot;between&quot; wikisource and wikibooks, just a resource for bibliographies and sources. Aside from ''creating'' a book that's going to actually ''use'' all those resources, there isn't really a place for it on here (well, maybe*) and it doesn't really belong on wikisource either.
::::::&lt;small&gt;*That page in particular, if cleaned up, would probably work by itself, if it was structured as an analysis of publications covering the subject. Even then it's a stretch and still needs significant work.&lt;/small&gt;
== [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Statistics Category:Statistics]: Include links to externals Java applets? ==

Would it make sense to enter content (as described below) in each of the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Statistics  Probability Distributions] sections which are currently empty (under [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Statistics Category:Statistics]? For instance, we can have a several sentences describing each distribution (univariate, multivariate, discrete and continuous) and then include an explicit link to the [http://socr.ucla.edu/htmls/dist/ corresponding interactive Java applet] that demonstrates the big-3 distribution characteristics (center, spread and shape), shows the effects of the distribution parameters, and provides means of calculating critical and probability values (for the specific distribution)? This would require Java-enabled browsers, albeit most modern browsers (2005+) are Java enabled by defaults. (Disclaimer, I'm associated with the UCLA group that developed these applets, however, this is not an *advertisement*, and I truly believe these Java applets will be very useful to many Wikiversity (novice and expert) users.

:I would encourage you to add any content that you feel would be beneficial to the book and for readers.  What you suggest sounds like a positive addition, given that Java applets cannot be embedded directly in the book. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:58, 29 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A bath fizzer''' or ''bath-bomb'' is a mixture of perfume or scent mixed an  alkaline and an which reacts in water.

==Ingredients==
Look at the ingredients on baking powder: These usually just contain sodium bicarbonate which may be written as NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but may also contain lemon juice or citric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). These are the alkaline and acid you need. Citric acid is the main ingredient of fizzy lemon or orange drink crystals and bath salts. in Europe, citric acid is often listed as as E330, bicarb is E500. Click this link to learn more about E numbers!

Some pharmacists stock boxes of pure crystalline sodium bicarbonate and refined citric acid crystals, but these things are cheaper and more easily sourced simply by reading the labels on various  powder products sold in ordinary shops. The wanted product should be the main (ideally only) ingredient, but expect to find colour, flavour and texture products mixed. 

==Experiment==
The 'best' mixture will depend on the exact nature of the products you can find, but a good starting point is an equal mixture of both ingredients, which we call 1:1 ratio of 50%. You may have try different mixtures: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, until the most lively reaction occurs, particularly with baking powder, which often contains rice flour. 

Swirl the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball. The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a sort of shell. Don't do this if you have cuts or grazes, because it can hurt. Once the ball has set, place it on a dry surface,  wash your hands thoroughly and dry them. Getting just the right moisture to make the ball 'set' will require a bit of trial and error! 

Now take some water that is as hot as is comfortable for a bath, drop the ball into it, and watch what happens!

Finally try adding some aromatic cooking powder such as dried lavender, vanilla or nutmeg. - that is it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{documentation subpage}}
==Template instructions==
This template serves to simplify the writing of chemical formulae.  For example,
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|H|2|O}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
will yield:
: {{chem|H|2|O}}

===Algebraic expression as subscript===
Algebraic expression are rendered as subscripts (but must not contain upper case letters).
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''&amp;amp;nbsp;+&amp;amp;nbsp;2}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives
: {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}

===Charge===
Ion charge superscripts are also supported:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|H|3|O|+}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
yields:
: {{chem|H|3|O|+}}

Simultaneous subscripts/superscripts are automatically handled (use a hyphen for the minus sign):
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|SO|4|2-}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives:
: {{chem|SO|4|2-}}

===Atomic number and mass number===
The first parameter can be used for mass number.
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|4|He}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives:
: {{chem|4|He}}

The first two parameters can be used for mass number and atomic number.
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|4|2|He}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives:
: {{chem|4|2|He}}

;Note: 
:Only the first two parameters can handle two consecutive plain numbers (i.e. without a plus sign or a hyphen (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;) following). Otherwise the template will loop.

===Linking===
The optional parameter &lt;tt&gt;link&lt;/tt&gt; changes the formula into a link. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|link=w:water|H|2|O}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
will yield:
: {{chem|link=w:water|H|2|O}}

For linking individual elements can be linked in the following manner.
&lt;pre&gt;
{{chem|[[w:Hydrogen|H]]|2|[[w:Oxygen|O]]}} 
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives 
: {{chem|[[w:Hydrogen|H]]|2|[[w:Oxygen|O]]}}

==Notes==
*To include &quot;=&quot; in the formula, use &quot;&amp;amp;#61;&quot; For example, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{chem|CH|2|&amp;amp;#61;CH|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; yields {{chem|CH|2|&amp;#61;CH|2}}.

*The template accepts up to twenty parameters in addition to &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;.
*This template uses {{tl|su}}.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
==Purpose==
Template for creating two smaller lines of text on one actual line, this can be used for scientific notations of uncertainty and physics symbols, such as nuclides and particles.

It was named after the '''&amp;lt;sup&gt;''' and '''&amp;lt;sub&gt;''' HTML tags, which share the first two letters of their name with this template. This template uses the third letter of the name of these tags, '''p''' and '''b''', as the name of the argument that drives the output of the top and bottom line, respectively.

[[File:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|]] '''Editors beware''': ''these templates use all kinds of hacky tricks to make the output render correctly in a wide variety of browsers. If you plan to make changes to this template, please make sure you verify that this template renders correctly after those changes in all mayor browser. This list includes the latest version(s) of Chrome, Firefox, MSIE, Opera and Safari as well as any version of those browsers that is still in common use, such as MSIE 6.0 and 7.0!''

== Arguments ==
{|
|'''p''' || The contents of the top line.
|-
|'''b''' || The contents of the bottom line.
|-
|'''a''' || The alignment of both lines ('''r''' for right, '''c''' for center aligned, default is left aligned)
|-
|'''w''' || The size of the characters ('''f''' for fixed width (monospace), default is whatever the current font is)
|}

==Examples==
'''Simple example''': &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;X{{su|p=a}}X{{su|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=b}}X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:X{{su|p=a}}X{{su|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=b}}X
'''Left aligned (default)''': &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;X{{su|p=aaaaa|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=bbbbb}}X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:X{{su|p=aaaaa|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=bbbbb}}X
'''Right aligned:''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;X{{su|a=r|p=aaaaa|b=b}}X{{su|a=r|p=a|b=bbbbb}}X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:X{{su|a=r|p=aaaaa|b=b}}X{{su|a=r|p=a|b=bbbbb}}X
'''Center aligned:''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;X{{su|a=c|p=aaaaa|b=b}}X{{su|a=c|p=a|b=bbbbb}}X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:X{{su|a=c|p=aaaaa|b=b}}X{{su|a=c|p=a|b=bbbbb}}X
'''Smaller font''': &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;small&gt;X{{su|p=a}}X{{su|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=b}}X&amp;lt;/small&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;X{{su|p=a}}X{{su|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=b}}X&lt;/small&gt;
'''Larger font''': &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;big&gt;X{{su|p=a}}X{{su|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=b}}X&amp;lt;/big&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;big&gt;X{{su|p=a}}X{{su|b=b}}X{{su|p=a|b=b}}X&lt;/big&gt;

| '''New structure'''
*Modules
**Introduction / motivation
**Importing
**Exporting

*Building a standalone application
**''Currently in Haskell in Practice/General Practices. This definitely should be in the Beginner's trail.''

*Higher-order functions
**''Having this module tucked at the end of Elementary felt kinda restraining''
**Quicksort examples
**Associativeness of type signatures (with a very demanding exercise)
**Currying

*More on datatypes
**Enumerations (without deriving context - first usage of deriving)
**Records
**Parametrized types (should focus on usage with constructors)
**(newtype is missing)

*Other data structures
**Trees (and their map and fold)
**map and fold for arbitrary datatypes (''temporary location'')

*Classes
**''The division between the current modules on classes seem arbitrary, so this proposal merges them.''
**Class declarations 
**Inheritance
**Type constraints (on signatures, constructors and instances. Mentions newtype)
**Deriving (note the change in topic order)

*Standard classes
**''The idea is expanding the diagram currently at Class Declarations to a full-fledged module.''
**''This might be a more natural location for exploration of Prelude types than the cheat sheets of Haskell Basics''
**''Also, derivation might fit better if moved here as well (although that might make the module too long) 

''Note: Keeping track of state should be deleted, there is probably no good reason to attempt such a module without a proper discussion of monads.''

== Tell when and where to cross the road safely. ==

=== Zebra Crossing ===

Give traffic plenty of time to see you and to stop before you start to cross. Vehicles will need more time when the road is slippery. Remember that traffic does not have to stop until someone has moved onto the crossing. Wait until the traffic has stopped from both directions or the road is clear before crossing. Keep looking both ways and listening, in case a driver or rider has not seen you and attempts to overtake a vehicle that has stopped.

=== At Traffic Lights ===
 
There may be special signals for pedestrians. You should only start to cross the road when the green figure shows. If you have started to cross the road and the green figure goes out, you should still have time to reach the other side, but do not delay.  If no pedestrian signals have been provided, watch carefully and do not cross until the traffic lights are red and the traffic has stopped.  Keep looking and check for traffic that may be turning the corner. Remember that traffic lights may let traffic move in some lanes while traffic in other lanes has stopped.

=== Pelican Crossings ===

These are signal-controlled crossings operated by pedestrians. Push the control button to activate the traffic signals. When the red figure shows, do not cross. When a steady green figure shows, check that the traffic has stopped then cross with care.  When the green figure begins to flash you should not cross. If you have already started you should have time to finish crossing safely. At some pelican crossings there is a bleeping sound to indicate to blind or partially-sighted people when the steady green figure is showing and there may be a tactile signal to help deaf/blind people. When the road is congested, traffic on your side of the road may be forced to stop even though their lights are green. Traffic may still be moving on the other side of the road, so press the button and wait for the signal to cross.

=== Puffin and Toucan crossings ===

These differ from pelican crossings as there is no flashing green figure phase.  On puffin crossings the red  and green figures are above the control box on your side of the road. Press the button and wait for the green  figure to show.  On toucan crossings cyclists are permitted to ride across the road.

=== Staggered Pelican or Puffin Crossings ===

When the crossings on each side of the central refuge are not in line they are two separate crossings. On reaching the central island press the button again and wait for a steady green figure

=== Crossings Controlled by an Authorised Person ===

Do not cross the road unless you are signalled to do so by a police officer, traffic warden or school crossing patrol. Always cross in front of them. 

Where there are no controlled crossing points available it is advisable to cross where there is an island in the middle of the road. Use the Green Cross Code to cross to the island and then stop and use it again to cross the second half of the road.

== Give road safety rules for: ==

=== Walking along the road by yourself. ===

Download a free pdf copy of &quot;A Kid’s Guide to Safe Walking&quot; from [http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/Traffic%20Injury%20Control/Articles/Associated%20Files/811026.pdf NHTSA Kids ]

#Always walk on the sidewalk. Walk on the sidewalk if there is one.
#If no sidewalk, walk facing traffic. If there is no sidewalk and you have to walk on the road, be sure to walk facing traffic.
#Be safe. Be seen. Brightly colored clothing makes it easier for drivers to see you during the daytime. But at night, you need to have a flashlight or wear special reflective material on your shoes, cap, and jacket or on your arms or legs that bounce the car’s lights off you and back to the driver. This light should caution the driver that there is something or someone moving and they should slow down and be careful.


=== Riding your bicycle. ===

Download a free copy of &quot;Rules of the Road for Riding Safely&quot; from [http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/bicycles/pdf/6124-B-v2-rules.pdf NHTSA Kids]

#Ride in a straight line, single file.
#Go with the traffic flow. Ride on the right in the same direction as cars.
#Obey all traffic signs and signals.
#Ride with both hands on the handlebars except when signaling a turn or stop.
#Stop and look left-right-left for traffic before entering a street.
#Walk your bike across an intersection.
#Stay alert – use your eyes to look for things that could make you fall, like potholes, cracks, pebbles, or wet leaves.
#Stay alert – use your ears to listen for traffic. Don’t wear earphones while riding.
#Watch for parked cars and cars pulling out or into parking spaces or driveways.
#Check your equipment. Make sure your bike tires are properly inflated and that the brakes work.
#Don’t forget your bicycle helmet. Wear it flat on your head and buckled!


=== Riding a horse ===

#Never ride alone. Ride with someone you know to be experienced and thoughtful.
#Wait until all riders are mounted to move off.
#If you could be returning after dark, wear reflective clothing and take a small flash light.
#Keep at least one horse length between you and the horse in front.
#Do not pass the trail boss.
#When riding during hunting season, make lots of noise and wear visible clothing such as a fluorescent vest. Using rhythm beads on your horse is a good way to alert hunters that you are NOT a deer.
#Do not leave the trail. Holes and unsafe surfaces, sharp objects and hornets nests may exist in unknown areas such as open fields.
 
	
=== Walking with a group ===

#Find a safe place to cross, then stop
#Stand on the pavement near the kerb
#Look all around for traffic and listen
#If traffic is coming, let it pass – look all around again
#When there is no traffic near, walk straight across the road
#Keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross.

== Explain why you should wear a seatbelt when riding in a car. ==

40,000 people die each year in car accidents, the leading cause of death for people under the age of 35. Safety belts can prevent death in about half of these accidents. If you know this and are still not wearing a safety belt, you may need to ask yourself why not. But first, let's look at what happens when a car crashes.

'''The Human Collision'''

Imagine running as fast as you can - into a wall. You'd expect to get pretty banged up. Do you think you could stop yourself if the wall suddenly loomed up when you were two feet away from it? This is exactly the situation you face when the front of your car hits something at only 15 miles an hour. The car stops in the first tenth of a second, but you keep on at the same rate you were going in the car until something stops you - the steering wheel, dashboard or windshield - if you're not wearing your safety belt.. Bad enough at 15 miles an hour, but a 30 miles you hit &quot;the wall&quot; four times as hard as you would at 15. Or to put it another way, with the same impact you'd feel as if you fell three stories. 
 
A properly worn safety belt keeps that second collision - the human collision - from happening.

== Listen to a Highway Patrol Officer or other safety officer talk about safety for children. ==
=== McGruff the Crime Dog ===
Contact your local Sheriff's Department to schedule a visit from McGruff the Crime Dog.  He and his partner are excellent options for this requirement as the children really get a kick out of McGruff.

== Play a safety game. ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">To run the PureDyne live distribution (either CD or DVD) from a hard drive:

1.  Copy the folders from the CD or DVD to your hard drive.

2.  Enter the following text in your /boot/grub directory, member menu.lst if you use the old version of grub:

&lt;pre&gt;
title PureDyne (when using the first partition of the first hard drive - hd0,0)
root (hd0,0)
kernel /live/vmlinuz ramdisk_size=100000 boot=live persistent username=lintian hostname=puredyne
initrd /live/initrd.img
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is for when it's on the hard drive your system thinks of as 'first' - for /dev/sda1 you'd enter hd0,0 for root, for /dev/sda2 you'd enter hd0,1, for /dev/sdb1 you'd enter hd1,0 etc. 

I don't know how to set up Grub 2 - the developers de-simplified it.  A friend tells me that for Grub 2 there is now a set of templates in a grub directory under /etc which can be edited, and the last of these (they are named starting with 10, 20, etc) is for free-form old style grub instructions like the above.  Good luck with it. 

3. boot, and select PureDyne from the menu.

----
HOWEVER - if you just do it this way, any changes you make will NOT persist between sessions.   To set up persistent storage, you must also have a Linux partition labeled live-rw
----

This is easiest on a flash drive.   Get a flash drive you can re-format that has a fair amount of space - at least 4 GB.  8 or 16 is better, if you're going to do a lot of new installs.   You can use a USB stick, an SD card, whatever you have.   Use Gparted or some other utility to re-format it as:
&lt;pre&gt;
A.  A primary partition
B.  filetype EXT2 or EXT3
C.  with the label live-rw.   This label, live-rw (lower case, as typed) is what
 the system looks for.  If Puredyne finds it, it stores any changes you make to that 
partition, and reads them from that partition the next time you boot. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

With this persistent storage on a flash partition, you can boot PureDyne from a CD or DVD at a friend's house and have your environment right there, or use it on your computer or laptop to have the same persistent environment. 


CAUTIONS - 

If you boot up and none of your changes are there - the system for some reason didn't recognize your flash drive.  Unplug it, re-plug it, and reboot.

BACK UP THE CONTENTS OF YOUR FLASH DRIVE REGULARLY to your hard disk or somewhere - you don't want to lose those directories.  You can format a new flash drive with the label live-rw and copy the contents to that, too - two copies of your personal environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I reverted your change regarding usage of the word paella for the following reason: The word paella means pan only in Spain's Valencian community. Paellera is the word for the wide shallow pan used to make paella (the recipe) in all other parts of the world, including Spain outside of Valencia. Also, the Royal Spanish Academy, the organization which regulates the Spanish language, defines both words as correct for the pan. Please see these links:

==Introduction==

* V34 - OS1.3x Gadtools did not exist
* V36 - OS2.0x First Introduction 
* V37 - OS2.04 NewLook rendering scheme 
* V39 - OS3.0x NewLook menus added - GT_GetGadgetAttrs() added - 
* V40 - OS3.1x Fixes


Until AmigaOS™ 2.0, there was no unified look and feel design standard — application developers had to write their own objects (buttons, requesters and menus), with Intuition providing minimal support. With AmigaOS™ 2.0 came gadtools.library, which provided standard widget sets, and the Interface Style Guide, which explained how applications could be laid out for consistency to the user. 




:[http://gega.homelinux.net/AmigaDevDocs/gadtools.html you should refer to the GadTools Library chapter] and [http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/AmigaMail_Vol2_guide/ Amiga list]. 

Gadtools is a deprecated interface. Try just using BOOPSI gadgets (much easier to use, too) or MUI Zune instead. 
BOOPSI is the underpinning for MUI, bgui and Reaction.

==Gadgets==

===Underscore===

The underscore character, `_' is the recommended marker-symbol.  So, for example, to mark the letter &quot;F&quot; as the keyboard equivalent for a button labelled &quot;Select Font...&quot;, create the gadget text:

 ng.ng_GadgetText = &quot;Select _Font...&quot;;




===Create===

http://thomas-rapp.homepage.t-online.de/examples/gadtools.c



===Modify===

To change the flags and the pot and body variables after the gadget is displayed, the program can call Intuition's NewModifyProp().

 void NewModifyProp( struct Gadget *gadget, struct Window *window, struct Requester *requester, 
                     unsigned long flags, unsigned long horizPot, unsigned long vertPot,
                        unsigned long horizBody, unsigned long vertBody, long numGad );

The gadget's internal state will be recalculated and the imagery will be redisplayed to show the new state.  When numGads (in the prototype above) is set to all ones, NewModifyProp() will only update those parts of the
imagery that have changed, which is much faster than removing the gadget, changing values, adding the gadget back and refreshing its imagery.

Each kind of GadTools gadget requires one or more of these IDCMP classes: IDCMP_GADGETUP, IDCMP_GADGETDOWN,
IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE, IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS and IDCMP_INTUITICKS. 

programs that use Gadgets always require notification about window refresh events.  Even if the application performs no rendering of its own, it may not use the WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH window flag and must always set IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW.

The attributes of a gadget are set up when the gadget is created.  Some of these attributes can be changed later by using the GT_SetGadgetAttrs() function: 

    void GT_SetGadgetAttrs (struct Gadget *gad, struct Window *win,
                            struct Requester *req, Tag tag1, ... )
    void GT_SetGadgetAttrsA(struct Gadget *gad, struct Window *win,
                            struct Requester *req, struct TagItem *taglist)




===Menus===

To set up GadTools menus

 GetVisualInfo() and FreeVisualInfo()    CreateContext() 





===List===

http://thomas-rapp.homepage.t-online.de/examples/lv.c

When CreateGadget() is called multiple times (for each gadget), each new gadget is automatically linked to the previous gadget's NextGadget field, thus creating a gadget list.  Second, if one of the gadget creations fails (usually due to low memory, but other causes are possible), then for the next call to CreateGadget(), next_gad will be NULL and CreateGadget() will fail immediately. This means that the program can perform several successive calls to CreateGadget() and only have to check for failure at the end.

can not use GadTools scroller gadgets in window borders 



===String===

Most regular Intuition string gadgets which default to FALSE



===Scroll===

http://thomas-rapp.homepage.t-online.de/examples/scroll.c
http://thomas-rapp.homepage.t-online.de/examples/iconify.c

Get the imagery for the gadgets from BOOPSI by allocating an object containing the appropriate imagery (imageclass) and then using this to draw the graphic into the button. 





==Reference==

Some code relies on AOS implementation of gadtools library which uses fake (non-boopsi) gadgets where especially the more complex ones (listview) have most gadget (input) handling done in the GT_GetImsg/GT_FitlerImsg() funcs. In AROS gadtools library uses real boopsi gadgets and therefore behaves differently.

LAYOUTA_Spacing (UWORD) - Extra space to place between lines of listview (default 0). 
GTLV_ItemHeight (UWORD) - The exact height of an item. This is normally useful for listviews that use the GTLV_CallBack 	    rendering hook (defaults to ng-&gt;ng_TextAttr-&gt;ta_YSize). 
GTLV_CallBack (struct Hook *) - Callback hook for various listview operations. Only callback supported is for custom rendering of individual items in the listview. The call back hook is called with:
		A0 - struct Hook *
		A1 - struct LVDrawMsg *
		A2 - struct Node *
The callback hook *must* check the lvdm_MethodID field of the message and only do processing if it equals LV_DRAW. If any other value is passed, the callback hook must return LVCB_UNKNOWN 
GTLV_MaxPen (UWORD) - The maximum pen number used by rendering in a custom rendering callback hook. This is used to optimize the rendering and scrolling of the listview display (default being the maximum pen number used by all of TEXTPEN, BACKGROUNDPEN, FILLPEN, TEXTFILLPEN, and BLOCKPEN.

GTMX_Spacing (UWORD) - The amount of space between each choice of a set of mutually exclusive gadgets.  This amount is added  to the font height to produce the vertical shift between choices (default 1). 
GTMX_Scaled (BOOL) - If true, then mx gadget imagery will be scaled to fit the gadget's width &amp; height.  Otherwise, a fixed size of MXWIDTH by MXHEIGHT will be used. When setting this tag to TRUE, should typically set the height of the gadget to be (ng.ng_TextAttr-&gt;ta_YSize + 1). (default FALSE.) 
GTMX_TitlePlace - One of PLACETEXT_LEFT, PLACETEXT_RIGHT, PLACETEXT_ABOVE, or PLACETEXT_BELOW, indicating where the title of the gadget is to be displayed. Without this tag, the NewGadget.ng_GadgetText field is ignored for MX_OPTION gadgets. 

LAYOUTA_Spacing - FOR COMPATIBILITY ONLY.  Use GTMX_Spacing instead. The number of extra pixels to insert between each choice of a mutually exclusive gadget.  This is added to the present gadget image height (9) to produce the true spacing between choices. (default FontHeight-8, which is zero for 8-point font users). 
&lt;/pre&gt;

GTNM_Format (STRPTR) - C-Style formatting string to apply on the number before display. Be sure to use the 'l' (long) modifier. This string is processed using exec.library/RawDoFmt(), so refer to that function for details. (default &quot;%ld&quot;) 
GTNM_MaxNumberLen (ULONG) - Maximum number of bytes that can be generated by applying the GTNM_Format formatting string to the number (excluding the NULL terminator). (default 10). 
GTNM_Clipped (BOOL) - Determine whether text should be clipped to the gadget dimensions (defaults to FALSE for gadgets without borders, TRUE for gadgets with borders). 
&lt;/pre&gt;



PALETTE_OPTION (color selection):
&lt;pre&gt;
GA_Disabled (BOOL) - Set to TRUE to disable gadget, FALSE otherwise (default FALSE).

GTPA_ColorOffset (UBYTE) - First color to use in palette (default 0).
GTPA_ColorTable (UBYTE *) - Pointer to a table of pen numbers indicating  which colors should be used and edited by the palette gadget. This array must contain as many entries as there are colors displayed in the palette gadget. The array provided with this tag must remain valid for the life of the gadget or until a new table is provided. (default NULL, which causes a 1-to-1 mapping of pen numbers).

GTSL_DispFunc ( LONG (*function)(struct Gadget *, WORD) ) - To calculate level to be displayed.  A number-of-colors slider might want to set the slider up to think depth, and have a (1 &lt;&lt; n) function here. No Default  Your function must take a pointer to gadget as the first parameter, the level (a WORD) as the second, and return the result as a LONG. 
GTSL_MaxPixelLen (ULONG) - Indicates the maximum pixel size used up by the level display for any value of the slider. This is mostly useful when dealing with proportional fonts. (default FontWidth*MaxLevelLen). 
GTSL_Justification (UBYTE) - Determines how the level display is to be justified within its alotted space. Choose one of GTJ_LEFT, GTJ_RIGHT, or GTJ_CENTER (default GTJ_LEFT). 

PGA_Freedom - Set to LORIENT_VERT or LORIENT_HORIZ to have a vertical or horizontal slider (defaults to LORIENT_HORIZ). 
&lt;/pre&gt;



STRING_OPTION (text-entry):
&lt;pre&gt;

STRINGA_ReplaceMode (BOOL) - If TRUE, this string gadget is in replace-mode (defaults to FALSE (insert-mode)). &lt;/pre&gt;



TEXT_OPTION (read-only text):
&lt;pre&gt;
GTTX_Text - Pointer to a NULL terminated string to be displayed, as a read-only text-display gadget, or NULL. (default NULL) 

GTTX_CopyText (BOOL) -	This flag instructs the text-display gadget to copy the supplied text string, instead of using only pointer to the string.  This only works for the initial value of GTTX_Text set at CreateGadget() time.  If you subsequently change GTTX_Text, the new text will be referenced by pointer, not copied.

LayoutGadgetTags
&lt;pre&gt;
GTMN_Menu (struct Menu *) - Pointer to the Menu structure whose FirstItem is the MenuItem supplied. If the menu items are such that they need to be columnized or shifted, the Menu structure is needed to perform the complete calculation. For the following tags, please see the description under LayoutMenusA().  Their behavior is identical when used in LayoutMenuItemsA(). 
	    GTMN_TextAttr
	    GTMN_NewLookMenus
	    GTMN_Checkmark
	    GTMN_AmigaKey
	    GTMN_FrontPen

&lt;/pre&gt;





Trying to manually open gadtools in the console code (for menus). I need it to be opened manually, because it *will* fail for the boot shell (see below), so I need to handle the case where it's not available. 
It seems to me that auto-opening non-resident libraries during boot is a really bad idea... Will lots of stuff break if that's turned off? Alternatively, is there a method to prevent auto-opening on a case by case basis?  IIRC you just need to declare the base pointer manually. This will prevent from getting it (and associated library opening code) from libautoinit. With programs it works. I think it works with residents. 
The autoinit code is linked in by the libbase variable. E.g. the autoinit code defined the global libbase variable of a library. If you define 'struct Library *GadToolsBase' somewhere in your code as a global
variable the autoinit code won't be linked in. Please, only use it when really needed and put proper comments why it is needed. The specific case here is avoiding duplicating a bunch of menu-layout code from gadtools in the console code to add menus to the console windows without requiring gadtools to be linked into the kernel. It means the boot shell won't get the menu, but I think that's a fair enough trade off vs. making things really messy. 

And it's only called in when global library bases are used at all, which shouldn't be the case with romable code, should it? That's something I didn't think about. Do I mess up stuff if I declare a global GadToolsBase, or are bss properly handled? If it messes things up, are there alternative ways of preventing the auto-opening? (committed a basic menu structure for the console handler that uses a global GadToolsBase). 

It's non-optimal, actually, since on m68k the only 'know to always exist' memory for the .bss is in Chip RAM, which is both precious and dog slow (due to contention with video and audio operations). For this usage it's probably fine, but if you can find a way to allocate it in a structure that the console handler passes around (con_base?) and dereference it from there, it's probably a better way to do. AllocMem() memory allocates from the highest priority first. See rom/devs/filesys/AmberRAM/handler.h's 'struct Handler', and the macros that immediately follow it for an example of how to do this. The console handler does already put lots of stuff in it's handler data structure, so if there is a way I can suppress auto-opening without a global variable, it's trivial enough to put it in there. 

Is there a good reference somewhere on all the things I need to take care of during a NEWWINDOWSIZE event?
You probably know this already, but NEWWINDOWSIZE doesn't block until ReplyMsg() like SIZEVERIFY. 


Endian issues 

There may be method structs in the code which uses WORD for some of the (coord) fields and then when calling the method it does something like gDoClassMethod(... , (x &lt;&lt; 16) | (y &amp; 0xffff), ...). This relies on big endianess and therefore fails on x86.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Future of Robots ==
 

Robots are a product of computer technology and as a reprogrammable multi-function manipulator. The robots are also designed to move material parts, tools through programmed motions for the performance of variety of tasks. The majority of people view robots as a machine-man that possesses super-human capabilities and functions in a technological sphere between people and machines.
Some day in the future one would assume that robots might conquer the world by being able to lighten the workload on humanity and even be able to provide companionship. On the hand robots might even become closer and closer to the decision making ability of humans. During the RoboBusines showcases fledgling mobile robot industry in October 2007, through various presentations and an exhibition the showcases highlighted the most current commercial robot world. In the showcases they were able to find key capabilities of the future robots, which include the following:
'''I.	Telepresence'''&lt;br&gt; 
This kind of robot allows people to hold remote controlled videoconferences from far distances, rather than traveling great distances in order to have face to face meeting. On the other hand, telepresence is another way of letting the users perceives no difference from the actual presence. This ability to be able to manipulate a remote object or environment is an important aspect of real telepresence systems. In remote controlled telepresence the movements of the user’s hands are sensed by wired gloves, inertial sensors and then a robot in a remote location copies those movements. For example, physicians use videoconferences to be able to talk with their patients when not close with them.

'''II.	Rescue and lifting'''&lt;br&gt; 
This kind of robot capability is mostly used in battle field. They are used in battlefield to             help soldiers clear out building, and also sense if there is danger in buildings before they enter.

'''III.	Navigation''' &lt;br&gt;
Navigation could allow the robots to be able to create their own route plans to deliver items or scan for assets. On the other hand, a robot programmed for navigation purposes for example might guide people through a museum, instead of people.

'''IV.	Humanoid robots'''&lt;br&gt; 
These kinds of robots are autonomous, because they change to their environment while reaching their goal. A fully functioning autonomous robot has the ability to do the following tasks:
I.	Gain information about the environment.
II.	Work without the help of human in extended period of time.
III.	Able to mobilize all its parts without human’s assistance in its environment.
IV.	Capable of avoiding situations that are harmful to people, property.

Since humanoid robot try to simulate the human structure and behavior they are most of the times more complex than any other kinds of robots. Humanoid robots are created to imitate some of the physical and mental tasks that human undergo daily. Scientists from different kinds of fields combine efforts that one day humanoid will be able to understand human intelligence reason and act like human.
 

== Programming Concepts ==

The programming concept for robots is to describe the desired robot behavior and must be supported by a programming system. These programming systems can be distinguished by both their aim and by their method of programming. Programming system is typically undertaken by developers before the low or medium level tasks. Level tasks programming is the allocation of tasks by consumers.
Robot programming concepts is a sophisticated human-robot interactions techniques programming. The robot must model and reason about the human programmer’s intentions and be able to recognize plans presented by human.
Robots systems have special programming demand related to their complex interactions in real environment, their complex sensors, and actuators. These programming demands provide appropriate human-robot programming interactions such as programming languages, tools, and distributed infrastructures. Robot programming system has three important conceptual components that include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''1.'''	The programming component that includes designs for programming languages, libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable a programmer to describe desired robot behavior.&lt;br&gt;

'''2.'''	The underlying infrastructure includes the designs for architectures that support and execute robot behavior descriptions, especially in distributed environments.&lt;br&gt;

'''3.'''	The design of interactive systems that allow the human programmer to interact with the programming component, to create, modify and examine programs and system resources, both statically and during execution. &lt;br&gt;

The programming system consists of the two main programming methods which are the manual programming and automatic programming.

Manual programming – involves text based or graphical system, which is common in industry where languages are used in simple robots. Text based systems have diverged from robot specific languages to develop more higher level programming such as C++, Java, Haskell, Robot C.

Automatic programming – includes the programming by demonstration (PBD), which is currently popular for training specific tasks, particularly in industry. Of the two main programming methods, considerable effort is aimed at improving the PBD system. For example, in automatic programming a robot may pick out important movements and plan on its own path between points, or execute the key steps in different order.

 

== Robot Control ==


The main component in robot control is the brick shaped computer called the NXT intelligent Brick. It is the state-of the art programmable intelligent brick that acts as the brain for robots. The NXT intelligent Brick can take input from up to four sensors and control up to three motors. The brick has a 100 × 64 pixel monochrome LCD display and four buttons that can be used to navigate a user interface using hierarchical menus. The speaker is also on the brick that can play sound files at sampling rates up to 8 kHz. Power is supplied by 6 AA (1.5 V each) batteries and by a Li-ion rechargeable battery and with a charger.
In addition to the NXT intelligent Brick, robot control has the following capabilities:
Motors – the motors are the primary source of power. The robot will use the motors to move around, lift loads, operate arms, grab objects, pump air, and perform any other task that requires power. There are also different kinds of electric motors that share the property of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy.
Touch Sensors – the touch sensors work more or less like the push button portion of the doorbell, when pressed a circuit it completed and electricity flows through it.
Light Sensors – the light sensors defect light and measure its intensity. In spite of its limitations you can sue it for a broad range of applications.
Probably the biggest problem facing a robot control is the overall system reliability. A robot might face any combination of the following failure modes: 
Mechanical failures – these might range from a temporarily jammed movement to wedged gear trains or a serious mechanical breakdown.
Electrical failures – this is when a computer itself will not fail but loose connections of motors and sensors which are a common problem.
Sensor unreliability – sensors will provide noisy data (data that is sometimes accurate, sometimes not) or data that is simply incorrect (touch sensor fails to be triggered).

== Mathematics of Robot Control ==


Mathematics of robot control is a powerful tool for system design and control especially models of system’s dynamics. This applies to any system but more specifically on human and humanoid robots. The dynamic control is generally a desirable solution if the dynamics can be calculated so the dynamic effects are important for a particular control problem. Computations time reduces rapidly with new computers, some dynamic problems (like link flexibility) are still considered time consuming. 
Robotics was started from mathematical modeling of robot kinematics and dynamic. Two leg walking was considered with the aim of generating a stable gait, and the arm and hand were modeled in order to allow manipulation. For example, rehabilitation devices appeared to suitable where prostheses were made for leg, arm and hand, and also orthosis for arm and legs, thus resulting in an active exoskeleton. Some of these mutilegged robots were designed while trying to solve the transport on rough terrain. 
Regarding the mathematical description full kinematic and dynamics were involved from the very beginning of robotics. In this mathematical modeling of a walking robot, Newton’s and Euler’s equations were used to describe the mathematical of robot control. 


== Robot Programming Languages ==


The development of modern robot programming languages started in the mid 70’s. Some examples of programming languages in the mid 70’s are VAL (predecessor of Adept’s V+) and AML. These programming languages represent some of the early robot programming languages which had sophisticated data structures. One of the essential ingredients of modern robot programming languages is through usage of frame concept. Languages using the frame concept should supply programmers with multitude of built-in functions to specify such transform. For instance the ZERO ++ programming languages provides many functions to convert x,y,z coordinates.

There is no single robot programming language available, allowing flexible specifications of functional interdependences of path properties. The choice on which language to choose depends on following few points:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''I.''' Having previous experiences and making sure that you are comfortable with the kind of programming language to use.&lt;br&gt;
'''II.''' The time and effort you plan to work on the program, because not every programming language is equally hard or easy to work with.

Text based programming is common in industry where simple robot languages are used, they are typically provided by the robot developer. With the development of technology nowadays, text based system has diverged from these robot languages to develop more general purposed in higher level programming languages that are suitable for any robot. Typically this involves extending existing languages such as C++, java, Haskell.

The LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT kit comes with programmable languages called NXC. The NXC stands for Not eXactly C, this is a simple programming language for the Lego Mindstorms. The NXT has a bytecode interpreter which is provided by LEGO that can be used to execute programs. The NXC compiler translates a source program into NXT btyecodes, which can then be executed on the target itself.

The NXC is not a general purpose programming language there are many restrictions that stem from limitations of the NXT bytecode interpreter. The NXC Application Programming Interface (API) describes the system functions, constants, and macros that can be used by programs. All Application Programming Interface are defined in a special file known as the “header file” which is automatically included when compiling a program. Both the NXC languages and the API provide information needed to write the NXC programs.

NXC is also a case- sensitive language just like C and C++, which means that the identifier for example “xYz” is not the same identifier as “Xyz”. Similarly the “if” statement begins with the keyword “if” but “IF”, “If”, or “IF’ are all just identifiers. NXC also uses lexical rules to describe how sources file break into individual tokens. This basically includes the way comments are written and valid characters for identifiers. 

ROBOTC one on the robot programming languages is a C programming Language that has an easy to use development environment. ROBOTC is supported by several different kinds of robotics platforms which include the popular platforms such as LEGO MINDSSTORMS NXT. This is a high performance program that can easily pinpoint the problem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The following is an example of a simple ROBOTC program:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
task main() &lt;br&gt;
{&lt;br&gt;
nxtDisplayString (4,”Hello World!”)&lt;br&gt;
wait1Msec (5000);&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Basically the above program when run, it will display the words “Hello World” on the NXT display screen.

== Obstacle Avoidance ==
Obstacle avoidance is one of the most important aspects of the robotics world. Without having a way to avoid obstacles, robots would be very limited in what they could do, especially those that rely on a program that requires them to navigate around or to a specific location. For instance, if a robot was programmed to move from point A to point B and had no way of detecting obstacles so that it can avoid it, that robot would not be able to get to its location if the path to the designated location was not a straight line with no obstacles in its way. The robot will eventually run into an obstacle and will continue to try to move against it because it could not detect the obstacle in its path.

With a way to avoid obstacles, robots would have a better navigations system and be able to traverse obstacles with ease. Detectors such as touch or light sensors help robots to detect obstacles. Through the use of programs, the robot can be directed to move in a number of ways around the obstacle to avoid it once it is detected. The robot could be programmed to reverse and then turn to find a different path or simply turn left or right as soon as the obstacle is detected. Using the light sensor, the robot can detect lines on the floor that it can either avoid or can be programmed to follow. The line can be laid out in a path and once the robot picks up the dark line, it can be programmed to follow it without leaving its path.



== Task Planning and Navigation ==
Task planning and navigation refers to the programming of the robot and how it goes about performing its assigned tasks and how it is able to navigate itself around its environment and be able to avoid obstacles to avoid collisions to be able to continue to function properly. The navigations system of the robot is very important. If a robot is not able to move around in its environment with ease and avoid obstacles then it will not be able to complete its task properly. 
	A robot navigates around its environment using sensors to detect whether it is too close to an object to avoid a collision. This is only one type of sensor that a robot may use to avoid collisions. Other sensors include light sensors that a robot may use to follow a specified path drawn out on the floor. For instance, the robots light sensor can be programmed to pick up a dark colors. Once the sensor picks up the dark color, which can be a black line on the floor, the robot will navigate itself to follow that line. This can be used to program the robot to follow a specific laid out path. Touch sensors can be used to help a robot avoid collisions with obstacles and walls. The robot can be programmed to move around in its environment freely, once it bumps or runs into an obstacle, the touch sensor will activate and depending on how the robot is programmed, it will back up and plot out a new path until it runs into another obstacle. 
	Task planning is important as it lays out the order in which a robot will complete its tasks. A robot can be programmed to complete several tasks, but if the tasks aren’t completed in a certain order, the end result may not be desirable. Task planning can range from plotting out tasks in a routine order or branch off into different decision making paths. For instance if a robot is programmed to go straight until it either hits an obstacle or detects a dark line on its path, it can be programmed to do many tasks depending on the programmer. Not only does task planning have to do with decision making for the robot, but it also controls loops that the robot will perform upon meeting specific requirements. Task planning is important because it keeps the robot in check to make sure that it performs all of its tasks as desired. A robot that isn’t able to plan out its tasks properly would just go about performing random tasks as it sees fit and may be completely undesirable to the way the programmer wants the robot to perform.
 

== Robot Vision ==
Vision systems are generally used in manufacturing companies to perform simple tasks such as counting objects that pass by on a conveyor belt, reading serial numbers or searching for surface defects. These tasks are simple programs that work through the use of a camera installed on the robot and are detected after the object is scanned. A robot does not process images the same way a human does. While humans can rely on inference systems and assumptions, computing devices must see by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features such as pattern recognition engines. Machine vision and computer vision systems are capable of processing images consistently, but computer-based image processing systems are typically designed to perform single, repetitive tasks. &lt;br&gt;

'''Applications of machine vision'''

The applications of machine vision (MV) are diverse, covering areas of endeavour including, but not limited to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Large-scale industrial manufacture&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Short-run unique object manufacture&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Safety systems in industrial environments&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Inspection of pre-manufactured objects (e.g. quality control, failure investigation)&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Visual stock control and management systems (counting, barcode reading, store interfaces for digital systems)&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Control of automated guided vehicles (AGVs)&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Quality control and refinement of food products&lt;br&gt;
'''•'''	Retail automation


== Knowledge Based Vision Systems ==
Vision systems are generally used in manufacturing companies to perform simple tasks such as counting objects that pass by on a conveyor belt, reading serial numbers or searching for surface defects. These tasks are simple programs that work through the use of a camera installed on the robot and are detected after the object is scanned. A robot does not process images the same way a human does. While humans can rely on inference systems and assumptions, computing devices must see by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features such as pattern recognition engines. Machine vision and computer vision systems are capable of processing images consistently, but computer-based image processing systems are typically designed to perform single, repetitive tasks. A knowledge based vision system would allow a robot to make inferences and assumptions. The robot would be able to identify an object and then be able to determine if that object were to be dangerous or not. The robot would first be given a list of objects to identify. Using its knowledge system, the robot would use the web to find images of the items it was given to find. Once it finds and identifies all of the objects, the robot will start on its search for the objects. Not only are the vision sensors an essential part in this process but the motion controls must also be functioning. The robot must be able to move and traverse through obstacles to be able to find its objects.



A knowledge based visions system in turn links to the artificial intelligence of a robot. To be able to create a fully functional android, the robot must have a working artificial intelligence and a working knowledge based visions system. Not only will the android be able to think on its own, it will be able to view the world as a human does. Whatever the robot sees, it will be able to make its own assumptions and own perceptions of its surrounding and the objects that it identifies. 

 

== Robots and Artificial Intelligence ==
Artificial Intelligence can be described as the mind of a robot. It is their ability to learn, reason, solve problems, perceive, and how they understand everything around them. You can build a robot and program it to do certain tasks but it will not be intelligent. That robot will perform only those tasks in which it was programmed to do in a continuous loop. If you programmed the robot to pick up a box in a specific location and move it to another destination and you were to move the box at the starting destination not too far away from where it is supposed to be, the robot will not be able to process in its mind that the box has moved. It will register that the box is not there so it will halt what it was programmed to do until the box is back where it is supposed to be. That robot may be able to move and do what it is programmed to do but without an artificial intelligence, it will not be able to learn or perceive the the changes in the envirnoment around it. One of the main challenges today is implementing an advanced artificial intelligence into a robot. Although robots may only be able to perform tasks that they are programmed to do, one day, the creation of an artificial intellegince will allows robots to learn and think just as humans do. Not only will these robots be able to perform tasks that they have been programmed to do, they will be able to adapt to their environments and situations, learn, reason, solve problems, and even be able to process and understand language. Robots will one day be able to think and act like humans and even be able to interact and communicate with humans also. 


	When most people think of artificial intellegice and its use in robots, the most common image that will pop up is the image of a humanoid robot. This image of the robot is of one that can talk and think like a human being and is capable of making its own decisions. Although this is one way that artifical intellegince can be implemented into robots, it is not the only way. Artificial intellegince can be used for more then just androids. If implemented into a machine that has the task of monitoring something , that machine will be able to perform its task more efficiently and will be able to do more then just simple tasks.&lt;br&gt; 

'''Advantages:''' &lt;br&gt;
'''1.'''	Provide answers for decisions, processes and tasks that are repetitive&lt;br&gt;
'''2.'''	Hold huge amounts of information&lt;br&gt;
'''3.'''	Minimize employee training costs&lt;br&gt;
'''4.'''	Centralize the decision making process&lt;br&gt;
'''5.'''	Make things more efficient by reducing the time needed to solve problems&lt;br&gt;
'''6.'''	Combine various human expert intelligences&lt;br&gt;
'''7.'''	Reduce the number of human errors&lt;br&gt;
'''8.'''	Provide strategic and comparative advantages that may create problems for competitors&lt;br&gt;
'''9.'''	Look over transactions that human experts may not think of
&lt;br&gt;

'''Disadvantages:''' &lt;br&gt;
'''1.'''	No common sense used in making decisions&lt;br&gt;
'''2.'''	Lack of creative responses that human experts are capable of&lt;br&gt;
'''3.'''	Not capable of explaining the logic and reasoning behind a decision&lt;br&gt;
'''4.'''	It is not easy to automate complex processes&lt;br&gt;
'''5.'''	There is no flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments&lt;br&gt;
'''6.'''	Not able to recognize when there is no answer&lt;br&gt;

==Introduction==

here is a global environment variable (Language) that holds the current active language.

You can check this yourself by typing &quot;getenv language&quot; (without the quotes) into a shell. Or it can be used in a script as variable $Language.

It can also be done programming using the OpenLocale() function (with NULL as parameter to return the current locale information in struct Locale) 




===System===

The locale.library provides us tools to localize applications. Localized strings are stored in separate languages catalogs files, under Catalogs directories. AROS Development Environment macros can build the required files. This document gives you a work-flow to localize applications or localize existing applications or create catalogs files for existing localized applications.

For each language supported, the system has a LOCALE:Languages/ file: 
 LOCALE:Languages/klingon.language

System translations are in LOCALE:Catalogs/ language directories:
 LOCALE:Catalogs/klingon/

Each application needs its proper Catalogs directory:
 my_app/Catalogs/

Translation files are in languages directories:
 my_app/Catalogs/klingon/my_app.catalog



===Appplications===

Each application supporting localization has its own catalogs directory:
 AROS/Contrib/my_app/catalogs

Strings are initially stored in a catalog description file:
 AROS/Contrib/my_app/catalogs/my_app.cd

&lt;pre&gt;
This file is structured as:
;
MSG_TITLE (//)
My Application
;
MSG_MY_MESSAGE (//)
My application message
;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;


Translations are stored in catalog translation files:
 AROS/Contrib/my_app/catalogs/klingon.ct

Structured as:
&lt;pre&gt;
## version $VER: my_app.catalog 1.0 (23.05.2004)
## language klingon
## codeset 0
;
MSG_TITLE
tlhIngan maH
;
MSG_MY_MESSAGE
Sujatlh 'e' yImev
;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The catalogs build file




Localization is provided by:
 AROS/Contrib/my_app/locale.c

 AROS/contrib/my_app/locale.h


Application:
_(MSG_MY_TITLE)

As STRPTR.

Or with:
__(MSG_MY_MESSAGE)

As IPTR (1)
The application source file

In AROS/Contrib/my_app/my_app.c, initialize locale with:


...
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;locale.h&quot;

main()
{
&lt;/source&gt;
...

Use the strings names from the .cd file. For instance, on a Zune application:
MUIA_Application_Title, __(MSG_TITLE),
...
}
The application build file
&lt;pre&gt;
Add the locale file target to the FILE section of AROS/Contrib/my_app/mmakefile.src:
FILES    := my_app \
               ...
               locale

Add the pre-requisite target for locale:
#MM- my_app: \
  ...
#MM my_app-catalogs
Build the locale
AROS/

To build the application and locale files:
make my_app

To update the translation (.ct) files:
make my_app-catalogsWarning:	If you are updating the description (.cd) files, build my_app target to update its strings file.
&lt;/pre&gt;





===Build System===

AROS Metamake builds required files with its build file present as:
 AROS/Contrib/my_app/catalogs/mmakefile.src

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
# Copyright © 2004, The AROS Development Team. All rights reserved.
# $Id: mmakefile.src,v 1.2 2004/02/19 22:05:38 john doe Exp $

include $(TOP)/config/make.cfg

%build_catalogs mmake=my_app-catalogs \
  name=My_App \
  subdir= \
  dir=$(AROSDIR)/Extras/My_App/Catalogs
Application directory
AROS/Contrib/my_app/
&lt;/source&gt;




==FlexCat==

FlexCat is a tool to create Amiga localization catalogs, as well as source and header files, out of catalog descriptions. 

The version in AROS/tools is 2.4, with a developers.readme saying to treat it as freeware with source code, but not to fork it. The history file tells us that version 2.4 is from 28 November 1999. Not all websites referred to in the documentation still exist, but [http://wfmh.org.pl/projects/flexcat/ flexcat] indeed supports the 2.4 version, with no mention of further development. Is a port a fork? If not, does a former port become a fork e.g. just because AROS becomes 68k? What if there originally was only one port, but someone else does another one - who is the forker? Maybe the author was just too imprecise and should have provided a definition of fork... 

1 The AROS project stamps are for 7 March 2009, so there may well have been changes for the AROS version over the last decade.

2 The last release on Aminet is version 2.7 on 29 June 2010, by the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexcat/ project], which claims a copyright starting in 2002. 

The [http://wfmh.org.pl/projects/flexcat/ original homepage] is outdated. It's now a GPL licensed [http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexcat/ product] which is maintained here. Of course the 2.7 distribution does not contain the source code, because the project is Open Source and the [http://flexcat.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flexcat/ source code] is available for everybody. The release archives contain binaries only for all supported platforms. 

* Update the the sources in AROS from a stable release of FlexCat 
* Make it buildable again, perhaps my merging in commits from prior commits.
* C_h_orig.sd is no longer available in current FlexCat. Find a replacement which works with the AROS build-system. 
* Bring back all fixes for AROS to the current trunk of FlexCat. Either bei joining the project on Sourceforge or sending it to the maintainer. 

We would appreciate if you would join the team and commit the changes to the SVN repository on sourceforge.net. Just ask Jens Langer (damato#light-speed.de) to add you the the list of developers. 

Optionally: wait till the &quot;vendor&quot; branch is available in AROS repository and work with that.

==Introduction==

All muimaster library offsets after MUI_MakeObjectA() are incorrect. There should be 4 private entries between MUI_MakeObjectA and MUI_Layout(). NOTE: after MUI_Layout(), not MUI_MakeObjectA(), I was blind this time :) (Bernd Roesch noticed this in 2006, not much has happened..). You can always have multiple .conf files that get used depending on the specific port, or you could modify the build process to preprocess the files before parsing them, or... 

This breaks all native m68k MUI custom classes (usually by corrupting the stack or crashing in some graphics library region routines, no wonder my debugging attempts didn't make any sense) 

So, whats the solution without breaking all existing ports?
Inject 4 fake entries just for the m68k port? and the PPC one too... even better, add an ifdef for AROS pre-ABIv1. I thought .conf files don't support port specific changes? (muimaster.conf needs 4 empty lines after MUI_Layout).  

Can you do '#ifdef' in *.conf files?!

And, what about the AROS_LHx() macros that have the offset numbers in them? 
The offset numbers can be macros themselves. As for .conf files, I don't think you can (Staf?), but you could preprocess them with the normal preprocessor (again, Staf? :) 
No, but you can specify the conffile option to build_module. You should be able to do something like in the mmakefile.src (untested). 

&lt;pre&gt;
ifeq($(AROS_TARGET_CPU), m68k)
CONFFILE := muimaster_m68k.conf
else
CONFFILE := muimaster.conf
endif

%build_module ...\
    conffile=$(CONFFILE)

Or this ;-)

ifeq($(AROS_TARGET_CPU), i386)
CONFFILE := muimaster_i386.conf
else
CONFFILE := muimaster.conf
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

= Tal Gambit =
2...d5 is the Tal Gambit, pioneered by Latvian grandmaster Mikhail Tal. It is one of the recommended counters to the direct Grand Prix Attack. 

If white accepts the gambit with 3.exd5, black's response is 3...Nf6, threatening the d5 pawn and gaining time in development.

If white chooses to decline the gambit, it is usually done by 3.e5. While white has a large space advantage now, it is still considered to be a favorable position for black. The response 3...e6 resembles and can transpose into a line of the French Defense, the McDonnell-Labourdonnais attack, which is favorable for black. 

Nowadays, modern Grand Prix Attack players play 2.Nc3 before playing 3.f4.

== Learn about the ladybug. What are the characteristics of the ladybug? ==
[[File:Ladybird.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Ladybird or Ladybug]]
[[File:Coccinellidae (Ladybug) Anatomy.svg|thumb|Basic anatomy of a ladybird]]

Ladybugs (also called lady birds and lady beetles) are small, oval-shaped winged insects. These shiny insects are usually red with black spots or black with red spots on the wing covers. The number of spots identifies the type of ladybug. Most ladybugs are less than 1/4 inch (4-8 mm) long. As ladybugs age, the color of the spots fade. Birds are the major predator of the ladybug. Ladybugs will play dead when threatened. 

'''DIET:'''
These tiny predators are usually very welcome in gardens because ladybug larvae and adults eat aphids, mealybugs, and mites (which are garden pests). Ladybug larvae can eat about 25 aphids a day; adults can eat over 50. There are about 5,000 different species of ladybugs throughout the world. A common species is the two-spotted ladybug; it is orange red with one black spot on each wing cover. 

'''ANATOMY'''
Ladybugs are winged insects (a type of beetle). When they are not flying, the flight wings are covered and protected by a pair of modified wings (called elytra). When flying, the elytras open up, allowing the wings to move. The area above the elytra is called the pronotum (it is part of the thorax). The pronotum frequently has grayish spots on it. The head of the ladybug is very tiny (and frequently confused with the pronotum). Females are larger than males. 

Like all insects, ladybugs have: 

:- 6 jointed legs (arranged as 3 pairs) 
:- One pair of antennae 
:- An exoskeleton made of chitin (a type of strong protein similar to the one that forms our hair and fingernails) 
:- A three-part body consisting of the: 
:- Head (which has the mouthparts, compound eye, and antennae) 
:- Thorax (the middle section which is where the 3 pairs of legs and the pairs of wings attach) 
:- Abdomen (which holds the excretory and reproductive organs and most of the digestive system


== Describe the lifecycle of the ladybug.  Make a poster. ==


The ladybug, like all beetles, undergoes a complete metamorphosis during its life. The life stages of the ladybug are: egg --&gt; larva --&gt; pupa --&gt; adult. 
    
&lt;gallery&gt;File:MarienkäferEier 03.JPG|1. Female ladybugs lay tiny '''Eggs''', usually laid in a small mass (fertilization is internal). 
File:Ladybug larva.JPG|2. The '''Larvae''' that hatches from the egg is small and long and has 6 legs.
File:Coccinella septempunctata emerging from pupa1.jpg|3a. '''Pupa1''' As it rapidly grows, the larva molts (sheds its skin) several times.
File:Coccinella septempunctata emerging from pupa2.png|3b. '''Pupa2''' After reaching full size, the larvae attaches itself to a plant leaf or stem (by its &quot;tail&quot;).
File:Coccinella septempunctata emerging from pupa3.png|3c. '''Pupa3''' The larval skin then splits down the back, exposing the pupa.
File:Coccinella septempunctata emerging from pupa4.png|3d. '''The pupa''' is about the size of the adult but is all wrapped up, protecting the ladybug while the it undergoes metamorphosis into its adult stage.
File:5-stip LHB 09 cropped.jpg|4. '''Adult Ladybug''' This last stage in the metamorphosis takes a few days.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Are all ladybugs red? Explain ==

&lt;big&gt;There are over 450 species in North America. Some are black or vary from reddish-orange to pale yellow. The most common in the US is the Convergent Lady Beetle, which is orange with black spots and the number of spots vary per species. There are 5 states in the U.S. that have the Ladybug as the state insect.&lt;/big&gt;

== Make 2 ladybug pet rocks. Give one away. ==


'''&lt;big&gt;Ladybug Rocks&lt;/big&gt;'''

By: Amanda Formaro

'''Supplies:'''

:-Smooth, round or oval rocks, washed and dried 
:-Acrylic craft paint in colors of our choice 
:-Black acrylic craft paint 
:-2 wiggle eyes for each ladybug 
:-Black permanent marker 
:-Acrylic matte sealer spray 
:-Tacky Glue


'''Instructions:'''

:Completely wash and dry all rocks. 
:Paint rocks in desired colors, allow to dry. Apply second and third coats if needed. Lighter colors will require more coats than darker shades. 
:Paint head on using black acrylic craft paint. There is no pattern needed, simply paint about ¼ of the rock black in the &quot;front.&quot; 
:Use a black permanent marker to draw a straight line down the center of the rock, starting at the center of the base of the &quot;head.&quot; 
:Dip the end of a large paint brush, or the eraser of a pencil, in black craft paint. Dot on the spots, reloading with paint after every dot. 
:Once the paint is dry, spray the rock(s) with acrylic sealer spray. Allow sealer to dry completely. 
:Using white craft glue, attach wiggle eyes and let dry.


'''Tips:'''
If you are doing this in a group setting such as Adventurers or a classroom, you may find it easier to prepare the rocks ahead of time. Wash, dry and apply a coat of gesso (recommended: Liquitex Basics Gesso) to each rock. This is a craft medium (white) that works well with many projects. It will also create a base so that less coats of color paint will be required. 
Bigger rocks are easier for small hands to manipulate. They are also heavier, so be sure that there are enough adult helpers for a group of little ones. 
White and black paint can be used instead of wiggle eyes. Simply dot on white paint, allow to dry, then use a smaller tool to dot on the black. 
If you cannot find suitable rocks outside, you can purchase them at most craft stories.

== What day of the week did God create ladybugs? ==


&lt;big&gt;Ladybug was created on the 6th day.&lt;/big&gt;

== Ladybug Facts ==

There are nearly 5,000 different kinds of ladybugs worldwide and 400 which live in North America.

:* A female ladybug will lay more than 1,000 eggs in her lifetime.

:* A ladybug beats its wings 85 times a second when it flies.

:* Aphids are a ladybug's favorite food.

:* Ladybugs chew from side to side and not up and down like people do.

:* A gallon jar will hold from 72,000 to 80,000 ladybugs.

:* Ladybugs make a chemical that smells and tastes terrible so that birds and other predators won't eat them.

:* The spots on a ladybug fade as the ladybug gets older.

:* During hibernation, ladybugs feed on their stored fat.

:* Ladybugs won't fly if the temperature is below 55 degrees Fahrenheit.

:* The ladybug is the official state insect of Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Tennessee.

:* The male ladybug is usually smaller than the female.

:* The Asian Lady Beetle can live up to 2-3 years.

When (although this is more myth than history) Zhou of Shang became the King of China, he started flirting with Daji, playing in pools of wine and forests of meat with nude people running around in them. If anyone disagreed with him, he put them on a 'paoluo'. In this torturing method, the person to be punished has to walk on a red-hot beam with fire burning under it. If he makes it to the end, he lives. Otherwise, he drops into the fire and is burnt. When Mei Bo tried to tell him to stop, Mei ended up turned into a kind of bolognaise and the lords were forced to eat him. As this was not beneficial to the people, rebellions happened. And, like the Shang dynasty, it was the ''lords'' who revolted.

==The story==
A long time ago, the Zhous&lt;ref&gt;Please do not confuse the Zhous with Zhou of Shang. They are different.&lt;/ref&gt; lived near the Wei River and built a strong state there. Although they belonged to the Shangs, they were getting more and more powerful and started to think of overthrowing the Shangs. The 'king' who thought of this was Wen of Zhou, but he failed to do so during his lifetime. His successor, Wu of Zhou, inherited his father's wishes. With the help of his father's assistant Jiang Ziya, he started plotting to topple the Shangs.

Wu swore against Shang at Muye. He motivated his army by reminding them of Zhou of Shang's cruelty. Then he raised the flag and started to dart towards the Shang army. At that moment, Zhou and Daji were watching dance shows, drinking wine and eating meat in his palace. When one of his men informed him of the Zhou army, he called his officials for an emergency meeting. Right then his army was trying to conquer the Dongyi tribe, so they could not be called back. So he decided to make his prisoners and slaves fight for him. That was the beginning of the Battle of Muye.

Although there were a hundred and seven thousand people in his army, most of them were prisoners and slaves who despised Zhou, and refused to fight. They dropped their spears and joined the Zhou army. (The Zhous' army, not Zhou's army.) Zhou of Shang knew that it was his last hour. He escaped to his palace and ate a lot. Then he ordered his men to burn the palace. He committed suicide and the Shang dynasty ended.

==Historical significance==
Wu of Zhou rushed to the palace, shot the dead Zhou a few times, stabbed the corpse with his sword, and cut off his head and put it on the flagpole. (The way Henry VIII did with ''his'' prisoners.) He announced that the Shang dynasty was over and that the Battle of Muye was won. He declared himself the King of China and set up the Zhou dynasty.

What, then, is so important about starting a new dynasty? The Zhou dynasty was the first dynasty to set up the ''fengjian'', ''jingtian'', ''zhongfa'' and ''liyue'' institutions. Fenjian is just like feudalism, but technically it is a kind of system where the lords, who are divided into dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons, had to pay tribute the king and fight for him. In return they would be allowed to rule over their land and divide up the land for their eldest sons. This system was later used in dynasties such as Western Han (partially), Xin and Western Jin. And of course, a similar system was used in Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
We want to provide a consistent way for users to navigate around in applications and their functions.  To do this we provide a standard site navigation breadcrumb view.

== Method ==
Each site style module has a breadcrumbs() function.  This function looks at the context of the application in the site and conditionally displays each level of the site as a path of links.

To support this function we will need to create a function that displays the depth we are in the site.  We call this the 
'''$style:web-depth-in-site''' variable.

Here is an example of how to calculate it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function style:web-depth-in-site() as xs:integer {
(: if the context adds '/exist' then the offset is six levels.  If the context is '/' then we only need to subtract 5 :)
let $offset := 
   if ($style:web-context)
then 6 else 5
    return count(tokenize(request:get-uri(), '/')) - $offset
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This function counts the number of &quot;/&quot; characters that appear in the current uri using the function get-uri().  It then does some offset calculations so that the root node of the site has a count of 1.

The $style:site-home is a path to the site home that can be renders in the context of the site.  For example you might set it to:

   let $style:site-home := '/rest/db/org/my-org'

The Application ID and Application Name should also be set in the $style:app-id $style:app-name variables.

This can be extracted from URI and the app-info.xml file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function style:breadcrumbs() as node() {
   &lt;div class=&quot;breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;
   
      { (: Check if Site Home should be displayed :)
      if ($style:web-depth-in-site gt 1) 
        then &lt;a href=&quot;{$style:site-home}/index.xq&quot;&gt;Site Home&lt;/a&gt;
        else ()
      }
      
      { (: Check if Apps Link should be displayed :)
        if ($style:web-depth-in-site gt 2) then
             (' &amp;gt; ' , &lt;a href=&quot;{$style:site-home}/apps/index.xq&quot;&gt;Apps&lt;/a&gt;)
        else ()
      }
      
      { (: Check if App Name should be displayed :)
        if ($style:web-depth-in-site gt 3) then
             (' &amp;gt; ' , 
             &lt;a href=&quot;{$style:site-home}/apps/{$style:app-id}/index.xq&quot;&gt;
             {$style:app-info/xrx:app-name/text()}
             &lt;/a&gt;)
        else ()
      }
   &lt;/div&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== &quot;disruptive criticism&quot; ==
In a few days we should extend the discussion to cover further steps. For instance how you define &quot;disruptive criticism&quot; ? (criticism is the expression of unfavorable opinion(s) on some event(s), the way criticism is taken depends mostly on the openness of the target of the critic, especially in written form, where the &quot;tone&quot; can easily be misinterpreted).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:26, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
:I'm not proposing or pushing any particular definition of &quot;disruptive criticism.&quot; The user in question is well-known as a critic of the WikiMedia Foundation, and of specific personalities involved, calling attention to and documenting alleged ethical failures. However, there would be a sign that criticism is disruptive, and that is that actual disruption is caused, i.e., incivility, calls for blocks, tenacious argument back and forth, etc. That doesn't mean that the criticism is ''improper,'' but that it is causing or triggering a problem. The &quot;problem&quot; is, as you hint at, not only with the critic but with someone objecting or reacting to criticism. Hence I'm suggesting that a few users here monitor this account. If disruption is being caused, the user would be asked to cease pushing any disruptive position here, outside of confined and civil and careful discussion, while some consensus is sought, with community advice, on how to proceed. The user should not use Wikibooks as a safe harbor from which to launch attacks on the WMF, other WMF wikis, or users, or anyone, for that matter, ''even if they are in some sense justified.''

:However, it could arise that there would be some occasion here to properly make critical remarks, and the key to avoiding cross-wiki disruption would be to address a developing situation promptly. The user should not be accused of deliberate disruption (&quot;trolling&quot;!) but should be asked to stop, pending community advice, whatever might be cross-wiki controversial, until and unless there is a place here specifically appropriate for that. For example, someone could theoretically write a textbook about wiki ethics. What standards would apply to that? Could it document, for example, specific case histories with diffs? I'm not hastening to answer that question!

:On Wikiversity, where similar things might happen with an educational resource or class, I'm suggesting that ethical guidelines be drafted and followed first, before diving deeply into what could, again, be controversial. Or, alternatively, to to proceed slowly and carefully, without having detailed guidelines, and come to a screeching halt if there is complaint, backing up, and then building consensus on each step.

:In other words, if there is no problem, there is no problem. If there is a problem, support should be given so that it does not get out of hand. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 02:02, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

::I agree, the &quot;disruption&quot; may would depend on making critics out of context and scope of discussions. He hasn't never done so here, preemptively admonishing him may be counterproductive as there may be occasions that pertinent information will not be provided because of a fear of retaliations even more if it is formalized in a policy or decision that directly targets the user.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:12, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
:::The procedure would be to politely request that he avoid creating disruption. He's very sophisticated, he'll understand, I believe.

:::I see that all hell has broken loose at the Reading Room. This was totally unanticipated by me, and this is definitely not Thekohser's doing. My condolences. I suggest addressing this very carefully and slowly. Don't take any steps that are not on solid ground. If necessary, there are open channels to the WMF and the Board, and to Jimbo himself, but let's not go there if it is not necessary. I'd think that nobody wants a repeat of what happened in March at Wikiversity, and that then resulted in Jimbo resigning his ability to do local blocks as Founder, and other similar intrusive tools, such as page deletion. Mike is here asserting himself much as Jimbo did in March, and, very definitely, that was not supported then and I don't see why it would be now. Were there some urgent situation, the matter would be different. But there is not. If Thekohser is unblocked, that, in itself, can cause very little damage, if any. It's a wiki, after all.

::::I've long ago lost all fear of retaliations, and not being an admin myself nor having an interest in any of the special political functions provides some clear relativistic clearness on my actions and in any retaliation. I do agree that Mike is disrupting a process that would have been closed and well addressed. It seems that he is acting not by principles or by our rules by what seems a special feud with the user. In fact he is usurping the community tools to proceed and enforce his personal goals (clearly not the goals of the community as no support has been given, especial note that the steward that made the first block and was contacted also decided not to defend it).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:52, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
:::::He's risking a lot for practically no gain. I've seen this happen with long-term volunteers when they are burning out. They become uncivil, dominating, and incapable of understanding that they are not the project. I've been hearing this about Mike for some time. The WMF machinery moves very slowly... but it does move. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 02:56, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
Hi. I can hear you. While I appreciate your concern, Abd, I'm neither burning out nor risking a lot. Thekohser simply isn't welcome on any WMF wiki. &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mike]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|en.wb]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; 03:02, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
::::::Lets give it some hours to see if he understands his position in this and doesn't force more drastic measures nor causes other damages to the project.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:01, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
:::::::Sure. I'll just ask Mike one thing: if users on WMF wikis want to welcome someone, who are you to say he &quot;simply isn't welcome&quot;? There is a lost performative there. Not welcome according to ''whom''? Who decides who is welcome and who is not, on each wiki? The Governor? Anyway, Panic, this is your problem, here, I'm working on Wikiversity. I hope Mike doesn't try this trick there. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 03:07, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

== Welcome ==

No doubt some people have told you that you can write a tome.  That makes Wikibooks a perfect fit.  What other project is entirely designed around writing... tomes?  You may be interested in [[Wikipedia]] or [[Wikimedia]].  If those are too close to home, I believe you also mentioned you worked with groups of people.  Then maybe you'd want to look at [[Subject:Sociology]].  Or you can start a new book entirely.  It's up to you. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:02, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
:Yeah. I first need to get a Round Tuit? Know where I can find one? Thanks. I've been a bit discouraged by the apparent Original Research requirements, etc. All real books, other than textbooks written by experts in the field, and even them, typically, include original research in the sense of new writing explaining something, sometimes without references. That's fine on Wikiversity. What's the situation here? What if I write in a field where I am familiar, and what I know is controversial among those who know less, or among ''some'' experts? In my own writing, I would certainly note the controversy, and would attempt to neutrally present it, but ... I got site-banned on Wikipedia for three months, with a topic ban for a year, for doing less, just trying to put what was in ''reliable secondary sources'' into [[w:Cold fusion]], with opposition from people who don't know the sources but who certainly have strong opinions! (Cold fusion is a pretty unusual field, where those who have followed the literature and know the sources, and the whole history of the research, hold opinions that are still quite different from ''many scientists,'' especially those who dismissed CF as bogus twenty years ago, when practically nothing was known about it except a little experimental evidence, and who literally refuse to look at anything new. That evidence eventually became overwhelming that some kind of nuclear reaction was indeed taking place. There is no proof as to what it is, exactly, it probably isn't &quot;ordinary fusion,&quot; though there are some pretty good theories now. And the ash was found, and is next to conclusively proven. It's an exciting field, I discovered it when noticing an abusive blacklisting on Wikipedia, which led me to ... a huge can of worms. Including Mike.lifeguard, my first contact with him. And a business. And I'll be mentioned in Naturwissenschaften this year, it seems, a review paper from a scientist has been accepted, and I assisted him with editing, which is amazing for me, given that, while I was trained in physics, I never worked in it. NW is the journal where Einstein published. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:43, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

::As reputable as it might make us, we aren't sticklers for references for every page of a book, much less every sentence (it seems) like at Wikipedia.  People are still free to tag things with {{tl|fact}} or nominate a book for deletion, but with fewer people here, there's less conflict over ideas.  As long as the concepts are reasonable, presented with a neutral point of view, and (optimally/optionally) provide references, there should be no problems.  [[Wikibooks:Original research]] is a draft; [[WB:OR]] is our only approved definition.  Information published in peer-reviewed journals is good.  If people can do a &quot;Google test&quot;, even better. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:06, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

::(edit conf.)
::Why not approach the subject of [[w:Cold fusion]] from a historical perspective (that would be interesting), then you can explore and comment on most theories in a balanced way and it would be withing reason to speculate on the future (it would also be fun to cover or reference the SiFi and movies coverage of the subject). There are approaches that would bypass the prejudice we have on original research, you will only get into problems if you make innovative concepts and ideas the core of the work, or present them as irrefutable facts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:10, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
:::Thanks. Good ideas. I have a pile of books here, some academically published, some published by specialist publishers, with the history, which is an amazing story. (I bought these books to learn about the field so I could intelligently edit the Wikipedia article. I started as a skeptic, only a little more than a year ago. Then I read the literature, ''including the skeptical literature'' -- which is, by the way, all very old. There is only one recent skeptical paper, published in a relatively minor journal, but under peer review, I've read a draft, and it is really, really bad. And it is really just an answer to a positive paper published there, and it was just co-published with rebuttals from the scientists in the field. (The original paper was written by Steve Krivit, a journalist.)
:::Can you imagine a Fringe Science field, with three Nobel laureates, experts in physics, supporting it? How in the world did that happen? How did a discovery that took expert electrochemists five years to find and satisfy themselves that it existed, with a cell required to run for months before the effect would show up, and they were not at all ready to announce, it was forced by university legal, end up being rejected through experiments that only ran for a few weeks, before the details of the original work had been published? (And, by the way, another historical detail. Pons and Fleischmann, when they ran out of their original palladium and got a new batch, ''could not reproduce their own work.'' There are so many clues in that I don't know where to start. Eventually, they (and) others figured out how palladium could be processed to get decent results, it has to do with nanostructure, but that whole approach is probably bankrupt, the effect is way too fragile in that environment. And I could go on and on.
:::Adrignola, thanks. Maybe I'll toss up an outline. But not today. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:26, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

== ''NY Times'' article of interest: Your Brain on Computers ==

From this week's ''NY Times''...

[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/technology/16brain.html?pagewanted=all Your Brain on Computers: Outdoors and Out of Reach, Studying the Brain]

Excerpt:

{{Quote|Todd Braver, a psychology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, was one of five neuroscientists on an unusual journey. They spent a week in late May in this remote area of southern Utah, rafting the San Juan River, camping on the soft banks and hiking the tributary canyons.

It was a primitive trip with a sophisticated goal: to understand how heavy use of digital devices and other technology changes how we think and behave, and how a retreat into nature might reverse those effects.

The trip’s organizer, David Strayer, a psychology professor at the University of Utah, says that studying what happens when we step away from our devices and rest our brains — in particular, how attention, memory and learning are affected — is important science.

“Attention is the holy grail,” Mr. Strayer says.

“Everything that you’re conscious of, everything you let in, everything you remember and you forget, depends on it.”

Echoing other researchers, Mr. Strayer says that understanding how attention works could help in the treatment of a host of maladies, like attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia and depression. And he says that on a day-to-day basis, too much digital stimulation can “take people who would be functioning O.K. and put them in a range where they’re not psychologically healthy.”}}

Thanks, my friend. You are always welcome on this page. As to elsewhere on this wiki, I don't yet have an opinion! I suppose it is up to everyone else. You've seen the work done with Thekohser, still to be completed by others here (and not so much my business yet). It will be harder with you, probably, but ... I suspect there is a way that wide consensus can be found as to when and how you can participate. Everywhere? Well, would I want a professional theater group to be performing ''everywhere''?

== I don't object to the vote... ==
I don't object to the changes but wish to make my position clear as to avoid any future divergence on an issue that is secondary. I didn't take a clear position on the vote (I did indicate it without a vote) not because of the format but because of the effects it has on the community and the limited conclusion and consequences it can bring to the issue, at best it can be read as response to the question raised by the promoter. In that regard I do object to your words &quot;The character of this !vote will be considered if there is a community decision coming out of this process.&quot; (in that context, you are referring to the vote) as no one but Thekohser should use that process to validate any action (or need to), if it is used to validate anything else it will be an error.&lt;br&gt;
I also advise you, if you have the time, to work on the block policy draft. The issue runs parallel and will probability open avenues of dialog in a way that it avoids dealing with a specific case.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:33, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
:Thanks. I was referring specifically to the comment by Moulton, i.e., that Moulton's status would surely be considered if it was important to do so. I will look at the block policy draft.
:Please understand that I have a view of wiki decision-making that considers that decisions aren't made, strictly speaking, by the community; rather the community advises those who decide. Those decide who have the ability to act, and who choose to act. Strictly speaking, the advice isn't binding, but those who decide against clear community consensus had better have good reasons, or they can end up losing their executive privileges, because the community may then advise others who will listen.
:So &quot;!voting&quot; doesn't actually make any decisions, and vote counts are only indications. But they can be useful ones. As to blocking, only sysops can block, but if everyone but the sysops were to say &quot;Block!&quot; and no sysop was willing to act, the &quot;community&quot; couldn't block. Conversely, as you know, if most in the community say &quot;Unblock!&quot; but no sysop is willing to act, the community, again, cannot unblock. This latter situation is pretty much what Wikibooks is in now, but the polling is setting up conditions to provide cover for unblocking, that might otherwise be considered wheel-warring. There was pretty much no other way, I haven't seen any suggestions from you that would have been better.
:I think your position is incorrect. Thekohser is blocked. It's purely a technical state. We can say, you can say, that he is not banned. But blocked he is, until someone with the tools changes the setting on his account. You may not recognize the ''legitimacy'' of this, but without executive power, that's meaningless. What impresses those who do have the executive power, at meta, more than anything, is numbers in a local poll. Again, you may think that improper, foolish, or whatever, but there is a reason why they want to see certain numbers in a poll on setting the bureaucrat bit, or checkuser, or the like. Or unsetting them.
:Those at meta who might need to make some decision, ultimately, whether it turns out to be needed in this case, do not want to follow long discussions and weigh complex arguments. They want, and need, for it to be simple. If they can look and see a consensus, they will almost certainly follow it. If they see a monster discussion with no clear resolution or obvious balance, they may not even read it. That's why this poll was needed. And that's why I've been acting to try to keep it clean and clear, not always with support. I can only do so much, by myself, I am, in the end, a servant, I'm not in charge. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 02:08, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

::A side note.  The [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals/2010/July#Reconfigure_Wikibooks|long discussion]] we had over reconfiguration of settings at Wikibooks was much like this discussion.  It got long and involved and many didn't read it.  Some even saw the consensus building as an effort to drown out those who objected to changes and found people's attempts to question their positions offensive.  Even when we decided on changes, the initial developer who looked at the bug report didn't read the discussion and [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24304#c1 asked for a link] to a plain old vote.  It just so happened that we had the foresight to create such a section and the developer had stopped scrolling before he got to that section.  Therefore, I find your comments about those at Meta wanting things kept simple (for better or worse) to be spot-on because I've seen it to be the case even for developers. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:53, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
===Response on decision-making, the use of committees===
:::Yes. Trainwreck. But it's not just about meta. It's about ordinary users as well. We all need clarity and simplicity for decision-making. What has happened is that discussion and debate are only half of decision-making. There are classic solutions to this problem.

:::The most obvious one, under Robert's Rules, is referral to a committee. Setting aside the question of how the committee is formed for the moment, a committee engages in whatever process it chooses to come up with a committee report. Such a report, to be a &quot;committee report,&quot; must be approved by a majority of the committee. It can present a series of reports. A minority report or reports may be presented. Each report would be signed by those who approve it. The report is, ideally, a summary of the full discussion, a transcript of which may be available, and a good report will make specific recommendations for action (or a recommendation for no action.)

:::The committee has been charged with the task as a result of, first, a presented and seconded motion. And, second, a motion and second and majority approval to refer the matter to a committee.

:::Committees may expand their own scope to consider, for example, alternatives. It is essential that they have control over their own process. In operation, they may solicit or receive comment from non-members, but they will place this in the record, choosing how to incorporate it (or not incorporate it).

:::Members of the full assembly will have opportunity later to object to the report or present further alternatives.

:::But the full assembly will receive a report of the committee, which has been organized to make the issues as clear as possible. If the motion is complex -- as it was in the case you cited, Adrignola -- each detail will have been examined carefully, we can hope, with the report explaining why a final recommendation was the way it was. But in addition to coverage of these details, there will be overall analysis and brief summary.

:::How the community will handle this may depend on how united the committee was in approving the committee report. A unanimous committee report, if the committee was fairly composed, will often be approved with practically no fuss. In a face-to-face meeting, I've seen, it can take a minute or so to receive the report formally, to move adoption of the recommendations, for that to be seconded, debate opened and immediately closed with a two-thirds vote, and then the final approval, sometimes even by a chair acting &quot;without objection.&quot; Nobody objects, it's done. You have to be paying attention if you object!

:::Hoping to bypass red tape, the on-line communities generally ignored centuries of experience with deliberative process, a process which includes rigorous protection for minority views. The result has been massive inefficiency and unclarity, and useless debate, with the necessary debate often getting hidden or even prevented.

:::Making decisions by &quot;discussion&quot; works under certain conditions, but it also seriously breaks down if there is no clear process to proceed from the discussion to the actual decision. If everyone has agreed, fine, but what if that hasn't happened? Sometimes it might take years to find complete agreement. Unless, of course, someone blocks those who disagree!

:::In reality, because there is no way to compel any user to do anything, decisions are made by individuals with the privileges necessary to implement the decision. Sometimes that's an ordinary editor, who may point to a discussion, for example, or might just do a thing. Page editing is an example. I've seen lengthy discussion of some proposed change on a Talk page, but it never gets done, and no decision is actually made except for a default &quot;nothing done,&quot; which isn't a decision unless so stated.

:::What I'm trying to introduce, here and elsewhere, are elements of classical deliberative process, without crushing the open wiki process; rather, supplementing with order-creating and maintaining structure.

:::Many common errors of consensus organizations have been repeated on the wikis, apparently without any awareness that these are classical problems. For example, making decisions by &quot;consensus,&quot; if the decisions are presumed to persist until changed, can lead to minority rule, in situations where the status quo benefits a minority. Because of the serious problems of participation bias in on-wiki discussions, it can even appear that some position is almost unanimous, whereas if the matter actually came before the entire community, that position would be heavily rejected.

:::There are ways to address this; they involve, generally, setting up decision making structure that kicks in when there are disputes not resolvable by small-scale informal discussion. There are a few (relatively feeble) efforts to do this on Wikipedia. For example, RfC structure there, and ArbComm process, are designed to encourage the separation of the presentation of evidence, discussion and debate, and the making of recommendations. However, without neutral clerking by those working to make sure that the issues and arguments are clear, it is all easily subverted. All it takes is a determined faction, a handful of editors, and it can take years to address even serious problems. That Wikipedia process is dysfunctional is widely known and acknowledged by many, from ordinary editors and critics, to high-level functionaries. But doing something about it on Wikipedia is difficult, for reasons that are not difficult to understand.

:::On the smaller wikis, the process is closer to the original ideals, at least sometimes. And so it may be more possible to introduce elements to heal the dysfunction. It's still difficult, one or two users who are determined to keep things just the way they are, because they are comfortable with that, and especially if they have privileged tools, can slow down the reform process, or maybe even stop it. In the end, though, they are cutting off the limb they are sitting on, because dysfunctional process, sooner or later, burns out everyone. It may look good to them now, but give it a few years, when they realize they have been rolling the same boulder up the hill, watching it roll down. Or be pushed down. You can see this in the history of some -- too many -- Wikipedia administrators. After a time they become progressively impatient and uncivil, until they finally flame out. It's not really their fault, it is a product of system dysfunction. These often become, later, bitter critics. They worked ''so hard,'' and then the community spat them out.

:::So, how to compose a committee? Absent a representative assembly -- it's possible to create one without any ordinary &quot;elections,&quot; that is nevertheless ''fully representative,'' committees can be self-appointed, but the process should result, in a defined time, in definite committee composition. This committee can then set its own rules, and it can under some conditions expel a member for disruption; that ought to take a two-thirds vote. The committee can meet on or off-wiki, but if it meets off-wiki to come up with recommended action, a transcript of that should be available to the public. It's important for transparency. Once there is definite composition, the committee can operate informally, seeking consensus, and, as mentioned, consensus is powerful, what members can all -- or nearly all -- agree upon may be implemented with little fuss. The project can set some default rules for committee process, but committees should be ultimately self-governed, and the rules would really only cover the committee report itself. My own conclusion about the consensus vs. majority rule issue is that majority rule is essential for efficient process, but that consensus is always desirable, and that function is best, overall, when both the right of the majority to make a decision, and the right of a minority to be fully heard and considered, are respected. Under Robert's Rules, it takes a two-thirds vote to close debate and proceed to a final decision, and that is a very substantial protection for minorities against being stampeded by a mere majority.

:::I've experimented a little with on-wiki moderated process, i.e., &quot;chaired.&quot; I've done it in my user space, where I have a default right to structure and organize my own user pages. This can be a model, a &quot;committee meeting&quot; can be hosted by someone acting as the chair. This is not actually a restriction on the committee members, because they could independently create another &quot;meeting&quot; in another user space. Key, though, is that every such meeting has someone responsible for maintaining order, a defined person. You will see, from me, particularly on Wikiversity, more experimentation with this kind of process, which is a hybrid between a very libertarian &quot;anything goes -- but no coercion&quot; and authoritarian control: &quot;It's in my user space and don't revert war with me here, or I'll ask for you to be blocked.&quot; The key is that anyone can do it. The &quot;authority&quot; is only over what's in my space, and that never becomes the sole available place to conduct process like this. (It is conceivable that a committee would fracture over some schism and present factional reports, the overall community would have to sort this out. But it's a waste of time to do this when it's possible to find agreement.)

:::I have never seen careful deliberative process fail to find consensus. I used it to address my first block on Wikipedia, and the result was a major healing, the admin who had practically demanded that I be banned ended up apologizing, and I, in turn, acknowledged what I'd never questioned, his good faith. But it took some doing to get him to that table! He was totally convinced it was a waste of time. So he didn't participate in the process itself, a few others volunteered to examine evidence and comment. And then he was shown the result. In the end, he became a significant ally.

:::It takes a huge amount of work to find true consensus. That's why it must be confined to a relatively small number of direct participants, it is way too much work to lay on the whole community, way too much reading is involved, as well as looking at evidence, etc., not to mention finding and documenting evidence. Because, in fact, the community simply will not take on the job, and if we don't have genuine consensus process in place, decisions get made in a haphazard way, or, worse, being controlled by a faction, the most motivated (which often means the most biased). --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 17:24, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

===On blocks and wheel-warring and voting===

::We have a guideline for decision processes and have an established practice on how they are run on Wikibooks, it is not optimal especially in dealing with block situations, and in cases like this recent one, it sadly makes clear that not all Wikibookians are as equal as they have the right expectation to be. Recently we had a block situation regarding the adoption of the new filter tools and changes to the page reviews etc, and after failing to reach a compromise with one Wikibookian (an admin) we at least could reach the consensus that his opposition wouldn't be resolved and that the greater good of the project was server by acknowledging a consensus to pass the resolution, the proper format would have been the user to remove the opposition explicitly but that rarely happens, it is a rare event when someone clearly compromises here, often irreducible block positions are ignored, this often creates the idea and the acceptance of the practice to form a majority decision disregarding any opposition by not properly addressing it or vice versa like the situation where we are at, this cases are often dependent on the maturity of the administration in analyzing the arguments and the will to give the process the necessary time.
::Our decision process guideline permits other formats, like votes etc but after that recent block situation a general (community) discussion that started as a joke and was &quot;by vote&quot; gathered unanimity against voting, so at present we have a community decision that we shouldn't vote, to me that is binding unless from the start of a process no one objects to the process (that was part of the point I was making) even if I see this recent vote as not a community decision process, even if it is general, because the statement made to initiate it, so in this case voting will be bad (the issue of creating factions) but I have no problem with the format, if the purpose is not subverted. Of course people form conclusions as a result of the process, but it shouldn't used alone to justify any action, it can be part of the argument to act but it will be dangerous to do so as it will nevertheless put us in a wheel-warring, not of only two Wikibookians but of one part of the community against another, that shouldn't be a goal worth pursuing.

::Thekohser is not blocked because there was no consensus or project rule to back the block, we can admit an admin imposing unilaterally a block but after the community is called to validate it, if consensus is not reached the block should not stand. There is also the issue of precedence for instance if an admin blocks a user by braking a policy (enforcible) a community decision should change/re-validate the policy before determining if the block was correct, in case of a guideline (non-enforcible), the user that made the infringement should be given a chance to explain the reasons before a block is considered. The specific case we are seeking normalization was not a result of a local intervention, but a consequence of a series of mistakes in fact the issue should have been clearly addressed at meta but we are lead to believe that even there they weren't capable of reaching a decision and so the mess was put on our lap.
::It all depends on the strength of the administration and political will, I've been personally gone trough the same loops so I know what I'm talking about it will take time. The expedient way is to get someone in an equal footing to act as required for the good of the project. Time is always on our side. We are all in charge it is up to us to guarantee that the &quot;all&quot; never gets left out.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:08, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
:::Of course, Panic, Thekohser is blocked. That's simply a fact. Your argument is that Thekohser is not &quot;community banned.&quot; &quot;Should not&quot; is normative, it is not factual. I see that Mike.lifeguard [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ABlocking_policy&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1690181&amp;oldid=1676998 tried to place] in [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]] the canard that ''If no administrator is willing to lift the block, the blocked user is effectively considered to have been banned by the community.'' He didn't explain why this needed to be there. I can probably guess.
:::Basically, it is generally considered against policy for a sysop to reverse a &quot;community ban,&quot; by unblocking, without getting approval from the community. By setting up a situation where a &quot;community ban&quot; is created without an actual community decision to ban, it can become habit to refer to a user as &quot;community banned.&quot; And then no sysop will dare unblock. But, as we can see, this is circular. The condition was &quot;no administrator is willing to lift the block.&quot; If that condition prevents any admninistrator from lifting the block, it's circular, self-reinforcing, pretending to a community consensus that may never have existed.
:::In my view, more properly, there is no such thing as a ban. There are only blocks, including indef blocks. Topic bans are another matter, they are basically warnings that if a user edits in an area, a block is considered, by a warning admin, likely to ensue. There is a misunderstanding of community process in considering that an admin cannot unblock without consulting with the community first. Rather, perhaps the community has decided to &quot;ban.&quot; That decision requires a close. (I've seen this violated, with much disruption resulting, it was simply said that the ban was obvious from the discussion; but this left nobody responsible for the close, for that decision. And when I examined it closely, it turned out that the charges on which the ban was based were radical misrrepresentations of the history, without evidence being presented. In at least one comment, an experienced administrator had asked for evidence. It wasn't provided. Others !voted and explicitly said, &quot;Assuming that the charges of XXX are true, yes, ban.&quot; Nobody ever took responsibility. But, then, one admin chose to convey the news to the hapless user, and when she complained, he said, &quot;Don't blame me, it wasn't my decision.&quot; Yes, it was!
:::A closing admin represents the community in handling that case, by default. So an admin wishing to unblock would approach that admin, present reasons, and they would presumably discuss it. If they can agree, done. If not, ''then'' it would go to the community if anyone wants to push it. But without a discussion and a closing admin, there is no ban. Only a block that has been set by an admin, with or without discussion and community consensus.
:::If there was no discussion, a reversal by a previously uninvolved admin is not wheel-warring. In the present case, Mike.lifeguard reblocked Thekohser locally to remove Talk page and email access that had been allowed by the original steward blocking. So Mike set a complete block. Adrignola, with discussion and the approval of ''everyone commenting,'' first delinked the account and opened up Talk page access to allow Thekohser to negotiate what Pathoschild, the original blocking steward, had clearly intended, a possible local unblock. Then, with no objection appearing except that of Mike, Adrignoloa unblocked. And Mike promptly reblocked, removing all Talk page and email access again. This was clearly wheel-warring, it's not at all doubtful. On Wikipedia, sysops who do this are, at a minimum, reprimanded by ArbComm, and often they lose their tools. It's highly disruptive, particularly when a community is depending on sysops being responsive to consensus, on being servants rather than masters.
:::Adrignola could not unblock without wheel-warring himself. He could, possibly, restore Talk page access, though prudence might suggest that he not do anything except discuss the situation, as if he were an ordinary user. QuiteUnusual has commented, lamenting the situation, but said that he was not willing to &quot;wheel-war&quot; himself. That's a misunderstanding of wheel-warring, though not completely outside how it is sometimes understood. Wheel-warring is like revert warring. It is clearest when it is a return to a state previously established by the same user. QU could unblock without wheel-warring, in my opinion.
:::However, &quot;wheel-warring&quot; is no longer an excuse to avoid action once a community consensus has been shown. Previously there was, and at present, there is still an apparent supermajority approval for unblock. So even Adrignola, my opinion, could unblock. Wheel-warring most clearly refers to action repeating one's own prior action, without establishing community consensus or clear demonstration of over-riding policy behind the action. With consensus, you can do anything. SB_Johnny closed the unblock discussion on Wikiversity, even though he had started the !voting himself, with an expressed opinion. But he had a showing of 75% consensus! And as he commented, blocking requires consensus to block, not the absence of consensus to unblock. The default for all editors is &quot;unblocked,&quot; normally, and it takes consensus to reverse that. (Or anticipation of consensus by a sysop; a sysop should never block if the sysop doesn't expect to be supported by community consensus. He or she can err, but not defy consensus.)

:::Now, about Wikibooks decision-making process. It's quite obvious, Panic, that the process is inadequate to deal well with situations like this, and certain assumptions are being made by you that should be questioned. You mention: '' the arguments and the will to give the process the necessary time.
::Our decision process guideline permits other formats, like votes etc but after that recent block situation a general (community) discussion that started as a joke and was &quot;by vote&quot; gathered unanimity against voting, so at present we have a community decision that we shouldn't vote...'' No, you don't! Who closed this discussion? Was this incorporated in policy? Even policy isn't absolutely binding, it merely sets strong precedent that can ''normally'' be relied upon. It seems that you have a rigid concept of &quot;decisions,&quot; but a basic rule in jurisprudence is that decisions are only made and only apply to specific cases brought before a court. At that point, those who participated were looking at a train wreck, but there had been a vote, and it was crystal clear, hard to see what the problem was. And in a similar situation, voting would again be used!
::Does Wikibooks have a &quot;legislative body&quot;? Such bodies do, in fact, set up law that is binding, without necessarily defining the exact applications. I'd say it doesn't: instead the closest thing it has to a legislative process is the ordinary editorial process involved in maintaining the content of policy pages. Given that, when it's appropriate, the community clearly does vote, the conclusion of that discussion would be &quot;voting is evil,&quot; not that we don't vote. Further, that is a vague and unapplied statement, and it properly refers to pure decision making based on vote numbers, which, without defined membership of the deciding body, is highly questionable, and isn't, generally, the wiki way, except where a defined body exists (as with ArbComm, on Wikipedia, which, indeed, makes decisions by majority vote.)
::Here is what is needed, I've described ways to approach this above. First there should be discussion, ideally among a relatively small number of users working on some problem. It's good if most &quot;factions&quot; that might have variant opinions have someone representing them in this small group, but it can be quite informal. This group attempts to find consensus, and to present a consensus proposal. They present this proposal, in a privileged section, that section isn't interrupted by comments and threaded discussion. Then there is public comment. No poll is opened until it is reasonably clear that no more comment is forthcoming. Then, ideally, someone summarizes the arguments on all sides, with opportunity for correction. But that correction is managed to not simply become a new discussion, the goal here is to present a single, coherent, summary of arguments, such that all who argued will say, &quot;Yeah, that's good enough.&quot; And if the discussion references the original arguments, and as long as the presentation is reasonably fair, this should not become a matter of contention. If it does, that can, again, be fairly easily handled by reference and even ''brief'' &quot;top-level&quot; statement.
::If someone is really trying to make a matter obscure, or is pursuing some personal agenda, that becomes obvious! Almost never does this behavior continue, in my experience.
::Then, perhaps with a brief discussion of proposed action(s), a poll is taken. Wider review and voting is solicited. People are asked, before voting, to review the presentation of arguments. But they aren't obligated to do so; nevertheless, the process I've described should make that easy. It is not a matter of reading a monster wall of threaded arguments!
::Sometimes, if the process has been good, the result will be obvious ''and no poll will be necessary.'' Polls are only needed, and should only be used, when difference of opinion on the proposed actions still remains, and especially where an action might be controversial, and subject to later review. And I'd lay out further definitions that would improve efficiency without tromping on the rights of minorities. Voting does not trample on the rights of minorities, ever, that is a very common misunderstanding. What tramples on the rights of minorities is knee-jerk decision making with inadequate deliberation, based solely on vote counts, and then a closer who pretends and takes no personal responsibility for the outcome. &quot;I didn't decide this, the community did!&quot; Nope. We are responsible for our own actions. Period. The community advises; sometimes it advises coherently, sometimes not. Sometimes a majority will vote one way, but the arguments are all or almost all on the other side. Closers are responsible for what they conclude, which is also why, if we disagree with a close, we should always discuss it with the closer first! What the closer can decide, the closer can undecide! --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:19, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

==My Comments at the Reading Room==

Hi, for the avoidance of doubt I'd like to say to you personally I am not and was not irritated, cross, angry or anything else about the way you summarised my position in the non-vote currently going on. I just didn't want that line you quoted included in the summary as I felt it misrepresented my view. I did, incidentally, mean to undo the whole of your edit as it also looked like you were changing another editor's contribution to the project page and in general I think that shouldn't be done. In this current non-vote with so many people apparently so passionate, accusations of sockpuppets in the past, distrust of IP edits, and all the rest, I think it is particularly important to avoid being seen to change other people's comments even for the best of reasons. As for the particular issue currently in debate.... well I find it ludicrous and I'm more than happy to unblock and move on but I won't engage in a wheelwar so sadly the debate will need to continue for a while. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:03, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
:Of course, QU, I didn't &quot;change&quot; anyone's &quot;comments.&quot; What you objected to was not any change in your comments, but rather my analysis of your comment, which I was simply doing to make sense out of various comments, in terms of what they might imply about community consensus. There are really at least five categories of comment: Support, Abstain, Oppose, and &quot;Abstain&quot; with some expressed position, which could be in either direction. The goal of a poll, however it is started, is to develop and show the general sense of the community on a topic. That, by itself, binds nobody.

::You had made a comment that appeared to place you in the &quot;abstain but support unblock&quot; category. You wished to emphasize neutrality. That's fine, and when you removed your comment, I then moved the categorization of your comment to a now-more-appropriate category, a pure abstention. (Which was possibly still an important category here, since Thekohser was asking for -- he can't demand, but surely he can ask -- at least ten community members participating, so your comment helped satisfy that condition.) I had only added the quotation from you originally to explain why I'd categorized you as I had.

:The time for debate, as far as I've seen, is largely over. It is time to make a decision and move on. That's also a rough consensus, at least, at this point. As you are, from your comment, apparently neutral, you could decide to close this, at what you see as the best time. If your close is based on consensus as well as your own opinion, you will not be wheel-warring should you implement it. You would also not necessarily be wheel-warring if you simply unblocked, because there was a prior apparent consensus to unblock, that has not changed, and you have not previously asserted a decision in this matter. Mike.lifeguard was clearly wheel-warring, because he re-established a condition (total block) that he had himself previously created, undoing Adrignola's action (that was based on prior discussion and consensus at the time). Adrignola was not wheel-warring, but he would be, possibly, if he simply unblocked.

:''Disagreeing with'' and ''acting contrary to'' Mike.lifeguard is not &quot;wheel-warring.&quot; If he'd been acting as steward, there is precedent for calling that wheel-warring, which, I'm sure, is why Adrignola asked about that. He wasn't acting as a steward (though he had a possible conflict of interest of a kind that he previously strongly decried at meta in the matter of Lar as a steward while also being an ombudsman reviewing checkuser actions, one of the steward privileges).

:(I recommend against *ever* closing a discussion, making a decision, contrary to your own opinion, unless that is a weak opinion, this is an important safeguard, if you think about it; i.e., you may close contrary to &quot;the majority,&quot; if you based this firmly on arguments, and you may close based on supermajority or even mere majority, sometimes, without deep consideration of the arguments, as &quot;the sense of the community,&quot; but, to avoid unnecessary dispute later, you should then be prepared to actually examine arguments, especially new ones, presented later, or on reviewing the original arguments, to consider reversing your decision. There are aspects of traditional deliberative process that lead me to this conclusion, combined with the wiki adhocracy and a need for efficiency.) --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:42, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
::I'm more than happy to unblock once the conclusion is clear... by wheel warring I meant &quot;not unblocking straight after Mike had blocked straight after someone else had unblocked&quot;.

== Questions from Thenub314 ==

&lt;small&gt;this question or comment from Thenub314 was posted to my User page, I have moved it here. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:27, 5 September 2010 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
: Since your wikiversity thread suggested here was a more appropriate place to discuss your Wikipedia Review comments, I decided to take you up on it.  But you still haven't answered the question: ''Why'' the abuse?  While we disagreed about various issues before, such as your wikiversity user request for custodial action, I still fail to see why it degenerated into name calling and insulting my intellect. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:51, 5 September 2010 (UTC)
::This comment is apparently based on comments of mine at Wikipedia Review, which I often compare to a bar where people interested in WikiMedia Foundation projects hang out and chew the fat, commiserate, complain, fight, agree, disagree, with few rules, except that being terminally boring at great frequency can sometimes lead to sanctions.

::The most appropriate place to respond to or question activity on Wikipedia Review is there. To get an account there, a user will generally have to establish identity as a WMF user. True identity need not be revealed. (Thenub314 has declined to obtain and use a WR account.)

::The second most appropriate way to complain about something I've written there is by email to me, which can be done through the wiki interface. This does not disclose identity; Thenub314 said that he did not want to use email because of concerns about exposing his identity. That, in itself, concerns me when it comes to a sysop, many of the problems of WMF wikis can be traced to allowing anonymous privilege. But I am not anonymous, my identity is openly disclosed. If Thenub314 writes me, I will respond. He will then know a direct email address for me. It will be his choice if he chooses to respond to that, thus disclosing his direct address to me.

::The third most appropriate place is here, since the occasion for my WR comments was Thenub314's activity here.

::However, what I wrote there I would not write here, so discussing what I wrote there would take place in a vacuum.

::On Wikiversity, Thenub314 attempted to raise the issue he has just raised here. He repeatedly posted to my Talk page, in spite of my obvious refusal to discuss this there. He suggested I respond on Wikipedia Review, which I did. He then asked a further question, one that he repeats here. I responded, again, there.

::It's a loaded question. Were my comments &quot;abuse&quot;? By what definition? They had a purpose and they can be justified, in context. Not here. Far, far worse is routinely allowed and tolerated there, and far worse is actually tolerated here. But not by me. If I wrote here what I wrote there, and if I was a sysop, I'd block myself as a warning. (Of course, I wouldn't. I'd delete it, strike, apologize, etc.) I blocked my mentor on Wikiversity, leading to a rapid (and out of process) desysop request by him at meta, a huge flap. The block was for incivility in his discussion of off-wiki conflict, he called a user a &quot;liar.&quot; Without any local need to do so. Civility is essential to consensus process, while engaged in the process itself.

::But human communities do far more than engage in formal or restricted process. They talk to each other, speaking frankly. Deep conflicts can be exposed and resolved through this, leading to better formal process. Or they can be inflamed. It depends, and there is no general rule that applies to all situations. It is clear to me that the open and almost completely uncensored discussion at Wikipedia Review leads to improvements in WMF wikis. One of the fastest ways to get a situation fixed where local sysops are unaware of a problem, and a user doesn't know how to get their attention without causing disruption, is to note the problem at Wikipedia Review.

::Wikipedia Review is not a long-term solution, it is only useful in some circumstances. But it is a way that the overall WMF community can meet, and this meeting includes many blocked and banned users, from whom those of us who are not banned can learn much. If any reader here wants to start to understand the problems of the WMF, WR is a great place to start. But be prepared. It's like a bar, it's rowdy. Thenub314 has obviously been reading comments there, but hasn't dared to start an account. Why not? I'd say that there is somewhat of a problem with a sysop who won't at least occasionally respond, defending his positions; on Wikipedia, it is very clear that sysops are expected to be tolerant of criticism, even intemperate criticism. That is a general principle for any sysop on any wiki that pretends to be open and neutral. Certainly, a sysop who considers it a waste of time to read Wikipedia Review is not obligated to do so, but here we have a sysop who is actually reading it. Why?

::I'll make up an example. This is not what I said.

::Suppose I show up at a faculty meeting at my university. A member of the faculty stands up, and, before the group, asks me why I called him an &quot;asshole&quot; in the University Bar and Grill, last night. The chair of the meeting tells him to sit down, that this is out of order. He refuses to sit down and insists that I answer the question. The chair orders him to leave the room, and the sergeant-at-arms conducts him out. But then he returns later and demands an answer again. Should I answer? Remember, his question is out of order, and so would be my response.

::If he shows up at my office, a place where students and other faculty members are present, and demands an answer, should I answer? Should I say the obvious and easy answer, &quot;Because you've been acting like an asshole, don't like my saying that, stop acting like an asshole!&quot;?

::Maybe. And maybe not. What if I invite him to meet me at the UB&amp;G? I'll buy him a beer and we can talk about it. [You can tell this story isn't about me, because I'm a Muslim and don't drink and wouldn't buy him a beer. But coffee, sure.]

::He replies that he would never go into such a place. So I ask him, &quot;What the hell are you doing listening at the door? Either come in and sit down and we can talk, or go away!&quot;

::I'm involved in negotiations with another &quot;globally banned&quot; user. He called me up the other day, I'd given him my phone number. We chatted for a while (this is a very interesting guy, with a great deal of very relevant experience), until we finally addressed a problem we'd been having. He started screaming at me about how pissed he was at me. He was obviously very, very angry. What did I do? What you you think? Do you think I'd hang up on him? Not yet, anyway! I listened to him!

::At the Bar and Grill, he can speak with politeness, or he can say, &quot;No, you are the asshole!&quot; He's free and so am I. Here, we both have the obligations of civility and avoidance of disruption, and those are essential here.

::I highly recommend that Thenub314, if he does not want to address alleged abuse in situ, or directly with me, privately, either talk off-wiki with friends to get some emotional support, or on-wiki on their talk pages if they and/or the community permits it, or stuff it, i.e., deal with his own feelings, himself, and not distract the community with them. I've discussed this here to cover the relevant process issue, the use of a wiki to address off-wiki behavior, which is seriously problematic. User talk pages, on-wiki, would be the most appropriate place, if it works. If it doesn't work, it's time to stop.

::What is ironic is that the present dispute, the cause of my off-wiki comments, is ultimately about the alleged abuse of Wikiversity and other WMF wikis to pursue disputes based on what was on different wikis or off-wiki (such as on Wikipedia Review or blogs or outside wikis, etc., or on Wikipedia, but being &quot;exposed&quot; on Wikiversity). In other words, Thenub314 is violating the same principles that led to the block of Thekohser on Wikiversity. Thekohser was an ordinary user. I'm an ordinary user (at this time). Thenub314 is a sysop and would generally be expected to know better. Does he? Is he willing to learn? Questions. Answers are not obligatory. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:19, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

But I'd think you'd have to do a whole lot more to get me that exercised. In fact, it's probably impossible. I don't think you'd be capable of setting up conditions where I'd do that. So ... that leads me to a question that might be of some interest. Why are you paranoid? And why do you use a &quot;sensitive email address&quot; for your WikiMedia email? It hampers you.

I'm likely to laugh -- if I don't turn around immediately and say, &quot;Yeah, that was pretty stupid!&quot; So, Thenub, do words mean what the speaker intended, or do they mean how the listener received it, or do they have meaning determined by some other process?

All I'd ask you to think about is whether or not this was a favor, something truly considering your welfare and the welfare of the wikis.

:::You think that behavior is superior in some way? That you don't change your language depending on cultural context? And you assume this deficiency of others as well? And it is a deficiency. The primary function of language is communication, not idle expression, and communication always takes place in a cultural context; it could be said that language is culture and culture is language. Now, you brought this language here, taking it out of its original context. That's your choice. I wouldn't have written that here. Here, however, I would directly criticize, as needed, your actions, the ones leading me to a conclusion, expressed there, about, not &quot;faculties,&quot; but whether or not the faculties are being used. It looks to me like they aren't. But that's a general comment, I would not ordinarily makes even such a general comment here, but you have effectively invited it. &quot;The stub&quot; is an obvious play on your user name; it implies something shortm incomplete. It does not imply intrisic shortness, not in our most common use around here, that of an immature page, a page that might be of value but which has not yet reached greater expression.

''What did you mean, and why where you upset enough to be reduced to name calling.
:You assume that I was upset, correct? What causes you to infer that? And why do you call this &quot;reduced&quot;? Sometimes calling a spade a spade, for example, can be a step forward. Now, you aren't a &quot;spade,&quot; but let's suppose for a moment that I called you an &quot;idiot.&quot; I didn't, as far as I recall. (As with many bars, my memory can be a bit hazy!) That is a term that would not, generally, carry the literal meaning. It is colloquial shorthand for a complex judgment, about behavior, an implication that behavior has not been demonstrating coherent and cogent analysis, but the reverse, some kind of blindness or mental rigidity. In person, this is ''not'' a ''personal attack.'' On the other hand, an example you used of personal attack, &quot;liar&quot; ''is'' generally a personal attack, and even &quot;lie,&quot; applied to what someone has said, is likewise a personal attack, because a &quot;lie&quot; is not merely an untrue statement, it represents a statement ''intended'' to deceive. And intention to deceive is almost always reprehensible, morally culpable, socially rejected behavior. A personal attack, casting or attempting to cast real opprobrium on the target. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:46, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
::Ok, this maybe a point where we can make some progress.  If you weren't upset, than what was the point? I say reduced because I see name calling beneath the usual level of respect I have witnessed from you on wiki.  As a academic note you should realize the deceit is not always seen as reprehensible, in many sub cultures the ability to do it well is something to strive for.  Being called a liar in such culture would cause no more fuss then a shrug of the shoulders.  Your personal views on what is insulting are interesting, but keep in mind they are exactly ''your'' views.  You shouldn't claim that when you insult someone else they should not take such offense, because it is the colloquial use of the term.

Don't think they need rescue? Well, let's say that this would be a shallow view, probably based on limited experience. If you open your eyes, you might see more.

Swarms of flies. Let me tell you: if I were on a hiring committee, through some misfortune, and I looked at this discussion, I'd see some kind of negative about you. Based not on what I've written, but what you have written. I'd worry a bit about how you might function socially in an organization. However, my ultimate decision would be based on a balance of all the information I had, including the normal stuff. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
''Finally to answer the questions: Do I know better?  I feel my behavior thus far is well away form anything that would get me blocked, but time will tell if I do &quot;know better&quot;.
:You were pushing it a bit on Wikiversity with that reversion of the archive template and removal of SB_Johnny's comment. That you removed my warning was, of course, allowable. But a bad sign. Nevertheless, you stood down anyway, and apologized to SBJ. A good sign. Thenub, you seem to think I was angry. Could it be that ''you'' are angry? Anger leads us to screw up like that. It's okay to be angry! If you are angry, in fact, you are much better off simply saying it. You are even better off taking full responsibility for it. I suppose we will see. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:46, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
:: I was angry the first few hours after your initial explanation of what &quot;the stub&quot; meant, but that has long since worn off.  In all honestly I suspect my screw ups were due to poor sleep.  But to be honest I just be careless by nature.

:::Could &quot;careless by nature&quot; be a bit of what I've been talking about? What if you are careless about arguments, about what impressions you form and what you advocate, as well as about details like avoiding removing the comments of others, or posting a comment on a user talk page, or, going way back, apologizing about a formatting error with a new comment in an AfD, i.e., making an already long discussion even longer without adding new relevant comment. I see this as quite connected with your recent behavior. I wouldn't mention it, here, if not for your effective invitation by asking on my Talk page. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
''Am I willing to learn? I am not sure what it is that you would exactly have me learn.

''I suppose you would hope I would learn that there is a clear distinction between on wiki and off wiki behavior and the two worlds should never meet.  I am fairly skeptical of this idea.  To take a hypothetical situation: suppose an on wiki dispute turns to physical violence off wiki (or even simply threatening behavior) I feel the two worlds have certainly met.
:A device for avoiding understanding what someone has said is to exaggerate it into something preposterous. I have never said that under no circumstances is off-wiki behavior irrelevant. Perhaps you should review and try to understand privacy policy. Even &quot;outing&quot; is allowed if there is sufficient necessity. What I've stated is the general case. The wikis are not to be used as dispute resolution fora for off-wiki disputes or conflicts. Only where the off-wiki conflict has serious implications as to on-wiki behavior, risking the project, or the safety of the community, does it become relevant. What you did, Thenub, was to take my alleged &quot;abuse&quot; to the Colloquium on Wikiversity, actually linking to it from there. That was offensive, in fact, absent some showing of necessity. As an example of necessity, suppose I were a sysop and, say, I blocked you. You might perhaps point to something like that to show bias. But I'm not a sysop, and I wouldn't block you if I were, unless the cause were blatantly obvious and clearly blocking would enjoy consensus.
:You took up the time of Wikiversity participants in pursuit of what you later called a &quot;purely academic interest,&quot; for your own &quot;edification.&quot; That was selfish and inconsiderate, for starters. Had I consented to the use of my Talk page for that, it would have been okay. But I did not, and for strong reasons, having to do with Wikiversity politics. You can get a hint of this by reading the comments in that archived discussion! You were adding fuel to a fire. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:46, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
::I had no intention of being offensive.  From my cultural perspective, what you say in a public forum is public, free to be discussed anywhere. I had no idea you'd find linking to them offensive.  It seems I have different perspective about the situation, as I said clearly a couple of times the thread in the colloquium was not about our particular dispute, but more about was my use of your talk page appropriate.  Many of the comments there were in fact very interesting, and I am glad to have started the thread.  Next time, if I do something like this and it involves you, I will pay you the curtsey of censoring your identity for the description of the issue.  I am sorry I offended you.

:::I'm pointing to a lack of caution due to context. To pursue this, the reductio ad absurdem of what you just wrote: So, because my comment was in a public place, you could bring it up in, say, a town council meeting. Or in an ArbComm case on Wikipedia. Or in the middle of an RfD discussion on something not connected with it. Yes, it was public and thus can be mentioned ''if relevant.'' And, yes, you'd be correct, if you want to learn about the general principle, to not bring up the very personal reason for asking in a way that, in itself, can constitute a personal attack. As has been pointed out on Wikipedia, &quot;personal attack&quot; can be a personal attack. The irony here is that the underlying dispute, the occasion for all this, is over a critic who used specific incidents in an attempt to discuss general ethical principles, and who may have mixed personal grievance with a sincere concern over ethics. In other words, Thenub, it's being suggested that you learn to avoid what got someone else blocked and banned. Does this mean that you are in danger of being blocked and banned? Probably not, unless you were to become far more &quot;careless.&quot; But the principles are the same. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
''Given my feelings about this hypothetical the question becomes where does one draw the line, but it is never about simply not acknowledging off wiki behavior.
:This is a simple line: will what I am adding to a wiki page improve the project? Will it improve collaboration here? Will it stir up unnecessary dispute? Is this the best place to raise an issue? If the answers are No, don't do it! You were originally free to ask your question on my Talk page. But when I declined to discuss it, that should have been it, as to there. I did give you alternatives, and, as you now realize, I did respond to you (and with more than you have yet read). And even more, now, though I would not expect this to ''fully'' satisfy you. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:46, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
:: Thank you for the lenghty analysis and reply.  When you asked for my patience I thought there would be more this conversation.

:::No, when I wrote that you might not be fully satisfied, it is because to understand all of what I'm saying to you might take far more than a relatively brief conversation, even one as long as this. It might take time and experience. I often say things that people are not ready to hear, but, sometimes, they come to me years later and say, &quot;You were right. I couldn't see it at the time.&quot; Sometimes. Some people never change. And, of course, sometimes I might be wrong.

''My opinions on this are painted by my own experiences in which being careless with my name and email address caused some on wiki disputes to follow me into my real life.  From that experience I was certainly willing to learn.  After this comment I will let the matter drop.  If you want to speak of it no more, simply do not reply.  But I hope that you will instead choose to explain things to me a bit better. 
:I have a long record of involvement in some serious disputes on Wikipedia, including taking two cases successfully to ArbComm. (The second case resulted in some sanctions on me, but I never considered my personal ability to edit to be that important. Both cases raised issues of administrative abuse, and in both cases, ArbComm recognized the problem I was pointing to; but ArbComm has an unfortunate tendency to shoot the messenger; they noticed that there was, so to speak, a howling mob, and they assumed that I must have done something to deserve that, to stir them up, to cause this &quot;disruption.&quot; &quot;Greatest good for the greatest number,&quot; would be a rough statement of the principle they often operate on. To actually understand the situation would have taken more work than they were willing or able to put in (so it came back to haunt them, there is a current monster case that might have been avoided). My point was that I knew what I was doing, I set out to do it, and ArbComm agreed. Both times.) In any case, I have never willfully betrayed a confidence, and I have the confidence, generally, of a number of arbitrators and functionaries. I would not reveal your email address, nor am I interested in &quot;outing&quot; you. My interest, generally, is in establishing consensus process, and &quot;consensus&quot; includes ''everyone.'' Not just my &quot;friends.&quot;
:I have questions about the wisdom of anonymity for administrators, my view not being ''far'' from WMF policy, which requires non-anonymity for certain high functionaries, I'd extend that to lower levels. I would, instead, set up structure that would level some of the distinctions between administrators and ordinary users, making it possible for those who wish to retain full anonymity to do so, while still retaining efficiency. I'd set up a special class of administrators, who would be under (voluntary but retroactively enforced) restrictions as to tool use. A little like the Wikiversity probationary custodian. These would be like extensions of a &quot;mentor administrator,&quot; allowing much more work to be done, but with a kind of supervision. And, in time, all this will be proposed, I assume. The goal is to make it easier to maintain the wiki, and easier to volunteer and serve, which is part of that. Further, it's essential that genuine consensus process be in place, it is impossible to fulfill the fundamental WMF policy of neutrality without that. And that's a huge story, all by itself.
:The basic lesson for you, I'd say, from this present affair is, &quot;Don't take yourself so seriously.&quot; (Which includes not taking what others say about you so seriously.) I've mentioned that you might have a good reason for raising the question you raised. Instead of &quot;Why this abuse?&quot;, you might instead have more purely represented this as, &quot;Why did you write that? What is this about?&quot; Instead of assuming, from the get-go, that it was improper and wrong, &quot;abuse.&quot; Does that seem reasonable? --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:46, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
:: I take myself seriously with good reason.  Which is why before I make any public, semi permanent comments about someone I choose my words carefully to try to reflect exactly what I mean.  As best as I understand form your bar room analogy, bars are a good place to call a spade a spade.  Or as mentioned in by way of a hypothetical example in another thread, sometimes you call someone an as****e because they are being an as****e.  So the best I can come up with is that you developed a nick name for me stating I had a limited intellect because that is your assessment of my intellect.  The benefit of writting &quot;why this abuse&quot; is that it let you know immediately how your remarks were received.    

::I might suggest to you to choose your words in the bar room a bit more carefully. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 06:16, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

:::&quot;Carefully&quot; according to what standard? It is impossible for me to &quot;assess&quot; your &quot;intellect,&quot; all I can do is assess what appears to be reflected in what you write. Your intellect may far outstrip what you express in writing, especially if you are &quot;careless.&quot; Isn't it ironic that you are suggesting that I become more careful in an environment designed to be relatively carefree, while I'm pointing out that your comments here don't show careful and intelligent consideration, in a place where such is far more necessary?

:::I should note that frank conversation with me can be dangerous for some people, I'd recommend continuing this only if you are willing to examine some of your deepest assumptions about society, about the wikis, about others, and about yourself. This is taking place on my Talk page, where your participation, where your very reading of this is completely voluntary. I'm pointing that out. You have no obligation to me to respond, nor any obligation to the wiki, only, maybe, if you agree, to yourself. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

:::: Well this last (and first) comment lead me to think that perhaps I am not the only person who should be asking themselves the question &quot;Am I taking myself too seriously?&quot;  For what it is worth, when I said I was careless I meant I do things like accidentally remove SB_johnny's comment, careless editing as it were.  I have a bit more faith in my arguments. I think I will let this conversation come to a clos. As a matter of personal advice to you, you seem to be chasing windmills to me, and best of luck with it.  Feel free to respond to this and have the last word as it seems you like to, but in the interests of letting the conversation finish I don't expect I'll reply.

:::::Well, not to have the last word, but just to respond to your hint about taking myself seriously. I do. 'Too seriously?&quot; Probably sometimes. However, since you derive that from the notes, I'll mention that discussion with me has led to, apparently, two actual suicides and many &quot;virtual suicides,&quot; where people had such strong reactions that they trashed months of work, or more. Was that about me or about them? Probably much more about them, but, you never can tell. Causation is a funny thing. Good luck. I see that Thekohser thing closed, with predictable result. Thenub, I serve consensus, I'm generally anticipating it, and I'm fairly good at it. Sometimes local consensus, a local phenomenon, can appear different than what the larger group will agree upon after fuller consideration. Sometimes the generality haven't yet become sufficiently aware of a situation. But I am ''not'' trying to impose my views on others.

== Demonstrate how to treat an abrasion or a cut, and describe the dangers of a dirty dressing. ==
 
One of the simplest and most essential first aid for kids that they need very often is how to tie a bandage. Kids keep on falling and getting themselves hurt. So teach them how to tie a bandage to the wounded area. Firstly it is important to clean the area with water. Then, using a cotton swab, antiseptic should be applied. Applying an antiseptic is very important as bacteria and other germs gain access to the body through the wound. So it is good to clean the wound first. In case you don't have an antiseptic, use an anti-bacterial soap. If the wound is small, a band-aid will do, but if it is a big wound, you will need a gauze.


== Describe how to care for a nosebleed. ==

Nosebleeds are common occurrence with children. In case of a nosebleed, make sure that you lean forward and pinch the bottom part of your nose. Do not lean backwards as the blood might enter your wind pipe through your nose, causing complications. Lean forward and pinch the nose till the bleeding stops. Typically, the bleeding will stop within 10 minutes as the blood will clot. Pinching the nose will stop the loss of blood.

== Identify and make a display of different types of bandages. ==

&lt;gallery&gt;File:AdhesiveBandage1.png|Adhesive Bandage
File:Bandage 02.jpg|Elastic Bandage
File:Knie-Aktivbandage.JPG|Knee Bandage&lt;/gallery&gt;


== Make a simple first-aid kit and learn uses of included items. ==
[[File:First aid kit for tropical country - unpacked.jpg|thumb]]
Even a simple kit needs the following items: 

#Adhesive compress
#Bandage compress, 
#2&quot; by 2&quot; plain gauze pads, 
#Gauze roller bandage, 
#Triangular bandages,
#Needle, 
#Scissors, 
#Tweezers, 
#Thermometer,
#Disinfectant, 
#Calamine lotion, 
#Insect repellant 
#Ace bandage.


== Sterilize one of the following and tell why each is an important item to have in your first-aid kit. ==

	
=== * Tweezers ===

	
=== * Thermometer ===

	
=== * Needle ===



== Visit an emergency-care facility to learn about some of the emergencies they care for. ==



== Play “hospital” and practice your skills on the above emergencies. ==



== Describe and draw the First Aid symbol. ==

&lt;gallery&gt;File:First Aid Green Cross.png|'''First Aid Symbol'''&lt;/gallery&gt;

The true internationally accepted symbol for first aid is a white cross on a green background.

Despite what pop culture, and millions of first aid kits sold worldwide (to the chagrin of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies) would have you believe, the red cross on white background is not an “accepted” symbol designating First Aid.

== Name a time when Jesus gave first aid to someone who was bleeding badly. ==

{{Bible verse|book=Matthew|chapter=26|verse=51|version=NIV|text=''With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.''}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many different environments that can be used to develop calculator programs using z80 assembly.  Here are a few more options.

== Brass ==
Brass is an assembler targeted at the TI-83+ by Benjamin Ryves.  It can be found on his blog, [http://www.benryves.com/ Ben Ryves Blog]


== Zilog Developer Studio ==
ZDS is the official IDE from Zilog for working with their processors.  You need to do some work to get an enviornment, but it is fully featured.  It is known to be used by Drew DeVault and Brandon Wilson in the community.


== Spasm ==
{{todo|I don't actually know anything about spasm, someone else should take this over.}}


== On-Calc Methods ==
Some people enjoy programming directly on their calculators.  This is not as easy, or as supported as elsewhere, but it is possible.  One option is to learn to code in pure hex, and use TIOS to compile it.  Another option is OTBP Assembler, which can be found at [http://www.ticalc.org/ TI-Calc].  An on-calc IDE called Mosaic is in development as well.


== Setting Up Your Environment ==
Setting up to develop for the TI-83+ in assembly can be a daunting task.  However, there is almost always someone willing to help.  You can find help at #ti on IRC (efnet) or at one of the various calculator forums.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Data Handling==
===Data Tables===
Data should be collected in tables in a systematic way that makes it clear and easy to understand.

Headings should make it easy to find the information that is required and should include appropriate '''units''' and '''uncertainty'''.
*Reference tables of data may be given in an appendix as they may be long.
*Tables in the body of a report should be designed to convey a message clearly and may only include summary data such as averages.

===Uncertainty===
All instruments have a level of uncertainty.  In an experiment the biggest source of uncertainty is the most important to consider and try to reduce.

*using a ruler to the nearest mm
*a voltmeter reading to the nearest 0.1V
*a set of scales measuring to the nearest 0.01g

This is the '''resolution''' of the instrument.  The smallest change it can observe or 'see'.  Any readings should only be taken to &amp;plusmn;1 of the last digit ''at best''.  However there may be reasons to be even more pessimistic about results.

*The '''stability'''. The results on a meter may flicker randomly or in response to changing conditions like being knocked.
*The '''range'''. Repeated readings of the ''same'' experiment may vary. 
*The '''calibration''' of the instrument.  Is it giving a true reading compared to other supposedly identical instruments of against a known standard?

A result should be given including &amp;plusmn; the uncertainty.

The uncertainty can be displayed on a graph as an '''Error Bar'''.

===Systematic Errors===
Systematic errors can arise from the experimental procedures or other bias.
* Zero error on an instrument making all readings too large or small by a set amount
** A micrometer that reads -0.01mm when fully closed
** Not realising a 30cm ruler has an extra few mm before the scale starts.
** A set of scales that has not been zeroed first.
* Calibration of an instrument giving false readings.
** An ammeter consistently giving reading that are too high.
** A measuring tape becoming stretched over years of use.
* Experimental design flaws
** Friction on a sloping runway not being accounted for.
** A resistor changing its value as it gets hot.
** Resistance of connecting wires.



These will often result in a line of best fit on a graph that doesn't go through an intercept where expected.

An experimental design can be improved to try to remove systematic errors.

===Random Errors===
These are often ''noise'' or random fluctuations in a repeated reading.
* The height a ball bounces to when dropped from the same height.
* The small variations in voltage when repeating a reading on the same length of wire.
They may also be due to a mistake or human error in the reading, for example using your eyes to measure the height that a ball bounces may lead to an outlier due to an error in judgement.
Human error would be the most likely source of an outlier.

===Spread and identifying possible outliers===
It is often useful to use ''plot and look'' as a quick way to assess the quality of data.  This is a dotplot that shows the distribution of a set of data.
The following data would look like this:
::5.5
::6.2
::6.7
::5.9
::7.7
::: Average = 6.4

''awaiting image''

; Range : The maximum value minus the minimum value in a set of repeated readings.
; Spread: &amp;plusmn; Half the Range
;Outlier: A value is likely to be an outlier if it is further than 2 x the spread from the mean average.  This should only be used as a guide and the possible reasons for an anomalous result should be considered before dismissing it.

===Graphs===
====Scales====
[[Image:Badgraphforadvancingphysics.jpg|left|thumb|200px|How not to plot.]]
[[Image:Bettergraphfroadvancingphysics.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A better plot.]]

The scales on a graph must include a suitable legend and '''units'''.

If producing graphs on computer they should be as big as is reasonably possible so that values can be read from them easily.  The scales should include minor unit markers or even grid lines.  Small graphs within the text of a report may be used for illustrative purposes but a full sized version could be included in an appendix.

The purpose of displaying the data in a particular graph should be made clear from a '''caption''' or title.

====Lines of best fit====

Error bars shows the uncertainty in the data. If you use the raw data on the graph, its uncertainty is equal to the lenght of uncertainty bars. But if you use processed data, you need to process uncertainties, too. ( If you don't know how to do this, write me and i will send you a document) You don't have to use error bars on graph if they are too small to draw, but you have to give reasons for this on your report otherwise you lose point.

Scaling of the graph is importantant to get &quot;complete&quot; so you have to rescale it, if you use less than half on any axis. (Remember, axis don't have to start from zero)

Uncertainities in Slopes:

The slope of best line gives you the value used in calculating experimental value of n.

===End===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does the spiny backed orb weaver look like?==
The spiny backed orb weaver has various horns and a hard outer shell.

This spider is 24mm.to 40mm. Adult females are larger than the male. The majority of female spiders are larger than male spiders.

==Where does the spiny backed orb weaver live?==
This unique spider lives in Mozambique, Africa.Similar orb weavers live in south of the U.S.A. Like its relatives it also likes to live in wet and tropical places around the globe.

==What does the spiny backed orb weaver eat?==
This spider likes to copy the web of a garden spider it weaves its spider in spiral spokes. This spider likes to snack on flies, ladybugs, and dragonflies are all on the spiny backed orb weavers menu.

==How does the spiny backed orb weaver defend itself?==
The spiny backed orb weaver has various horns to make birds and other predators say &quot;thats a tough meal&quot;. The shape of this spider would be like trying to swallow a wish bone from a chicken.

==What steps does the spiny backed orb weaver to mature?==
This species does not live long. Usually the life span is until mating which is the spring after the following winter.Females die after making an egg sack, males die a week after reproducing.

==What is special about this spider?==
This unique kind of spider has various and magnificent horns to its sides which make this magnificent spider a spider to remember forever.

==How does the spiny backed orb weaver affect people?==
This spider does not affect people. In fact this spider benefits the farmers by controlling the pest and fly population.

{{wikipedia|Figure-eight knot (ropes)}}

The figure-eight knot is a simple [[Knots/Stopper knots|stopper knot]]. To tie it, make a loop, then turn the working end around to the other side of the loop and put it through, so that it looks like the picture. It is an [[Knots/Stopper knots/Overhand knot|overhand knot]] with an extra [[Knots/Parts of the knot|turn]] around the standing part.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Schotstek rechts.jpg|thumb|right|A sheet bend]]

The sheet bend is a bend knot that is identical in structure to the [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]] but is tied differently and has a different purpose, serving as a [[Knots/Bend knots|bend knot]] instead of as a [[Knots/Loop knots|loop knot]]. Making reference to the picture to the right, the bigger or less flexible rope should be the red one, and the other rope should be the green one. Notice that, in order to be most secure, the two free ends should end up on the same side of the knot (see below). 

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Double sheet bend==
{{see also|Knots/Bend knots/Double sheet bend}}
[[Image:Double sheet bend 2.jpg|thumb|right|A double sheet bend]]
If the ropes used in a sheet bend are of greatly different sizes, it may be necessary to put the smaller one under itself twice (first at the bottom of the bight, second nearer the tip) instead of only once. The resulting knot is called a double sheet bend.

The '''double sheet bend''' is a variation on the [[../Sheet bend|sheet bend]]. If the ropes that one wishes to join in a bend are of greatly different sizes, it may be necessary make the double sheet bend by putting the smaller one under itself twice (first at the bottom of the bight, second nearer the tip) instead of only once (as in a normal sheet bend).

&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''&lt;/s&gt; I should start by mentioning that this book has been nominated for deletion [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Suicide|before]]. After an anonymous user queried this page I took the time to read through the book.  There is an extensive toc but the actual content is mostly confided to [[Suicide/Jumping]], [[Suicide/Saying_Goodbye]], [[Suicide/Suicide_Notes]], and [[Suicide#Unusual_Methods]].  The book might be ok if it lived up to its own description of what it is and isn't, but as such after reading it I am can only draw the following conclusions: 
#If I jump, a straight dive is best. I should practice at a pool to make sure I can get it right.
#Hard surfaces are better to hit, the head will absorb the energy of impact in 0.0012s (NTS: really? regardless of velocity?)
#And, according to a TV show, 25 meters should do it.
#Saying goodbye is something anyone would want to do before committing suicide, there are different methods for telling people, but if I don't want to do it I can go ahead and commit suicide.
# Same goes for Suicide notes.
# There are a bunch of neat google searches I can do about things like decapitation and complex methods of suicide.

I should mention, to be well rounded, the description of what the book is the book does link to one list of suicide hotline numbers appropriate for the US.  But ''my impression'' of the only content added to the book since its creation does have POV problems. 

There were three keep votes in the original Rfd.  One that said the book was kept with the opinion of many people because it was RfD'ed so close to its creation, and that it might be ok if it didn't only advocate suicide.  

Another keep vote said it was a POV violation not to include a book on committing Suicide.  This is an interesting point, does NPOV about the choice of books we include, the books themselves, or both? One I don't want to debate here, I will simply point out that [[WB:SOAP]] states it is the individual modules that must maintain NPOV.

The books creator also voted for keeping the book, as I interpret his comments it is ok to keep a book advocating suicide just like it is ok for a C++ book advocates the use of that language.  

Many people made excellent comments, followed by a lets wait and see what this book becomes.  As it is now 2 years later, it is a good time to review. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:55, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. I declined the query because it's been created for ages and because it's got an outline. If POV and poorly defined scope are the only problems, why can't somebody simply define the scope, weed out the biased POVs and cite the rest? Maybe, just maybe, a psychologist or somebody will dedicate himself to this book in the future, and turn it into a good book, maybe even a featured book.

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' Thanks for the notification Thenub314, I'm not the creator but have attempted to fix the book a little (feel free to check the previous status). The bottom line is that the book is a stub anyone can improve it and reshape freely (I'm referring to the structure and defining a direction for the content). The topic of the book will not be seen as politically correct, most of the deletions request tend to stem from that or get special momentum because of it, as such we should increase the level of protection granted to it, this type of works are beneficial for the project as it creates diversity of thoughts and opinions and protects also the needed diversity of Wikibooks, in general I don't mind deleting stalled old stubs but this makes this one special.
:In this specific case the topic covered is important and often discarded, death in general is becoming increasingly tabu in most of our societies, since I did attempt to correct past problems, I did examine the points you raise and I don't see them as a major problem I've checked the fist 2 on your list the first is beneficial not only for the person considering the thing but it also can promote detection of the persons intentions and you decontextualized the second one, it relates to the example being given, it is my interpretation that it refers to the force at the moment of impact...
:In any case it is my view and I'm voting accordingly. A deletion is not on the best interests of the project and that none of the issues the work may have are un-fixable at this stage of development.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:36, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''&lt;s&gt;Strong&lt;/s&gt; Delete''' [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] has put a lot of excellent work into this book.  Despite his efforts, I still find it quite biased. In fact more so.  There have been added lots of images, many of romantic images of famous suicides.  Lots of quotes for suicide notes.  Many more graphs, without text explaining them.   There has been some sections added, most consisting of only images.  Where text is added it does not live up to our verifiable criteria, and OR is implicitly (and possibly accidentally) placed into the work.
:*The graphs give the appearance of verifiability, without actually giving solid references.
:*The quotes form suicide notes only more bias the book toward the point of view that suicide is acceptable. Without offering alternate perspectives.
:*The sections I mentioned previously remain effectively the same.  
:*I should explain what I mean by OR exists.  Is it really a ''common'' to use of suicide to as a political protest?  According to us it is.  Is it really a form of mental torture to be place in a US jail or prison, according to wikibooks (currently) it is (which I find offensive on a personal level).  This is what some people call synthesis, the book is using facts to draw new conclusions which as far as I know are not drawn elsewhere.

:So to summarize I feel this book as it stands is unverifiable, contains synthesis (a form of OR), and is biased.  It doesn't stand a hope of being developed into a text that could be used to teach a course at any accredited institution I am familiar with.

:: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Sorry, but this seems a bit over the top, Thenub314. I understand that it's an emotional issue and you may find it personally offensive. Every graph I checked linked to source data and don't see the blatant OR going on here. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:46, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
:::{{Comment}} I agree the graphs do point to their source.  It is the choice of how the information is included that bothers me.  The case of the graph involving declining suicide rates in Jail, relative to rather constant suicide rates in prison, the image is place in a section on &quot;mental torture.&quot;  To me this implies that being put in prison or jail is a form of torture.  Since the subsection on mental torture is included under &quot;Common motivations&quot;, the implication would seem to be that it is life in prison driving people to commit suicide.   This is not what is claimed if you follow the link to the data.  Perhaps I am a bit sensitive to this particular instance, given my particular relationship to the prison system in the US, but it is clear there is no underlying source here.  What little is written is written is the personal views and interpretation of data and historical facts of the editors here.  To give another example consider the section on jumping.  It first gives a classic parabolic graph for an objects velocity under constant gravity.  This (in my opinion) is more or less irrelevant, as wind resistance plays a major factor.  Then it proceeds to quote a forensic pathology book.  Giving the appearance that something meaningful is being said.  Unfortunately when one actually reads the forensic pathology book it is not speaking about head injuries incurred from jumping off of tall structures.  Instead it is talking about low velocity impacts, that might occur from say tripping and falling.  The author is then applying this to another situation.  The book does not say soft tissue injuries that occur when you jump from a building are not fatal.  That was the opinion of the author writing the section.

:{{comment}} After some further reflection, I could see moving this book to a chapter of a book on Death.  The philosophy department where I was an undergraduate offered such a course on the subject, and it naturally covered the spirit of what this book aims to cover.  A factual description of what suicide is, along with a discourse of ideas surrounding it.  In addition having the book as part of a broader context could bring a lot to it.  I recall having discussed other philosophical issues about about death fit quite well with this subject.  For example, to what extent informed consent and pain relief (say in late stage cancer's) consist of medically assisted suicide?  (It is not uncommon for the pain relievers to be the direct cause death it seems).  But I would be curious if people thought this would make the context too broad.

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Thanks for understanding and for the correction [[User:Kayau|Kayau]]. I've fallowed your findings and note that the &quot;book&quot; hasn't been evolving, was stale since 8 November 2009. A minor correcting edit was done in May 2010 by [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] (logged out). I've been very outspoken against the deletion of content only because it was copied without attribution to Wikipedia or by the correct transwiki of the content, but in this case it does indeed continue to only reproduce the content found on the original project with no clear intention of going beyond an encyclopedic article...

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''': Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia and encyclopedic pages even qualify for speedy deletion.  Even forgiving the attribution, the time given to develop the page into a book has not been taken advantage of and the content issue remains.

This page is full of Questions regarding the Python Programming language. The questions are General in nature and do not relate to a particular section of the book. Is Wikibooks a Reference Desk? [[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 09:59, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''': [[WB:WIW]] says that Wikibooks is not a dictionary or encyclopedia; nothing is said about a reference desk, though.  [[Wikibooks:Study help desk]] is no longer active.

:: That may be your personal view, but there is no rule that forbids book contributors. See Adrignola's comment, posted an hour before yours.

:{{Keep}} I agree that it is unwise to have question pages here, since we any particular book rarely has an editor attending it to.  But I have seen many books here that have such question pages. But I fully support the idea of turning it into a FAQ.  On a personal note, I don't see why it makes sense to ask questions at wikipedia.

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' As others mentioned, a static FAQ makes perfect sense as a book module. Even a dynamic Q&amp;A section can be useful for the authors of a book as an alternative way of for gathering reader suggestions about which areas could be improved. That's why I wouldn't agree with a hard rule on deleting Q&amp;A pages. However, such pages would have to be clearly labelled as resources for posting questions that the book left unanswered, and not as general-purpose reference desks, as both this and the cited Chess page are. So, delete, or at least refactor to a more well-defined scope (which is unfortunately unlikely given the low activity in that book).--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 18:50, 6 May 2010 (UTC)

: {{del}} There's already a Q&amp;A section for wikibooks.  To reach them, click the &quot;discussion&quot; link at the top of the page, and ask a question associated with the given page (or the main book if necessary.) In these cases, content questions are usually indications that the person asking them hasn't read the page, but can otherwise be clarifying questions. &lt;br/&gt; I'd also like to draw attention to [[C Programming/Q&amp;A]] - at one time, I did a cleanup on that page, removing questions that turned out to be word purée, duplicate, or from those who simply can't be bothered reading the book.  There were also homework questions, and and drive-by questions (e.g. post a question but make no attempt to assist others.)  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 23:26, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
:: Talk pages are specifically for discussing their corresponding pages, not necessarily the general topic of the book. Comments posted on these are only noticed by those watching those pages so there is a benefit to having a local page where users can ask questions or ask general feedback. That is not to say that Q&amp;A/FAQ pages are necessary or even useful on all books. Simply that some book contributors may find them useful and as long as they're not harmful, we would do well to respect the wishes of those contributors. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:54, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I have created several Q&amp;A pages but all in the talk namespace, not as part of a book. They are generally important and useful. They permit clarification of the subject matter, detecting missing information on the work, helps to improve the quality of the content and even in helping readers (a happy reader will often turn into a good contributor). I'm not as yet contributing to Wikiversity but a Q&amp;A can be an extremely helpful tool to bridge a book into Wikiversity.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:04, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

: {{Comment}} Someone should start a fresh RfD for [[Chess/Q&amp;A]] and [[C Programming/Q&amp;A]] and place an RfD templates on those pages if we are are serious about deleting them.

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' as per my several comments above that may be summarised as follows: Q&amp;A/FAQs are within the scope of Wikibooks, have their uses and while I wouldn't choose these for the books I'm working on, I believe that as long as they're not harmful, we should give contributors leeway in how they structure their books and interact with their readers, as has been the culture here at Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:54, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

**Randomized. 30 patients, intractable medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Arm 1) SRS 20 Gy vs Arm 2) SRS 24 Gy. Target at the amygdala, 2 cm of the anterior hippocampus and parahipocampal gyrus, 50% prescription isodose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Setting up a test-environment ==
Every once in a while you need to test something for OpenClinica and you don't want to clutter your production database, so you decide you need a test-environment. Here is how to do that, plus instructions how to clean up after your testing.

It takes four steps to create your test-environment:
#create a new database
#make a copy of the web-app
#make a data directory
#edit datainfo.properties

=== Create a new database ===
In this example we'll name the test environment octest. Login to your server and go to the dir with psql and start it:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /usr/bin 
sudo -u postgres ./psql
CREATE DATABASE octest WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER=clinica;&lt;/pre&gt;

Check if the database was created correctly with &quot;\list&quot; (or just &quot;\l&quot; will do) and quit psql with &quot;\q&quot;

=== Make a copy of the web-app ===
Change to the tomcat webapps directory and copy the OpenClinica structure:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
sudo -u tomcat cp -r OpenClinica octest&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Make a data directory ===
Change to directory /usr/local/tomcat and create a data directory and give tomcat all rights:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /usr/local/tomcat/
sudo mkdir octest.data 
sudo chown tomcat octest.data 
sudo chgrp tomcat octest.data&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Edit datainfo.properties ===
The last thing to do is edit the file datainfo.properties. Go to the right directory and start your favourite editor:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/octest/WEB-INF/classes
sudo -u tomcat vi datainfo.properties&lt;/pre&gt;

Change:&lt;br /&gt;
filePath=/usr/local/tomcat/openclinica.data/&lt;br /&gt;
into:&lt;br /&gt;
filePath=/usr/local/tomcat/octest.data/&lt;br /&gt;

url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/openclinica&lt;br /&gt;
into:&lt;br /&gt;
url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/octest&lt;br /&gt;

sysURL=http://localhost:8080/OpenClinica/MainMenu&lt;br /&gt;
into:&lt;br /&gt;
sysURL.base=http://localhost:8080/octest/MainMenu&lt;br /&gt;

You are now ready to deploy your octest-app and you do this by stopping and starting tomcat.
&lt;pre&gt;
cd /etc/init.d
sudo ./tomcat stop
sudo ./tomcat start&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Cleaning up ===
After testing you should clean up the database and the app and you do this by:

stopping tomcat: 
&lt;pre&gt;cd /etc/init.d
sudo ./tomcatd stop&lt;/pre&gt;
removing the app-directory:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo rm -r /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/octest&lt;/pre&gt;
removing the data-directory:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo rm -r /usr/local/tomcat/octest.data&lt;/pre&gt;
starting psql and removing the database: 
&lt;pre&gt;cd /usr/bin
sudo -u postgres ./psql
drop database octest;
\q&lt;/pre&gt;
starting tomcat: 
&lt;pre&gt;cd /etc/init.d
sudo ./tomcatd start&lt;/pre&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;This challenge project is designed to encourage families to spend quality time reading aloud together; to encourage the child with more advanced reading skills; and to challenger “eager readers” —children who desire to excel in reading and to accomplish an award on their own.&lt;/big&gt;'''


==Requirements:==

&lt;big&gt;Books may be selected from recommended reading lists published by or listed on the Gateway to Reading list (for Adventist schools), or from the NAD Adventurer/Primary Book Club List.

Eager Readers should select books that are at or slightly above their reading level.

Books that are selected for families to read aloud together, should be at or slightly above the child’s listening level. (Typically, the listening level is 2-3 years above the child’s reading level.)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;The Adventurer must read two books, not previously read, in each of the following categories:&lt;/big&gt;

''The Adventure Bible keeps getting better. Its exciting features make learning about faith and growing up spiritually a thrilling journey. Twenty full-color pages offer inspiring activities set to a jungle safari theme. Life in Bible Times whisks you off to the ancient world to discover what life was like back then, with illustrations showing what people ate, where they slept, what kinds of work they did and more. From Jehu to Jesus, People in Bible Times reveals who’s who in the Scriptures. Words to Treasure highlights valuable verses to memorize. Did You Know? gives you insight into God’s Word and turns you into a Bible trivia master. Live It! suggests fun activities to help you remember the truths of the Bible and apply them. The Adventure Bible also features introductions with useful facts about each book of the Bible, a dictionary/concordance for looking up tricky words, and color maps to help you locate places in the Bible.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|JavaScript|Introduction}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Despite the similar names, Java and JavaScript, there is almost no relation aside from syntax between the two languages. Since both are frequently used on the Internet, the two can be confused by the uninitiated. In fact they were developed by two totally different companies, with differing goals and purposes in mind: Netscape developed JavaScript and Sun Microsystems developed Java. JavaScript can be interpreted by most browsers directly and quickly, while Java requires a separate &quot;Java Virtual Machine&quot; to be started before running. JavaScript and Java use a similar syntax (based on the C language) but many of the commands are quite different. There are also technical differences. Java is a [[Wikipedia:Statically-typed programming language|statically typed language]] which requires the declaration of all variables and their types (e.g. integer, string or boolean). In contrast, Javascript is an &quot;loosely&quot; typed language, allowing variables to be used without prior declaration. 

For example, compare the two methods of writing to the display (page). In Java, to write &quot;Hello world!&quot;, the code would read: &lt;code&gt;System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; while in JavaScript (in a browser), it would say: &lt;code&gt;document.write(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;.

JavaScript is an interpreted programming language that is mostly used to turn static web pages into dynamic and interactive pages after a web browser has finished downloading them. For example, a clock displayed on a page that updates itself to show the current time on the user's computer. JavaScript's design was influenced by many programming languages, including C, but is meant to be more usable by non-programmers. JavaScript is not based on or related to Java; this is a common misunderstanding which you can read more about [[JavaScript/Not Java|here]].

==Before we start== &lt;!-- shout-out to [[HTML]] --&gt;
To write JavaScript, you will need to choose a plain text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, PSPad...) and a web browser .  It is a good idea to have a wide array of browsers available for testing, as they often behave in incompatible ways.  You should also be fluent in HTML or XHTML, because manipulating them is the only useful thing JavaScript does in a web page.

To test your programs, you will need an up-to-date web browser. To make them work for the greatest number of users, test them in several browsers. Each browser has slightly different rendering, and most have their quirks which cause technically correct JavaScript to break.  Popular browsers include Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari.  Internet Explorer, although the pet peeve of many web developers, is the most popular among users and therefore essential to your testing kit.  A text-only browser such as Lynx would also serve you well, as it presents the same information in the same order as a seeing- or hearing-impaired user's browser does.

Be aware that JavaScript is unsuitable for essential logic, i.e. anything that must run or that contains secret information.  Not all browsers have a JavaScript interpreter (such as text-only browsers), or run its latest version.  Some users turn off JavaScript capabilities by choice, and as you will soon learn JavaScript source may be viewed and altered by anyone just like HTML.  Generally, web pages should only use JavaScript to enhance the user's experience, rather than depend on it.  This is often referred to as graceful degradation (i.e if the user has turned off JavaScript, the page should always still load, presenting the same information but without the extra functionality provided by JavaScript.)  A [[wikipedia:Server-side scripting|server-side language]] is a much better tool for more critical purposes.

==Your first program==
Let's start with a simple program (modified from [[HyperText_Markup_Language/Introduction|the HTML tutorial]]. Write this code in your editor, or copy-and-paste it, and save it as &quot;index.html&quot;. The file must be saved with the exact extension, and will not render or run correctly otherwise.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt; My First Program &lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
            alert('Hello, world! You just lost The Game.');
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_%28mind_game%29&quot;&gt;The Game&lt;/a&gt; is a mind game
        where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game
        constitutes a loss, which, according to the rules of The Game, must be announced each time it
        occurs. It is impossible to win The Game; players can only attempt to avoid losing for as long
        as possible. The Game has been described alternately as pointless and infuriating, or as a
        challenging game that is fun to play. As of 2010, The Game is played by millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Now open the document in your browser and see the result.  Notice that the source code is normal HTML, except for the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag which contains the JavaScript.  We'll explore its contents in the coming chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|JavaScript|Control Structures|Event Handling}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

&lt;!-- You might wonder why that dialog box got in your face.  Notice in the source that we typed &lt;code&gt;alert&lt;/code&gt; followed by parentheses (or round brackets) and single-quotes around a string of text.  &lt;code&gt;alert&lt;/code&gt; is the name or &quot;identifier&quot; of a '''function'''. --&gt;

== Functions ==
Functions allow you to split your code up into separate parts. This commonly allows a complex task to be broken up into several simple tasks, which then become easier to manage and control.  When you put your script into a function it keeps the browser from executing the script when the page loads. It contains a code that will be executed by an event or call to that function. It can be called from anywhere within a page or even in an external page. While they can be defined in both &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; sections it is commonly used in and highly recommended to be used in the &lt;head&gt; portion in order to have your function load before the rest of the page.&lt;p&gt;

Functions are defined with &lt;code&gt;function ''name''() { ''code'' }&lt;/code&gt;. To call a function, use &lt;code&gt;''name''()&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Functions without arguments ===

Let us create a function that will perform for us the one of the most common examples when beginning programming. That of saying &quot;Hello, World!&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function helloWorld() {
  alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code is saying:
* create a function called helloWorld
* that doesn't expect any arguments
* and perform the following statement, to alert a message

When we want to invoke this function in our HTML document, we call the function in the following manner:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
helloWorld();
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's put this together on a sample web page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Some Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      function helloWorld() {
        alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
      }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A web page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      helloWorld();
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Example====
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/source&gt;
      &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      function displaymessage() {
        alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
      }
      &lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
      &lt;input id=&quot;displayMessage&quot; type=&quot;Button&quot; value=&quot;Click Here!&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/source&gt;
      &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      document.getElementById(&quot;displayMessage&quot;).onclick = displaymessage;
      &lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Since the line &quot;alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)&quot; was placed in a function it will not display until the button is clicked, in which case the alert will pop up.

=== Functions with arguments ===

Let's start with a quick example, then we will break it down.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function stepToFive(number) {
  if (number &gt; 5) {
    number -= 1;
  }
  if (number &lt; 5) {
    number += 1;
  }
  return number;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This program takes a number as an argument. If the number is larger than 5, it subtracts one. If it's smaller than five it adds one. Let's get down and dirty and look at this piece by piece.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function stepToFive(number) {
&lt;/source&gt;

This is similar to what we've seen before. We now have &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; following the function name. This is where we define our arguments for later use, which is similar to defining variables, except in this case the variables are only valid inside of the function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
  if (number &gt; 5) {
&lt;/source&gt;

If statements. If the condition is true, execute the code inside the curly brackets.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    number -= 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Assuming that JavaScript is your first language, you might not know what this means. This takes one off from the variable &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;. You can think of it as a useful shorthand for &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    number += 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is similar to the last one, except that it adds one instead of subtracting it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
  return number;
&lt;/source&gt;

This returns the value of number from the function. This will be covered in more depth later on.

Here is an example of using this in a page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Some Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/source&gt;
      &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
      function stepToFive(number) {
        if (number &gt; 5) {
          number -= 1;
        }
        if (number &lt; 5) {
          number += 1;
        }
        return number;
      }
      &lt;/source&gt;
    &lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/source&gt;
        &lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
        var num = stepToFive(6);
        alert(num);
        &lt;/source&gt;
      &lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are a few more things to cover here.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var num = stepToFive(6);
&lt;/source&gt;

This is where the return statement in the function comes in handy. &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; here gets assigned the number 5, since that is what stepToFive will return when it's given an argument of 6.

== Objects ==

The philosophy of object-oriented programming says that program code should be as modular as possible.  Once you've written and tested a function, it should be possible to slot it into any program or script needing that kind of functionality and just expect it to work, because it's already been tried and tested on an earlier project.  

The benefits of this approach are a shorter development time and easier debugging, because you're re-using program code that has already been proven.  This 'black box' approach means that data goes into the Object and other data comes out of the Object, but what goes on inside it isn't something you need to concern yourself with.

An Object is a code structure that has its own private variables, and stores data that is isolated from outside interference.  Only the Object itself can alter this data.  The user works with the data through a set of public functions (called Methods) for accessing these private variables.  It's probably most convenient to consider that an Object has its own set of functions that allows you to work with it in certain ways.

While JavaScript allows creating of objects, you will discover that access protection are not directly available in JavaScript; as such, it is possible to bypass the intent of the object-oriented programming by directly accessing fields or methods.  To minimize the impact of these issues, you may want to ensure that methods are properly described and cover known situations of use - and to avoid directly accessing methods or fields that are designed to hold the internal state of the object. 

Javascript provides a set of predefined Objects.  For example: the document itself is an Object, with internal variables like 'title' and 'URL'.

== The Date Object ==

Let's look at the &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; Object.  You can create a new object and assign it to a variable name using the ''new'' keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var mydate = new Date();
&lt;/source&gt;

The Date Object has a set of internal variables which hold the time, day, month, and year.  It allows you to refer to it like a string, so you could for example pop-up the time that the variable was created.  A pair of lines like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDate = new Date();
alert(myDate);
&lt;/source&gt;

would display an alert box showing the current time and date, in universal time, like this:
{| style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.2em; width: 100%; margin-bottom:1.5em&quot;
|-
|
Tue Jul 26 13:27:33 UTC+1200 2007
|-
|}

Even though it produced a string, the variable myDate is not actually one itself. An operator called ''typeof'' returns a string that indicates what type the variable is. These types are:
* boolean
* function
* number
* object
* string
* undefined

So the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDate = new Date();
alert(typeof myDate);
&lt;/source&gt;

would produce:

{| style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.2em; width: 100%; margin-bottom:1.5em&quot;
|-
|
object

The Date Object stores a lot of information about the date, which are accessed using a certain predefined ''method''. Some examples of these methods are:
* getFullYear()
* getMonth()
* getDate()
* getDay()
* getHours()
* getMinutes()
* getSeconds()

The following code shows the year and what type of object that information is.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDate = new Date();
var year = myDate.getFullYear();
alert(year + '\n' + typeof(year));
&lt;/source&gt;

{| style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.2em; width: 100%; margin-bottom:1.5em&quot;
|-
|
2007&lt;br&gt;
number
|-
|}

Because information such as the year are private to the object, the only way we have to alter that information is to use a method provided by the Object for that purpose.

The above methods to get information from the Date object have matching methods that allow you to set them too.
* setFullYear()
* setMonth()
* setDate()
* setDay()
* setHours()
* setMinutes()
* setSeconds()

The following code will show one year, followed by a different year.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDate = new Date();
alert(myDate.getFullYear());
myDate.setFullYear(2008);
alert(myDate.getFullYear());
&lt;/source&gt;

{| style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.2em; width: 100%; margin-bottom:1.5em&quot;
|-
|2007
|-
|}

{| style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.2em; width: 100%; margin-bottom:1.5em&quot;
|-
|2008
|-
|}

==Defining New Classes==

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var site = {};
site.test = function (string) {
    alert(&quot;Hello World! &quot; + string);
    site.string = string;
}
site.test(&quot;Boo!&quot;);
alert(site.string);
&lt;/source&gt;

What this example does is:
* Define site as an empty object
* Add a method called test to the site object
* Call the test method with variable &quot;Boo!&quot;

The result is:
* An alert message with &quot;Hello World! Boo!&quot;
* site.string being defined as string
* An alert message with &quot;Boo!&quot;.

=== In summary ===
An object is a structure of variables and some functions used to work with those variables.  These include private variables, which can (or in JavaScript's case, should) ''only'' be referenced or changed using the ''methods'' it provides.    If a &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; object's &lt;code&gt;getFullYear()&lt;/code&gt; method returns an incorrect value, you can depend on the fact that somewhere in your script, the &lt;code&gt;setFullYear()&lt;/code&gt; method has been used to alter it.

== this keyword ==

The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword allows a method to read and write the property variables of that instance of the object.

The following example uses an initial capital letter for &lt;code&gt;PopMachine()&lt;/code&gt; to help indicate that the object needs to be created with the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function PopMachine() {
    this.quarters = 0;
    this.dollars = 0;
    this.totalValue = function () {
        var sum = this.quarters * 25 + this.dollars * 100;
        return sum;
    }
    this.addQuarters = function (increment) {
        this.quarters += increment;
    }
    this.addDollars = function (increment) {
        this.dollars += increment;
    }
}
function testPopMachine() {
    var popMachine = new PopMachine();
    popMachine.addQuarters(8);
    popMachine.addDollars(1);
    popMachine.addQuarters(-1);
    alert(&quot;Total in the cash register is: &quot; + popMachine.totalValue());
}
testPopMachine();
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exceptions ==

In Javascript, errors are created by the Error object and its subclasses.  To catch the error to prevent it from stopping your script, you need to enclose sections of your code with the try...catch block.  

Errors have two important fields: Error.name - which is the name of the error, and Error.message - a human readable description of the error.  

While you can throw any object you want as an exception, it's strongly recommended to throw an instance of the Error object.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==

If you point a flash light at the ground you might see little green eyes; it is a wolf spider.  They are hairy, and typically brown to gray in color with various markings or lines.  The wolf spider's body size is less than 1 to 30 millimeters.

==Where does it live?==

They live in common houses.  They look for warm places for winter time, like garages.  Wolf Spiders may be found in a wide range of habitats, like shrublands, woodlands, wet coastal forests, alpine meadows, and even suburban gardens.

==What does it eat?==

The wolf spider eats bugs and insects &amp;mdash; crickets, other spider, ants, grasshopers &amp;mdash; and also small lizards and frogs.  The wolf spider kills its prey by injecting venom.

==How does it defend itself?==

The wolf spider defends itself by injecting you with venom.  They say that if you bother them it will inject venom and if you get bitten you get swelling, mild pain, and itching; it is painful.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
The Wolf Spiders' mother carries their large egg sac around with her.
When the baby spiderlings hatch they climb on the mother's back and ride around until partially grown.


==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

They do not spin a web but roam at night to hunt for food.  The wolf spider is shy and seeks to run away when disturbed.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Not all spider bites are poisonous.  The wolf spider might poison you.

==Understand the steps to salvation:==

Click on the link below to print the pdf file from Dow's Schoolroom.  

[http://www.thedowsschoolroom.com/salvationpopup.pdf Salvation Popup Booklet.pdf]
 
#'''God Is Love''' - (1 John 4:8). God loves me very much (Jer. 31:3). God loves everyone (John 3:16).
#'''Recognize I am a sinner''' - Everyone does wrong and is a sinner, thus everyone needs salvation because sinners will die forever (Rom 3:23).
#'''Believe Jesus Can Save Me''' - God sent Jesus to die so I wouldn’t have to die forever (John 3:16). Then He rose again as my Saviour (1Cor. 5:3, 4). When I Receive Jesus, all my sins will be forgiven (Isa. 1:18; Ps. 51:7-11; 1 John 2:1, 2)
#'''Salvation is a Gift God Gaves Me''' - I must personally ask Jesus to be my Saviour (John 1:12) God hears me when I pray.
#'''I Have Accepted Jesus''', I have become a new person, one who doesn’t want to do wrong because I love Jesus and Jesus loves me (John 3:3-7; 2 Cor. 5:17).
#'''Jesus Is My Savior''' - I can be sure that I am saved when I have asked Jesus to be my Saviour (John 3:26; Heb. 13:5). Because I am sinful, I will still make mistakes. But I if I confess my sins to Jesus, He will forgive me and remove my guilt completely (Jer. 31:34).  God wants me to confess to others who are hurt by my actions (1 John 1:9) and make restitution to them (Luke 19:8), and then totally turn away from sin (John 8:11).

I use different resources to teach the steps of salvation. One of then is the wordless book - http://www.hslaunch.com/mypage/downloader.php?file=userfiles/0/11840226842.pdf&amp;id=2924

==Read and discuss with an adult four of the following Bible stories on conversion/salvation:==
#The Ethiopian converted (Acts 8:26-40)
#Naaman washed clean (2 Kings 5)
#Jesus loves children (Matt. 19:13-15
#The lost coin, sheep and son (Luke 15)
#Zachacus (Luke 19:1-10)
#Jailer converted (Acts 16:21-34)

==Memorize John 3:16, Acts 16:31, and 1 John 1:9 ==

==Spend a regular quiet time with Jesus.==
You may combine this Awards with Builder Requeriment My God III, His Power in My Life.

==Make a personal choice to accept Jesus as Saviour and Lord. Discuss your decision with a parent or club teacher.==
#Trace around your foot on paper and decorate any way you like, including the words of commitment: I _____(your name) have taken my first steps to Jesus today___________(date) with ________________(adult witness’ name).
#Show the foot (commitment response to a club teacher, to receive a certificate and award patch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
A trap-door spider has a large abdomen and shiny legs and pincers.  Most species of the trap-door spider have black legs and a brown abdomen.  The trap-door spider is a relative of the tarantula.  It can be distinguished from the tarantula by a less hairy abdomen.  Trap-door spiders go from 4 in.&amp;ndash;4.5 in.  They camouflage with soil, trees, and rocks.

==Where does it live?==
The trap-door spider lives underground for protection. It will hide until prey passes by then surprise it by sneaking up on it. 
==What does it eat?==
The trap door spider eats ladybugs, ants, beetles and other spiders wandering near its burrow.
The trap door spider senses the movements of its possible prey. When close enough, the trap door spider opens the door of its burrow and lunges on its prey. Then upon catching it, the spider holds on to it with two of its legs and injects a quick setting paralyzing venom that stops the movements of its prey. The trap door spider then carries it down its burrow and feasts on it.

==How does it defend itself?==
The trap-door spider defends  itself by having a burrow to defend its babies. To defend itself it has venom
==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
* Eggs will hatch on the 7th month
* After mating
==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

==How does this bug affect people?==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to have a single button on a content management system that will copy a file to a remote subversion repository.

== Method ==
We will configure our subversion repository on a standard Apache server that is configured with an SSL certificate.  This will encrypt all communication between the intranet system and the remote subversion server.  We will also set the authentication to be Basic Authentication.

== Apache Configuration File ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Location &quot;/testsvn/&quot;&gt;
  DAV svn
  AuthName &quot;svntest&quot;
  SVNParentPath /Library/Subversion/RepositoryTest
  SVNAutoversioning on
  &lt;Limit GET HEAD OPTIONS CONNECT POST PROPFIND PUT DELETE PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK&gt;
     Require user  testuser1  testuser2  testuser3
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
  AuthType Basic
&lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== HTTP Put Function for Basic Authentication ==

HTTP Basic authentication requires the user to concatinate the user and password with a colon seperating the strings and then do a base64-encoding on that string.  This is then send in the HTTP header with the key of &quot;Authorization&quot;.  The HTTP header must look like the following:

   Authorization = Basic BASE64-ENCODED-USER-PASSWORD

The following XQuery function performs this process.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function http:put-basic-auth($url, $content, $username, $password, $in-header) as node(){
  let $credentials := concat($username, ':', $password)
  let $encode := util:base64-encode($credentials)
  let $value := concat('Basic ', $encode)
  let $new-headers :=
  &lt;headers&gt;
     {$in-header/header}
     &lt;header name=&quot;Authorization&quot; value=&quot;{$value}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/headers&gt;
  let $response := httpclient:put($url, $content, false(), $new-headers)
return $response
};
&lt;/source&gt;

To put the file you just need to put the URL to the correct content area, and the content to be inserted, the user name and password and

== Monitoring HTTP Client Libraries ==
Debugging authentication protocols is very difficult if you do not have the correct tools.  One of the most useful tools is to enable logging for the httpclient module.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;category name=&quot;org.apache.commons.httpclient&quot; additivity=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
        &lt;priority value=&quot;debug&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;console&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/category&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

I decided to place this nomination after seeing the arguments about this book, [[Mathematics Fundamentals]] (which is already an RfD) and [[Physics Course]] (to which the same considerations apply), and I am basing it on [[WB:FORK]]. I am aware of that not being official policy but the argument still stands (as per the snowball clause, or whatever you call it here in Wikibooks). The point is that, while the author is more than welcome to start from scratch the Physics books at vi.wikibooks.org if they do not exist, it makes no sense to have a book like this one alongside the existing ones in [[:Category:Physics]]. Although the quality and depth of the books available there appears to (after a five minute inspection) vary widely, consider a book such as [[Physics Study Guide]], which covers pretty much all of the material available here with '''overwhelmingly''' better quality. As for the quality issues with the book, they are too numerous to mention here, so I provided a sample analysis of the first module in my userspace: [[User:Duplode/On the Physics Handbook Wikibook]].

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''': Many people will start a new book on a subject rather than add to an existing one due to differences in writing style or personal ideas as to what the topic should cover.  If there are other books on the same topic, with the same scope and intended audience, then the best content from both should be merged together to create a single book that is better than either one was before.  Wikibooks has enough stubs as it is; we should be trying to get as many books as complete as possible. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:47, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}}  I have sympathies with both of the positions above.  One difficulty is that the same arguments apply to many books by this author.  [[Communication Course]], [[Electronics Course]], etc.  (Just search for &quot;Quach Trung&quot; for a longer list).   Since the author is blindly translating books from vi.wikibooks, without really looking at what is available there is lots of repetition.  And perhaps several books that are like [[Physics Handbook]].  In general, merging seems like the right thing to do.  The difficulty is that many of the pages should be (in my opinion) &quot;empty merge.&quot;  Meaning the page in one book is so much more complete and well written then the page in a the second book there is not information to include.  So then what do you do? A history merge is out of order, so a speedy delete seems like the way to go.  But then what a slippery slope we stand on.  I can only imagine a future where two people are arguing about whose page is better and the &quot;empty merge&quot; their competitor away because the feel their page is so much better.  And if you really feel every page is an empty merge isn't an RfD more sensible then marking every page as a speedy delete.  I haven't look closely enough to know if for this book I would call every page an empty merge.  It might be that one of the many tables could be a nice addition to some page?  So I'll just leave my thoughts as a comment for now. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:08, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I have done many merges. Note that a merge can be a result of a RfD, but it isn't forced, like as in creating a timeframe, (probably it will result in a later RfD if it lingers).
:: The merge in itself, as I have recently stated in a reply to a Wikibookians asking for clarification (and to Adrignola), after a merge is complete to the editor's satisfaction, if any usable content still remains present that has no seemingly future on the project, just do the merge of the edit history and start a RfD that explains that to the rest of the community, it can even be useful on other projects, like Wikiversity etc...

::: Just doing a history merge when there is not actual contribution is just academic dishonesty.  The authors of the page deserve credit and it is not fair to the contributors of the actual content to give credit to people who actually no contribution.  If there is material left after the merge that doesn't belong in the new book, but is not replicated there.  In that case I agree with you, it should be kept for the use of future endeavors.  If on the other hand the page there is really no content in the first page that is not contained in the second page it should be deleted. If someone wants to use the material in some other book or project, the more complete/better written module will still be there .

:[[File:Symbol opinion vote.svg|15px]] '''FYI:''' The [[Physics Handbook]] (last contribution edit 14 April 2010) and [[Physics Course]] (seems that someone contributed to it at least in 28 April 2010) and [[Physics Study Guide]] (tagged as a [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured book]] and last contributed at least in 12 March 2010) all seem to be active and have Wikibookians working on them as such the RfD seems premature, [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] should engage those communities, propose the merges he sees fit and see if those Wikibookians agree with them, or why not. As for the problem of the author creating many books, I don't see an issue with that, he seems to be only focused on translation and not reformatting the works, that should be fine. A merge can be done later, if he didn't perform the translation there wouldn't be even any content.
: Regarding [[Electronics Course]] and [[Electronics Handbook]] I'm in full agreement with the added merge proposal (at first I thought about if the merge shouldn't be done in reverse but after looking at the content I agree with the proposal), if no one objects that should close the issue there.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:25, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} It seems unnatural to ''propose'' a merge to a community when the proponents themselves do not believe such a merge would be viable, or worth the effort (I, for one, most definitely do not). If you (not just Panic, but all involved) are concerned about undeserved destruction of content, the ideal resolution of this situation would be asking editors of some of the most developed Physics books (by the way, I singled out Physics Study Guide as an example, just for illustrating the point!), who are likely in a better position to evaluate the contents from both a scientific and editorial point of view, to survey the material and see if there is something worth salvaging. Then if, ''and only if'', any of these editors decided it was worth it to &quot;adopt&quot; the contents, the book would be moved to the &quot;namespace&quot; of the adopting book and then get progressively merged with no time frame set. And of course, ideally the author (or authors?) of this Physics Handbook should take part in the proceedings too. Hardly feasible? Maybe, but surely preferable to having not just the duplication of efforts ([[WB:FORK]]) but also a deeply flawed book like this one occupying a very prominent title such as &quot;Physics Handbook&quot; (or worse - I just found out that [[Physics]] redirects to the &quot;Physics Course&quot;).--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 07:25, 6 May 2010 (UTC)

:: You must have misunderstood my position above, I'm not pro or against a merge, just against the deletion as proposed.
:: I fully support any attempt to salvage useful content. I've examined the book's talk pages and there isn't any expression of objection to the merges that have been proposed (I take you are against them, but you have failed to participate your objection there). This is why I don't think this RfD is useful, talk to the communities first, try to bring previous contributors to the table, but there is at present no policy or guideline that would validate the deletion of concurrent works, like I think you are proposing, the steps are simple and non destructive 1) propose merge 2) merge non opposed for 7+ days do merge, if blocked by the book existing editors/good reasons (merge aborted, try again in a few months) 3) merge done, if spare content still lingers after an history merge the admin if the content is significative will bring it to a RfD. (This is how it has been done in most case, and the cases that have been done right in my opinion.)
:: I will gladly discuss the &quot;proposed&quot; [[WB:FORK]] policy and how it came about. The idea is simpler, we shouldn't prevent contribution of useful content, book tend to be highly personal enterprises (long and require structure) by not promoting but enabling contributors to get out of the problem of too many cooks in the kitchen, we are fomenting participation and reducing conflict, as I said earlier, merges and deletions can only occur if the content is here to be acted upon, forced participation/collaboration will not work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:46, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
::: I find above discussion a bit unfair to [[User:Duplode|Duplode]].  It should not be necessary to express disagreement with a merger before suggesting deletion.  This is the appropriate forum for discussing deletion.  He brought his concerns to the correct place and I thank him.  In addition it is not the case the the community &quot;in favor or merging&quot; is not represented here.  I placed the merge templates, I am taking part.  Unrelated to my comments above, let me express the opinion that if one finds writing a book a highly personal enterprise, perhaps one should consider a different forum from than a wiki. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:09, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: Unfair ? We were replying to each-other for mutual understanding, the arguments can be valid or not. Since you are supporting that this is the right forum, well this forum can serve for any type of discussion (but it should be considered off topic) since the there is a presumption that a RfD is just that a request for deletion. And so I will attempt to prove why it is all off topic...
:::: Duplode has put one things on the table, the RfD of the work (to what I already voted my opinion) but he requests the deletion not based on valid (by policy) reasons, but by his disagreement with a merge (this has no bearing here, he should talk to those that have proposed it) and he seem to like the FORK proposal (I have no problem with his support for it but again this shouldn't be the forum to discuss the proposal), most important to me is that he failed in attempting to address those book communities first. I'm extremely defensive of the right to block (in regards to any decision process on Wikibooks) within reason.
:::: Since you have placed the merge templates, both of you should come to an understanding seeing that he doesn't share your opinion, but why involve the rest of the community especially with a RfD? This is clearly an instance where a more general forum would apply if and after a private or limited attempt of dialog had failed, and that is not even the case. Just like your last post and this reply, it could all been better done in private.
:::: As for the wiki mantra and Wikibooks being only fit for accommodating types is unrealistic, you shouldn't look further than this RfD since all attempts to compromise and enter into dialog (with those with invested interests on the specific subject, on the &quot;inside loop&quot;) have not been taken. On the global picture you can look to the best works we have and to the number of stubs and abandoned works. Good works are creations of highly motivated people, they have a stable structures, and they are the result of organized book communities (that in itself protects them from &quot;unwanted&quot; interferences since they require more coordination and investiture to be a participant) or singe handed jobs (those are rare). This is by far most the personal invested oriented goal on any Wikimedia project, it requires not only commitment but the capacity to organize around a specific subjects, knowledge about it and the being able to  complete the job, and all that done voluntarily. Ultimately what you are proposing is that some people aren't fit to participate, I wont agree with that, the project has gone to extreme lengths to make all able to contribute (be inclusive), in my view only vandals should be excluded and even then I defend moderation and when possible an attempt of education.
:::: To me a Wikibook is like a sand castle. Imagine a kid constructing a sand castle on the beach, participation is welcomed, but not required and there is plenty of sand for all, there is no need to fight over it or how the castle should be built, and when the castle is built it is only sand, it will be used again, what is important is that the sand remains and kids come to build new and improved castles.
:::: I hope you and Duplode understand that I'm not attempting to force the issue or my view on you, or that I by engaging in a dialog with you am in any way attacking you. I'm attacking only the argumentation, and I'm known for being wrong sometimes or at least not having the full facts...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 11:44, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: Minor cross-replies to you above (find timestamps &quot;1:56, 6 May 2010&quot; and &quot;12:01, 6 May 2010&quot;).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:02, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
::::: First of all, Panic, there's no need to worry too much about being &quot;unfair&quot; with me - as you said, we are discussing ideas here, and you can be sure I won't take criticism of my arguments as a personal attack. Of course, there is a risk in making &quot;unfair&quot; arguments, namely that unfairness means they rest on issues which may not be pertinent to the discussion at hand, and that may detract from the point one is trying to make. An example would be your claim that the messages in this RfD are &quot;off topic&quot;. If someone puts up an RfD, even if supported by weak arguments, discussions about the merits of the request can't possibly be off topic until consensus has been reached (something that clearly hasn't happened, as from all the involved people you are the only one to have expressed a final stance, be it &quot;Keep&quot; or &quot;Delete&quot;). on what to do or the RfD got closed by an admin (as per [[WB:DP]] or whatever else happens). Furthermore, even if an RfD like mine is flawed for one reason or another something productive may arise out of it (like a plan of action to recover the involved books) in case the final decision is &quot;Keep&quot;. After all, that is pretty much the same principle on which your criticism of this RfD rests (it is better not to kill something flawed if a better thing can grow out of it), except that applied on the RfD itself instead of on a Wikibook.
::::: Digression closed, back to the Handbook. Your argument mentions that creating a Wikibook is something that demands extra dedication when compared to doing work in other Wikimedia projects. Curiously enough, that is one of the main reasons why I believe this RfD is valid. The numerous factual and presentational errors that justify my claim about the low quality of the book imply that the author either is not putting enough effort in making this an useful resource or is unable to do so. The flaws in the present version make me believe that this book will ''not'' become an useful resource unless it is adopted (as I explained in the previous comment) by another book or is taken over by a dedicated author. And (I'm perfectly aware I will get severely flamed for saying it, but still) I do believe having a &quot;Physics&quot; or &quot;Physics Handbook&quot; resource of such poor quality lying around, hoping for the day it gets rescued by a talented volunteer, just for the sake of inclusiveness ''hurts the project as a whole''.
::::: As for the issues of not following due process (as in trying to find an amiable solution before filing an RfD), I admit that could be argued upon as well. However:
::::: 1. I immediately placed an RfD notice on the [[User_talk:206.130.173.55|main contributor talk page]] (admittedly it escaped me at first that the contributor has an under-used account in Wikibooks, so only now I placed the notice there). This way, even if the RfD fails (or if it succeds) said contributor will have (or have had) the chance of becoming aware of the discussions.
::::: 2. On the other hand, previous attempts of reaching that contributor failed - for instance, during the RfD of Mathematics Fundamentals.
::::: 3. You also mention I should have recognized the merge of proposal of Thenub before coming here. That proposal has very little to do with my RfD, as it proposes merging Physics Handbook and Physics Course, both from the same author and both equally flawed.
::::: 4. Finally, one thing we all seem to (almost) agree about is that any non-destructive course of action would start with requesting comments from people involved in the other Physics books. Before posting my message yesterday I went about doing so, but a quick inspection at the most complete books in [[:Category:Physics]] revealed no obvious targets for asking for help, as most of these projects do not have a currently active community (most recent edits are small typos and such); and since I wanted to post the message before going to bed I left it for later. Still, I intend reaching someone (if this was Wikipedia filing an RfC would help, but here there are just too few contributors) - and would be happy if you or other ''interested parties'' (frankly, &lt;s&gt;more interested&lt;/s&gt; more interested in salvaging any eventual content than myself) tried the same as well. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:39, 6 May 2010 (UTC)

:::::: I'm glad you understand that we are merely in dialog, but for what I read you already understood my basic position. The lack of people taking position as you state is an indication that the content is not significant or they don't care about the subject, a long argumentation also put some people off, this is why we should avoid going sidetracked). I'll try to be succinct as the thread is getting huge. 
:::::: I could have used relevance in place on or off topic. RfDs are often closed, removed and changed without reaching a consensus and any Wikibookian can close them, for instance one other issue I oppose on bringing into a RfD are the copyvios, as it can be handled without coming directly to a RfD (the RfD in those cases is a RfKeep). Often than not an RfD does cause more harm than good, so frivolous ones should be avoided. I'm here since 2004 and never saw a RfD having a good outcome to a work at best it prompts some minor edits for others that oppose the deletion, I often put myself to the task (and I count in one hand other that do the same).
:::::: If put yourself in the receiving end and someone making similar considerations on your work, in these terms, it is extremely demoralizing. You have to consider the intentions and the work other have put into it at this time, a simple query or merge wound have been extremely useful earlier in the game. Physics Study Guide (was created in October 2003), Physics Handbook (in December 2009), Physics Course (also in December 2009), I know you are here recently. I haven't investigated the steps taken I'm commenting only on what transpired here. A merge even if partial would preserves and give some meaning to the efforts already made. On the other hand if the deletion prompts you to significantly contribute to the remaining work we all gain from it.
:::::: I'll reverse my position to the deletion considering apparent commitment to better existing content.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:46, 6 May 2010 (UTC)
::::::: Okay, I will try to keep it succinct this time. First of all, I believe that if we are doing academic work here demoralization is not a primary concern. Just as we two are able to distinguish attacks to an argumentation from personal attacks, anyone who writes a book should be aware that his/hers work will be subject to public scrutiny and therefore ''objective'' criticism. Furthermore, I strongly recommend you not to change your vote based on my &quot;apparent commitment&quot; to the existing physics books, because: 1. I never implied that during this discussion 2. While I certainly can detect errors in these books I am no specialist in physics and thus lack confidence to make large-scale contributions to the better existing content. 3. Any small-scale contributions I might do there would have very little to do with the books being discussed here, due to the &quot;empty merge&quot; considerations already presented. 4. A substantial part of my argument rests in the fact that it is preferable not to have the &quot;Physics Handbook&quot; and the &quot;Physics Course&quot; here even if no attempt is made to salvage contents from the deleted books, so whether I will commit to existing books is completely irrelevant to the discussion. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 00:56, 7 May 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' I am not sure how I feel about the forking policy, but it is rather beside the point.  I agree that the book is poorly written, that there is better coverage in other wikibooks, and that the attempted scoop is too broad.  I did not mean to invoke so much passion by using the phrase unfair.  The read the comment &quot;(I take you are against [the suggestions to merge on the talk page], but you have failed to participate your objection there)&quot; as implication that it was not the correct thing to do to raise an RfD if he felt the book should be deleted.  If he felt the book should be deleted, an RfD is always a safe way to go, there no need to comment on a talk page first.  Since I was under the impression he was new here, I wanted to make sure to express that ''I'' thought he acted optimally. 

:Here are a randomish collection of my other thoughts reading this.  I never meant to say people were unfit to contribute, but it is easy to feel [[WB:OWN|ownership]] of work here.  I meant to say, if a person does feel ownership over a book, they give themselves a headache trying to develop the book on a wiki.  It would be better for them to develop it in some other way.  

:Regarding the phrase comment &quot;the requests the deletion not based on valid (by policy) reasons&quot;.  Good!  There is no criteria for when we should delete under an RfD.  There are specific criteria for speedy deletions.  But the RfD is specifically for the modules that '''do not''' meet these criteria.  Any book could be deleted if there is community consensus to do so.  So his arguments do not need to be based solely on policy.

:The suggestions that something should have been said in the discussion page before raising the RfD.  This is very rarely done with any book, when someone feels there should be an RfD they tag it and start the discussion here.  In tagging it they involve the community who are editing the book.  End of story.  No need to discuss the merger. No failure to address the books community.

:Finally the remarks about bad books hurting the project reflect my own personal recent experience.  While actively trying to entice other mathematicians and mathematics students to contribute here, I have been repeatedly been told the people had looked at the project in the past, but none of whom contribute.  One student lamented to me &quot;what a great idea, I just wish they had something... anything.&quot;   From the discussion I have had it does seem like we lose editors (at least in my field) because the first 4 or 5 books they look at are such rubbish and they decided the project is a non-starter.  I do believe there is harm in leaving error filled non-sense around.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:19, 6 May 2010 (UTC)

I only noticed the top replies after replying to your last. (In the future, regarding this long discussion and at least in replies to me, I would appreciate you indicate that it was a multi part reply in the last comment to the same person on a thread.)
::Regarding the RfD and a merge in general, probably some clear lines can be established, a RfD supersedes any failed attempt to compromise on a merge (the discussion should be continued on the newly created RfD) but an RfD shouldn't be used to abort an ongoing request for merge, the merge can easily be closed and substituted for a more global discussion. 
::I don't agree with your interpretation of the deletion policy and it provides guidelines to initiate an RfD, the case being that this RfD is about deleting valid but seemingly redundant content (even the proposer didn't commit to how redundant it is and did not make that the primary point of the RfD), in fact it goes against the written guidelines. I've taken a quick look and I can't define it as a stub or meaningful content. Considering past conversation I understand that it was the result of a translation effort that is stale for some time.
::As for the FORK and OWNERSHIP proposal people should take the proposals with a grain of salt (none were voted upon) and not literally take them as proto-policies to validate actions (the situation is different to a non objected alteration to an approved text). The fork policy as it is is more or less what we do in the project but the ownership is in worst state (I invite you in examining the edit history and the talk pages, and will gladly engage in attempting to improve it), it deals with owning the copyright over the contributed material, not control of the works. There are several misdirections in there like &quot;No Wikibookian may prevent other users from editing or modifying content&quot; most of us  do it day in and day out it all depends on context and intention, this subject on control and right to edit is best covered in the BeBold policy and was discussed there.  
::For a solution to the books on mathematics start merging stale books as soon as you can, and propose for deletion duplicating stubs (just to avoid situations like this RfD), you can also provide some order on the subject page see [[Subject:C++ programming language]].

:: As Duplode said, I have agreed to the deletion in the hope that his proposal is translated in productivity on the remaining work, especially as a way to encourage him to participate in that. Regarding your post I do disagree with two items, I don't think at Wikibooks we can and aim to &quot;complete&quot; books in the sense of conclusion. The aim is to at least bring them to an usable state and build on that ad infinitum. The distinction is important because we should place more value on the process that on the goal. That means that the goal shouldn't be used to justify the means to reach it, since there is no guarantee that it will be reached at all. This because as we are all volunteers, there is no compromise or force that ensures the effort will be made. This also relates to the idea that diffused contributions hinders participation. I strongly disagree with this reasoning, and this was one of the factors that prompted me to be contrary to what was being stated on the proposal (and is also present in your above post), but I already have expressed my thought on that before so I will spare you the repetition.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:29, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

The {{HTML:element|script}} element will work in most browsers, because JavaScript is currently the default scripting language. It is strongly recommended though to specify what type of script you are using in case the default scripting language changes.

The scripting language can be specified individually in the {{HTML:element|script}} element itself, and you may also use a meta tag in the head of the document to specify a default scripting language for the entire page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Script-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/javascript&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

While the &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt; was formally obsoleted in April 2006 by [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt RFC 4329] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt RFC 4329]: Scripting Media Types&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of &lt;code&gt;application/javascript&lt;/code&gt;, it is still preferable to continue using &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt; due to HTML validators' and Internet Explorer web browsers' inability to understand &lt;code&gt;application/javascript&lt;/code&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=338278 &quot;application/javascript&quot; and &quot;application/ecmasscript&quot; media types not recognized.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; element may appear almost anywhere within the HTML file.

A standard location is within the {{HTML:element|head}} element. Placement within the {{HTML:element|body}} however is allowed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Web page title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML code here --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are however some best practices for speeding up your web site &lt;ref&gt;Yahoo: [http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html best practices for speeding up your web site]&lt;/ref&gt; from the Yahoo! Developer Network that specify a different placement for scripts, to [http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom put scripts at the bottom], just before the &lt;code&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. This speeds up downloading, and also allows for direct manipulation of the DOM while the page is loading.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

At the end of the last chapter, you were (hopefully) wondering what the below code fragment means.  This chapter is about how to tell the browser, using HTML, that it needs to start thinking in JavaScript.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    alert('Hello, world! You just lost The Game.');
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== The {{HTML:element|script}} element ==
All JavaScript, when placed in an HTML document, needs to be within a {{HTML:element|script}} element. A {{HTML:element|script}} element is used to link to an external JavaScript file, or to contain inline scripting (script snippets in the HTML file). A {{HTML:element|script}} element to link to an external JavaScript file looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

while a {{HTML:element|script}} element that contains inline JavaScript looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    // JavaScript code here
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Inline scripting has the advantage that both your HTML and your JavaScript is in one file, which is convenient for quick development and testing. Having your JavaScript in a separate file is recommended for JavaScript functions which can potentially be used in more than one page, and also to separate content from behaviour.

For those wondering, yes you can move the {{HTML:element|script}} tag to [[JavaScript/Other Places|other sections]] of your HTML deocument; however, placing it in the {{HTML:element|head}} is sufficient for almost all cases.  A much less useful nugget is that you can tell the browser to use a [[JavaScript/Other Script Types|different scripting language]].

== Inline JavaScript ==
Using inline JavaScript allows you to easily work with HTML and JavaScript within the same page. This is commonly used for temporarily testing out some ideas, and in situations where the script code is specific to that one page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    // JavaScript code here
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Inline HTML comment markers ===
The inline HTML comments are to prevent older browsers that do not understand JavaScript from displaying it in plain text.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    // &lt;!--
    // JavaScript code here
    // --&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; is a comment delimiter, which prevents the end comment tag &lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; from being interpreted as JavaScript.

The usage of comment markers is rarely required nowdays, as the browsers that do not recognise JavaScript are virtually non-existent. These early browsers were Mosaic, Netscape 1 and Internet Explorer 2. From Netscape 2.0 in December 1995 and Internet Explorer 3.0 in August 1996 on, browsers were able to interprete JavaScript.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:JavaScript#History and naming]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inline XHTML JavaScript ===
In XHTML, the method is somewhat different:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    // &lt;![CDATA[
    // JavaScript code here
    // ]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that both the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[&lt;/code&gt; tags are commented out. This prevents the browser from mistakenly interpreting strings with XHTML tags as if they were actual XHTML tags.

== Linking to external scripts ==
JavaScript is commonly stored in a file so that it may be used by many web pages on your site. This makes it much easier for updates to occur and saves space on your server. This method is recommended for [http://alistapart.com/articles/behavioralseparation separating behavior] (JavaScript) from content ((X)HTML) and it prevents the issue of incompatibility with inline comments in XHTML and HTML.

Add &lt;code&gt;src=&quot;&lt;var&gt;script.js&lt;/var&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the opening &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag. Replace &lt;var&gt;script.js&lt;/var&gt; with the path to the .js file containing the JavaScript.

Because the server provides the content type when the file is requested, specifying the type is optional when linking to external scripts. It's still advised  to specify the type as text/javascript, in case the server isn't set up correctly, and to prevent HTML validation complaints.
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Calfat node.png|thumb|right|A finished Portuguese Bowline.]]
The French Bowline, also known as the Portuguese Bowline, is similar to the regular [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]] but it has two loops. The two loops are adjustable in size. You can pull rope from one loop into the other, even when the knot is tight.

==Learn about personal cleanliness.==

Did you know that keeping clean is one of the most important ways to stay healthy?
Sometimes, washing up or brushing your teeth may seem like a bother. But brushing your teeth helps fight germs that cause cavities, rotten teeth, and bad breath. And washing up helps protect you from all sorts of germs that can make you sick. So keep clean!

* '''Brush your teeth''' at least twice a day, before you go to bed and when you get up in the morning.
	
* '''Take a bath or shower''' every day. Wash all over with soap. 

* '''Wash your hands''' with soap and water before eating.
 
* '''Keep your fingernails''' and toenails clean and clipped.
 
* '''Wash your hair''' regularly with shampoo.
 
* '''Keep your hair''' combed.

Remember: staying clean will help you look and feel your best!

==Discover three important times for washing your hands.==
[[File:CleanHandsGuardiansOfHealth.jpg|thumb|250px|Proper times to wash your hands]]

Washing your hands is the best way to stop germs from spreading. Think about all of the things that you touched today - from the telephone to the toilet. Maybe you blew your nose in a tissue and then went outside to dig around the dirt. Whatever you did today, you came into contact with germs. It's easy for a germ on your hand to end up in your mouth. Think about how many foods you eat with your hands.

You can't wear rubber gloves all day long, but you can wash your hands so those germs don't get a chance to make you or someone else sick. When germs go down the drain, they can't make anyone sick.

So when are the best times to wash your hands?

*Before eating or touching food (like if you're helping cook or bake, for example)
*After using the bathroom (that includes washing their hands)
*After blowing your nose or coughing
*After touching pets or other animals
*After playing outside
*Before and after visiting a sick relative or friend
*After brushing your teeth

==Practice proper brushing of teeth.==

#Place your toothbrush next to the teeth so that it rests on the gumline (the point where the teeth and the gums meet) , forming a 45 degrees angle against teeth and gums. 
#Move the toothbrush from the gums towards the edge of teeth to move the dental plaque away from the gum line. 
#Move the brush back and forth gently in short (1½ tooth wide) strokes. 
#After brushing, one by one tooth, all the outer teeth surfaces do the same for the inner surfaces.  
#Brush the chewing surfaces of the teeth with horizontal moves. 
#Spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash.
#Wash hands after brushing your teeth. 


'''&lt;big&gt;During toothbrushing give special attention to the area of the gumline where gum disease starts and to the back molars where it is easier for bacteria to hide.&lt;/big&gt;'''


*Brush your tongue, removing the bacteria that cause bad breath will freshen your breath. Use a tongue scraper if you do not feel comfortable cleaning your tongue with your toothbrush. If you have a bad breath problem, brushing the roof of your mouth might also help. 
*When you brush your teeth, you remove most of the plaque-causing bacteria. But some stay behind. These bacteria can set up a colony and begin damaging your teeth within 24 hours--which is why dentists recommend brushing twice a day to consistently interrupt their growth. 
*After finishing brushing your teeth, you can check if you have effectively removed dental plaque by using disclosing tablets. 
*Avoid the use of hard toothbrushes. Do not use too much force while brushing teeth. In both cases you could cause abrasions to the tooth enamel or dentin, that could lead to tooth sensitivity problems. 
*A correct brushing must have a duration of 2 to 3 minutes. 
*After brushing teeth use the dental floss to complete your dental hygiene.

==Discuss regular bathing and how to keep your hair clean.==

===Take a bath daily===
To keep the dirt and odors away (use deordorant daily if you are ready). 

Taking a bath or shower means washing your body with soap and washing your hair with shampoo. How often you take a bath or shower will depend on your activities. If you take part in activities that get you dirty or make you sweaty, then you will need to get clean more often then someone who does not take part in such activities. A good rule to follow is to take at least one bath or shower each day no matter what and then if you get dirty and smelly while playing, you will need to get clean after your activities.


===To keep your hair clean:=== 

*Wash regularly with shampoo (cheap ones are often as good as very expensive ones).   
*Massage your scalp well. This will remove dead skin cells, excess oil and dirt.  
*Rinse well with clear water.  
*Conditioner is helpful if you have longer hair as it makes the hair smoother and easier to comb, but hair doesn't need to have conditioner.  
*Use a wide toothed comb for wet hair as it is easier to pull through.

==How many glasses of water should you drink daily?==

On the average, a person should drink '''eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day'''. That's about 2 quarts. However, the overweight person needs one additional glass for every 25 pounds of excess weight. The amount you drink also should be increased if you exercise briskly or if the weather is hot and dry. Water should preferably be cold - it's absorbed into the system more quickly than warm water. And some evidence suggests that drinking cold water can actually help burn calories. When the body gets the water it needs to function optimally, its fluids are perfectly balanced.

===20 Tips For Getting Your 8 Glasses of Water Daily===

Sometimes drinking our eight glasses of water a day can be a real challenge Here are 20 tips to help you accomplish that feat! It is said by many beauty experts that drinking your water is the cheapest, quickest way to look better! That should motivate us! 

#Make a bet with a co-worker to see who can drink more water in the course of a day. 
#Have a big glass of water at every transitional point of the day: when you first get up, just before leaving the house, when you sit down to work, etc. 
#Make it convenient - keep a big, plastic, insulated water bottle full on your desk and reach for it all day. 
#When you have juice (apple, grape, or orange) fill half the glass with water. 
#When you have a junk-food craving, down a glass of water immediately. You feel full quickly and avoid the calories, and it lets time pass till the craving fades. 
#Have one glass every hour on the hour while at work. When the work day is done your water quota is met. 
#Substitute a cup of hot water with a drop of honey for tea or coffee. 
#While at work, get a 20 ounce cup of ice and keep filling it up from the office water cooler. The key is drinking with a straw - you take bigger gulps and drink much more. 
#Freeze little bits of peeled lemons, limes, and oranges and use them in place of ice cubes - it's refreshing and helps get in a serving or two of fruit. 
#After each trip to the ladies room, guzzle an eight-ounce glass to replenish your system. 
#Don't allow yourself a diet soda until you've had two to four glasses of water. You will find that you won't want the soda anymore or that just half a can is enough. 
#Let ounces of water double grams of fat: When eating something containing 10 grams of fat, I drink 20 ounces of water. 
#Drink two full glasses at each meal, one before and one after. Also, drink one glass before each snack so you don't eat as much. 
#Carry a small refillable water bottle at all times and drink during downtime; while waiting in a bank line, sitting on the train, etc. 
#Use a beautiful gold-rimmed glass and fill it with cold water from the tap. 
#Drink two glasses of water immediately after waking up. 
#Bring a two-liter bottle of water to work and try to drink it all before you leave work. If you don't finish, drink it in traffic on the way home - it's like a race. 
#Always keep a 24-ounce bottle of water handy while watching TV, doing laundry, making dinner, etc. 
#Add drinking two glasses of water to your daily skincare regimen. Drink, cleanse, moisturize, etc., then drink again. 
#Drink your water out of a big Pyrex measuring cup - it's a good way to keep track of how much water you are drinking.

==Is it important to keep your clothing clean?==

Even if you're not heavily into puberty style sweating, clothes can get stained, dirty and generally grubby, so you need to change them often.

Underclothes are right next to your skin and collect dead skin cells, sweat and possibly other unmentionable stains. Overnight bacteria start to work on these stains so your clothes do not smell as nice on the second day of wearing. 

Stay away from cigarette smoke as the smell will get into your clothes and hair.  

If you have to wear a school uniform then take it off as soon as you get home and hang it up to air before you wear it the next day.

Ask your family not to smoke in the house or the car. Besides being unhealthy for them and you, the smoke clings to your clothes and makes them smelly. Of course, you wouldn't smoke either, would you?

Change underclothes often.

=Broad Implications=

As is the case with many elementary physical laws, Hooke's law, stating the linear correlation between load and deformation, spans the small and simple, and the big and complex.  For instance, the theory is a good approximation of simple test specimens subjected to axial loading.  Naturally, it is also an accurate physical model for linear springs.  And it is even valid for very complex structures, so long as they respond linearly.  These are all trivial and perhaps self-evident statements, yet they are powerful and important.   

==Load and Stress==

To expand on this, let's consider an initially stress free quasi-static linear-elastic mechanical system that is subjected to one load &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; which has some fixed direction and point of application.  The global equilibrium of the system is sustained by a pattern of internal stresses in the structure.  The specific shape of the stress pattern is required to achieve equilibrium at each point in the structure.  That is, if the stress magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; at some point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; differed from the equilibrium state &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; by a factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the system would automatically strive to reach the unique pattern of equilibrium.  One could however obtain a new equilibrium state that abides the new condition at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by altering the stress levels in the material surrounding &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by the same factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.  A state of equilibrium is thus reached if

\begin{equation} \sigma_i = k \sigma_{i0} \end{equation}

If the refactoring of the stress magnitudes is propagated throughout the system, including the point at which the load is applied, global equilibrium will be achieved.  Consequently, also the magnitude of the load itself would have to be altered by the factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in this scenario.  Hence we can write

&lt;math&gt; F = k F_0 &lt;/math&gt;     (2)

Equation () and () yields

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_i = \frac{\sigma_{i0} F}{F_0} = k_i F&lt;/math&gt;     (3)

Where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. &lt;br&gt;

Equation () is only true if the normalized stress pattern is unaffected by the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; in the considered interval.  If instead, the system is nonlinear, i.e. responds differently depending on the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt;, equation () is not be true/reliable.

==Load and Strain==

Moreover, Hookes law and equation () gives us

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{xi} = \frac{\sigma_{xi} - \nu (\sigma_{yi} + \sigma_{zi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{xi} - \nu (k_{yi} + k_{zi})}{E} = F k'_{xi} &lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{yi} = \frac{\sigma_{yi} - \nu (\sigma_{xi} + \sigma_{zi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{yi} - \nu (k_{xi} + k_{zi})}{E} = F k'_{yi} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{zi} = \frac{\sigma_{zi} - \nu (\sigma_{xi} + \sigma_{yi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{yi} - \nu (k_{xi} + k_{yi})}{E} = F k'_{zi} &lt;/math&gt;

==Load and Displacement==

Let's consider a path &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; that runs through a continuous linear elastic body.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; has two endpoints &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The relative change &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; in distance in some direction between the two points can be formulated

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F \int_{P_1}^{P_2} \! k(s) \, ds = F k_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement and Strain==

From equation () and () we get

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F k_{12} = \frac{k_{12}}{k'_i} \epsilon_i = k'_{i12} \epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement and Stress==

From equation () and () we get

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F k_{12} = \frac{k_{12}}{k_i} \sigma_i = k_{i12} \sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalization==

Moving on to a more general point of view, we state the following definition 

&lt;math&gt;\psi = C \psi' &lt;/math&gt;     (3) 

Where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi'&lt;/math&gt; are some linearly dependent structural measures at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

From equation (3) and the superposition principle we conclude that

 &lt;math&gt;\psi = c_0 + c_1 \psi'_1 + c_2 \psi'_2 +...+ c_{n-1} \psi'_{n-1} + c_n \psi'_n&lt;/math&gt;     (4) 

The independent parameters of (4) can be obtained by performing &lt;math&gt;&gt;=n&lt;/math&gt; tests/calculations.  It follows that it is easy to, for instance, scale linear test results according to different safety factors.

It is important to know whether or not the structure is linear before drawing any critical conclusions from the theory of elasticity.  Common sources of non-linear behavior in a structure are material, geometric, contact and dynamic effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Additional Aspects=

The simplistic view on elasticity presented in this section is useful in many ways. It should be noted however, that it is incomplete. The chapter &lt;i&gt;Continuum Mechanics&lt;/i&gt; presents a theory of how 2D and 3D stress and strain fields interact.  Moreover, the material property &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, may be influenced by several factors, including: temperature, aging and rate of deformation. Therefore, keep in mind that there is more to come on this subject later on in the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to limit search results based on one or more dates within items.

== Method ==
We will create a XForms application that will have two calendar selectors.  We can use the built-in calendar selector or allow users to select the year, month, day values separately.

== Month Code Table ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;code-table&gt;
    &lt;code-table-name&gt;date-month-code&lt;/code-table-name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;A list of all the month codes for doing searchs.&lt;/description&gt;

==Topic 8: Option - Statistics and Probability==
As learnt in the statistics and probability section in the core syllabus, the expected value &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, or the mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; of a distribution &quot;X&quot; is:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mathrm{E}(X) = \begin{cases} \sum xP(x),  &amp; \mbox{for discrete } X \\ \int xf(x)dx,  &amp; \mbox{for continuous } X \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variance of a distribution is defined as:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}(X) &amp;= \mathrm{E}((X-\mu)^2)\\
 &amp;= \mathrm{E}(X^2) - (\mathrm{E}(X))^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If ''X'' is discrete, the variance can be defined as:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}(X) &amp;= \mathrm{E}((X-\mu)^2)\\
 &amp;= \sum(x-\mu)^2P(x) \\
 &amp;= \sum x^2P(x) - \sum\mu^2 P(x) \\
 &amp;= \sum x^2P(x) - \mu^2 &amp; \left \{\sum P(x) \mbox{ is } 1 \mbox{ and } \mu \mbox{ is a constant}\right \}\\
\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}(X) &amp;= \mathrm{E}(X^2) - (\mathrm{E}(X))^2 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Expectation Algebra===
====Linear Transformations====
If one displaces and scales a distribution, the mean and the variance must change. The values change in accordance to the following formulas:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(aX+b)=a\mathrm{E}(X)+b&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(aX+b)=a^2\mathrm{Var}(X)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Notice how the variance is unaffected by the value of ''b'', since the variance of a distribution is never changed by the displacement of the distribution. Only the value ''a'', representing a horizontal stretch of the distribution, modifies the spread.
====Linear Combinations of Independent Random Variables====
When one takes multiple samples of a random variable ''X'', these are often independent random variables. In that case the distribution must be treated differently.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(a_1X_1\pm a_2X_2)=a_1\mathrm{E}(X_1)\pm a_2\mathrm{E}(X_2)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(a_1X_1\pm a_2X_2)=a_1^2\mathrm{Var}(X_1)+a_2^2\mathrm{Var}(X_2)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Notice that the variance is always superimposed, not subtracted. Also the random variable may not necessarily be from the same population ''X''.

These rules also apply to situations with ''n'' independent random variables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(a_1X_1\pm a_2X_2\pm...\pm a_nX_n)=a_1\mathrm{E}(X_1)\pm a_2\mathrm{E}(X_2)\pm...\pm a_n\mathrm{E}(X_n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(a_1X_1\pm a_2X_2\pm...\pm a_nX_n)=a_1^2\mathrm{Var}(X_1)+a_2^2\mathrm{Var}(X_2)+...+a_n^2\mathrm{Var}(X_n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The derivation of this rule is beyond the scope of the syllabus.
====Unbiased estimators of mean and variance====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{E}(\overline{X})&amp; = \mathrm{E}(\tfrac{X_1+X_2+...+X_n}{n})&amp; \\
 &amp; = \tfrac{\mathrm{E}(X_1+X_2+...+X_n)}{n}&amp;\{\mbox{Assuming independence}\}\\
 &amp; = \tfrac{\mathrm{E}(nX)}{n}&amp;\{n\mbox{ of them }\}\\
 &amp; = \tfrac{n\mu}{n}\\
\mathrm{E}(\overline{X}) &amp; = \mu &amp; \therefore \overline{x} \mbox{ or } \mathrm{E}(\overline{X}) \mbox{ is the unbiased estimate of } \mu
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Unbiased Estimators of Variance''' are calculated by multiplying the original variance by n/(n-1)&lt;/big&gt;

===Probability Distribution Functions===
====Discrete Distributions====

'''Binomial, B(''n,p'')'''&lt;br&gt;
When X~B(n,p), P(X=x) denotes the probability of ''x'' number of successes when ''n'' trials, each with a probability of success of ''p'', are performed. &lt;br&gt;Applies when:
* There are exactly two possible outcomes
* The number of trials is fixed
* Each trial is independent of the outcomes of other trials
* The probability of each trial remains constant. 

'''Negative Binomial, NB(''r,p'')'''&lt;br&gt;
Models the number of Bernoulli trials B(1,''p'') required to achieve ''r'' successes. The combinatorial coefficient in the probability mass function is merely to account for the number of ways such a number of successes could be arranged. 
&lt;br&gt;

'''Geometric, Geo(''p'')'''&lt;br&gt;
Models the number of Bernoulli trials B(1,''p'') which will be needed until the ''first'' success, ie similar to NB(1,''p''). No combinatorial coefficient is needed because &quot;counting&quot; stops once the first success has been achieved. Hence there is only one possible arrangement for outcomes. 
&lt;br&gt;

'''Poisson, P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'') &lt;br&gt;
A Poisson distribution measures the number of successes in 
* a fixed interval
* an infinite number of trials. 
For instance, there could potentially be a huge number of phonecalls per hour, but if the mean is two per hour, the chance of this is slim. NB: This assumes that ''m'' is constant, which in real situations is not true (eg frequency of phonecalls depends on time of day, day of week, etc).
Questions of this type often involve converting between time intervals, for instance if the mean is two calls per hour and the probability of a certain number of calls in 5 hours is needed, the mean used would be 10. 
Also specific to this distribution is the fact that E(x) = Var(x).

====Continuous Distributions====
These can follow any function where: 
* &lt;math&gt; {f(x)}\geq{0}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;{x}\in&lt;/math&gt; range of f(x).
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{b}^{a}f(x)\, dx = 1&lt;/math&gt; if the domain of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a \leq x \leq b&lt;/math&gt;.
Furthermore, ''x'' can be any value &lt;math&gt;-\infty \leq x \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt; that is also within the domain of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Cumulative frequencies are calculated by integrating &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, the syllabus expects knowledge regarding three particular continuous probability distributions.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Exponential, Exp(λ)'''&lt;br&gt;
This distribution models the expected interval between events (assumed to be instantaneous) in a Poisson distribution. Eg for P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(2) calls an hour, the expected number of calls in one hour is 2; the expected value of the exponential distribution, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is half an hour. &lt;br&gt;
The exponential distribution can also be seen as the continuous equivalent of the geometric distribution, which models the time until the first success. 
&lt;br&gt;

'''Normal, N(μ,σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'''&lt;br&gt;
This is the most interesting distribution, and the most relevant to the statistics option. Due to the central limit theorem, a large portion of the Statistics option is based on the normal distribution. On questions about the normal distribution, the question must state that the data at hand “follows a normal distribution”, “is normally distributed”, etc. This makes it easy to identify. &lt;br&gt;
The standard normal variable ''Z'' follows the distribution and is a way of converting to ''Z''-scores, which is important for calculating confidence interval and hypothesis testing.

'''Normal approximation to the binomial distribution'''&lt;br&gt;
For large values of ''n'', X~B(''n,p'') can be approximated as X~N(''np,npq''). (This can be shown on a histogram.)&lt;br&gt;
There are different estimates for how large ''n'' should be; greater than 5 is usually a good approximation, yet the IB states &lt;math&gt;(np) \geq 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(nq) \geq 10&lt;/math&gt; as rules. In situations which do not satisfy these conditions it should be clearly stated that the approximation is not good.

====Summary of Distributions====
The summary of equations, functions and notations are shown below for each distribution.

===Normal Distribution===
====Linear Combinations====

It is often useful to combine variables, eg to determine the probability that &lt;math&gt;X &gt; Y&lt;/math&gt;. This is done by solving an inequality and basing a new variable, for instance &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; on the random variable size. For instance: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}(X &gt; Y)\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= \mathrm{P}(X-Y &gt; 0).\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{let }U = X-Y\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We now need to find &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; using the rules:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(X \pm Y) = \mathrm{E}(X) \pm \mathrm{E}(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(X \pm Y) = \mathrm{Var}(X) + \mathrm{Var}(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the variance is always added. It is also important to convert standard deviation to variance before attempting to combine variables. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Questions also discuss combinations where multiple picks are made. Note the difference between
* &lt;math&gt;U = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4\!&lt;/math&gt; and 
* &lt;math&gt;U = 4X\!&lt;/math&gt;.
In the first, four separate picks are made. Variance becomes &lt;math&gt;4\mathrm{Var}(X)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
In the second, the value of one pick is multiplied by four. Variance in this case is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(4X) = 16\mathrm{Var}(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
In short, separate picks should be treated as separate variables, despite having the same μ and σ.

====Central limit theorem====

When taking samples from a ''non-normal'' population &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; whose mean is ''μ'' variance is ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the averages of these samples will be distributed ''normally'' as &lt;math&gt;\bar X \sim N(\mu, \tfrac{\sigma^2}{n})&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' is the number of data points each sample is based on (sample size). This applies when &lt;math&gt;n \geq 30&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

The samples must be independent. Although a proof of the CLT is not required, it may be useful to know that it stems from a binomial distribution: either &lt;math&gt;\bar x &lt; \mu&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\bar x \geq \mu&lt;/math&gt;. The probability is constant and independent, meaning that the sample means are described by a binomial function. We already know by the normal approximation to the binomial distribution that when the sample size is large enough, the distribution will be approximately normal. &lt;br&gt;

This is a reliable approximation for sample sizes &lt;math&gt;n \geq 30&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the variance, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sigma^2}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, of the normal distribution decreases with larger values of ''n'', meaning that the probability distribution will be narrower, ie more [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision precise]. The &quot;standard deviation&quot; of the normal distribution when using the CLT, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, is also known as the ''sampling error'' or ''standard error''.

====Normality of a proportion====

Proportions with large sample sizes also follow a normal distribution. Following a similar logic as for sample means, a proportion of a sample can either be a success or failure. The probability of this is considered fixed, meaning that the distribution is binomial. When the sample size is large enough, there is therefore a normal distribution where &lt;math&gt; \mu = \widehat{p} &lt;/math&gt;, the sample proportion:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\widehat{p} = \frac{X}{n}, ~~~ \text{ where }
\begin{cases} 
  \widehat{p} = \text{ sample proportion} \\
  X = \text{ number of successes} \\
  n = \text{ sample size.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If ''p'' is the true proportion of successes and ''n'' is the sample size then ''X''~B(''n,p''). Hence we can show that
* Expected value &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(\widehat{p}) = \mathrm{E}(\tfrac{1}{n}X) = \tfrac{1}{n}\mathrm{E}(X) = \tfrac{1}{n} \times np = p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Variance &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(\widehat{p}) = \mathrm{Var}(\tfrac{1}{n}X) = \tfrac{1}{n^2}\mathrm{Var}(X) = \tfrac{npq}{n^2} = \tfrac{pq}{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By the Central Limit Theorem, we can say that for large values of ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\widehat{p} \sim \mathrm{N}(p,\tfrac{pq}{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

===Confidence Intervals===
[[File:Confidence_Interval_90P.png|thumb|right|90% confidence interval. 90% of data within 0±a.]]
A confidence interval is a range measured from the mean of a distribution in which a certain fraction of samples lie. It is often represented as a percentage, for instance saying that &quot;90% of samples weigh 2±0.01 kg&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
Confidence intervals work the same way for sample means and for proportions. In each case let &lt;math&gt;\mu = \bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu = \widehat{p}&lt;/math&gt;. The difference arises when the population variance is not know. These two situations are explored below.

====When σ is known====
The data booklet gives the expression for a confidence interval as: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \bar{x} \pm z \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;   (given ''n'' &amp;ge; 30). &lt;br&gt; 
This same expression is merely written in terms of the standard distribution for a sample: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \widehat{p} \pm z \times \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}\widehat{q}}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; (when ''np'' &amp;ge; 10 or ''nq'' &amp;ge; 10).

&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the ''z''-score corresponding to the percentage of the confidence interval. This can be looked up using the tables which occupy the last few pages of the data booklet of using the invNorm function on the calculator. Note, however, that entering invNorm(.9) will ''not'' give the ''Z''-score of a 90% confidence interval. The remaining 10% must be distributed evenly both above and below the target range that is within 90% of the mean. Therefore ''z'' = invNorm(0.95). This can be clearly seen in the illustration above - we want to find the value of ''a'', and should therefore use either 0.95 or 0.05. This is the same concept as a two-tailed test (described below) - if we were saying that 90% of the values were ''below'' a certain value, then we would use invNorm(0.9).&lt;br&gt;

'''Calculator functions'''&lt;br&gt;
''ZInterval'': Either enter a set of data or statistics. Not that in both cases, σ is clearly requested. C(onfidence)-Level as a fraction. When using data, select the list name at set Frequency=1. &lt;br&gt;
''1-PropZInt'': ''x'' is the number of successes in ''n'' trials. C(onfidence)-Level as a fraction.&lt;br&gt;

====When σ is unknown====
When the population standard distribution, σ, is unknown, we must approximate it using the sample data. &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}^2&lt;/math&gt; is used to represent σ. Note that the sample standard deviation &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; may be known without the population standard deviation being known. When σ was known, we said that&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = Z&lt;/math&gt;, the standard normal distribution N(0,1). Likewise, the distribution when σ is not known is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\tfrac{S_{n-1}}{\sqrt{n}}} = t&lt;/math&gt;, known as the t-distribution. It is simply a &quot;fatter&quot; version of the standard normal curve N(0,1). &lt;br&gt;

When using a t-distribution, state the degrees of freedom: '''ν = ''n''-1''' where, as usual, ''n'' is the sample size. (This gains significance in hypothesis testing.)&lt;br&gt;


'''Calculator function'''&lt;br&gt;
''TInterval'': Data or statistics. When using data, same input method as ZInterval is used. Note that &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and has to be calculated manually from the sample standard deviation &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;S^2_{n-1} = \tfrac{n}{n-1}S^2_n&lt;/math&gt; (from data booklet).

====Determining appropriate samples sizes====
In order for an estimate to be correct, the size of samples must be high enough. As ''n'' increases, the variance falls, increasing the precision (distribution narrows). &lt;br&gt;
The example below is taken from Haese &amp; Harris' ''IBDP Mathematics (Options)'':&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;How large should a sample be if we wish to be 98% confident that the sample mean will differ from the population mean by less than 0.3 if we know that population standard deviation σ = 1.365?&quot;&lt;br&gt;

This means that &lt;math&gt;-0.3 &lt; \mu - \bar{x} &lt; 0.3&lt;/math&gt; [where &lt;math&gt; \bar{x} &lt;/math&gt; is the furthest acceptable point from μ.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

From the data booklet formula&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \mu = \bar{x} \pm z \times \tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we know that:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{x} - z \times \tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} &lt; \mu &lt;  \bar{x} + z \times \tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and invNorm(0.99) [''not'' 0.98!] is 2.326:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-2.326\tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} &lt; \mu - \bar{x} &lt; 2.326\tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore 2.326\tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 0.3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n} = \tfrac{2.326\sigma}{0.3} = \tfrac{2.326 \times 1.365}{0.3} \approx 10.583&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n \approx 112&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So a sample of 112 should be taken to be 98% sure that sample means will differ from the population mean by less than 0.3 (''n'' was rounded up to 112).&lt;br&gt;

Note that for '''proportions''', &lt;math&gt;\widehat{p}&lt;/math&gt; might not always be known. In such a case the largest possible error should be used, ie &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \pm z \sqrt{\tfrac{\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )}{n}} \to \pm z \tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As above, this is set equal to the maximum acceptable range, eg 0.03 if the proportion must be &quot;within 3%&quot;.

===Significance/Hypothesis Testing===
The aim of hypothesis testing is to consider the validity of hypotheses at particular levels of significance and come to a conclusion regarding their accuracy. The idea is to 
* Formulate a hypothesis 
* Collect sample data 
* Determine whether the data supports the hypothesis
A level of significance is much like the confidence level of significance testing. For example, a 90% confidence interval contains 90% of the spread, while a 10% level of significance says that a hypothesis is true or false with a chance of 90% (10% chance of error).

====Null and alternative hypothesis====
In any hypothesis test, there will be ''two'' mutually exclusive hypotheses:
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, the null hypothesis, which states ''equality''. This is assumed true until proven false. 
* &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;, the alternative hypothesis, which is adopted if &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; has been proven false by random sample data. 

For example, testing that the mean number of phone-calls per hour is greater than 6:&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;H_0 : \mu = 6&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;H_1 : \mu &gt; 6&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative hypothesis can either be one-sided, as above, or two sided. If we wanted to prove that the mean number of phone-calls is ''not'' 6, we would say that &lt;math&gt;H_0: \mu \neq 6&lt;/math&gt;. This would imply either that &lt;math&gt;\mu &gt; 6&lt;/math&gt; '''or''' that &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt; 6&lt;/math&gt;. This creates a slight difference in how the probability is calculated (see the invNorm() argument in Confidence Intervals) but this is largely handled by the calculator.&lt;br&gt;

====Significance Testing for Mean and Proportion====
To perform a test, data must be collected, giving a value for &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''z''- or ''t''-score (&lt;math&gt;z*\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t*\!&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated, depending on whether population σ is known, using 
* &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\tfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}&lt;/math&gt; or 
* &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\tfrac{S_{n-1}}{\sqrt{n}}}&lt;/math&gt; (remembering to state &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom).
When using proportions:
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \widehat{p} = \tfrac{x}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_{\widehat{p}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{pq}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
All the CLT requirements need to be met for each respective method: &lt;math&gt;n \geq 30&lt;/math&gt; for sample means and &lt;math&gt;np \geq 10&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;nq \geq 10&lt;/math&gt; for proportions. 

The next step is to determine the ''' ''p''-value ''', the probability of the ''z''- or ''t''-score occurring. For ''z''-scores this can be done with normalcdf(), but for ''t''-scores the whole process must be done on the calculator (explained below). The ''p''-value  measures the likelihood of &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; occurring with a mean of μ and standard deviation σ. If the ''p''-value is low, there is a high possibility that either the sample is wrong (sample size could be increased to verify this) or the mean is not μ (reject null hypothesis). The cut-off for which the ''p''-value is considered &quot;too&quot; low is determined by the level of significance: given a 0.05 (5%) level of significance, &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; will be rejected if the ''p''-value is below 0.05. 

For two-tailed tests (&lt;math&gt;\neq&lt;/math&gt;), the ''p''-value is the probability &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}(t \geq t*) + \mathrm{P}(t \leq -t*)&lt;/math&gt; whereas for a single-tailed test (&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;) it is simply &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}(t \geq t*)&lt;/math&gt; or the equivalent in terms of &lt;math&gt;z\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z*\!&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Steps to hypothesis testing''' 
# State &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and whether the test is one- or two-tailed. 
# State whether ''z''- or ''t''-distribution, calculate corresponding test statistic &lt;math&gt;z*\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t*\!&lt;/math&gt;.
# State decision rule (reject &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; if ''p''-value is...). Calculate ''p''-value for test statistic. 
# Make decision: &quot;Reject &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;&quot; or &quot;Accept &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;. 
# Brief statement putting the decision into context. 

The &quot;brief&quot; statement will involve as much of the information from as possible. For example, &quot;Based on the a sample of 200 cookies, insufficient evidence is provided to accept at the 1% level of significance that more than 60% of cookies contain chocolate&quot;. &lt;br&gt;

There is also a slightly different way of determining whether the calculated ''z''-score is acceptable. Instead of converting the ''z''-score into a probability which is then compared to the ''p''-value, calculate the ''critical value'' ''z''-score based on the level of significance. Then use logic to determine whether the calculated ''z''-score falls within the rejection region. 
For instance, when testing at a 5% level of significance, a &quot;&lt;&quot; one-tailed test&lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; can be rejected if &lt;math&gt;z*\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt; invNorm(0.05). For a &quot;&gt;&quot; one-tailed test, reject if &gt; invNorm(0.95) and for a two-sided test reject if &lt;math&gt;\left\vert z* \right\vert \geq &lt;/math&gt; invNorm(0.975).&lt;br&gt;

'''Calculators (TI)'''&lt;br&gt;
Calculator functions are quite straightforward to use. In general:
* &lt;math&gt;\mu_0:&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu:&lt;/math&gt; combine to form the alternative hypothesis. For example, if &lt;math&gt;H_0: \mu &lt; 6 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = 6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt; \mu_0&lt;/math&gt;. The same applies to &quot;&lt;math&gt;\text{prop}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; in the 1-PropZTest. 
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of successes
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of trials
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the population standard deviation (''z''-tests) and &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;S_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the unbiased estimate of population variance. 
Sorting out which variables are known will provide the right function in the case that it isn't clear to start with.

====Type I and II errors====
* Falsely rejecting &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Type I error'''. Chance of this occurring is equal to the level of significance at which the test is performed. 
* Falsely accepting &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Type II error'''. Chances of making a Type II error increase with stricter levels of significance as the critical region shrinks. Calculating the probability of a Type II error occurring requires an alternative value, ie the &quot;true&quot; mean. Type II error is the chance of accepting that the mean is ''a'' when it is in fact ''b'', meaning that the probability of Type II error occurring depends on ''b''. Therefore Type II is the chance of getting the recorded sample mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; when the true mean is ''b'' - this can be calculated using normalpdf.

===Chi-Squared Distribution===
This distribution can be used to test whether a data set follows a particular distribution by comparing expected values to observed data. It can likewise be used to hypothesise whether two variables are dependent. &lt;br&gt;

The chi-squared (χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) distribution is dependent on the degrees of freedom. The higher the degree of freedom, the closer to the normal curve it becomes. 

Note that all χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tests are one-tailed. So don't go dividing the ''p''-value in two or any of that funny stuff. 

====Goodness of fit====
For GOF tests, &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; states that the data ''follows'' a distribution while &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; states that it ''does not'' follow the distribution. For example:
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;: The data is from a uniform distribution
* &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;: The data is not from a uniform distribution.

Degrees of freedom '''ν = number of classes (''n'') - number of restrictions (''k'')'''. When there do not appear to be any restrictions (most cases), ''k'' 1 due to the fact that there are a finite number of classes. Once the values of all but one have been found, the last class is unable to fluctuate. This means that in general for GOF-tests ν = ''n'' - 1. &lt;br&gt;

To calculate the probability that a data set follows a particular distribution, enter the observed and expected values into separate lists. If any of the ''expected'' frequencies are below five, combine this group with a neighbouring group. This is to avoid dividing by small numbers when calculating the test statistic, which would produce disproportionately large values. Because the number of classes falls when this done, decrease the degrees of freedom accordingly. Additionally, subtract 1 from ν for each statistic (&lt;math&gt;m, \bar{x}, p, \mu, \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;) which is used to calculate expected data but which is itself based on the observed data. 

Then perform a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;GOF-Test using that data. As with hypothesis testing, the ''p''-value shows how likely it is to get a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-score greater than the one achieved with this data set, so if it is smaller than the level of confidence &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; should be rejected and it can be concluded that the data does not follow the distribution at this particular level. 

====Contingency tables====
When testing for the independence of variables, a two-variable contingency table is used. This lists the combinations of frequencies of the two variables. For instance: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
  |+ Contingency table relating smoking to hypertension
|-
  |   
  ! colspan=&quot;4&quot;| Amount of smoking
|-
  ! Degree of hypertension
  | ''None''
  | ''Moderate''
  | ''Heavy''
  | ''Total''
|-
  | ''Severe''
  | 10
  | 14
  | 20
  | 44
|-
  | ''Mild''
  | 20 
  | 18
  | 31
  | 69
|-
  | ''None''
  | 40
  | 22
  | 25
  | 87
|-
  | ''Total''
  | 70
  | 54
  | 76
  | 200
|}

When entering the data into the calculator the &quot;total&quot; column and row are omitted. Expected values do not have to be calculated manually (this would be done by multiplying row total by column total and dividing by &quot;total total&quot;, eg 70×44/200 = 15.4, the first cell in the expected value table). Instead, a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test is performed and the expected values will be inserted into the &quot;Expected&quot; matrix. &lt;br&gt;
Degrees of freedom in a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test are '''(rows-1)(columns-1)'''. &lt;br&gt;
When there is a two by two contingency table, ν = 1. Normally one would use Yate's continuity correction, however this has been removed from the syllabus. Therefore just proceed as normal with ν = 1.

For independence test:
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;: Variables are ''in''dependent. 
* &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;: Variables are dependent.

As always, the ''p''-value is the probability of a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-value larger than that observed occurring. &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is therefore rejected if the level of significance is lower than the ''p''-value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When dealing with teen pregnancy, remember - your opinion about what should be done with the baby will shape your story.  Whatever option your character chooses must be something you feel comfortable writing about, even if it is not the choice you would have made.  For instance, if you do not feel right about writing about someone who has an abortion, don't have your character have an abortion.

Should your teen character decide to place the baby for adoption, the Web site [http://www.adoptiononline.com Adoption Online] has examples of letters from those seeking to adopt.  These letters can be used as examples of what possible adoptive families will say about their homes, families, and why they want to adopt.  Also look in your local library under the Dewey Decimal number 362.734, but choose those books that do not emphasize international adoption - books that emphasize international adoption do not tend to have anything about placing a baby for adoption.

Should she decide to have an abortion, books on this subject include ''Abortion'' by Carl N. Flanders (1990), and ''Abortion'' by Allison Lassieur (2001).

Should your character decide to keep the baby, examples of teen parents who have kept their babies can be found in the books ''Teen Fathers'' (1998) and ''Teen Mothers'' (1996), both by Gail B. Stewart and both part of the Other America series.  Other books that might be helpful are ''Teen Parenting'' by Gail B. Stewart (2000), which is part of the Teen Issues series, and ''Teen Mothers: Raising a Baby'' (2000) and ''Teen Fathers: Getting Involved'' (2000), both by Julie Endersbe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[File:Brown-recluse-2-edit.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A brown recluse spider.]]
The brown recluse spider abdomen is uniformly colored a dark violet and is bulbous.  The spider has dark brown skin and is covered with numerous fine hairs. It has long thin brown legs with a span the size of a quarter and a body that is 10mm long and 5mm wide. Most spiders have eight eyes but the brown recluse has six eyes arranged in pairs.

==Where does it live?==
The brown recluse is most common in the southeast corner of North America most recluse live in 500 feet above sea level mainly in the central midwestern states southwards to the gulf of Mexico and occasionally as far north as Ohio. They don't live on the east coast, or anywhere west of the Rocky Mountains. They make an untidy web that includes a shelter that they stay in during the day. At night they come out to hunt. They make their webs under rotting tree bark in woodpiles, and in places that are undisturbed, like garages and cellars. They seem to like cardboard, perhaps because it is similar to tree bark.

==What does it eat?==
Brown recluse spiders are hunters. They trap some insects in their webs, but most of their prey is caught during their nightly hunts. They prefer to eat cockroaches, firebrats, crickets and other crawling bugs. It even will attack dangerous bugs, such as ants and other spiders. It lunges at its prey and bites it, injecting venom. It then retreats and waits for the poison to work. When the prey is paralyzed and unable to defend itself, the spider comes back and eats it. The brown recluse also scavenges dead insects. When prey are scarce the spider can survive for a long period of time provided it can find somewhere cool, but not cold. In the right conditions the brown recluse could last six months without food!

==What stages does it go through to mature?==
The spiderlings stay with their mother while they are young. She feeds them, and they also eat the eggs of any of their brothers and sisters that didn't hatch in time. As they grow they have to shed their skins and grow new larger ones. After growing their 4th skin, the spiderlings are big enough to live on their own, and move away to make their own webs. 

==What is special about the brown recluse?==
The brown recluse has a powerful venom that can cause damage to humans. People sometimes get bitten when the spider feels threatened and can't escape. People are sometimes bitten in bed, if they roll over onto the spider. The actual bite doesn't hurt much at first, and people often don't go to the doctor straight away. After about 2 to 6 hours the bite may become very painful with blisters and what looks like bruising. The bruising gets worse, with the skin becoming purple around the bite, and eventually turning black as the skin cells die. Eventually the black skin falls off, leaving a large scar. Not every bite is as bad as this, and some bites have no venom at all, and some people think that they have been bitten by a spider when in fact they have a skin disease, or a bite from another type of bug.

==Trees==

Let's look at one of the most important data structures: trees. A tree is an example of a recursive datatype. While there are several different kinds of trees, the essential features of a tree that will concern us are in the following definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, it's parameterized; i.e. we can have trees of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;s, trees of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s, trees of &lt;code&gt;Maybe Int&lt;/code&gt;s, even trees of &lt;code&gt;(Int, String)&lt;/code&gt; pairs… What makes this data type special is that &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; appears in the definition of itself.

===Lists as Trees===

As we have seen in [[Haskell/More about lists|More about lists]] and [[Haskell/List_Processing|List Processing]], we break lists down into two cases: An empty list (denoted by &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;), and an element of the specified type, with another list (denoted by &lt;tt&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/tt&gt;). This gives us valuable insight about the definition of lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data [a] = [] | (a:[a]) -- Pseudo-Haskell, will not work properly (because lists are more ingrained in the language).
&lt;/source&gt;

This is sometimes written as (for Lisp-inclined people):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;

Like Tree, lists are also recursive. Here, the constructor functions are &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;. They correspond to what we called &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Branch&lt;/code&gt; in the Tree definition. So, we can use &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Branch&lt;/code&gt; in pattern matching just as we did with the empty list and the &lt;code&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Maps and Folds===

We already know about maps and folds for lists. Now, we can write map and fold functions for our new &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; type. To recap:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show)
data [a]    = []     | (:)    a [a]
  -- (:) a [a] is the same as (a:[a]) with prefix instead of infix notation.
&lt;/source&gt;

{{body note|Deriving is explained later on in the section [[Haskell/Classes and types|Class Declarations]]. For now, understand it as telling Haskell (and by extension your interpreter) how to display a Tree instance.}}

====Map====

Let's take a look at the definition of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; for lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

If we were to write &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt;, what would its type be? Defining the function is easier if you have an idea of what its type should be.

We want &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt; to work on a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; of some type and return another &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; of some type by applying a function on each element of the tree.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b
&lt;/source&gt;

This is just like the list example.

Now, when talking about a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;, each &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; only contains a single value, so all we have to do is apply the given function to that value and then return a &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; with the altered value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b
treeMap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
&lt;/source&gt;

This looks a lot like the empty list case with &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Now, if we have a &lt;code&gt;Branch&lt;/code&gt;, it will include two subtrees; what do we do with those? The list-&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; uses a call to itself on the tail of the list, so we also shall do that with the two subtrees. The complete definition of &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt; is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b
treeMap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
treeMap f (Branch left right) = Branch (treeMap f left) (treeMap f right)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can make this a bit more readable by noting that &lt;code&gt;treeMap f&lt;/code&gt; is itself a function with type {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Tree a -&gt; Tree b&lt;/code&gt;}}. This gives us the following revised definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b
treeMap f = g where
  g (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
  g (Branch left right) = Branch (g left) (g right)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you didn't follow that immediately, try re-reading it. This use of pattern matching may seem weird at first, but it is essential to the use of datatypes. Remember that pattern matching happens on constructor functions.

When you're ready, read on for folds over Trees.

====Fold====

As with map, let's first review the definition of &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; for lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
foldr f acc [] = acc
foldr f acc (x:xs) = f x (foldr f acc xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

Recall that lists have two constructors:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(:) :: a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]  -- takes an element and combines it with the rest of the list
[] :: [a]  -- the empty list takes zero arguments
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments corresponding to the two constructors:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; b  -- a function takes two elements and operates on them to return a single result
acc :: b  -- the accumulator defines what happens with the empty list
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's take a moment to make this clear. If the initial &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; is given an empty list, then the default accumulator is returned. For functions like &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt;, the initial accumulator will be 0. With a non-empty list, the value returned by each fold is used in the next fold. When the list runs out, we are back at the empty list, so foldr returns whatever is ''then'' the accumulator value from the last fold.

Like &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; for lists, we want &lt;code&gt;treeFold&lt;/code&gt; to transform a tree of some type into a value of some other type; so in place of {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;[a] -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;}} we will have {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Tree a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;}}.  How do we specify the transformation?  First note that {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Tree a&lt;/code&gt;}} has two constructors (just like lists have two constructors):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Branch :: Tree a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a
Leaf :: a -&gt; Tree a
&lt;/source&gt;

So &lt;code&gt;treeFold&lt;/code&gt; will have two arguments corresponding to the two constructors:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fbranch :: b -&gt; b -&gt; b
fleaf :: a -&gt; b
&lt;/source&gt;

Putting it all together we get the following type definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeFold :: (b -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; b
&lt;/source&gt;

That is, the first argument, of type {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(b -&gt; b -&gt; b)&lt;/code&gt;}}, is a function specifying how to combine subtrees into a single result; the second argument, of type {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;}}, is a function specifying what to do with leaves (which are the end of recursion, just like empty-list for lists); and the third argument, of type &lt;code&gt;Tree a&lt;/code&gt;, is the whole tree we want to fold.

As with &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt;, we'll avoid repeating the arguments &lt;code&gt;fbranch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fleaf&lt;/code&gt; by introducing a local function &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeFold :: (b -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; b)  -&gt; Tree a -&gt; b
treeFold fbranch fleaf = g where
  -- definition of g goes here
&lt;/source&gt;

The argument &lt;code&gt;fleaf&lt;/code&gt; tells us what to do with &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; subtrees:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
g (Leaf x) = fleaf x
&lt;/source&gt;

The argument &lt;code&gt;fbranch&lt;/code&gt; tells us how to combine the results of &quot;folding&quot; two subtrees:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
g (Branch left right) = fbranch (g left) (g right)
&lt;/source&gt;

Our full definition becomes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeFold :: (b -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; b
treeFold fbranch fleaf = g where
  g (Leaf x) = fleaf x
  g (Branch left right) = fbranch (g left) (g right)
&lt;/source&gt;

For examples of how these work, copy the &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; data definition and the &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;treeFold&lt;/code&gt; functions to a Haskell file, along with the following example Tree and example functions to fold over.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
tree1 :: Tree Integer
tree1 = 
    Branch
       (Branch 
           (Branch 
               (Leaf 1) 
               (Branch (Leaf 2) (Leaf 3))) 
           (Branch 
               (Leaf 4) 
               (Branch (Leaf 5) (Leaf 6)))) 
       (Branch
           (Branch (Leaf 7) (Leaf 8)) 
           (Leaf 9))
 
doubleTree = treeMap (*2)  -- doubles each value in tree
sumTree = treeFold (+) id -- sum of the leaf values in tree
fringeTree = treeFold (++) (: [])  -- list of the leaves of tree
&lt;/source&gt;

Then load it into GHCi and evaluate:

&lt;pre&gt;
doubleTree tree1
sumTree tree1
fringeTree tree1
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Other datatypes==

Map and fold functions can be defined for any kind of data type. In order to generalize the strategy applied for lists and trees, in this final section we will work out a map and a fold for a very strange, intentionally-contrived datatype:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Weird a b = First a
               | Second b
               | Third [(a,b)]
               | Fourth (Weird a b)
&lt;/source&gt;

It can be a useful exercise to write the functions as you follow the examples, trying to keep the coding one step ahead of your reading. 

===General Map===

The first important difference in working with this &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; type is that it has ''two'' type parameters. For that reason, we will want the map function to take two functions as arguments, one to be applied on the elements of type &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and another for the elements of type &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;. With that accounted for, we can write the type signature of &lt;code&gt;weirdMap&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdMap :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; Weird c d
&lt;/source&gt;

Next step is defining code&gt;weirdMap&lt;/code&gt;. The key point is that maps preserve the ''structure'' of a datatype, so the function must evaluate to a &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; which uses the same constructor as the one used for the original &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt;. For that reason, we need one definition to handle each constructor, and these constructors are used as patterns for writing them. As before, to avoid repeating the &lt;code&gt;weirdMap&lt;/code&gt; argument list over and over again a '''where''' clause comes in handy. A sketch of the function is below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdMap :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; Weird c d
weirdMap fa fb = g
  where
    g (First x)          = --More to follow
    g (Second y)         = --More to follow
    g (Third z)          = --More to follow
    g (Fourth w)         = --More to follow
&lt;/source&gt;

The first two cases are fairly straightforward, as there is just a single element of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; type inside the &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdMap :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; Weird c d
weirdMap fa fb = g
  where
    g (First x)          = First (fa x)
    g (Second y)         = Second (fb y)
    g (Third z)          = --More to follow
    g (Fourth w)         = --More to follow
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Third&lt;/code&gt; is trickier because it contains a list whose elements are themselves data structures (the tuples). So we need to navigate the nested data structures, apply &lt;code&gt;fa&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fb&lt;/code&gt; on all elements of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and eventually (as a map must preserve structure) produce a list of tuples – &lt;code&gt;[(c,d)]&lt;/code&gt; – to be used with the constructor. The simplest approach might seem to be just breaking down the list inside the &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; and playing with the patterns:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    g (Third []) = Third []
    g (Third ((x,y):zs)) = Third ( (fa x, fb y) : ( (\(Third z) -&gt; z) (g (Third zs)) ) )
&lt;/source&gt;

This appears to be written as a typical recursive function for lists. We start by applying the functions of interest to the first element in order to obtain the head of the new list, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(fa x, fb y)&lt;/code&gt;}}. But what we will cons it to? As &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; requires a &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; argument, we need to make a &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; using the list tail in order to make the recursive call. But then &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; will give a &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; and not a list, so we have to retrieve the modified list from that – that's the role of the lambda function. Finally, there is also the empty list base case to be defined as well.

After all of that, we are left with a messy function. Every recursive call of &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; requires wrapping &lt;code&gt;zs&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt;, while what we really wanted to do was to build a list with {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;(fa x, fb y)&lt;/code&gt;}} and the modified &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;. The problem with this solution is that &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; can (thanks to pattern matching) act directly on the list head but (due to its type signature) can't be called directly on the list tail. For that reason, it would be better to apply &lt;code&gt;fa&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fb&lt;/code&gt; without breaking down the list with pattern matching (as far as &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is directly concerned, at least). But there ''was'' a way to directly modify a list element-by-element...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    g (Third z) = Third ( map (\(x, y) -&gt; (fa x, fb y) ) z)
&lt;/source&gt;

...our good old &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function, which modifies all tuples in the list &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; using a lambda function. In fact, the first attempt at writing the definition looked just like an application of the list map except for the spurious &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; packing and unpacking. We got rid of these by having the pattern splitting of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; done by &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, which works directly with regular lists. You could find it useful to expand the map definition inside &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; to see the difference more clearerly. Finally, you may prefer to write this new version in an alternative and clean way using list comprehension syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    g (Third z) = Third [ (fa x, fb y) | (x,y) &lt;- z ] 
&lt;/source&gt;

Adding the &lt;code&gt;Third&lt;/code&gt; function, we only have the &lt;code&gt;Fourth&lt;/code&gt; left to define:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdMap :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; Weird c d
weirdMap fa fb = g
  where
    g (First x)          = First (fa x)
    g (Second y)         = Second (fb y)
    g (Third z)          = Third ( map (\(x, y) -&gt; (fa x, fb y) ) z)
    g (Fourth w)         = --More to follow
&lt;/source&gt;

All we need to do is apply &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; recursively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdMap :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; Weird c d
weirdMap fa fb = g
  where
    g (First x)          = First (fa x)
    g (Second y)         = Second (fb y)
    g (Third z)          = Third ( map (\(x, y) -&gt; (fa x, fb y) ) z)
    g (Fourth w)         = Fourth (g w)
&lt;/source&gt;

===General Fold===

While we were able to define a map by specifying as arguments a function for every separate type, this isn't enough for a fold. For a fold, we'll need a function for every constructor function. With lists, the constructors are &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; argument in the &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; function corresponds to the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; constructor. The &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; argument in the &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; function corresponds to the &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; constructor. The &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; datatype has four constructors, so we need four functions – one for handling the internal structure of the datatype specified by each constructor. Next, we have an argument of the &lt;code&gt;Weird a b&lt;/code&gt; type, and finally we want the whole fold function to evaluate to a value of some other, arbitrary, type. Additionally, each individual function we pass to &lt;code&gt;weirdFold&lt;/code&gt; must evaluate to the same type &lt;code&gt;weirdFold&lt;/code&gt; does. That allows us to make a mock type signature and sketch the definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdFold :: (something1 -&gt; c) -&gt; (something2 -&gt; c) -&gt; (something3 -&gt; c) -&gt; (something4 -&gt; c) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; c
weirdFold f1 f2 f3 f4 = g
  where
    g (First x)          = --Something of type c here
    g (Second y)         = --Something of type c here
    g (Third z)          = --Something of type c here
    g (Fourth w)         = --Something of type c here
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we need to figure out to which types &lt;code&gt;something1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;something2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;something3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;something4&lt;/code&gt; correspond to. That is done by analyzing the constructors, since the functions must take as arguments the elements of the datatype (whose types are specified by the constructor type signature). Again, the types and definitions of the first two functions are easy enough. The third one isn't too difficult either because, for the purposes of folding the list of &lt;code&gt;(a,b)&lt;/code&gt;, tuples are no different from a simple type (unlike in the map example, the ''internal'' structure does not concern us now). The fourth constructor, however, is recursive, and we have to be careful. As with &lt;code&gt;weirdMap&lt;/code&gt;, we also need to recursively call the &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; function. This brings us to the final definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
weirdFold :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; c) -&gt; ([(a,b)] -&gt; c) -&gt; (c -&gt; c) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; c
weirdFold f1 f2 f3 f4 = g
  where
    g (First x)          = f1 x
    g (Second y)         = f2 y
    g (Third z)          = f3 z
    g (Fourth w)         = f4 (g w)
&lt;/source&gt;

{{body note|1=
If you were expecting very complex expressions in the &lt;code&gt;weirdFold&lt;/code&gt; above and are surprised by the immediacy of the solution, it might be helpful to have a look on what the common &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; would look like if we wrote it in this style and didn't have the special square-bracket syntax of lists to distract us:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- List a is [a], Cons is (:) and Nil is []
data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil

listFoldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; (b) -&gt; List a -&gt; b
listFoldr fCons fNil = g
  where
    g (Cons x xs) = fCons x (g xs)
    g Nil         = fNil
&lt;/source&gt;

Now it is easier to see the parallels. The extra complications are that &lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt; (that is, &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;) takes two arguments (and, for that reason, so does &lt;code&gt;fCons&lt;/code&gt;) and is recursive, requiring a call to &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;. Also, &lt;code&gt;fNil&lt;/code&gt; is of course not really a function, as it takes no arguments. 
}}

====Folds on recursive datatypes====

As far as folds are concerned, &lt;code&gt;Weird&lt;/code&gt; was a fairly nice datatype to deal with. Just one recursive constructor, which isn't even nested inside other structures. What would happen if we added a truly complicated fifth constructor?

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    Fifth [Weird a b] a (Weird a a, Maybe (Weird a b))
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a valid and yet tricky question. In general, the following rules apply:

* A function to be supplied to a fold has the same number of arguments as the corresponding constructor.
* The type of the arguments of such a function match the types of the constructor arguments, ''except'' if the constructor is recursive (that is, takes an argument of its own type).
* If a constructor is recursive, any recursive argument of the constructor will correspond to an argument of the type the fold evaluates to.&lt;ref&gt;This sort of recursiveness, in which the function used for folding can take the result of another fold as an argument, is what confers the folds of data structures such as lists and trees their &quot;accumulating&quot; functionality.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If a constructor is recursive, the complete fold function should be (recursively) applied to the recursive constructor arguments.
* If a recursive element appears inside another data structure, the appropriate map function for that data structure should be used to apply the fold function to it.

So &lt;code&gt;f5&lt;/code&gt; would have the type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f5 :: [c] -&gt; a -&gt; (Weird a a, Maybe c) -&gt; c
&lt;/source&gt;

as the type of &lt;code&gt;Fifth&lt;/code&gt; is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Fifth :: [Weird a b] -&gt; a -&gt; (Weird a a, Maybe (Weird a b)) -&gt; Weird a b
&lt;/source&gt;

The definition of &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;Fifth&lt;/code&gt; constructor will be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    g (Fifth list x (waa, mc)) = f5 (map g list) x (waa, maybeMap g mc)
      where
        maybeMap f Nothing = Nothing
        maybeMap f (Just w) = Just (f w)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that nothing strange happens with the &lt;code&gt;Weird a a&lt;/code&gt; part. No &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; gets called. What's up? This is a recursion, right? Well... not really. &lt;code&gt;Weird a a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Weird a b&lt;/code&gt; are different types, so it isn't a real recursion. It isn't guaranteed that, for example, &lt;code&gt;f2&lt;/code&gt; will work with something of type 'a', where it expects a type 'b'. It can be true for some cases but is not reliable for every case.

Also look at the definition of &lt;code&gt;maybeMap&lt;/code&gt;. Verify that it is indeed a map function as:

* It preserves structure.
* Only types are changed.

==Explain who an artist is. Name Creation’s Master Artist.==

An artist is a person whose creative work shows sensitivity and imagination. An artist use many methods including drawing, painting, and sculpting. They use an assortment of materials—different kinds of paints, pencils, and pens, plaster, clay, and even computers. An artist's work may show objects, people, nature, or events.

The Creation's Master Artist is God.


[[File:Primary-Secondary color wheel.tif|thumb|Color Wheel]]
==Name and know the primary colors.==

'''The Primary colors are''' red, yellow, and blue. Primary colors cannot be made from other colors.  Artists create all the other colors of the rainbow by mixing together the primary colors.

'''The secondary colors''' are green, orange and violet (purple). Secondary colors are made by mixing two primary colors.  Each secondary color is made from the two primary colors closest to it on the color wheel 

* Mix these colors to make three new colors.
* Use these six colors to make a picture.

==Demonstrate how to sharpen pencils and clean brushes.==
* Sharpen two pencils.
* Using water, clean your brush.


[[File:Finger_Painting.jpg|thumb|250px|Finger Paint]]
==Make a design with each of the following:==
'''Finger paints''' - Have the children finger paint on a piece of finger paint paper mixing orange and yellow.  Then have them  finger paint with brown and black on another sheet.  After it is dry, have the children cut out ground and a sun as shown.  Glue in place on a large sheet on construction paper.  Glue small green pompoms down for the caterpillar's body and a red pompom for the head. Glue a small bent piece of pipe cleaner above the head. Add tiny wiggly eyes.A sample of this project is found in this webpage:[http://www.makinglearningfun.com/themepages/HungryCaterpillarFingerPaintArt.htm Hungry Caterpillar Finger Paint Art]
 
'''Colored pencils''' - Did you know that good colored pencils can actually blend together like oil pastels do? I didn’t until I purchased some new supplies. 
* Demonstrate a simple line drawing of an apple sitting on a table and ask your students to draw their own, in pencil.
* Show students how to &quot;glaze&quot; a drawing by coloring the different layers needed for this apple. Fill the apple shape first with white colored pencil, then a layer of yellow (leave a highlight spot) then orange, and finally red.
* Add detail such as the stem and background. A sample of this project is found in this webpage:[http://www.artprojectsforkids.org/2007/12/colored-pencil-apple-drawing.html Colored pencil apple drawing]

'''Felt markers''' -

==Learn an art technique and demonstrate two of the following:==
* '''Potato prints''' - The best [http://www.marthastewart.com/273682/potato-prints '''Potato Prints''']have a painterly quality reminiscent of impressionist art. To make one, cut a potato (any variety will do) in half, and draw a shape onto the flesh with a pencil. Then, using a utility knife or a jackknife with a thin blade, carve around the outline of the pencil design, and cut away the background to a depth of 1/4 inch. Dip the potato into a dish of paint as though using a stamp pad. Press the potato onto blank cards, reapplying paint when the prints become faint. Each print will look unique and slightly irregular -- a work of art in itself. To make a tag, punch a small hole in the corner of the card with a needle or an awl, and thread a piece of string or ribbon through.

* Stencil

:Mix salt and flour. 
:Add in half the water, then eventually add the remaining water. Knead until the dough is smooth, this can take up to 10 minutes. For flat dough ornaments roll out the dough on baking paper Or be creative and make odd shapes and wreaths (takes longer to bake) Now that you have your mixture completed, you simply take cookie cutters or your hands and creat anything you please. It can be big or small, epending on how much stuff you make.The best way to make a hole in the top of the ornament so that you can hang it from the tree is to place a straw where you want it and press firly and twist. It then slices the through all the salt-dough.
:To bake the salt-dough, it depends somewhat on the thickness your creation. Set your oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit and leave in for an hour to an hour and a hal. If you think its done, make sure it is dry, then it is done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Newton==

Already in the antiquity it was known, that if the fraction &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is near ''&amp;#8730;a'', then the fraction &lt;math&gt;x_1 = (x_0 + a/x_0)/2&lt;/math&gt; is a better approximation to ''&amp;#8730;a''. For if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation to ''&amp;#8730;a'' that is smaller than ''&amp;#8730;a'', then &lt;math&gt;a/x_0&lt;/math&gt; is an approximation to ''&amp;#8730;a'' that is larger than ''&amp;#8730;a'', and conversely, therefore &lt;math&gt;x_1 = (x_0 + a/x_0)/2&lt;/math&gt; is a better approximation to ''&amp;#8730;a'' than both &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a/x_0&lt;/math&gt;. We can, of course, repeat the procedure, and it is very effective: you get an approximation to ''&amp;#8730;a'' with ten correct digits, if you start with &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; = 1.5 and apply the procedure three times.

To find the square root of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, is to solve the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2 - a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and we have solved this equation by the ''iteration'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;(x + a/x)/2&lt;/math&gt;. And it is this method we must apply for solving an equation, if we do not have a formula, or if this - after the invention of the computer - seems too laborious to use.

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpicthist1.jpg|thumb|right|Newton iteration]]It was ''Newton'' who described the general procedure: if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a (continuous) differentiable function which intersects the x-axis near &lt;math&gt;x = x_0&lt;/math&gt;, and we apply the iteration &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;x - f(x)/f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; a number of times starting in &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then we get a good approximation to a solution ''x*'' of the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; = 0 (because we have assumed that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; intersects the x-axis, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;&gt; 0 near the point ''x*'' where &lt;math&gt;f(x*)&lt;/math&gt; = 0).

The method can be generalized, so that it works for &lt;math&gt;f'(x*)&lt;/math&gt; = 0, but if &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges to ∞ for ''x'' converging to ''x*'', as it is the case for &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; and ''x*'' = 0, then the procedure leads away from the solution.

There are situations where a solution cannot be found by this method, and there can be points whose sequence of iteration either converges towards a cycle of points (containing more than one point) or does not converge. This question ought to be studied more closely, advertised the English mathematician ''Arthur Cayley'' in 1879 in a paper of only one page. He was aware, that the Newton procedure could as well be applied for solving a complex equation &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; = 0, and he proposed that we &quot;look away from the realities&quot; and examine what can happen when the iteration does not lead to a solution. But this proposal was his only contribution to the theory.

==Julia and Fatou==

Thirty years passed before anyone took up this question. But then the two french mathematicians ''Gaston Julia'' (1893-1978) and ''Pierre Fatou'' (1878-1929) published papers where they examined iteration of general complex rational functions, and they proved all the facts about &quot;Julia&quot; sets and &quot;Fatou&quot; domains we have used here. Julia and Fatou were of course not able to produce detailed pictures showing the Julia set for Newton iteration for solving the equation &lt;math&gt;z^3&lt;/math&gt; = 1, for instance, but they knew that the Julia set in this case is not a curve. Cayley certainly imagined that the plane would be divided up by geometrical curves, and if he did so, it was not unforgivable, for this is namely the case for the so-called weak Newton procedure: this leads more slowly but more safe to a solution.

We have intimated, that our mean results regarding Julia sets, were known to Julia and Fatou. This is not quite true, for the fact that the sequences of iteration in the neutral case can go into ''annular'' shaped revolving movements, was first discovered in 1942 by the German mathematician ''C.L. Siegel''. We have said that these revolving movements can be either polygon or annular shaped, that they are lying concentrically and that there is a finite cycle which is ''centre'' for the movements. And possibly the reader has wondered: this centre cycle, does it belongs to the Fatou domain or to the Julia set? We will now answer this question. In the section about field lines we have defined a complex number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which in the attracting case has norm smaller than 1, but which in the neutral case has norm 1 and therefore corresponds to an angle (its argument). When this angle is rational (with respect to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;), the terminal movements are finite (polygonal, the ''parabolic'' case), and the centre cycle belongs to the Julia set, when the angle is irrational, the terminal movements are infinite (annular, the ''Siegel-disc'' case), and the centre cycle belongs to the Fatou domain.

==Mandelbrot==
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpicthist2.jpg|thumb|right|The Mandelbrot set for &lt;math&gt;\lambda z(1 - z)&lt;/math&gt;]][[Image:Juliasetsdkpicthist3.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the above Mandelbrot set]]

But apart for such few results, not very much happened in this theory before ''Benoit B. Mandelbrot'' (1924-2010) in the late 1970s began his serious study of Julia sets by using computer. It is Mandelbrot who has coined the word ''fractal geometry''. He had had Julia as teacher (at ''École Polytechnique''), and around 1964 he began his &quot;varied forays into unfashionable and lonely corners of the Unknown&quot;. But the fractal patterns he first studied were self-similar in the strict sense of this word, namely invariant under ''linear'' transformation. It was first in 1978-79 he began his study of Julia sets for rational complex functions. He made some print-outs and he studied ''families'' of rational complex functions, formed by ''multiplying'' the function by a complex parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. His intention was to let the computer draw a set M of parameters &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for which the Julia set is not (totally) disconnected (a &quot;fractal dust&quot;). Such a program could be made very simple: he found two critical points for the function, and plotted the points &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for which the two critical points did not iterate towards the same cycle. For then there would be at least two Fatou domains, and therefore the Julia set would not be a dust cloud. He chose functions for which he knew a real parameter value &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that the iteration behaved chaotically on some real interval, for then this &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; might belong to his set M.

He began (in 1979) with the family &lt;math&gt;\lambda (1 + z^2)^2/(z(z^2 - 1))&lt;/math&gt; (having four real and two imaginary critical points). For &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; = 1/4 it behaves chaotically on an interval, and he &quot;felt that in order to achieve a set having a rich structure, it was best to pick a complicated map (every beginner I have since then watched operate has taken the same tack)&quot;. The picture where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; varied over the complex plane, showed a highly structured but very fuzzy &quot;shadow&quot; of the set. A very blotchy version, but &quot;it sufficed to show that the topic was worth pursuing, but had better be persued in an easier context&quot;.

Then (in 1980) he studied the family &lt;math&gt;\lambda z(1 - z)&lt;/math&gt; (having critical points 1/2 and ∞), which for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; = -2 and 4 behaves chaotically on the interval [-2, 2]. He saw two discs of radius 1 and centres in 0 and 2: &quot;Two lines of algebra confirmed that these discs were to be expected here, and that the method was working. We also saw, on the real line to the right and left of the above discs, the crude outlines of round blobs which I call &quot;atoms&quot; today. They appeared to be bisected by intervals known in the Myrberg theory, which encoraged us to go on to increasing bold computations. For a while, every investment in computation yielded increasing sharply focussed pictures. Helped by imagination, I saw the atoms fall into a hierarchy, each carrying smaller atoms attached to it&quot;.

&quot;After that, however, our luck seemed to break; our pictures, instead of becoming increasingly sharp, seemed to become increasingly messy. Was this the fault of the faltering Textronix [cathode ray tube (&quot;worn out and very faint&quot;)]?&quot;. Mandelbrot ran the program on another computer: &quot;The mess had failed the vanish! In fact, as you can check, it showed signs of being systematic. We promptly took a much closer look. Many specks of dirt duly vanished after we zoomed in. But some specks failed to vanish; in fact, they proved to solve into complex structures endowed with &quot;sprouts&quot; very similar to those of the whole set M. Peter Moldave and I could not contain our excitement. Some reasons made us redo the whole computation using the equivalent map ''z'' → &lt;math&gt;z^2 - c&lt;/math&gt;, and here the main continent of the set M proved to be shaped like each of the islands! Next, we focussed on the sprouts corresponding to different orders of bifurcation, and we compared the corresponding off-shore islands. They proved to lie on the intersection of stellate patterns of logarithmic spirals! (...) We continued to flip in this fashion between the set M and selected Julia sets J, and made an exciting discovery. I saw that the set M goes beyond being a numerical record of numbers of points in limit cycles. It also has uncanny &quot;hieroglyphical&quot; character: including within itself a whole deformed collection of reduced-size versions of all the Julia sets&quot;.

A '''speedy keep''' is a decision made in the [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]] when an article should be kept speedily.

==Criteria==
Should '''any one''' of the following criteria apply, any request for deletion can be speedily kept:
* There is no remaining argument for deletion. &lt;!--If this looks familiar, I've read the opposite number of this proposal at WP.--&gt; This includes:
**When the article is fixed so that the arguments given at any time are invalid.
**When the original argument is considered completely wrong.
*When the nomination is considered vandalism.

==Non-admin closure==
A non-administrator can close a discussion as '''speedy keep''' without the need of an administrator to endorse it. However, administrators do have the right to revert such a decision. To avoid conflicts of interest, please do not speedily keep a page you have created or are closely related to. If a speedy keep is blatant vandalism, then any user can undo or roll back such a decision. If this is repeated, the user who speedily kept the request can be blocked for edit warring as well as vandalism, or banned from participating in the requests for deletion.</text>

In this chapter, we will talk about something that may seem boring to many but is very useful: measurements. You may have learnt them in science, but here they are anyway. This chapter has no corresponding material in Euclid's ''Elements'', and will only serve as a reference chapter.

==Measuring length==
When measuring length, simply put get a ruler and place the '0' on the endpoint of the segment you wish to measure. Then move the ruler so that the edge of the ruler fits the line exactly. Read the marking on the ruler on the other endpoint. That is the length of the ruler.

Some people use the metric system when measuring lengths. That means they use centimetres, millimetres, metres and kilometres. Others use inches, feet and yards. Most people prefer to use the metric system, although many people still use other measuring units.

Sometimes we need to measure a longer distance. Then we can use the tape measure, the trundle wheel, or the metre rule. We will not talk about them in detail here.

Sometimes we need to know the area of the figure. That has been discussed before. If you do not remember that, take a look at [[../Plane shapes|the chapter about plane figures]]. When we calculate the area of the figure, we use only one unit. Let us use centimetres as an example. If a square is 4cm long, then its area is 4cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is equal to 16 squared centimetres, or cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Measuring angles==
Sometimes we need to measure angles. That is, how wide an angle is open. The size of the arms is insignificant. If you remember from [[../Angles|the chapter about angles]], angles are measured in degrees. So, how can we find out the number of degrees an angle has?

You probably have a measuring tool called a protractor. It looks like a semi-circle with markings along the circumference. Some protractors are full circles. You can use both for measuring angles. To measure an angle, look for a tinky marking at the midpoint of the diameter of the circle. Place that on the vertex of the angle. Now let one of the arms fit the radius exactly. Read the marking on the other arm. That is the size of the angle!

When dealing with reflex angles, a full circle protractor may be better for the purpose, but let's stick to using a half-circle for now. Recall that angles with the same vertice and which add up to 360° are called angles at a point. Notice that in reflex∠ABC, for example, you can also measure ∠ABC. Then you can take ∠ABC away from 360°. That is the size of reflex∠ABC.

==Measuring volume==
Measuring volume may require more complicated apparatus than measuring angles or lengths. In the laboratory, we use measuring cylinders, but since we are not in the laboratory, we usually use beakers instead. However, sometimes we use displacement cans, which are like large beakers with an opening. We can easily find the volume by looking at the water displaced. The concept is discovered by a mathematician called Archimedes.

When measuring volume, we can use the units cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, if a book is 10cm long, 5cm wide and 1cm thick, its volume would be 50cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

A related concept is capacity. Capacity is the amount of liquid that a container can hold. We can use the units, litres and millilitres. For example, a box of vita-soy milk contains about 250 millilitres of soy milk.

      <comment>/* Section B: Plane and solid figures */  added one letter to correct spelling</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You have gone through the entire section about the basic concepts of geometry. It is about time you test yourself. Note that this exercise covers only knowledge questions and no sums are required. If you need a detailed solution, please see [[/Answers/|the answers]]. 

==Section A: Points, lines and angles==
'''Part one: True or False'''
# Points are infinitely small.
# Lines have a fixed length.

'''Part two: Multiple choice questions'''
#Which of the following facts about line segments is correct?
##Any two lines segments must intersect.
##Line segments are lines which go on forever in both directions
##Line segments have a finite length because they have midpoints
##When two line segments intersect, the point where they cross is called the point of intersection

==Section B: Plane and solid figures==
We've went over this, right? But it is very important to go over while doing Exercise I. Plane figures, such as a circle, are flat, like a piece of paper. Solids are shapes you can actually touch. You also need to think about the &lt;u&gt;texture&lt;/u&gt;. Texture is how an object feels. Here is an example, I have foam in my hand. It feels squishy and foamy.

==Section C: Symmetry, transformation and coordinates==
Symmetry (from the Greek: &quot;συμμετρεῖν&quot; = to measure together), generally conveys two primary meanings. The first is an imprecise sense of harmonious or aesthetically pleasing proportionality and balance;[1][2] such that it reflects beauty or perfection. The second meaning is a precise and well-defined concept of balance or &quot;patterned self-similarity&quot; that can be demonstrated or proved according to the rules of a formal system: by geometry, through physics or otherwise.
 
Although the meanings are distinguishable in some contexts, both meanings of &quot;symmetry&quot; are related and discussed in parallel.[2][3]
 
The &quot;precise&quot; notions of symmetry have various measures and operational definitions. For example, symmetry may be observed:
 with respect to the passage of time;
 as a spatial relationship;
 through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation;
 through other kinds of functional transformations;[4] and
 as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.[5][6]
 
This article describes these notions of symmetry from four perspectives. The first is that of symmetry in geometry, which is the most familiar type of symmetry for many people. The second perspective is the more general meaning of symmetry in mathematics as a whole. The third perspective describes symmetry as it relates to science and technology. In this context, symmetries underlie some of the most profound results found in modern physics, including aspects of space and time. Finally, a fourth perspective discusses symmetry in the humanities, covering its rich and varied use in history, architecture, art, and religion.
 
The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry.

In mathematics, a transformation could be any function mapping a set X on to another set or on to itself. However, often the set X has some additional algebraic or geometric structure and the term &quot;transformation&quot; refers to a function from X to itself that preserves this structure.
 
Examples include linear transformations and affine transformations, rotations, reflections and translations. These can be carried out in Euclidean space, particularly in dimensions 2 and 3. They are also operations that can be performed using linear algebra, and described explicitly using matrices.

In geometry, a coordinate system is a system which uses one or more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of a point or other geometric element. The order of the coordinates is significant and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a letter, as in 'the x-coordinate'. In elementary mathematics the coordinates are taken to be real numbers, but in more advanced applications coordinates can be taken to be complex numbers or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice versa; this is the basis of analytic geometry.
 
An example in everyday use is the system of assigning longitude and latitude to geographical locations. In physics, a coordinate system used to describe points in space is called a frame of reference.

==Section D: Integrated and miscellaneous questions==
Integration may refer to:
 
In sociology and economy:
 Social integration
 Racial integration, refers to social and cultural behavior; in a legal sense, see desegregation
 Economic integration
 Educational integration of students with disabilities
 Regional integration
 American Studies Integration, the study of pillars kind of routine
 Horizontal integration and vertical integration, in microeconomics and strategic management, refer to a style of ownership and control
 Integration clause, in a contract, a term used to declare the contract the final and complete understanding of the parties
 Integrated production
 
In mathematics:
 Integration, in mathematics, a fundamental concept of calculus—the operation of calculating the area between the curve of a function and the x-axis
 Indefinite integration, in calculus, the process of calculating antiderivatives—the opposites of derivatives (a.k.a. &quot;antidifferentiation&quot;)
 In numerical analysis and in signal processing, a time series can be &quot;integrated&quot; numerically by various step-by-step means, including autoregressive integrated moving average and the Runge-Kutta methods.
 
In Electronics Engineering:
 Integrated circuit, an electronic circuit whose components are manufactured in one flat piece of semiconductor material
 Systems integration, the engineering practices and procedures for assembling large and complicated systems from less-complicated units, especially subsystems
 In electronic signal processing, radars, sonars, and astronomy, integration is the process of taking multiple copies of a weak signal and adding them together to form detectable signals. Special vacuum tubes called &quot;integration tubes&quot; were devised and used in radar systems.
 
Other uses:
 Pre-integration complex or retroviral integration, in biology
 In animation, to combine 2D, 3D graphics, motion capture, or live-action footage together

{{del}} This is not a textbook.  It seems to be an essay which analyses various biblical statements and tries to ascertain the nature of angelic beings.

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I would support any attempt to turn this into a keep. I don't see any POV issue on the text (it is balanced and uses quotes from the Bible).
:The issue with this book (and others also) is that we don't have any support for theological and philosophical works (or most of the cool subjects in humanities studies) besides looking into the subjects from an the historical perspective, which is sad but a change would require some fine tuning to the WIW policy (since discerning them from OR would be extremely difficult and would also  increase the number of bizarre contributors, that in itself wouldn't be that bad, but it is a gray area).
:Since we are &quot;cleaning house&quot;, a look into the other works in this section is probably in order [[Miracles]] (very cool font) and [[Solidjah]] (both have the exact same issue), [[The Ten Commandments]] (POV), [[Yeshua and Kabbalah]] &quot;Some people do not see the relationship of kabbalah and the teachings of Yahshuah. I was one of those seven years ago&quot; (probably salvageable but some issues of POV and redaction) and probably more, this in just a few seconds, deletion can indeed be easy if you have the time and inclination...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:13, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
::I would support the deletion of the four books mentioned here. Although a thorough reading would be extremely exhausting and tedious, I have skimmed the books and came to the conclusion that the books have the same problem, namely, they present facts that are supposed to be biased anyway. Take the events held in commemoration of the Tiananmen Square rebellion, for example. ''Ming Pao'' and ''Ta Kung Pao'' presented completely different reports. ''Ming Pao'' interviewed the used the protestor's estimates, interviewed anti-government people (but not pro-government ones!), and went into as much detail as possible to make it seem really big. ''Ta Kung Pao'', on the other hand, made it as brief as possible, used the police's estimates, and put it somewhere nobody would care, so as to make it seem trivial. Neither of them are doing particularly good things, but Ta Kung Pao is better at concealing it.

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. Cut and dried OR and can never be anything else. Also a complete work of fantasy as it works from the assumption that angels exist and treats the Bible as being some kind of reference work - but that's just my opinion. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 10:36, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

: {{Del}} Not enough support from references for not taking it as OR essay and hardly any effort to try to begin the discussion from a perspective even slightly close to NPOV. Like Panic, I felt some goodwill towards this book but unfortunately I can't see it as a keep. Abstracting a bit from this particular book, though, Panic's concerns about the difficulty in dealing with philosophical and religious subjects, however, are very pertinent. Following the same line of thought, I wouldn't agree with Kayau about &quot;facts that are supposed to be biased&quot;. For instance, it is perfectly possible to write a book on, say, Christianity from a Christian perspective without loading it with POV. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 04:18, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} Assuming that the obvious tone and POV issues were dealt with, the contents were structured like a proper book and (ideally) there existed a book which covered Kabbalah (so that the material could have some sort of bigger context) there would be some hope of finding an use for the contents. Not that it looks like a likely scenario, but still... some of the references (''not'' the external links) even appear to be reasonable sources in an NPOV context (the text does not make clear how they are used, though, which is a problem). On the other hand, the fact that the &quot;book&quot; is fully available at http://yeshuaandkabbalah.blogspot.com/ may not be particularly encouraging. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:25, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} It is also a bit disturbing the entire book popped into existence in a single edit.  My guess would be by a copy and paste from a wikipedia article that was to be deleted, since it came complete with redlinks and citation tags. This seems further evidenced by the vast differences in writing style between sections.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:22, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Del}} After a little investigating over at WP it seems this page was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Yeshua_and_Jewish_Kabbalah deleted at wikipedia] for being straight forward OR.  Reading the comments there has convinced me this is OR.   In addition this is clearly a copyvio, there is no longer an original page from which we can get an editors list who helped to improve the page.  These facts, together with the fact there is an exact copy at the authors blog makes me think this should go.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:28, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Harmony is the underlying foundation of Western art music. Harmony is the study of how particular sonorities are related and function with respect to a primary tonal region based upon a central pitch class.

The Mathematical definition of harmony: Presume that waves X and Y are of wavelengths A and B. In other words X(nA) = X(mA), and Y(nB) = Y(mB), where n and m are any 2 integer numbers.

Now, presume that wave Z is a combination of X and Y. In other words Z(n) = X(n) + Y(n), where n is any number. Because Z is a function of X+Y, Z only repeats at any point where X and Y both repeat. This point is the lowest common multiple of A and B, which will henceforth be referred to as value C. C is the combined wavelength of X and Y.

The nature of tonal harmony is that the lower the value of C, the more harmonized the notes are. This is why octaves are the most harmonized; a note's octave repeats twice as often as the note itself, so if 2n is the wavelength of any note, n is its octave. Obviously, the lowest common multiple of N and 2N is 2N itself, which makes the wavelength of a note combined with its octave just the wavelength of the note itself, and the shortest possible combine wavelength of 2 notes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

Currently, OpenSCAD only supports DXF as a graphics format for 2D graphics. Other common formats are [[w:PostScript|PS]]/[[w:Encapsulated Postscript|EPS]] and [[w:Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]].

=== PS/EPS ===

The [http://www.pstoedit.net/ pstoedit] program can convert between various vector graphics formats. OpenSCAD needs the &lt;code&gt;-polyaslines&lt;/code&gt; option passed to the dxf output plugin to understand the file. The &lt;code&gt;-dt&lt;/code&gt; options instructs pstoedit to render texts, which is usually what you want if you include text. (If the rendered text's resolution in terms of polygon count is too low, the easiest solution is to scape up the eps before converting; if you know a more elegant solution, please add it to the example.)

 pstoedit -dt -f dxf:-polyaslines infile.eps outfile.dxf

=== SVG ===

pstoedit does not understand SVG, but EPS can be converted from an SVG. [http://inkscape.org inkscape], an SVG editor, can be used for conversion.

 inkscape -E intermediate.eps infile.svg
 pstoedit -dt -f dxf:-polyaslines intermediate.eps outfile.dxf

=== Makefile automation ===

The conversion can be automated using the make system; put the following lines in your &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
 all: my_first_file.dxf my_second_file.dxf another_file.dxf
 
 %.eps: %.svg
 	inkscape -E $@ $&lt;
 
 %.dxf: %.eps
 	pstoedit -dt -f dxf:-polyaslines $&lt; $@
&lt;/source&gt;
The first line specifies which dxf files are to be generated when &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; is called in the current directory. The second paragraph specifies how to convert a file ending in .svg to a file ending in .eps, and the third from .eps to .dxf.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The move '''2.Kf2'''?! (ECO code A00)is called various things in various parts of the world. Most commonly known as the ''Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening'' but also known throughout much of Europe as the ''Hammerschlag''.In the United States some theory has been published to award-winning praise under the name ''Schmoe Attack''.[http://www.uschess.stratlabs.com/news/press.releases/2001/uspr0141.html]

In 2001 a &quot;mystery GM&quot; playing at the I.C.C.(Internet Chess Club) was beating all Grand Masters (GMs) and International Masters (IMs) with this opening for several months. GM Nigel Short lost several games to this mystery player using the ''Pork Chop Opening'', and he had a theory from chats he and this player had had after their games that this was in fact Bobby Fischer, trying to prove that you can win at the highest levels in chess even with random openings and in this way promoting ''Fischer Random Chess''.

There is a competing rumor told by GM Larry Evans and others in the chess community that someone using a chess interface engine which plays the moves straight to the game instead of the cumbersome process of transferring moves from the chess engine to the online game was playing a trick on the online chess community. Fischer is not on record as have ever commenting on the matter.

'''Positional Ideas:''' White wants to calmly trade off pieces to lessen the chances of a successful attack against his king. As pieces come off the board white's king will be in a good position to control the center and help in a king and pawn ending.

'''Psychological Ideas:''' The shock and awe factor of facing this opening may lead to overconfidence and reckless play from black, in this way the game may reach atypical positions with chances for creative and energetic play.

'''Opening Ideas:''' Controlling the center with f3 and often an early pawn advance to c3. An active king who if handled properly can assist in both attack and defense in the late opening and early middle-game.

== Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening Mainline ==
'''2...d5''' Taking firm control of the center and opening line for the development of black's pieces. In the game between the two masters Williams, Simon Kim (2421) vs. Simons, Martin (2264)11.08.1999 - Chessbase Mega Database 2010 play continued '''3.e3''' Nf6 4.d4!? Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd6! 6.Ne2 O-O 7.Re1?! e4 8.Ng3 h5!? 9.f4 Bg4 10.Be2 g6?! and white went on to win a wild game.

'''3.c3''' is a trappy move which can assist in taking over the center with a timely pawn advance to d4, it also allows movement of the queen along the deadly d1-a4 diagonal. 3...Nf6 4.Na3!? leads to fun and unexplored positions.

* I plan to merge Decision Control into Conditional Statements and move Loops after Sequences.  I already moved Sequences to after Decision Control because they seem more advanced than Boolean logic, but now the higher level of iteration is bugging me.  I understand why Decision Control exists; it's neat and logical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Independent thinking and learning ===

Independent learning outside of school can be promoted through the creation of extensive written works and team work.
To create a parent education course, such as the one you are about to write, could consequently be seen as a useful learning context.
The topic is of general interest and there are extensive opportunities for literature research and research projects.
Independent thought can be encouraged by a need for {{/@|Self-concept and metacognition|metacognition}}, through research and through extensive opportunity for discussions which can be further stimulated through questions and contradictions, or other need for clarification.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
* How can you bring the motivation for independent learning into the family?
* What other topics than parent education could one work on in a similar manner?
* What other aspects of independent thought and learning could one choose to promote?
* What other methods of promotion for independent thought and learning can you devise?
}}

A parent education course may also have the objective to train competencies in a family.
An important competence, which promotes independent thought and learning, is [[w:autodidacticism|autodidacticism]].
In order not to exaggerate one should also apply {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idiocultural competence}}; not everybody shares enthusiasm for [[w:lifelong learning|lifelong learning]] and not everybody wants to improve his autodidactic skills.
The right way can be to prefer interest-driven learning and to improve autodidactic skills only as a side effect; whoever learns according to his interests is unlikely to complain about the improvement of his learning skills.
Autodidactic learning presupposes a willingness to accept that there are things which one does not understand, but which one may consider essential once they are understood.
Many people fail to recognize this fact again and again.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
* How do you explain to a learner that he only after understanding a topic can truly understand its benefits?
* Why is it hard to understand that the benefits of the unknown may also be unknown?
* Is this a [[w:cognitive bias|cognitive bias]]?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Happiness research ==

At the Willy-Hellpach school in Heidelberg there is a new subject [http://www.schulfachglueck.de/ Happiness] since September 2007.
The head teacher Ernst Fritz-Schubert means to promote life skills, enjoyment of life, personality development, personal satisfaction, self-confidence, self-responsibility and social responsibility with this subject.
What he deems necessary for this purpose are self-esteem, empathy, friendship, love, spirituality, humor and optimism.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
The head teacher of the Willy Hellpach school sees happiness as a basic need.
* Where would you put happiness in the {{/@|Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs}}?
* What do you think about the ingredients of happiness (self-esteem, empathy, friendship, love, spirituality, humor and optimism)?
* What do you know yourself (or believe to know) about the psychology of happiness?
}}

An important observation is that happiness occurs in many situations in response to a change, so you can react in these situations only to that event or a shorter or longer phase with happiness and well-being. After the event or after a certain time a habituation effect can occur, which means you get used to the state that initially made you happy and you perceive the pleasant event or the comfortable state as normal.

A good example are computer games or listening to music; both of which can be used to enhance the mood, to feel in a good mood for a limited time, but both can also be exaggerated, so that the effect decreases and a habituation occurs.
In case of homework one could distinguish for instance if the homework is unpleasant enough, so that an artificial improvement of one's mood appears necessary, or whether the intellectual challenge may be motivation enough. To turn off music before the homework can be seen as [[w:Deferred gratification|delayed gratification]] as well as a necessity in order to achieve the necessary concentration. (If the homework is always unpleasant that could be a topic for the {{/@|Class council and family council|class council}}.)

Longer-lasting happiness results however, for instance, from the fulfillment of some of the basic needs in the {{/@|Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs}}, especially on the steps three (social needs), four (esteem) and five (self-actualization).

At level four of the hierarchy of needs respect, self-esteem, recognition and wealth can be found as examples.
In a capitalist society all these terms can easily be associated with &quot;wealth&quot;, which makes capitalism an end in itself instead of a {{/@|Capitalism as a means to an end|means to an end}}. An interesting question could thus be: How much money does one need to be happy? The [[wikinews:de:ZDF-Studie_zum_Glück_der_Kinder_in_Deutschland|ZDF-study about happiness of children in Germany]] reports that children in families with a household income of less than 1.500 Euro described themselves as less happy.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* What can you do to help families who possibly do not earn enough?
* What forms of cooperation with other families do exist?
* Is the income the actual cause or merely an indicator? What are possible causes?
* What can you do about these causes?
}}

An example for a measure could be a [[w:de:Schülerfirma|pupil company]] that works as an educational coaching agency and employment agency for unemployed parents; the same pupil company could for instance offer and organize parent education courses and {{/@|parent service}} and organize additional leisure and educational offers for pupils.

=== Class council and family council ===

The [[w:class council|class council]] of a class and the {{/@|Family council|family council}} of a family are both democratic committees that serve the purpose to facilitate learning processes for social and democratic behavior.
Many families can benefit from assistance for family councils through their schools.

==== Philosophycracy ====

Philosophycracy is a made up word, but the meaning is generic and can be deduced from the components &quot;philosophy&quot; and &quot;krátos&quot;. The term philosophy comes from the Ancient Greek word φιλοσοφία (philosophía) and means love of wisdom. The root word κράτος (krátos) is also of Ancient Greek origin and means strength or power, such as in the word democracy. The philosophycracy would consequently be the &quot;rule of the love of wisdom&quot;.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
Can one design a council so that all votes have to be based on the philosophical positions of the voters?
}}

The voters would have to determine their philosophical positions in advance and commit to vote in accordance with their philosophy or possibly to abstain from voting.
In general it may be almost impossible to anticipate all possible exceptions and conflicts of interest, however, exceptions should be rare enough so that one could at least establish the general positions.
Whether a council recognizes an exception or a conflict of interest and allows a deviation from the philosophycracy rule can be left to the council to decide.

A benefit of the prior determination of philosophical positions is that every member of the council gets to know every other council member.
To discuss the philosophical positions of other council members could thus be regarded as valuable social behavior.

=== Parent service ===

{{Rquote|right|There is much evidence that the furtherance of children in programs outside of the family benefits if likewise the parents can be won over to give the educational processes of their children more attention and support.|[http://www.familienhandbuch.de/familienpolitik/wissenschaftliche-beitrage/die-bildungspolitische-bedeutung-der-familie-folgerungen-aus-der-pisa-studie The meaning of the family for educational policy,&lt;br&gt;conclusions from the PISA study]|Scientific Advisory Council of the German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth}}

In the U.S. some private schools require that all parents must collaborate in school.
Both, services for parents as well as services by parents can be referred to as &quot;parent service&quot;.
These services may include assistance with school events but also in education.
Often merely the family is required to serve a certain number of hours, for instance four hours per month; the family members can then discuss in a family council who accepts this duty in each case, which should also be seen as a positive motivation for discussions.
A further psychological effect is that children and teenagers will appreciate the cooperation of their parents if a duty could just as easily be assigned to them.
An occasional compulsory school attendance for parents can, however, be used for parent education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Intercultural competence ===

[[w:Intercultural competence|Intercultural competence]] is actually the competent handling of cultures of other countries, but you can also apply intercultural competence to the personal cultures and characteristics of people and groups of people as {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idiocultural competence}}.
This is obviously the case when you personally meet people from other cultures.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* What cultural differences do you know?
* What is required for intercultural competence when dealing with people from other countries?
* How can you learn or train intercultural competence?
}}

Intercultural competence means knowledge about other cultures, but also {{/@|Self-concept and metacognition|metacognition}}, because you have to think about your own actions and the actions and expectations of others; it means [[w:people skills|people skills]], because you have to be able to apply the knowledge and the results of your considerations in social activities.
The required knowledge, the ability for the required metacognition and the aspects of social competence that are necessary form together an {{/@|Active mental vocabulary|active mental vocabulary}} of intercultural competence, or more simply put: You cannot just read up on intercultural knowledge but you have to train intercultural competence like a skill.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* Is there a cognitive bias, which produces the impression that one is proficient, although one only knows the theory?
* What cognitive biases result in the impression that other cultures are less important, less complex, and already sufficiently known?
}}

Für die Bewertung von interkultureller Kompetenz werden insbesondere die Eigenschaften Ambiguitätstoleranz, Kontaktfähigkeit, Verhaltensflexibilität, Emotionskompetenz, Leistungsmotivation, Empathie und Polyzentrismus bewertet.

For the assessment of intercultural competence the attitudes and abilities [[w:ambiguity tolerance|ambiguity tolerance]], [[w:interpersonal skills|interpersonal skills]], behavioral flexibility, [[w:emotional competence|emotional competence]], [[w:Need for achievement|achievement motivation]], [[w:empathy|empathy]] and [[w:polycentrism|polycentrism]] are of particular importance.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* Which of these properties can be trained?
* How can you measure these properties?
* Can you measure or train the abilities of parents?
* Which of these options could be used as part of a parent education course, if they are usable at all?
}}

Don't worry if you cannot devise or implement the perfect measurement methods as pupils in middle school or at the beginning of high school.
The attempt is important and the considerations about the possibilities should be useful to reveal new perspectives for the parent education course.
You shouldn't be discouraged by the view &quot;we can't do this yet&quot;, but you should, of course, not assume that your measurement methodes will produce very precise results; that is possibly not relevant: Fantasy and creativity are what is demanded from the authors here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Model of culture ===

Cross-cultural researchers have devised various [[w:Cultural_dimensions|models of culture]] that describe cultural dimensions as important features of cultures, which vary between different cultures.
Models of culture are, for instance, important for {{/@|intercultural competence}}.
A cultural dimension that deserves the name describes an important aspect of a whole culture that is part of the culture and shapes the culture, especially in comparison to other cultures.
For the parent education course, however, the term culture shall be extended to include smaller groups up to {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idiocultures}}.
The term cultural dimension is thus made more flexible and may allow interesting new interpretations.

The model of culture offered here does not correspond exactly to any of the scientific models of culture, but that is not important.
The point is that you can offer your own cultural dimensions to suit your own needs.
A [[w:youth culture|youth culture]] can have a different demand for cultural dimensions than the cultures of adults. 
Your family cultures can also have unknown dimensions and your school culture may not even exist yet.
If your school does not have a school culture the {{/@|class council can family council|class council}} could possibly decide a class culture.
A class culture can also provide a lowest common denominator for a class and allow smaller groups to build a more specific {{/@|Idiocultural competence — personal culture and family culture|idioculture}} on top.

Less fundamental but also interesting are the [[w:Intercultural_competence#Typical_examples_of_cultural_differences|typical examples of cultural differences]] in the Wikipedia article about intercultural competence.

{{/Table 1}}
{{/Table 2}}
{{/Table 3}} &lt;!-- please do not fill table 3, pupils should be able to do some research here themselves --&gt; 


{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
What is missing in this table? Find your own cultural dimensions and insert them into the table.
* Is &quot;talkative or taciturn&quot; a cultural dimension?
* Is there a relationship between cultural dimensions and [[w:Trait theory|personality traits]]? 
}}

==== Test your youth culture ====

{{Rquote|right|The adolescents do neither conform with the so-called &quot;traditional&quot; values such as loyalty, sense of duty, etc.; nor have they fully set &quot;modern&quot; values in their place, which are supposedly more capable to support an individual self-actualization than the value orientation of older generations. The adolescents rather mix their own &quot;values cocktail&quot; from different values, which seem best suited for their individual plans for life.|[http://www.familienhandbuch.de/jugendforschung/jugend-heute/jugend-ohne-perspektive-alte-werte-und-neuer-generationenkonflikt Jugend ohne Perspektive? - &quot;Alte&quot; Werte und &quot;neuer&quot; Generationenkonflikt]|Mathias Albert}}

What is your youth culture? You can test your youth culture by extending the model of culture table with your own cultural dimensions, which apply to your own youth culture or youth cultures. You can then use the table as a questionnaire and use it to interview teenagers from your social environment.
A statistical analysis shows how your common youth culture looks like.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg| 
* How do you collect ideas for cultural dimensions best?
* How should the table be completed? Which information is needed on the respective cultural dimensions?
* How should the questionnaire be amended to allow the survey to be conducted without extensive explanations?
* Why could the youth culture be important for a parent education course?
}}

If the parent education course is meant to guide parents to better understand teenagers it can be important to explain the youth culture to those parents who do no yet have this understanding, particularly the aspects that are preferably criticized by parents.
A democratic education also means to respect the culture of others and to find compromises where possible.
Parents will possibly view some aspects of youth culture as a kind of [[w:counterculture|counter-culture]].

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Crystal_Clear_app_error.png|
This survey can be used as an exercise to rehearse techniques for surveys and evaluations.
The more important polls relate to families, education and mentoring.
As pupils you are, however, allowed to disagree with this view.
}}

==== Capitalism as a means to an end ====

{{Rquote|right|Especially from an economic perspective the insight has developed that growing material wealth in the developed countries above a certain level does not lead to increasing well-being.|Wissenschaftliche Bestandsaufnahme der Forschung zu &quot;Wohlbefinden von Eltern und Kindern&quot;|German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth}}

An error in the assessment of moral priorities, which in capitalism arises almost like an anti-pattern, is to assign the capitalist system a high priority and also to consider close personal relations and mutual support as an important priority, but to assign the common good only a lower priority.
A moral error that results from this perspective is that one would implicitly have to endorse a lower level of education of the general public in order to serve the purpose to attain and to preserve a capitalist advantage for one's chosen social environment. Trivially this is not a particularly moral position.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Japan road sign 206-L.svg|
* Where is the error in the assessment of moral priorities?
* Is the public interest more important than friends and acquaintances?
* Is the public interest more important than capitalism?
* If the error the evaluation as unchanging priorities?
}}

{{/@|Mentoring}} consequently constitutes insofar a higher moral level (or at least a refinement of moral evaluation) as the basis is a conscious decision that, while one doesn't have to promote a mentally disabled person to earn a medical degree, arbitrary third parties should have a right to a certain level of support.

Another important argumentation in relation to capitalism is that capitalism is a means to achieve an end.
If that means becomes and end by itself, as it can happen in a capitalist society, then the question of the actual purpose remains unanswered.
This open question is also evident in the behavior of capitalist organizations: The organizations respond to the orders of their customers, but do not always have own interests and goals beyond that. In that sense the efficient capitalist company is primarily controlled by external interests. 

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Blue_question_mark.svg|
* Is it a purpose of capitalism to serve the common good?
* What is [[w:Corporate Social Responsibility|Corporate Social Responsibility]]?
* What do parents know about Corporate Social Responsibility?
* Why is that important?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What to juggle with ==
To learn how to juggle, you will need three objects of suitable size, weight and hardness. Beanbags or hackey-sacks are optimal, but tennis balls or racquet balls and the like can fill the role in nicely. You may also wish to use mandarin oranges, rolled-up socks, newspaper balls or other similar objects instead.

== Where to juggle ==
The place where you juggle should be bright enough to allow you to see the balls clearly. Depending on the balls used, it may also be necessary to juggle in front on a bright wall (as is often the case with hackey-sacks). The place should be well ventilated and not too hot, but a direct breeze is ill-advised as it may make it harder to throw the balls accurately. It should also be tall enough to allow you to juggle freely without hitting the ceiling.

== Position ==
Stand up in a comfortable position in the middle of your juggling area and begin with step one!

      <comment>From [[Juggling]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The three ball cascade is the basic juggling style. If you have not done any juggling before this is what you should start with. You should NOT try doing a shower(where all the balls move in a circle with all the balls moving in the same direction. aka clockwise or counter-clockwise) until much further along in your juggling practice.

== Step one ==
Use one ball for this step. Take a ball in one hand. Now throw it to the other hand. The throwing hand should move in a semi-circle before releasing the ball in order to make the ball fly almost vertically. This is called a &quot;scoop&quot; and will help a lot in further steps.

You should aim to throw the ball in such a way that it falls directly into the other hand. Having to move the catching hand too much is not a good sign. The ball should travel in an arc, its top around the height of your eyes.

Do not look at the ball as it falls. You have to learn to control yourself and catch the ball without looking at it. If you do not learn to do so now, further steps will become very hard. Throw the ball softly and try and keep the flow of the throwing smooth.

Do not underestimate this step, as it is possibly the most important. Not knowing how to throw the balls nicely will result in trouble in the following steps.

== Step two ==
You will need two balls for this step. Take one ball in each hand and throw it directly upwards. Catch each ball with the hand that threw it. Alternate which ball you throw such that when the left ball is at the top of the arc, you throw the right ball and when the right is at the top, you throw the left one.

This process will help you achieve good rhythm for later. Apply the principles from step one - throwing the ball so you don't need to move the catching hand much, looking upwards instead of at the balls etc.

Try and make this step as automatic as possible. Listen to a few songs while performing it and throwing the balls to the rhythm. Try and listen to songs with different rhythm. Fast, slow, whichever you like.

== Step three ==
This is the step that makes what you are doing actually look like juggling. Take a ball in each hand. Now throw one ball to the other hand as in step one. When the ball is at the top of the arc (as in step two), throw the other ball to the first hand. The second ball should travel underneath the first one.

This step may seem a bit daunting, but it is just a combination of steps one and two. When practicing this step, you should train both hands equally. First, throw the left ball first and the right ball second. Then, throw the right ball first and the left ball second. After a while, you should be able to do this in a nice, circling movement.

Never be afraid of going back to previous steps just to recapture the rhythm or throw more accurately.

== Step four ==
When performing this step, you are actually already juggling. Take two balls in one hand and one ball in the other. Always begin with the hand with two balls. Repeat what you have been doing in step three, but when the second ball is at the top of the arc, throw the third ball to the opposite hand.

When you have done this step, you have made the first juggling circle. Actual juggling is just a series of these steps. Try and repeat these three passes until you feel you have perfected them. Throw the balls accurately, remember the rhythm when throwing and always try and catch the balls. It isn't a problem if they fall on the ground, but you need to be able to do at least three circles (with pauses after each circle) without them falling down before proceeding to step five.

Remember to practice this step with both hands equally. Left-right-left, then right-left-right. Music might help you with rhythm.

This step is the forerunner to juggling. As such, you might feel tempted to pass it quickly, but you should resist the urge and repeat it until you are comfortable with it.

== Step five ==
This is it, the last step of the way! This is the breakthrough step and the time needed to get the grip of it varies greatly from person to person. If you have thoroughly practiced the previous steps, however, it shouldn't be a problem.

Repeat step four, but instead of catching the third ball as it falls down, throw the first ball again and proceed right into the next circle. When you first do it, you might get caught off balance and you will drop all the balls. Don't worry, it's natural at this point! Repeat step four again. When you are comfortable, try and do two circles without pausing.

As you learn this step, you will realize the movements are becoming more and more natural. Feel the flow of the balls as they soar through the air. Enjoy yourself! You now know how to juggle!

== Troubleshooting ==
=== I cannot do more than 3 (or 4 or 5 etc.) throws ===
This is probably a mental problem. If this is happening to you, you need to make a point of throwing your balls whether or not you think you can catch them. Even if you drop them, throwing the balls will help you get past this mental block.

=== I throw my balls forward ===
(and in turn have to walk forward to keep up)

This is a common problem and can probably be fixed by juggling while facing a wall just close enough that you can extend your arms.

=== My balls collide in mid-air ===
To fix this problem you will have to work on your throws. Go back to step one and make sure you throw the ball correctly. Make sure that you are &quot;scooping&quot; your throws so that the ball flies almost completely vertically.

=== I still can't juggle. ===
Try this:  http://www.alightfingers.com/tuition/  This is a more gradual and supportive version of the above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">After you have practiced the three ball cascade enough that you can do it comfortably, you are ready to learn your first juggling trick.

== Over the Top ==
The first trick that most people learn is &quot;over the top&quot;. This trick is just what it sounds like, instead of the normal cascade throw in which the ball travels under the previous one, you throw a ball over the top of the other one.

To begin with, practice the over the top throw with only one ball. Simply take the ball in your hand and &quot;scoop&quot; in a half circle towards the outside instead of the inside. When doing this you will probably want to move your hand further to the outside in order to make the throw more horizontal. When doing this you should throw the ball all the way from one side to the other whereas in the cascade you throw them from the middle to the outside.

Once you are comfortable with this try working it into a three ball cascade. Do not worry about it falling. Just throw it over the top of the other balls and resume your cascade.

== Jugglers' Tennis ==
Before you learn this trick you need to know &quot;over the top&quot;.

When doing &quot;juggler's tennis&quot; it may help if you have one different colored ball but it is definitely not necessary. The jugglers' tennis is when you do an &quot;over the top&quot; over third throw such that the same ball goes over the top every time you throw it. If you have a ball that is a different color than the other two that should be the one that goes over the top. This will help you to remember which ball you are supposed to throw over the top and lets you concentrate more on the technique.

== Half Shower ==
Before learning this trick you need to know &quot;over the top&quot;. &quot;jugglers' tennis&quot; will help but is not required.

In the &quot;half shower&quot; you throw ever other ball over the top such that the same hand always makes this throw. If you thoroughly practiced &quot;over the top&quot; and &quot;jugglers' tennis&quot; this should be fairly easy.

== Reverse Cascade ==
Before learning this trick you need to know all previous &quot;over the top&quot; tricks.

This trick is basically a cascade where you throw every ball over the top of the others. It is not, however, that simple. You see if you throw every ball with the over the top throw, you will have to continually throw them higher and higher until you cannot keep up. Instead, you must make your throws go from the outside to the middle. This will be hard at first but with practice will gradually become easier.

As soon as you have the new throw down you will want to work it into the cascade. You may have been starting with a normal cascade and working your way into the trick before, but with the reverse cascade you will have to go straight into it. You may not get it at first but keep at it. You will get it eventually and it is really fun once you do.

:{{Del}} Let's see... &quot;A possible definition of a miracle is that a miracle is something that negates a holon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_%28philosophy%29)&quot;. Even if we assumed it makes sense to use a Wikipedia reference like this, [[w:Holon (philosophy)]] has no mention of miracles. Then we have &quot;Many ideas behind the theories presented here are taken from A Course In Miracles&quot;, which clearly suggests both original research and annotations on a parent book. Conclusion: non-salvageable OR.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 

:{{Del}} I agree with the arguments above.  Removing the OR would remove all the text from the book, there is nothing to be saved. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:09, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

::{{Comment}} I just noticed the comment by the author on its discussion page, in which he states: &quot;This is a metaphorical book. Please do not take it too literally, that would not be appropriate. This book is an exercise, a poem.&quot;  I would say that means it is not a textbook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will show two ways of making a program that can draw a Mandelbrot set where the iterations are towards ∞: a program where all is done from the ground, but which does nothing more than drawing a single picture, and a program where you can do all you desire (zoom, alter colouring and render as file), but where these facilities are handed over to another program, namely ''Ultra Fractal''.

==A single picture==

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictcomp1.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the Mandelbrot set for &lt;math&gt;z^2 + 0.009/z + c&lt;/math&gt;]]Let us make a program that is as simple as possible: it draws a single picture, and does nothing more (when it has done its work it closes). It was originally written in assembly language, but here we write it in pseudo-code. It consists of two parts: the drawing procedure and the colour scale.

We draw a section of the Mandelbrot set for the family &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^2 + \frac{p}{z} + c \,&lt;/math&gt;, for p = 0.009. We let the size of the window be 800x600 pixels, and we imagine that the section has its lower left corner in the point with coordinates (ax, ay) and that is has width h. We have &lt;math&gt;f'(z) = 2z - \frac{p}{z^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;, so that the finite critical point we need, is solution to the equation &lt;math&gt;z^3 = p/2&lt;/math&gt;. We choose the real solution cri = &lt;math&gt;(p/2)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''The drawing procedure'''

:p = 0.009
:cri = &lt;math&gt;(p/2)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
:r = 1.0E200 (square of the bail-out radius)
:u = log(log(r))
:v = 1/log(2) (2 is the degree of the rational function)
:ax = -0.7028233689263 (x-coordinate of lower left corner)
:ay = 0.1142331238418  (y-coordinate of lower left corner)
:h = 0.0092906805859 (width of the section)
:g = h / 800
:m = 850 (maximum iteration number)
:thick = h * 0.0005 (thickness of the boundary)
:dens = 24.9 (density of the colours)
:disp = 432.0 (displacement of the colour scale)

for i = 0 to 799 do
:begin
::cx = ax + i * g (x-coordinate of pixel (i, j))
::for j = 0 to 599 do
:::begin
::::cy = ay + j * g (y-coordinate of pixel (i, j))
::::x = cri
::::y = 0
::::xd = 0
::::yd = 0
::::f = 0
::::n = 0
::::while (n &lt; m) and (f &lt; r) do
:::::begin
::::::n = n + 1
::::::x1 = x * x - y * y
::::::y1 = 2 * x * y
::::::f = x * x + y * y
::::::x2 = 2 * x - p * x1 / (f * f)
::::::y2 = 2 * y + p * y1 / (f * f)
::::::temp = xd
::::::xd = x2 * xd - y2 * yd + 1
::::::yd = x2 * yd + y2 * temp
::::::fd = xd * xd + yd * yd
::::::x = x1 + p * x / f + cx
::::::y = y1 - p * y / f + cy
::::::f = x * x + y * y
:::::end
::::if (n = m) or (log(f) * sqrt(f) &lt; thick * sqrt(fd)) then
:::::setpixel(i, 599 - j, 0)
::::else
:::::begin
::::::s = n - v * (log(log(f)) - u)
::::::n = round(dens * s + disp) mod 720
::::::col = paletteRGB(col1[n], col2[n], col3[n])
::::::setpixel(i, 599 - j, col)
:::::end
:::end
:end

'''Explanation'''

We have set &lt;math&gt;c = cx + icy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z' = xd + iyd&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x1 + iy1 = (x + iy)^2&lt;/math&gt;, and we have used that &lt;math&gt;1/z = z^-/|z|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The successive calculation of the derivative ''z''' is &lt;math&gt;xd + iyd = (x2 + iy2) * (xd + iyd) + 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x2 + iy2 = 2 * (x + iy) - p * (x1 - iy1) / (f * f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;. The next point in the iteration is &lt;math&gt;x + iy = (x1 + iy1) + p * (x - iy) / f + (cx + icy)&lt;/math&gt;. The distance function is

:''log(&amp;#8730;f)*&amp;#8730;f/&amp;#8730;fd &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(= log(f)*&amp;#8730;f/(2*&amp;#8730;fd))''

for the last ''z''-value, here &lt;math&gt;f = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;fd = xd^2 + yd^2&lt;/math&gt;. The number in the interval [0, 1[ to be subtracted from the iteration number (in order to get the real iteration number), is &lt;math&gt;log(log(|z|)/log(r))/log(2) = v * (log(log(f)) - u)&lt;/math&gt;, for the last ''z'', here &lt;math&gt;v = 1/log(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u = log(log(r))&lt;/math&gt;.

paletteRGB(r, g, b) is the integer indexing the colour with RGB-values (r, g, b), 0 gives black. col, col2 and col3 are the arrays from 0 to 719 of integers from 0 to 255 constructed in the next section.

'''The colour scale'''

A colour is immediately (in the computer) given by its composition of the three primary colours red, green and blue, and their shares are measured in whole numbers between 0 and 255. This triple of numbers is the set of RGB values of the colour. The colours correspond accordingly to the entire points in a cube with side length 256, and we construct our cyclic colour scala by going regularly along an ellipse in this cube. An ellipse in the space is determined by:

::a centre with coordinates ''(a, b, c)''
::a major axe ''rmaj'' and a minor axe ''rmin''
::two angles angle ''g'' and ''h'' determining the direction of the plane of the ellipse
::an angle ''q'' determining the direction of the ellipse in this plane

:u = cos(g * pi / 180) * cos(h * pi / 180) {(u,v,w) is a unit vector orthogonal to the plane}
:v = cos(g * pi / 180) * sin(h * pi / 180)
:w = sin(g * pi / 180)
:x = -a {(x,y,z) is a vector ''in'' the plane}
:y = -b
:z = a * u / w + b * v / w
:e = sqrt(sqr(x) + sqr(y) + sqr(z))
:x1 = x / e {the unit vector corresponding to (x,y,z)}
:y1 = y / e
:z1 = z / e
:x2 = v * z1 - w * y1 {the unit vector in the plane orthogonal to (x1,y1,z1)}
:y2 = w * x1 - u * z1
:z2 = u * y1 - v * x1
:e = cos(q * pi / 180)
:f = sin(q * pi / 180)
:x1 = e * x1 + f * x2 {the unit vector in the plane in the direction of the angle q}
:y1 = e * y1 + f * y2
:z1 = e * z1 + f * z2
:x2 = v * z1 - w * y1 {the unit vector in the plane orthogonal to this direction}
:y2 = w * x1 - u * z1
:z2 = u * y1 - v * x1
:for i = 0 to 719 do
::begin
:::e = rmaj * cos(i * pi / 360)
:::f = rmin * sin(i * pi / 360)
:::col1[i] = round(a + e * x1 + f * x2) {the three coordinates of the point on the ellipse}
:::col2[i] = round(b + e * y1 + f * y2)
:::col3[i] = round(c + e * z1 + f * z2)
::end

In the picture we have: (a, b, c) = (176, 176, 176), rmaj = rmin = 88, g = 146, h = -32, q = 0.

==Ultra Fractal==

Ultra Fractal is a program for drawing fractals where the user to a great extent can write his own formula programs and where the main program performs all that is common for all the fractal procedures, that is, the procedure of going from pixel to pixel, zooming, colouring, production of a large picture as a file. Your effort is reduced to a minimum, and apart from pictures that cannot be drawn regularly from pixel to pixel - attractors and landscapes, for instance - you can do all you desire: non-complex functions, quaternions, ... You can operate directly with complex numbers.

First you should download a free trial-version of the program and learn how it works. Then you should see the article [http://www.juliasets.dk/UFP.htm Make attractive pictures of Mandelbrot and Julia sets with Ultra Fractal], and download the (free) programs from this site to be run with Ultra Fractal.

For the drawing two programs have to be combined: a formula program and a colouring program. In the formula program is a section called ''loop'', and when this loop has done its work, the number of iterations and the last value of the complex number ''z'' are transferred to the colouring program, which calculates the colour from these two numbers. However, Ultra fractal is designed to &quot;all&quot; types of fractals, and unfortunately the Julia and Mandelbrot sets do not quite fit into this form: for iterations towards cycles, the iteration has to be continued in order to find the order and the attraction of the cycle, and it is not the last value of ''z'' in the sequence we do use for the colour. Therefore we replace this loop by a fictive loop (which only runs one time) and perform all the operations in the section ''init''. This implies that we cannot use the default colouring program of Ultra Fractal, we must write a new colouring program.

Another thing you must be aware of, is that in Ultra Fractal the norm |z| of the complex number z is the '''square''' of its length: |z| = &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictcomp2.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the Mandelbrot set for &lt;math&gt;z^2/2 + 0.26*z^4 + c&lt;/math&gt;]]We will show a program that draws the Mandelbrot set for the family &lt;math&gt;f(z) + c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial whose first two terms are zero, so that it begins with &lt;math&gt;z^2&lt;/math&gt; or a larger power of ''z'', because we then can take 0 as the finite critical point.

The two programs can be copied and inserted in an empty formula and colouring document, respectively. We have inserted the polynomial &lt;math&gt;z^2/2 + p*z^4 + c&lt;/math&gt; of degree 4, where p is a real parameter. The picture shows a section of the Mandelbrot set for p = 0.26.

'''The formula program'''

::float p = 0.26  ;parameter

'''Explanation'''

We have set the square of the radius r of the bail-out circle to &lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, and set the thickness of the boundary to &quot;thick/(1000 * #magn)&quot;, so that it becomes thinner when we zoom in.

We have calculated the derivative &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(f(z+h) - f(z))/h&lt;/math&gt; for a small number h, namely &quot;h = 1/(1500*#magn*width)&quot;, where &quot;width&quot; is the width of the picture. The default value is the width of the window in pixels (here set to 640), but if you draw a large picture, you should enter the width of this.

The successive calculation of the derivative &lt;math&gt;z'_{k+1} = f'(z_k)z'_k + 1&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;zd = (f(z+h) - f(z)) * zd / h + 1&quot;. The next iteration &lt;math&gt;z_{k+1} = f(z_k) + c&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;z = f(z) + #pixel&quot;. The square of the distance estimation &lt;math&gt;log|z_k| * |z_k| / |z'_k|&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;sqr(log(|z|)) * |z| / |zd|&quot;. The number to be subtracted from the iteration number &lt;math&gt;log(log(|z_k|)/log(r))/log(deg)&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;v * (log(log(|z|)) - u)&quot;, where &quot;v = 1/log(deg)&quot; and &quot;u = log(log(r))&quot;.

The final complex number ''z'' (to be transferred to the colouring program), which here actually is real, is set to -1, when the point belongs to the Mandelbrot set or to the boundary, otherwise it is set to the real iteration number. It is transferred to the colouring program, which we have called ''Gradient'', as #z, and is here set equal to the real number s. When s is negative the colour is set to &quot;#solid&quot;, otherwise we multiply s by a number &quot;dens&quot; determining the density, and add to this number a number &quot;disp&quot; determining the displacement of the scale, and as we want this displacement to be a per cent, we divide the result by 100: &quot;u = (dens * s + disp) / 100&quot;. In Ultra Fractal the colours of the cyclic colour scales are indexed by the real numbers in the interval [0, 1[, and we let this number, &quot;#index&quot;, be the non-integral part of the number u: &quot;#index = u - trunc(u)&quot;.

::float s = real(#z)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a simple XQuery program that will extract all the OWL classes from an OWL file that is coded using RDF.

== Method ==
We will start by just selecting all the classes in the file that have an name.  In this example the names are stored in the rdf:ID attribute of the class like the following:

   &lt;owl:Class rdf:ID=&quot;Wine&quot;&gt;

For our example we will use the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/wine.rdf wine ontology] Used in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/ W3C OWL Guide]:

Our XQuery will specifically get all the RDF tags with the &quot;owl:Class&quot; element in the file.

Here is a simple XQuery that returns all the Classes in the wine ontology.  To you this script you can load it into a collection such as
/db/apps/owl/views/classes.xq and the RDF data files can be loaded into /db/apps/owl/data

/db/apps/owl/views/classes.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

declare namespace xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;
declare namespace rdfs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&quot;;
declare namespace rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;
declare namespace owl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $title := 'List of OWL Classes'

let $data-collection := '/db/apps/owl/data'
let $file := request:get-parameter('file', 'wine.rdf')
let $file-path := concat($data-collection, '/', $file)

(: we only want classes that have an ID.  Other classes are not named classes. :)
let $classes := doc($file-path)//owl:Class[@rdf:ID]

(: sort the list :)
let $ordered-classes :=
   for $class in $classes
   order by $class/@rdf:ID
   return $class

return
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;{$title}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;file&gt;File Path: {$file-path}&lt;/file&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Number of Classes = {count($classes)}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
      {for $class in $ordered-classes
         let $class-name := string($class/@rdf:ID)
         return
           &lt;li&gt;{$class-name}&lt;/li&gt;
      }
      &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Results ==

The results will be an HTML file with a ordered list:

&lt;pre&gt;
File Path: /db/org/syntactica/apps/owl/data/wine.rdf

Number of Classes = 74

   1. AlsatianWine
   2. AmericanWine
   3. Anjou
   4. Beaujolais
   5. Bordeaux
   6. Burgundy
   7. CabernetFranc
   8. CabernetSauvignon
   9. CaliforniaWine
  10. Chardonnay
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Other Tools ==
There are several other tools for working with OWL files that are very useful.  One is to list all of the properties in an OWL file or list all the properties of a class.  These reports can then be used to load the class or property into an XForms application for editing/versioning/workflow and approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Joypads are the SNES' means of input from the user. There can be up to four connected to the system, and there's support for special controllers, too ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES_Mouse mouse], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Scope Super Scope], etc).

'' '''NOTE''': This tutorial is a work-in-progress. I'm still relatively new to the SNES, so please feel free to correct any errors in this document.''

=Joypad Registers=

To start off, we'll list the registers that we're going to use:

{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|''Size''||''Address''||''Description''
|-
|Byte|| $4200|| Counter Enable
|-
|Byte|| $4212|| Status Register
|-
|Word|| $4218|| Joypad #1 Status
|-
|Word|| $421a|| Joypad #2 Status
|-
|Word|| $421c|| Joypad #3 Status
|-
|Word|| $421e|| Joypad #4 Status
|-
|Byte|| $4016|| Joypad #1 Old-Style Status
|-
|Byte|| $4017|| Joypad #2 Old-Style Status
|-
|}

Now, let's look at them in a bit more depth:

'''$4200 - Counter Enable'''
''n-vh---j''

This register is most likely a bit familiar to you. If you've done any prior SNES coding, you'll recognize that you've probably used this register to enable a VSync interrupt. For joypad input, we must make sure bit 0 (&quot;j&quot;) is set. This tells the SNES that we will be polling the other joypad registers.

'''$4212 - SNES Status Register'''
''vh-----j''

This register is used to see if certain data is ready to be polled from the SNES. In this case, we only care about bit 0 (&quot;j&quot;). If we poll $4212 and bit 0 is set, then we know that the other SNES joypad registers will contain relevant data. It's usually not so bad if this step is left out, though. In the algorithm I'll be showing later, this check is skipped, but this explanation still exists for completeness.

'''$4218/9 through $421e/f - Joypad Status Registers'''
''hi:bystudlr lo:axlriiii''

These are 16-bit registers that return the button and/or type states for each joypad connected to the SNES. $4218 and $4219 contain joypad 1's data, and joypad 2, 3, and 4 follow. The bits are laid out like this:

{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|'''Bit(s)'''||'''Description'''
|-
|''$4219/b/d/f''||''(hi)''
|-
|b||B Button
|-
|y||Y Button
|-
|s||Select Button
|-
|t||Start Button
|-
|u||Up D-Pad Button
|-
|d||Down D-Pad Button
|-
|l||Left D-Pad Button
|-
|r||Right D-Pad Button
|-

|''$4218/a/c/e''||''(lo)''
|-
|a||A Button
|-
|x||X Button
|-
|l||L Button
|-
|r||R Button
|-
|iiii||Controller Type ID
|-
|}

Most of these are quite self-explanatory. If a corresponding button's bit is set, then that button is pressed. The only semi-confusing part of this is the mysterious &quot;iiii&quot; bits - these determine which kind of controller is connected to the port. Basically, if they read 0000, then it's a standard SNES controller. Otherwise, it's a custom controller type or corrupted data.

'''$4016 and $4017 - Joypad 1 and 2 Old-Style Status'''

For these, you'll notice I left out the specific bits of each register. Basically, these work just like reading states from NES. Because of this, I think it's redundant to include that information here, except that bit 0 of $4200 must be clear to do use them this way. These registers can still be useful, though. If you write 0 to $4016, then these two registers can be used to check if joypads 1 and 2 are connected. After writing the 0 (and you only need to write to $4016, not both), reading from the registers will return 0 if not connected, and something else if connected.

You may have received a card paper handout [[:File:MakerFairePedia.pdf|(pdf)]] for taking notes like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #f9f9f9; line-height: 1.1em;&quot;&gt;
:MakerFairePedia Form: fill in and return to the Wikimedia booth and/or &lt;tt&gt;[[MakerFairePedia|httр://3.ly/makerfairepedia]]&lt;/tt&gt;



:Exhibit name ___________________________ Your name (optional) ____________________________

:Description: (write a description of the exhibit as objectively, without bias or opinion, as possible)






:Maker(s): (write the names and contact information of the Maker(s) here)




:Impressions: (What did you like best about the exhibit?)




:External links: (any URLs about the exhibit)



&lt;/div&gt;


Check the list of exhibits already in [[MakerFairePedia]] and use the card to take notes about a new exhibit.  Or, review an article for an exhibit you want to write about and see if it's as complete as you want it to be.  Then use the card to take notes so you can use the button on [[MakerFairePedia]] to create or edit an existing exhibit's article.

{{tl|Music}} renders Western music notation of various types into Wikibooks and improves cross-browser support for music symbols.

==Accidentals==
The template correctly renders Unicode sharps ({{music|sharp}}), flats ({{music|flat}}), and natural signs ({{music|natural}}) in Internet Explorer which would otherwise display empty squares unless a full Unicode font is chosen in its Preferences. The choice of fonts also improves the rendering in other browsers on [[Microsoft Windows]] such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]. See the tables below to compare the results in your current browser. The template makes use of SVG to display double flat ({{music|doubleflat}}), double sharp ({{music|doublesharp}}), and microtonal signs since the corresponding Unicode characters are not widely supported.

Some browsers support &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x2669;&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;#x2669;) and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x266a;&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;#x266a;) for quarter and eighth notes, but since the display is often ugly and does not match any of the other (non-supported) notes and rests, this template does not use these characters.

;Sample text
In place of the single whole note ({{music|semibreve}}), Chopin writes {{music|eighthrest}} {{music|halfnote}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|eighth}}, completely changing the profile of the music.

==Clefs==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Symbol
! style=&quot;width:16em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;text 
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;result
|-
! Treble&lt;br/&gt;clef
| {{tlx|music|treble}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|trebleclef}} || {{music|trebleclef}}
|-
! G-clef
| {{tlx|music|gclef}} || {{music|gclef}}
|-
! Alto&lt;br/&gt;clef
| {{tlx|music|alto}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|altoclef}} || {{music|altoclef}}
|-
! Tenor&lt;br/&gt;clef
| {{tlx|music|tenor}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|tenorclef}} || {{music|tenorclef}}
|-
! C-clef
| {{tlx|music|cclef}}  || {{music|cclef}}
|-
! Bass&lt;br/&gt;clef
| {{tlx|music|bass}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|bassclef}}  || {{music|bassclef}}
|-
! F-clef
| {{tlx|music|fclef}}  || {{music|fclef}}
|}

Note that there is no graphical distinction between treble clef and G-clef; alto clef, tenor clef and C-clef; bass clef and F-clef. The names preserve a difference in meaning and make the caption text (for screen readers) different.

== Time signatures ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Symbol
! style=&quot;width:16em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;text 
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;result
|-
! common-time
| {{tlx|music|common-time}} || {{music|common-time}}
|-
! cut-time
| {{tlx|music|cut-time}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|alle-breve}} || {{music|cut-time}}
|}

==Scale degrees==
Scale degrees are often represented as Arabic numerals with a hat on them and thus the root of a scale is &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|1}}&lt;/sub&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Scale degree
! style=&quot;width:16em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;text 
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;result
|-
! 1
| {{tlx|music|scale|1}} || {{music|scale|1}}
|-
! 2
| {{tlx|music|scale|2}} || {{music|scale|2}}
|-
! 3
| {{tlx|music|scale|3}} || {{music|scale|3}}
|-
! 4
| {{tlx|music|scale|4}} || {{music|scale|4}}
|-
! 5
| {{tlx|music|scale|5}} || {{music|scale|5}}
|-
! 6
| {{tlx|music|scale|6}} || {{music|scale|6}}
|-
! 7
| {{tlx|music|scale|7}} || {{music|scale|7}}
|-
! 8
| {{tlx|music|scale|8}} || {{music|scale|8}}
|-
! 9
| {{tlx|music|scale|9}} || {{music|scale|9}}
|}

;Sample text
A descending tetrachord could be written as &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|4}}&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|3}}&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|1}}&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Chord symbols==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! style=&quot;width:9em;&quot; | Chord
! style=&quot;width:16em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;text 
! style=&quot;width:6em;&quot; | Template&lt;br/&gt;result
|-
! Diminished
| {{tlx|music|dim}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|dimdeg}} || {{music|dim}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{music|dimdeg}}
|-
! Half-diminished
| {{tlx|music|halfdim}}&lt;br/&gt;''or'' {{tlx|music|dimslash}} || {{music|halfdim}}
|}

;Sample text
vii{{music|dim}} becomes vii{{music|dimslash}} in B{{music|flat}} minor by raising the G{{music|b}} to G{{music|natural}}

==Processes and Tasks==
'''Process''' is a running user space program. Kernel can start a process with function {{Linux ident|do_execve}}. 
Processes occupy system resources, like memory, CPU time. System calls {{Linux ident|sys_fork}} and {{Linux ident|sys_execve}} are used to create new processes from user space. The process exit with an {{Linux ident|sys_exit}} system call.

'''How are the process handled within the kernel?'''

      <comment>Robot: Cosmetic changes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Beside the obvious weight lifting aspect, some regard a proper diet to be as, if not more important. A traditional bodybuilder's diet will always include a high amount of ''Protein'' (current research suggests 25-30% of calorie intake [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15107010&amp;dopt=Abstract]), Carbohydrates, usually complex (rather than simple sugars) to provide them with energy to complete their workout, and go about their daily lives. Lastly, fats. The misconception about fats is that &quot;all fats&quot; make you gain body fat, whilst this is not true. There are three types of fatty acids: saturated, trans, and unsaturated. They each contain 9 calories per gram, whilst Carbohydrates and Protein have 4 calories per gram.

* Saturated fats: They are definable because they are solids at room temperature, like the fat on bacon.
* Unsaturated fats: These are &quot;useful&quot; fats that can be broken down into subcategories monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, and include the popular Omega 3 &amp; 6 fats. They are usually found in liquid form, particularly in fish. They are essential to every diet.
* Trans-fats: These are so named due to how they look structurally. From a chemistry perspective, there is a cis formation and a trans formation for a fatty acid chain. This trans formation is produced when hydrogen is added to an unsaturated fat (an oil) which causes it to solidify. These fats are solid at room temperature and are generally found in fried foods, some margarines, processed red meats, and processed foods of all types. They are listed on food labels as 'partially hydrogenated' oil. They are used by many fast food chains because they don't smoke when heated. They are generally considered a health hazard.

Depending on whether a bodybuilder is &quot;'''cutting'''&quot; or &quot;'''bulking'''&quot;, they will either try to burn more calories than they consume, or, if bulking, consume more &quot;useful&quot; calories (that is, protein) than they burn.

== Crime Fighting in The United States ==

=== Overview of ''The System'' ===
Crime Fighting is often seen as the main mission of law enforcement professionals. Professional Crime Fighting Science is often called ''Criminal Justice''. Criminal Justice is looked at as a system. That system includes the police, courts and corrections. The police deal with crime, crime control, arrest and bookings. The courts deal with charging the defendants. The courts determine if the suspect has committed a misdemeanor, an ordinance violation, or a felony. It may file an information or an indictment. An arrest warrant may be issued by the court in order that the police may arrest a suspect. 

There are a variety of pretrial stages that a defendant may go through. He may have an initial appearance, an arraignment, bail is set, and a preliminary hearing may occur. The defendant may have a bench trial or a jury trial. They may participate in plea bargaining or simply plead guilty and receive their sentence. 

The defendant then becomes part of the correctional system where he may receive probation, incarceration, or parole. There are a number of other alternative sentences that he may receive. 

=== Paradigms ===
There are two basic models of the criminal justice system. The first, the Crime Control Model, reflects traditional conservative values. In this model the control of criminal behavior is the most important function of criminal justice.

The second, the Due Process Model, embodies traditional liberal values. In this model, the principal goal of criminal justice is at least as much to protect the innocent as it is to convict the guilty.

=== The Media ===
The media tends to portray crime and criminality in an often inaccurate fashion.  Alarmist and extravagant stories tend to increase viewer ratings, while concise and accurate statistics tend to bore people to tears.  One must remember that what the media shows is not always the truth, but it is certainly entertainment and information.  The problem is, the media actually influences the way that the public views crime and the response to crime.

== ''Criminal Justice'' as Institution of Social Control ==
The majority of Americans believe that criminal justice involves fighting crime and that law enforcement is the only institution with that responsibility. Identify as many institutions as you can that are involved in the societal effort of social control. Use your word processor to create a list of these institutions.  Identify how each of these agencies helps to fight crime.  

Once you have created a word processed document that lists out institutions of social control and how they help to fight against crime, you are ready to be exposed to some new concepts.  Institutions of Social Control use various definitions to express their perception of and reaction to crime.  From these definitions, we derive our definitions of crime.  There are social definitions of crime and there are legal definition of crime. 

An example social definition of crime is behavior that violates the norms of society—or, more simply, antisocial behavior.  It is not the behavior that defines the crime; it is society's reaction toward that behavior that defines it as a crime.  The legal definition of crime is established by official action from a legislative group such as Congress, a state Legislature, or a Municipal Council.  The legal definition of crime can be summed up as ''the intentional violation of the criminal law or penal code, committed without defense or excuse and penalized by the state''.  A more comprehensive definition of crime can be found in the Core Vocabulary For Criminal Justice Professionals (Core Vocabulary For Criminal Justice Professionals, Stough, 2005).  

=== Crime Is An Elementary Issue ===
Now that the definitions of crime have been discussed, the essential elements 
of a crime come to hand.  What are the elements of a crime?  How are they defined?  For a crime to have occurred the following seven essential elements must be present:  

: *Actus Reus 
: *Mens Rea 
: *Harm 
: *Causation 
: *Concurrence
: *Legality
: *Punishment    

In more advanced Crime Fighting Science courses, such as CRIJ 1310 [Fundamentals of Criminal Law], I present other elements, until you have learned all twelve.  For now, though, these seven elements will suffice.

=== Getting Out From Under It All ===
Having informed the you of the seven essential elements of a crime, this conversation now turns to a discussion of Legal defenses for criminal responsibility.  Legal defenses for criminal culpability include age, insanity, mental defect, irresistible-impulse, entrapment, necessity, and others. In some cases, criminal behavior is defined in terms such as ''mala in sel'', and ''mala prohibita''.  That is, they are evil acts in and of themselves, or they are behavior that society simply does not wish to experience.  

== Measuring Up... And Down ==
Going hand in hand with this discussion of what crime is and how one can defend against criminal culpability, is the issue of the amount of crime that is actually occurring.  The measurement of crime is always crucial for the criminal justice professional.  Let us take a moment to consider crime statistics.  Statistics are numbers.  They are a way to simply complex observations into clear, numeric and graphic representations that can be easily interpreted by an audience.  Crime Statistics are numeric and graphical representations of the amounts and types of crimes that have, are, and will in the future probably occur.  There are many official agencies, bureaus, and organizations who spend their days and nights constructing huge data sets, statistical reports, and publications that are based on those reports, all for the express purpose of informing us about crime and its characteristics in our society.  Unfortunately, however, not all crimes are accounted for in those statistical reports.  Why is that?  

=== Dark Shadows And The Crime That Hide In Them ===
The ''&quot;Dark Figure of Crime&quot;'' explains this problem.  The Dark Figure of Crime is the amount of criminal behavior that goes unreported or undetected by Society, the Criminal Justice System, and those who are responsible for collecting and analyzing crime statistics.  The collection, use, and reporting of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Report's [UCR] crime data demonstrates the United States' attempt to resolve the issue of ''The Dark Figure''.  Incentives, Fines, Penalties, and the use of specially trained Crime Statisticians encourage compliance with the rules and regulations of the Uniform Crime Reporting System as outlined by the [http://web.archive.org/20050325205547/www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf Federal Bureau of Investigations Uniform Crime Reporting System Handbook].  [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm Crime Rates] are defined with some easily understood examples.  The [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm National Incident-based Reporting System (NIBRS)] provides the methodology and methods for recording and reporting crime data to the Government of The United States.  The NIBRS is a part of the [http://www.fbi.gov Federal Bureau of Investigations].  

Can you explain how crime statistics are gathered and used?  Why is it important for you to learn how to gather and use crime statistics?  The answers to these questions often point to future career success in criminal justice.   

=== Casting Light Into The Shadows ===
Crime happens every day 50% of people live and die.
One important tool that is used in filling in the gaps made by the Dark Figure of Crime is the [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCVS/ National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)]. This is a source of crime statistics based on interviews in which respondents are asked whether they have been victims of any of the FBI’s [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm Index Offenses] or other crimes during the past six months. The NCVS is a great way to fill the blank spots caused by the Dark Figure of Crime because it provides citizens with a way to report crimes which they would not otherwise have reported.  Self-reporting surveys useful alternatives methods of filling the Dark Figure's void, augmenting the Official Reporting Systems used by Crime Fighting Agencies across America.

== Concluding With Fear ==
Well, I am going to bring this particular chapter to an end with a discussion of the cost of crime from a little bit different perspective.  Fear of crime and the characteristics of the victims of crime are weighed heavier in this discussion.  The general concept is that more than money is at issue when one is examining the concept of Costs of Crime.  

Being victimized by crime leaves people feeling vulnerable, invaded, and at a loss for words fit to describe the hurt caused by such a violent taking of ''something'' from them.  Victims seldom feel safe in their homes after being victimized.  For that matter, they do not feel safe ''out of their homes'' either.  Stereos and cars and refrigerators can be replaced.  However, virginity, sense of self worth, and ability to trust are almost always impossible to replace.  That is where the real cost of crime is measured.  Or at least, that is how I see things.  

What do you think?  What should be included in a discussion of the costs of crime?  Write down a list of the items that you would use to measure the costs of crime.  Use your word processor to develop this list, so that you can send me a copy when you are finished with it.  

Meanwhile, I am finished with this particular lecture.  I hope that you have gained something from reading this material.  It is my goal to help you to learn about Crime Fighting from the perspective that ''you are the one who does the fighting''.  Let me know how I am doing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Tools===

The Tools menu is probably the most used panel in Flash. In it are the tools needed to  
manipulate items on the stage. It can also be used to do actions on the timeline.

[[Image:Flash_toolbar.png|right]]

Here are the main tools and their uses;

* Selection Tool ('''v''') - Selecting whole objects and moving them.
* Subselection Tool - Selecting partial objects.
* Line Tool - Drawing straight lines.
* Lasso Tool - Selecting irregular shaped pieces of an object
* Pen Tool - Drawing non-straight and curved lines. 
* Text Tool ('''t''') - Inputting a textbox onto the stage.
* Oval Tool - Drawing oval and circle shapes. (Drag + Holding Shift = Circles)
* Shape Tool - By default draws rectangles. (Drag + Holding Shift = Squares)
* Pencil Tool - Free drawing thin lines. 
* Brush Tool- Free drawing brush shapes.
* Free Transform - Scale, rotate, and skew an object.
* Fill Transform - Distort the gradient fill of an object.
* Stroke Tool - Change the color and size of a stroke.
* Fill Tool - Change the color of a fill.
* Eyedropper - Sample a color from the stage.
* Eraser - Use a brush to erase parts of an object.
* Hand Tool - Move the stage around if it is not all visible.
* Zoom - Zoom in or out.

===Properties Panel===

The properties panel is used to modify the characteristics of pre-existing objects on stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Motion Tweening is an easy method of animating an Object on the Stage, using the Timeline. Motion Tweening can only be performed on a Graphic, a Button or a Movie Clip.

For example, place an Object on the stage. This, by default, will create a Keyframe in frame 1 of the Timelime. Right click on the Keyframe in the Timeline and select ''Copy KeyFrame'' from the menu. Now right click on a frame further along the timeline and select ''Paste Frames''. You will see your Object appear in the same position on the Stage, and the frames between your two keyframes will have turned grey. 

Making sure that your second Keyframe is selected (a red line should be over it in the Timeline - if not just click on it with the left hand mouse button), move your object to somewhere else on the Stage by clicking and dragging it.

You can now create your Motion Tween. Right-click the Timeline anywhere between your two Keyframes and select ''Create Motion Tween''. The frames will turn purple and a thin back arrow will point from the first Keyframe to the second.

You can test your animation by pressing CTRL + Enter. You should see your object move smoothly from its first position to its final position.

Note that attempting to tween more than one object on the same layer doesn't often work very well. If you need to do this, it's probably best to put the objects on separate layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shape tweens are an easy way of changing shape of an object on the stage.

First, place an object such as a circle or square on the stage. The first frame should turn gray to show that there is an object on the stage. Then, right-click a frame later in the timeline and select 'insert keyframe', or just hit F6. The frames between the first frame and the keyframe should turn gray.

Click on the second keyframe to select it, and use the selection tool (the black arrow), or the free transform tool (the white box with a black border and small black squares on the side) to change the shape of your object on the stage.

To create the shape tween, select a frame between the two keyframes. In the properties panel, there is a drop-down menu next to the word 'tween'. Select 'shape' from the drop-down menu, and the frames between the two keyframes turn solid green with a long, solid line ending in an arrow.

To preview your animation, press Ctrl+Enter, or hit F12 for a more accurate HTML preview of what your animation will look like.

Note that you ''cannot'' tween an object unless it is a vector. To turn a non-vector object into a vector, use the Modify &gt; Break Apart command. 

You can use &quot;hints&quot; to control your tween. To add a hint, go to Modify &gt; Shape &gt; Add Shape Hint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ActionScript is an ECMAScript-based programming language used for scripting Adobe Flash movies and applications. Since both ActionScript and JavaScript are based on the same syntax, fluency in one translates easily to the other. However, while JavaScript's DOM is browser window-, document- and form-centric, the ActionScript DOM is movie-centric, which may include animations, audio, text and event handling.

Each action must be in a keyframe.

It's a good design strategy to keep all your actions on a separate layer named &quot;Actions&quot; or something similar.

To make a button that, when clicked, loads a [[w:Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]], right-click the button's instance, and select &quot;Actions&quot; from the menu. Then, enter this code:
 on( release )
 {
   getURL( &quot;&lt;URI&gt;&quot;, [&quot;&lt;target&gt;&quot;], [&quot;&lt;method&gt;&quot;] )
 }
where &quot;target&quot; refers to a window type (e.g. &quot;_blank&quot; for a new window).

One commonly used ActionScript function is gotoAndPlay. It takes the form gotoAndPlay( &lt;frame&gt; ). When run, it will move the player to that frame and resume play. For example, gotoAndPlay( 5 ) will move to frame 5 and resume playing, and gotoAndPlay( &quot;menu&quot; ) will go to the frame named &quot;menu&quot; and resume playing.

A similar function is gotoAndStop( &lt;frame&gt; ), which goes to the frame referenced but does ''not'' resume playing.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{columns-list|2|
  * George Washington
  * John Adams
  * Thomas Jefferson
  * James Madison
  * James Monroe
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which would render as

&lt;!-- Substituted {{columns-list}} to prevent possible loop --&gt;&lt;div {{#if: 2| style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; -webkit-column-count:2; column-count:2 }};&quot;&gt;
* George Washington
* John Adams
* Thomas Jefferson
* James Madison
* James Monroe
&lt;/div&gt;


CSS styles can also be added after the number of columns. For example
  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{columns-list|2&lt;/nowiki&gt;''';width:400px;font-style:italic'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|
  * New York, I Love You
  * Hōtai Club
  * The Kon Ichikawa Story
  * Rainbow Song
  * Hana &amp; Alice]]
  * All About Lily Chou-Chou
  * April Story
  * Swallowtail Butterfly
  * Picnic
  * Fried Dragon Fish
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which would render as

&lt;div {{#if: 2| style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; -webkit-column-count:2; column-count:2; width:400px; font-style:italic }};&quot;&gt;
  * New York, I Love You
  * Hōtai Club
  * The Kon Ichikawa Story
  * Rainbow Song
  * Hana &amp; Alice]]
  * All About Lily Chou-Chou
  * April Story
  * Swallowtail Butterfly
  * Picnic
  * Fried Dragon Fish
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{template doc page viewed directly}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(This is the documentation for: {{PAGENAME}}.)&lt;/center&gt;

{{#switch:{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}
| col-2 = The [[Template:Col-2]] sets column width for each of 2 columns, with align=left, valign=top. The width, align or valign can be changed: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-2 |width=40%|align=right|valign=center}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-3 = The [[Template:Col-3]] sets column width for each of 3 columns, with align=left, valign=top. The width, align or valign can be changed: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-3 |width=25%|align=right|valign=center}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-4 = The [[Template:Col-4]] sets column width for each of 4 columns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-5 = The [[Template:Col-5]] sets column width for each of 5 columns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-6 = The [[Template:Col-6]] sets column width for each of 6 columns, with align=left, valign=top. The width, align or valign can be changed: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-6 |width=20%|align=right|valign=center}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
| col-start=The [[Template:Col-start]] begins a wikitable (same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
}}
The {{tl|col-begin}}, {{tl|col-break}} and {{tl|col-end}} templates control columns of text on a page:
:*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - starts a table (followed by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for 1st column)
:*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - triggers the start of each column
:*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - ends the multi-column table.
The widths of columns can be specified by using various additional codes. See below for examples.

==Usage==
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin|width=70%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - start table with width.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break|width=66%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - start column-1 as 66% wide.
:: This is text in col-1.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-break|width=33%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - start column-2 as 33% wide.
:: Text column-2.
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
The table will have 2 columns, with column 1 twice (2x) the width of column 2.

A border of 2px (1px width on each side) corresponds to a 5%. Therefore, with a 2px border the width needs to be 95% for the table to fit within the screen. Since it's possible that some tables might not have a border, correction on the individual page could be made after substitution. Another way to create a two column table is like this:

{|
|
&lt;pre&gt;
{{col-begin|width=95%}}
|-
| 
Left column
|
Right column
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

{{col-begin}}

{{col-4}}

 {{tl|Col-begin}}
 {{tl|Col-2}}
 Column 1 here
 {{tl|Col-2}}

      <comment>/* Lack of Awareness of flaws in 'standard' Renderings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Julia and Mandlebrot sets broke new ground in 1980s==
The Julia and Mandelbrot sets were the first fractals that really amazed the world when they appeared in the 1980s. These pictures displayed patterns that differed entirely from anything previously known and beyond anyone's imagination.  They could furthermore possess real beauty. The hitherto known fractal patterns were sets that had more or less interesting mathematical properties, and when they could be visualized, they could exhibit thought-provoking shapes, but they were not as impressive as the new types.

==Popularity of Fractal Art==
Because of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets - not least the simplicity of the software for drawing them - the concept of fractal became very popular.  This concept has since become extremely widespread leading on to many varieties of ''fractal art''. This development has revealed an extreme variation in possible patterns.  Pictures and animations have been made of great artistic value or displaying an elaborate piece of mathematical work. However, all the serious work has been on other things than improving the basic presentation of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Pictures of fractal sets in their &quot;pure&quot; form, without artistic elaboration, do not seem to appeal to people as much today as they did in the 1980's and work on improving the basics has slid into the background.  

==Lack of Awareness of flaws in 'standard' Renderings==
Until early 2000 there was little or no progress as regards the basic drawing technique. Until 2003 not a single picture had been made where the boundary was drawn, apart from some pictures of the usual Mandelbrot set and its Julia sets&lt;ref&gt;Boundary set renderings, [http://www.juliasets.dk/Fractals.htm juliasets.dk] (started 2003 and completed 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Also the colouring based on the real iteration number only really works when the cycle is a fixed point, and even there leads to avoidable 'banding' effects, yet this colouring is in almost universal use, even when the cycle is not a fixed point. Furthermore, until early 2000, not a single Mandelbrot set had been constructed from two finite and different critical points.&lt;!--Citation needed for last point, or needs rewording--&gt;
&lt;gallery widths=350px heights=250px&gt;
Image:Juliasetsdkpostex1.jpg|Mandelbrot set constructed from one point that is not a critical point; rendered without boundary and with jumps in the colouring
Image:Juliasetsdkpostex2.jpg|Mandelbrot set constructed using two different critical points; shows boundary in the upper half part and continuous colouring
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The two images above show the opportunity for a more mathematically correct and more aesthetically pleasing way to render fractals than the method commonly used.  The right hand image shows the boundary correctly and it does not exhibit the banding effects.  Can this opportunity for improvement really be true? Can it be true, that twenty years after the Julia and Mandelbrot sets first saw the light of day, only now are technically perfect pictures beginning to turn up? 

===A possible explanation===

The most influential book about Mandelbrot and Julia sets is probably Peitgen &amp; Richter: ''The Beauty of Fractals'' from 1986. In this book  you can see the first ''real'' pictures of the Mandelbrot set, because they were drawn by distance estimation and in black-and-white. Mandelbrot saw exciting patterns when he zoomed down into his set - stellate patterns of logarithmic spirals and uncanny and &quot;hieroglyphical&quot; reduced-size versions of the Julia sets - but he only see all this, because his maximum iteration number was low. The right hand picture below, with boundary and maximum iteration number 10,000 shows how the Mandlebrot set should look. The left picture is less mathematically precise, using 1,000 iterations, and is not calculating the boundary.  If the left picture were drawn with the same maximum iteration number of 10,000, but still without the boundary calculation, we would only have seen the mini-mandelbrot visible in the centre of the right image.  The other detail would be 'too fine' to see.

Image:Juliasetsdkpictpost1.jpg|With boundary calculation and with max iteration number 10,000
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Misconceptions from a Flawed Example Program===
''The Beauty of Fractals'' gives an almost correct computer program for the distance estimation shown in the right image.  A possible reason that that method did not gain ground is that the procedure in this program is seriously flawed: The calculation of &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; is performed (and completed) before the calculation of &lt;math&gt;z'_k&lt;/math&gt;, and not after as it ought to be (&lt;math&gt;z'_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; uses &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt;, not &lt;math&gt;z_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;). For the successive calculation of &lt;math&gt;z'_k&lt;/math&gt;, we must know &lt;math&gt;f'(z_k)&lt;/math&gt; (which in this case is 2&lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt;).  In order to avoid the calculation of &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; (''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ...) again, this sequence is saved in an array. Using this array, &lt;math&gt;z'_{k+1} = 2z_kz'_k + 1&lt;/math&gt; is calculated up to the last iteration number, and it is stated that overflow can occur.  If overflow occurs the point is regarded as belonging to the boundary (the bail-out condition).  If overflow does not occur, the calculation of the distance can be performed. Apart from it being untrue that overflow can occur, the method makes use of an unnecessary storing and repetition of the iteration, making it unnecessarily slower and less attractive.  The following remark in the book is nor inviting either: &quot;It turns out that the images depend very sensitively on the various choices&quot; (bail-out radius, maximum iteration number, overflow, thickness of the boundary and blow-up factor). Is it this nonsense that has got people to lose all desire for using and generalizing the method?

== What are exponents? ==
''Exponents'' are a shorthand used for repeated multiplication.  Remember that when you were first introduced to multiplication it was as a shorthand for repeated addition.  For example, you learned that: 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5.  The expression &quot;4 &amp;times; &quot; told us how many times we needed to add. Exponents are the same type of shorthand for multiplication. Exponents are written in superscript (that is, a smaller number written above) after a regular-sized number. 

For example: 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 = 8. The number in larger font is called the base. The number in superscript is called the exponent.  The exponent tells us how many times the base is multiplied by itself. In this example, 2 is called the base and 3 is called the exponent.

The expression 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is read aloud as &quot;2 raised to the third power&quot;, or simply &quot;2 cubed&quot;.

Here are some other examples:

6 &amp;times; 6 = 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (This would read aloud as &quot;six times six is ''six raised to the second power''&quot; or more simply &quot;six times six is ''six squared''&quot;.) &lt;br&gt;
7 &amp;times; 7 &amp;times; 7 &amp;times; 7 = 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (This would read aloud as &quot;seven times seven times seven times seven equals ''seven raised to the fourth power''&quot;.  There are no alternate expression for  ''raised to the fourth power''.  It is only the second and third powers that usually get abbreviated because they come up more often.  When it is clear what is being talked about, people often drop the words &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;power&quot; and might simply say &quot;''seven to the fourth''&quot;.)

== Basic Rules of Exponents ==

&lt;u&gt;'''Multiplying Powers with the Same Base'''&lt;/u&gt;
     

&lt;math&gt;a^{n} \cdot a^{m}=a^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; means that you have &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; a factor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times.  If you add &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; more factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; then you have &lt;math&gt;n+m&lt;/math&gt; factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.


'''&lt;u&gt;Dividing Powers with the Same Base&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^{n}}{a^{m}}= \frac{\overbrace{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot ... \cdot a}^\text{n factors of a}}{\underbrace{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot ... \cdot a}_\text{m factors of a}}=a^{n-m}&lt;/math&gt;


In the same way that &lt;math&gt;a^{n} \cdot a^{m}=a^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt; because you are adding on factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, dividing is taking away factors of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  If you have m factors of a in the denominator, then you can cross out m factors from the numerator.  If there were n factors in the numerator, now you have n-m factors in the numerator.



'''&lt;u&gt;Raising a Power to a Power&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt; (a^n)^{m}=a^{n \cdot m}&lt;/math&gt;

If you think about an exponent as telling you that you have so many factors of the base, then &lt;math&gt;(a^n)^m&lt;/math&gt; means that you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; factors of &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  So you have m groups of &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and each one of those has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; groups of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  So you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; groups of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; groups of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  So you have &lt;math&gt;n \cdot m&lt;/math&gt; groups of a, or &lt;math&gt;a^{n \cdot m}&lt;/math&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Products raised to powers&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;(ab)^n = a^n b^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

You can multiply numbers in any order you please.  Instead of multiplying together n factors equal to ''ab'', you could multiply all of the ''a'' 's together, multiply all the ''b'' 's together, then finish by multiplying &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt;



'''&lt;u&gt;Quotients raised to powers&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{n}=\frac{a^n}{b^n}&lt;/math&gt;

You can raise a fraction to a power by raising both the numerator and the denominator to the power.


'''&lt;u&gt;Any Nonzero number Raised to the Zero Power Is One&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;a \ne 0 \implies a^{0} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This all means that as long as the base is not zero, when you have an exponent of zero, the expression is always equal to 1.  

&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{a^n}{a^n} = a^{n - n} = a^0 = 1 \ ,\ a \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is undefined.


'''&lt;u&gt;Negative Exponents&lt;/u&gt;'''

A negative sign on an exponent means that you need to take the reciprocal of the base, then make the exponent positive.

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{-n}=\left( \frac{b}{a} \right)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples of Basic Rules of Exponents ==

&lt;u&gt;'''Multiplying Powers with the Same Base'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add the exponents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3^{4} \cdot 3^{2}= (3 \cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot3) \cdot (3\cdot3)=3 \cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot3 \cdot 3\cdot3=3^{6}&lt;/math&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Dividing Powers with the Same Base&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Subtract the exponents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{5^{7}}{5^{4}}= \frac{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}=\frac{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{1}=5^{3}&lt;/math&gt;



'''&lt;u&gt;Raising a Power to a Power&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply the exponents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(4^{3})^{2}=4^{3} \cdot 4^{3} = (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4) \cdot (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4)=4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4=4^{6}&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Any Nonzero number Raised to the Zero Power Is One&lt;/u&gt;'''

&lt;math&gt;2^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;109^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-92^{0}=-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(-92)^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Exponent Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Exponent Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

===Scientific Notation===
Scientific notation makes use of exponents. It is often used for very large or very small numbers. It's easier to write 1,574,000,000,000,000 as 1.574 * 10^15. To convert from regular notation to scientific notation, find the leftmost nonzero digit. Count how many places away it is from the ''ones'' digit. This is the exponent for 10. If the digit was on the right of the ones digit, the exponent will be negative. If it ''was'' the ones digit, the exponent will be zero. Then, move the decimal place of the original number so that exactly one nonzero digit is on the left. Write down this new number and * 10^(exponent). You're done!

==Mathematical Insights==
1. ''Motivation for the negative exponent rule'': 

Since positive exponents are defined by repeated multiplication, see if you can show that if &lt;math&gt;a^{-b} = \frac{1}{a^b}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a^b a^c = a^{b + c}&lt;/math&gt; for all b and c.  Can you think of a different meaning for a negative exponent?  Would the operators + and - still have the same meaning?

2. ''Motivation for the non-definition of &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;'':

Try to define &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;.  A good definition would ensure that &lt;math&gt; a^b a^c = a^{b + c}&lt;/math&gt;.  Show that there is no good definition.  (You may find it useful that it is impossible to define 1/0 consistently -- why?)  Read the article [[w:Zero|zero]]. What happened in world history as people moved from the Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals?

3. ''The importance of the product rule'':

Use examples to show that &lt;math&gt;b^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{(a^b)}^c = a^{bc}&lt;/math&gt; are consequences of the product rule.

4. ''Fractional powers'':

What would be a sensible definition of &lt;math&gt;a^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;?  &lt;math&gt; a^{m/n} &lt;/math&gt;?

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The Java platform Event Model is the basis for event-driven programming on the Java platform.

==Event-driven programming==
No matter what the [[w:programming language|programming language]] or [[w:Programming paradigm|paradigm]] you are using, chances are that you will eventually run into a situation where your program will have to wait for an external event to happen. Perhaps your program must wait for some user input, or perhaps it must wait for data to be delivered over the network. Or perhaps something else. In any case, the program must wait for something to happen that is beyond the program's control: the program cannot ''make'' that event happen.

In this situation there are two general options for making a program wait for an external event to happen. The first of these is called ''polling'' and means you write a little loop of the for &quot;while the event has not happened, check again&quot;. Polling is very simple to build and very straightforward. But it is also very wasteful: it means a program takes up processor time in order to do absolutely nothing but wait. This is usually considered too much of a drawback for programs that have to do a lot of waiting. Programs that have a lot of waiting moments (for example, programs that have a graphical user interface and often have to wait for long periods of time until the user does something) usually fare much better when they use the other mechanism: ''event-driven programming''.

In event-driven programming a program that must wait, simply goes to sleep. It no longer takes up processor time, might even be unloaded from memory and generally leaves the computer available to do useful things. But the program doesn't completely go away; instead, it makes a deal with the computer or the [[w:operating system|operating system]]. A deal sort of like this:

:&lt;tt&gt;Okay Mr. Operating System, since I have to wait for an event to happen, I'll go away and let you do useful work in the meantime. But in return, ''&lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;'' have to let me know when my event has happened and let me come back to deal with it.&lt;/tt&gt;

Event-driven programming usually has a pretty large impact on the design of a program. Usually, a program has to be broken up into separate pieces to do event-driven programming (one piece for general processing and one or more others to deal with events that occur). Event-driven programming in Java is more complicated than non-event driven but it makes far more efficient use of the hardware and sometimes (like when developing a graphical user interface) dividing your code up into event-driven blocks actually fits very naturally with your program's structure.

In this module we examine the basis of the Java Platform's facilities for event-driven programming and we look at some typical examples of how that basis has been used throughout the platform.

==The Java Platform Event Model==
===Introduction===
One of the most interesting things about support for event-driven programming on the Java platform is that there is none, as such. Or, depending on your point of view, there are many different individual pieces of the platform that offer their own support for event-driven programming.

The reason that the Java platform doesn't offer one general implementation of event-driven programming is linked to the origins of the support that the platform does offer. Back in 1996 the Java programming language was just getting started in the world and was still trying to gain a foothold and conquer a place for itself in software development. Part of this early development concentrated on software development tooling like [[w:IDE|IDEs]]. One of the trends in software development around that time was for reusable software components geared towards user interfaces: components that would encapsulate some sort of interesting, reusable functionality into a single package that could be handled as a single entity rather than as a loose collection of individual classes. Sun Microsystems tried to get on the component bandwagon by introducing what they called a [[JavaBeans|JavaBean]], a software component not only geared towards the UI but that could also be configured easily from an IDE. In order to make this happen Sun came up with a large specification of JavaBeans (the JavaBeans Spec) dealing mostly with naming conventions (to make the components easy to handle from an IDE). But Sun also realized at the same time that a UI-centric component would need support for an event-driven way of connecting events in the component to business logic that would have to be written by the individual developer. So the JavaBeans Spec also included a small specification for an event Model for the Java platform.

When they started working on this Event Model, the Sun engineers were faced with a choice: try to come up with a huge specification to encompass all possible uses of an event model, or just specify an abstract, generic framework that could be expanded for individual use in specific situations. They chose the latter option and so, love it or hate it, the Java Platform has no generic support for event-driven programming other than this general Event Model framework.

===The Event Model framework===
[[Image:JavaEventModelBasicFramework.jpg|right|frame|The basic Event Model framework]]

The Event Model framework is really very simple in and of itself, consisting of three classes (one abstract) and an interface. Most of all it consists of naming conventions that the programmer must obey. The framework is depicted in the image on the right.

Speaking in terms of classes and interfaces, the most important parts of the framework are the &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt; abstract class and the &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt; interface. These two types are the centerpieces of the rules and conventions of the Java Platform Event Model, which are:

*A class that has to be notified when an event occurs, is called an ''event listener''. An event listener has one distinct method for each type of event notification that it is interested in.
*Event notification method declarations are grouped together into categories. Each category is represented by an event listener interface, which must extend &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt;. By convention an event listener interface is named ''&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener''. Any class that will be notified of events must implement at least one listener interface.
*Any and all state related to an event occurrence will be captured in a state object. The class of this object must be a subclass of &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt; and must record at least which object was the source of the event. Such a class is called an event class and by convention is named ''&lt;Event category name&gt;Event''.
*Usually (but not necessarily!) an event listener interface will relate to a single event class. An event listener may have multiple event notification methods that take the same event class as an argument.
*An event notification method usually (but not necessarily!) has the conventional signature ''[[../Keywords/public|public]] [[../Keywords/void|void]] &lt;specific event&gt;(&lt;Event category name&gt;Event evt)''.
*A class that is the source of events must have a method that allows for the registration of listeners, one for each possible listener interface type. These methods must by convention have the signature ''[[../Keywords/public|public]] [[../Keywords/void|void]] add&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener(&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener listener)''.
*A class that is the source of events may have a method that allows for the deregistration of listeners, one for each possible listener interface type. These methods must by convention have the signature ''[[../Keywords/public|public]] [[../Keywords/void|void]] remove&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener(&lt;Event category name&gt;Listener listener)''.

[[Image:JavaEventModelGenericFrameworkUse.jpg|523px|thumb|left|A general example of how the framework is used]]

That seems like a lot, but it's pretty simple once you get used to it. Take a look at the image on the left, which contains a general example of how you might use the framework. In this example we have a class called &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; that publishes interesting events. Following the rules of the Event Model, the events are represented by the &lt;code&gt;InterestingEvent&lt;/code&gt; class which has a reference back to the &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; object (&lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt;, inherited from &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt;).

Whenever an interesting event occurs, the &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; must notify all of the listeners for that event that it knows about by calling the notification method that exist for that purpose. All of the notification methods (in this example there is only one, &lt;code&gt;interestingEventOccurred&lt;/code&gt;) have been grouped together by topic in a listener interface: &lt;code&gt;InterestingEventListener&lt;/code&gt;, which implements &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt; and is named according to the Event Model conventions. This interface must be implemented by all event listener classes (in this case only &lt;code&gt;InterestingEventListenerImpl&lt;/code&gt;). Because &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; must be able to notify any interested listeners, it must be possible to register them. For this purpose the &lt;code&gt;EventSourceClass&lt;/code&gt; has an &lt;code&gt;addInterestingEventListener&lt;/code&gt; method. And since it is required, there is a &lt;code&gt;removeInterestingEventListener&lt;/code&gt; method as well.

As you can clearly see from the example, using the Event Model is mostly about following naming conventions. This might seem a little cumbersome at first, but the point of having naming conventions is to allow automated tooling to access and use the event model. And there are indeed many tools, IDEs and frameworks that are based on these naming conventions.

===Degrees of freedom in the Model===
There's one more thing to notice about the Event Model and that is what is ''not'' in the Model. The Event Model is designed to allow implementations a large degree of freedom in the implementation choices made, which means that the Event Model can serve as the basis for a very wide range of specific, purpose-built event handling systems.

Aside from naming conventions and some base classes and interfaces, the Event Model specifies the following:

*It must be possible to register and deregister listeners.
*An event source must publish events by calling the correct notification method on all registered listeners.
*A call to an event notification method is a normal, synchronous Java call and the method must be executed by the same thread that called it.

But the Event Model doesn't specify ''how'' any of this must be done. There are no rules regarding which classes exactly must be event sources, nor about how they must keep track of registered event listeners. So one class might publish its own events, or be responsible for publishing the events that relate to an entire collection of objects (like an entire component). And an event source might allow listeners to be deregistered at any time (even in the middle of handling an event) or might limit this to certain times (which is relevant to multithreading).

Also, the Event Model doesn't specify how it must be embedded within any program. So, while the model specifies that a call to an event handling method is a synchronous call, the Model does not prescribe that the event handling method cannot hand off tasks to another thread or that the entire event model implementation must run in the main thread of the application. In fact, the Java Platform's standard user interface framework ([[../Swing|Swing]]) includes an event handling implementation that runs as a complete subsystem of a desktop application, in its own thread.

===Event notification methods, unicast event handling and event adaptors===
In the previous section we mentioned that an event notification method usually takes a single argument. This is the preferred convention, but the specification does allow for exceptions to this rule if the application really needs that exception. A typical case for an exception is when the event notification must be sent across the network to a remote system though non-Java means, like the [[w:CORBA|CORBA]] standard. In this case it is required to have multiple arguments and the Event Model allows for that. However, as a general rule the correct format for a notification method is

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: Simple notification method'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void specificEventDescription(Event_type evt)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Another thing we mentioned earlier is that, as a general rule, the Event Model allows many event listeners to register with a single event source for the same event. In this case the event source must broadcast any relevant events to all the registered listeners. However, once again the Event Model specification allows for an exception to the rule. If it is necessary from a design point of view you may limit an event source to registering a single listener; this is called ''unicast event listener registration''. When unicast registration is used, the registration method must be declared to throw the &lt;code&gt;java.util.TooManyListenersException&lt;/code&gt; exception if too many listeners are registered:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.2: Listener registration'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void add&lt;Event_type&gt;Listener(&lt;Event_type&gt;Listener listener) throws java.util.TooManyListenersException
&lt;/source&gt;}}

[[Image:JavaEventModelUsingAnAdaptor.jpg|600px|thumb|center|An event adaptor in between the event source and the event listener.]]

Finally, the specification allows for one more extension: the event adaptor. An event adaptor is an implementation of an event listener interface that can be inserted between an event source and an actual event listener class. This is done by registering the adaptor with the event source object using the regular registration method. Adaptors are used to add additional functionality to the event handling mechanism, such as routing of event objects, event filtering or enriching of the event object before processing by an actual event handler class.

==A simple example==
In the previous section we've explored the depths (such as there are) of the Java platform Event Model framework. If you're like most people, you've found the theoretical text more confusing than the actual use of the model. Certainly more confusing than should be necessary to explain what is, really, quite a simple framework.

In order to clear everything up a bit, let's examine a simple example based on the Event Model framework. Let's assume that we want to write a program that reads a stream of numbers input by the user at the command line and processes this stream somehow. Say, by keeping track of the running sum of numbers and producing that sum once the stream has been completely read.

Of course we could implement this program quite simply with a loop in a main() method. But instead let's be a little more creative. Let's say that we want to divide our program neatly into classes, each with a responsibility of its own (like we should in a proper, object-oriented design). And let's imagine that we want it to be possible not only to calculate the sum of all the numbers read, but to perform any number of calculations on the same number stream. In fact, it should be possible to add new calculations with relative ease and without having to affect any previously existing code.

If we analyze these requirements, we come to the conclusion that we have a number of different responsibilities in the program:

{| class=&quot;messagebox&quot;
|
*Reading the number stream from the command line
*Processing the number stream (possibly multiple of these)
*Starting the entire program
|}

Using the Event Model framework allows us to separate the two main responsibilities cleanly and affords us the flexibility we are looking for. If we implement the logic for reading the number stream in a single class and treat the reading of a single number as an event, the Event Model allows us to broadcast that event (and the number) to as many stream processors as we like. The class for reading the number stream will act as the event source of the program and each stream processor will be a listener. Since each listener is a class of its own and can be registered with the stream reader (or not) this means our model allows us to have multiple, independent stream processing that we can add on to without affecting the code to read the stream or any pre-existing stream processor.

The Event Model says that any state associated with an event should be included in a class that represents the event. That's perfect for us; we can implement a simple event class that will record the number read from the command line. Each listener can then process this number as it sees fit.

For our interesting event set let's keep things simple: let's limit ourselves to having read a new number and having reached the end of the stream. With this choice we come to the following design for our example application:

[[File:JavaEventModelWikibooksJavaProgrammingBookExample.jpg|600px|thumb|center]]

In the following sections we look at the implementation of this example.

===Example basics===
Let's start with the basics. According to the Event Model rules, we must define an event class to encapsulate our interesting event. We should call this class ''something-something''Event. Let's go for &lt;code&gt;NumberReadEvent&lt;/code&gt;, since that's what will interest us. According to the Model rules, this class should encapsulate any state that belongs with an event occurrence. In our case, that's the number read from the stream. And our event class must inherit from &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventObject&lt;/code&gt;. So all in all, the following class is all we need:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.1: NumberReadEvent.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.util.EventObject;

public class NumberReadEvent extends EventObject {

    private Double number;
   
    public NumberReadEvent(Object source, Double number) {
        super(source);
        this.number = number;
    }

    public Double getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Next, we must define a listener interface. This interface must define methods for interesting events and must extend &lt;code&gt;java.util.EventListener&lt;/code&gt;. We said earlier our interesting events were &quot;number read&quot; and &quot;end of stream reached&quot;, so here we go:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.2: NumberReadListener.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.util.EventListener;

public interface NumberReadListener extends EventListener {
    public void numberRead(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent);
   
    public void numberStreamTerminated(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent);
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Actually the &lt;code&gt;numberStreamTerminated&lt;/code&gt; method is a little weird, since it isn't actually a &quot;number read&quot; event. In a real program you'd probably want to do this differently. But let's keep things simple in this example.

===The event listener implementation===
So, with our listener interface defined, we need one or more implementations (actual listener classes). At the very least we need one that will keep a running sum of the numbers read. We can add as many as we like, of course. But let's stick with just one for now. Obviously, this class must implement our &lt;code&gt;NumberReadListener&lt;/code&gt; interface. Keeping a running summation is a matter of adding numbers to a field as the events arrive. And we wanted to report on the sum when the end of the stream is reached; since we know when that happens (i.e. the &lt;code&gt;numberStreamTerminated&lt;/code&gt; method is called), a simple &lt;code&gt;println&lt;/code&gt; statement will do:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.3: NumberReadListenerImpl.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

public class NumberReadListenerImpl implements NumberReadListener {
   
    Double totalSoFar = 0D;

    @Override
    public void numberRead(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        totalSoFar += numberReadEvent.getNumber();
    }

    @Override
    public void numberStreamTerminated(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Sum of the number stream: &quot; + totalSoFar);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

So, is this code any good? No. It's yucky and terrible and most of all not thread safe. But it will do for our example.

===The event source===
This is where things get interesting: the event source class. This is the interesting place because this is where we must put code to read the number stream, code to send events to all the listeners and code to ''manage'' listeners (add and remove them and keep track of them).

Let's start by thinking about keeping track of listeners. Normally this is a tricky business, since you have to take all sorts of multithreading concerns into account. But we're being simple in this example, so let's just stick with a simple &lt;code&gt;java.util.Set&lt;/code&gt; of listeners. Which we can initialize in the constructor:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: The constructor'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
private Set&lt;NumberReadListener&gt; listeners;
   
public NumberReader() {
    listeners = new HashSet&lt;NumberReadListener&gt;();
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

That choice makes it really easy to implement adding and removing of listeners:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.2: The register/deregister'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void addNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
    this.listeners.add(listener);
}

public void removeNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
    this.listeners.remove(listener);
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

We won't actually use the remove method in this example &amp;mdash; but recall that the Model says it must be present.

Another advantage of this simple choice is that notification of all the listeners is easy as well. We can just assume any listeners will be in the set and iterate over them. And since the notification methods are synchronous (rule of the model) we can just call them directly:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.3: The notifiers'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
private void notifyListenersOfEndOfStream() {
    for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener : listeners) {
        numberReadListener.numberStreamTerminated(new NumberReadEvent(this, 0D));
    }
}

private void notifyListeners(Double d) {
    for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
        numberReadListener.numberRead(new NumberReadEvent(this, d));
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Note that we've made some assumptions here. For starters, we've assumed that we'll get the Double value d from somewhere. Also, we've assumed that no listener will ever care about the number value in the end-of-stream notification and have passed in the fixed value 0 for that event.

Finally we must deal with reading the number stream. We'll use the Console class for that and just keep on reading numbers until there are no more:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.4: The main method'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public void start() {
    Console console = System.console();
    if (console != null) {
        Double d = null;
        do {
            String readLine = console.readLine(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;, (Object[])null);
            d = getDoubleValue(readLine);
            if (d != null) {
                notifyListeners(d);
            }
        } while (d != null);
        notifyListenersOfEndOfStream();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Note how we've hooked the number-reading loop into the event handling mechanism by calling the notify methods? The entire class looks like this:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.4: NumberReader.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.io.Console;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class NumberReader {
    private Set&lt;NumberReadListener&gt; listeners;
   
    public NumberReader() {
        listeners = new HashSet&lt;NumberReadListener&gt;();
    }
   
    public void addNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.add(listener);
    }
   
    public void removeNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.remove(listener);
    }
   
    public void start() {
        Console console = System.console();
        if (console != null) {
            Double d = null;
            do {
                String readLine = console.readLine(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;, (Object[])null);
                d = getDoubleValue(readLine);
                if (d != null) {
                    notifyListeners(d);
                }
            } while (d != null);
            notifyListenersOfEndOfStream();
        }
    }

    private void notifyListenersOfEndOfStream() {
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberStreamTerminated(new NumberReadEvent(this, 0D));
        }
    }

    private void notifyListeners(Double d) {
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberRead(new NumberReadEvent(this, d));
        }
    }

    private Double getDoubleValue(String readLine) {
        Double result;
        try {
            result = Double.valueOf(readLine);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            result = null;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

===Running the example===
Finally, we need one more class: the kickoff point for the application. This class will contain a main() method, plus code to create a NumberReader, a listener and to combine the two:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.5: Main.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberReader reader = new NumberReader();
        NumberReadListener listener = new NumberReadListenerImpl();
        reader.addNumberReadListener(listener);
        reader.start();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

If you compile and run the program, the result looks somewhat like this:

{{XCode|1='''An example run'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
&gt;java org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example.Main
Enter a number: 0.1
Enter a number: 0.2
Enter a number: 0.3
Enter a number: 0.4
Enter a number:
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}

{{XCode|1='''Output'''
'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff; &quot;&gt;
Sum of the number stream: 1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;'''}}

===Extending the example with an adaptor===
Next, let's take a look at applying an adaptor to our design. Adaptors are used to add functionality to the event handling process that:

* is general to the process and not specific to any one listener; or
* is not supposed to affect the implementation of specific listeners.

According to the Event Model specification a typical use case for an adaptor is to add routing logic for events. But you can also add filtering or logging. In our case, let's do that: add logging of the numbers as &quot;proof&quot; for the calculations done in the listeners.

An adaptor, as explained earlier, is a class that sits between the event source and the listeners. From the point of view of the event source, it masquerades as a listener (so it must implement the listener interface). From the point of view of the listeners it pretends to be the event source (so it should have add and remove methods). In other words, to write an adaptor you have to repeat some code from the event source (to manage listeners) and you have to re-implement the event notification methods to do some extra stuff and then pass the event on to the actual listeners.

In our case we need an adaptor that writes the numbers to a log file. Keeping it simple once again, let's settle for an adaptor that:

* Uses a fixed log file name and overwrites that log file with every program run.
* Opens a &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt; in the constructor and just keeps it open.
* Implements the &lt;code&gt;numberRead&lt;/code&gt; method by writing the number to the &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt;.
* Implements the &lt;code&gt;numberStreamTerminated&lt;/code&gt; method by closing the &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt;.

Also, we can make life easy on ourselves by just copying all the code we need to manage listeners over from the &lt;code&gt;NumberReader&lt;/code&gt; class. Again, in a real program you'd want to do this differently. Note that each notification method implementation also passes the event on to all the real listeners:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.6: NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor implements NumberReadListener {
    private Set&lt;NumberReadListener&gt; listeners;
    private BufferedWriter output;
   
    public NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor() {
        listeners = new HashSet&lt;NumberReadListener&gt;();
        try {
            output = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;numberLog.log&quot;));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
   
    public void addNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.add(listener);
    }
   
    public void removeNumberReadListener(NumberReadListener listener) {
        this.listeners.remove(listener);
    }
   
   
    @Override
    public void numberRead(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        try {
            output.write(numberReadEvent.getNumber() + &quot;\n&quot;);
        } catch (Exception e) {
           
        }
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberRead(numberReadEvent);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void numberStreamTerminated(NumberReadEvent numberReadEvent) {
        try {
            output.flush();
            output.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
           
        }
        for (NumberReadListener numberReadListener: listeners) {
            numberReadListener.numberStreamTerminated(numberReadEvent);
        }
    }

}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Of course, to make the adaptor work we have to make some changes to the bootstrap code:

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.7: Main.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en.javaprogramming.example;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberReader reader = new NumberReader();
        NumberReadListener listener = new NumberReadListenerImpl();
        NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor adaptor = new NumberReaderLoggingAdaptor();
        adaptor.addNumberReadListener(listener);
        reader.addNumberReadListener(adaptor);
        reader.start();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

But note how nicely and easily we can re-link the objects in our system. The fact that adaptors and listeners both implement the listener interface and the adaptor and event source both look like event sources means that we can hook the adaptor into the system without having to change a single statement in the classes that we developed earlier.

And of course, if we run the same example as given above, the numbers are now recorded in a log file.

==Platform uses of the Event Model==
The Event Model, as mentioned earlier, doesn't have a single all-encompassing implementation within the Java platform. Instead, the model serves as a basis for several different purpose-specific implementations, both within the standard Java platform and outside it (in frameworks).

Within the platform the main implementations are found in two areas:

* As part of the [[../JavaBeans/Introduction to JavaBeans|JavaBeans]] classes, particularly in the support classes for the implementation of PropertyChangeListeners.
* As part of the Java standard UI frameworks, [[Java Swings/AWT|AWT]] and [[Java_Swings/Overview|Swing]].

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
==Purpose==
The purpose of the &quot;resolved&quot; tag is to give a visual hint to readers of talk page items, making it easier to ignore already-resolved issues. Also, it is hoped that the existence of such a tag will encourage the resolution of items on a talk page.

This template is to show an item on a talk page has been resolved and there is no dispute in anyone's mind about the outcome. That is, the initial comment or request has been filled, a reply to that effect has been added, and there are no disputed items or issues left to be resolved, and (if required) the article (or other page type) has been updated.

The &quot;resolved&quot; tag is '''not''' final and does not close a conversation. If new issues arise, or the item is not fully resolved, please remove the tag.  Thus, the tag also helps clarify situations that might otherwise be ignored because some users thought the issue was resolved, when it was not.

This tag can be (and is) also used in admin processes to note that an action item reported to a notice board has been dealt with, and can further be of help on user talk pages to sort messages for archival from those to be retained for continued discussion or followup action.

==Usage==
Place the following under the topic heading on a talk page:
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Resolved|1=~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
{{Resolved| [[User:JohnDoe|JohnDoe]] 00:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC) }}
(The 1= is necessary if there are any &quot;=&quot; characters in the message, for example if your raw signature contains &quot;=&quot;. Diffs include the &quot;=&quot; character and therefore require the 1=. Otherwise you can drop it.)

To make an additional comment explaining why the issue is resolved, and/or to sign so that others know who marked the thread as resolved:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Resolved|Articles have been updated with 2007 data, and are now in sync. --&amp;#126;&amp;#126;~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{resolved|Articles have been updated with 2007 data, and are now in sync. --[[User:JohnDoe|JohnDoe]] 00:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)}}

===Example===

 ==Chelonia==
 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#BBFFBB&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Resolved|Error corrected in article. ~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Chelonia currently redirects to Turtle, but ''Chelonia'' is the monotypic genus containing the [[Green Sea Turtle]].&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Shouldn't it be Chelonian--&gt;Turtle, and Chelonia--&gt;Green Sea Turtle? [[User:OneUser123|OneUser123]] 2 July 2005 05:08 (UTC)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 :Yes you are right. I changed it. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:AnotherUser789|AnotherUser789]] 00:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|title=Gyoza
|cover=Jiaozi.jpg
|desc=[[Cookbook:Gyoza|Gyoza]] is a popular Chinese restaurant fare, also known as the potsticker.  While it is derived from a Chinese recipe, it is more closely associated with the Japanese Gyôza or Pan-Fried Dumpling. Its contrast between filling and crispy exterior is a very pleasing sensation and, like many dishes, it can be melded to incorporate almost any flavour.

I think the following is wrong:
:A number is a type of variable which stores an integer
JavaScript's variables are typeless, so any variable can store anything. &quot;A number&quot; in JavaScript is the same as in natural language: it is a value composed of digits. I believe that in JavaScript there are two types of numbers, integers and floating point values, or &quot;floats&quot; for short; like in all other curly-brace languages, such as C, C++, Java, C# etc..

:No, I'm partially wrong: there are no integers in JavaScript, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Number WP:JavaScript syntax#Number]. &quot;Numbers&quot; are floating point values only.

For the rest, the Math object exists since numbers are not objects. In 
&lt;pre&gt;
  var a = 2;
  var b = 2;
&lt;/pre&gt;
there is no meaning to first create one object whose value is 2 and then another object whose value is 2, 2 is always identical to 2 wherever the respective 2:s are created and accessed. There are no need to actually create 2:s, instead one can imagine that all numbers are already preexisting &quot;objects&quot;, that might be added or subtracted to each other, but the designers of JavaScript didn't understand it that way. Therefore the Math object exists to &quot;give access&quot; to functions operating on numbers when they aren't real objects.

=Ruy Lopez, Riga Variation=

White's move threatens black's queen and attempts to eliminate the dark side bishop. Note that in the main line of the Riga Variation, that bishop is sacrificed on h2 for attacking chances on white's king.

[[/8...Be7|8...Be7]] accepts the trade, usually following 9.Bxe7 Kxe7 to break the pin coming from the a5 bishop.

[[/8...f6|8...f6]] gets complicated. Now white has a piece in danger as well. White can respond Nxd4 and play can continue toward the main line. Simply moving the bishop again loses a tempo and the initiative.

[[/8...Qd6|8...Qd6]] moves the queen out of the way, though it does take the square the bishop needs to sacrifice on h2.

== How to develop a GUI Python program to click on desktop at desired position ... ==

Hello All Pythoners,

I am Raju C Padaria from India. Today whole day I read about Python programming language. I feel it very very useful in my daily office work for my users. I have been working on SAP R/3 4.6C on Windows XP since last 3 years. I need to automate some download from SAP using Python.
Is it possible to open SAP screen, enter required parameters in the screen, click on an icon to download data from SAP &amp; so on &amp; so forth. I have gone through almost all examples / tutorials but couldn't find the answer of my question.

Please guide me how should I go about it ?

Thanks well in advance !

Best Regards,

--[[User:Padarrju|Padarrju]] Raju C Padaria 13:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

I want a sample program on linked list

== Who is the author of Python? ==
[[w:Guido van Rossum|Guido van Rossum]]

== Python Problem ==

Given the dimensions of a rectangular grid and a sequence of robot positions and
instructions, you are to write a program that determines for each sequence of robot
positions and instructions the final position of the robot.
A robot position consists of a grid coordinate (a pair of integers: x-coordinate followed
by y-coordinate) and an orientation (N,S,E,W for north, south, east, and west). A robot
instruction is a string of the letters 'L', 'R', and 'F' which represent, respectively, the
instructions:
• Left: the robot turns left 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
• Right: the robot turns right 90 degrees and remains on the current grid point.
• Forward: the robot moves forward one grid point in the direction of the current
orientation and maintains the same orientation.
The direction North corresponds to the direction from grid point (x,y) to grid point
(x,y+1).
Since the grid is rectangular and bounded, a robot that moves ``off'' an edge of the grid is
lost forever. However, lost robots leave a robot ``scent'' that prohibits future robots from
dropping off the world at the same grid point. The scent is left at the last grid position the
robot occupied before disappearing over the edge. An instruction to move ``off'' the
world from a grid point from which a robot has been previously lost is simply ignored by
the current robot.
INPUT SPECIFICATION
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the rectangular world, the lowerleft
coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
The remaining input consists of a sequence of robot positions and instructions (two lines
per robot). A position consists of two integers specifying the initial coordinates of the
robot and an orientation (N,S,E,W), all separated by white space on one line. A robot
instruction is a string of the letters 'L', 'R', and 'F' on one line.
Each robot is processed sequentially, i.e., finishes executing the robot instructions before
the next robot begins execution. There will be 3 robots.
You may assume that all initial robot positions are within the bounds of the specified
grid. The maximum value for any coordinate is 50. All instruction strings will be less
than 100 characters in length.
OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
For each robot position/instruction in the input, the output should indicate the final grid
position and orientation of the robot. If a robot falls off the edge of the grid the word
``LOST'' should be printed after the position and orientation.
SAMPLE INPUT (from file) and OUTPUT (to file)
Case 1:
in.txt looks like this:
5 3
1 1 E
RFRFRFRF
3 2 N
FRRFLLFFRRFLL
0 3 W
LLFFFLFLFL
out.txt looks like this:
1 1 E
3 3 N LOST
2 3 S

== Pyserial Bill Acceptor ==

Has anyone ever tried to have python read a bill acceptor through a RS-232 serial port? If not how would one go about this? I assume using pySerial but except for the examples there isn't much information that is intuitive to me anyway.  Any information would be great. Thanks.

== Reinitializing Python Import ==

I am new to Python. I want to manipulate ready-made command line programs with scripts, and Python appears to achieve this with more control of the programs than DOS batch files. 

I have written a few Python scripts to test some programs, and I have a question about reinitializing the text ~.py module when I make a change to it. After I've imported a module into Python, e.g., &gt;&gt;&gt; import name.py, and I make a new change to the text file &quot;name.py,&quot; the change will not take effect even if I again import it into Python. 

How do I reinitialize the module once I've made changes to the module? I can't just import the module; the definitions remain unchanged, unless I exit Python and restart it. 

Thanks,

in this tutorial what does mean x%2 ?
i think: i * 2% = always even number 
but why not 4,6 or 8? but  i * 4(6,8,10,12...)% = always even number too
for example: 100 * 2(4,6,8,10,12...)% = 2(4,6,8,10,12...)
even numbers = {2,4,6,8,10,12...}
and how pyton understanding 0(even or odd number or it is an exception?)?

Jalapeno eggs for two persons:

==Ingredients==
*4 eggs (free range
*4 slices of whole bread
*1 pack of bacon (150 grams)
*Picled jalapenos (the kind you have on tacos)
*1 can of tomato beans
*1 onion
*Margarine
*grated cheese (real cheese, not cheese product)

==Procedure==

===Side Dishes===
#Chop and fry the onions, set aside.
#Warm the tomato beans. Medium heat
#Fry the bacon and set it aside. Use the bacon grease to fry the eggs.

===Eggs===

#Slice the bread and apply margarine - generously.
#Heat a frying pan with a little margarine
#Start frying two eggs. Do not crack the yolk.
#When the eggs are nearly done, draw aside the egg white so the yolk is clear.
#Chop some jalapenos and spread them over the eggs. Add some of the picle juice as well.
#Spread some cheese over the eggs 
#Put a lid over the frying pan and let the cheese melt. 

Ready to serve.</text>

== Deprecate [[Cookbook:Recipes]] and [[Cookbook:Ingredients]] ==

Shall we deprecate [[Cookbook:Recipes]] and [[Cookbook:Ingredients]]? [[:Category:Recipes]] and [[:Category:Ingredients]] are already much more complete. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:46, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
: Agreed. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
: Good idea. These will have to have the links pointing to them updated. I've got a bot that has done such work on Wikipedia and it seems one doesn't need authorization to use bots here (though the use is discouraged) so I offer my help if needed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
:: Actually, most of the pages linking to the page were doing so from {{tl|Cooknav}} and {{tl|Recipe}}. I've been bold and updated these. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
::: Great, thanks. I haven't had the focus to do this myself for the last few months. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:30, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

: I started updating the other pages (not template ones) and it turns out that a lot of these pages that seem to mimic categories exist. These are conveniently listed on [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]]. Should these also be changed to categories? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:23, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Mostly not. Or not yet at least. The categories were created (mostly by me) to be more complete references since they're easier to update and maintain. A lot of the other pages have information above and beyond just the recipe/ingredient list, or they have more fine grained subdivisions than the categories currently have (e.g. [[Cookbook:Dessert]] has nice subsections). In the future, I think we'll probably be using DynamicPageLists2 to include category output into a single readable page (like [[Cookbook:Dessert]]) without the extra work that hand maintaining lists brings. But DPL2's aren't enabled here as of yet. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:08, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

::: Actually, most of these don't really have any text content, but are simple lists (including [[Cookbook:Dessert]]). In the current form, I'd say the automatical listing would give categories the advantage. Category pages can still have content, though only at the top of the page, above the page list.
::: What is DynamicPageLists2? An extension? I checked Meta and MediaWiki.org, but without results. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:30, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: They're a way to transclude category listings into normal pages. DPL(1)'s are currently enabled on wikibooks, but they don't allow alpha ordering, so it makes them sort of useless for the cookbook. If DPL2's were enabled, we would be able to create a page for Desserts which had appropriate subsections (you don't just want one big list of desserts, really) but do it dynamically from the categories. This would be better than just linking to the Desserts category. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:24, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: An example of DPL1's is on my scratch page [[User:Kellen/Scratch#DynamicPageList_test_.28chocolate_desserts.29:]] [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:27, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Ethnic cuisines ==

With the Ethnic cuisines, is any attempt made to differentiate between &quot;native&quot; recipes and foreign versions?  For example:  Mexican vs. American Mexican.  Thai vs. Americanized Thai.  Indian vs. English Indian, etc.  In some cases, there are major cuisine differences between the &quot;native&quot; food and the foreignized versions (such as in Chinese food).  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:57, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:Some, but spotty. For example, there is [[:Category:Southwestern recipes]], which probably has more of the Americanised Mexican recipes. See also [[Cookbook:Tex-Mex cuisine]] and [[Cookbook:California cuisine]]. English Indian recipes will often be modified to more classic Indian dishes by passing editors, and I think at least one Americanised Thai recipe has been treated similarly. We could do much better, though, so ... ;-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:36, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

::I think it might be good to develope some sort of policy clarifying this—for example, American Thai food is great, but it shouldn't be confused for Authentic Thai.  It might be good to have the two listed as two separate recipes, however, one American Thai, and one Thai.  And make it a policy to specify whether a recipe is &quot;foreignized&quot; or native.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:53, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::I've tried to do that in a couple of instances here, but not in any formal way. Perhaps a policy on this would be good. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:59, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

::::I think so.  How would we go about coming up with one?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 10:35, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:It depends on what &quot;Americanized&quot; means. If that means a semi-poisonous ingredient available in a half dozen countries got replaced by a wholesome ingredient available in hundreds of countries, then the Americanized version is better. If the Americanized version is full of nasty commercial substitutions (ketchup in a lasagna!) then the Americanized version is probably junk. If the recipies are both decent and are quite distinct, then put the version less common in America on a separate page and link each page to the other. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:34, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

::This last approach is exactly what Cookbook has done with a couple of Anglicised recipes, especially classic Italian dishes that are popular in the UK. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:18, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

::: &quot;Authentic&quot; is very much a matter of opinion.  Not too long ago, a well-known  Italian writer (not so well known that I remember his name), writing a book in English on Italian food was lambasted by the New York Times for writing &quot;not all Italian grandmothers are good cooks&quot;. The Times stated derisively that 'good' was no proof of authenticity and &quot;authetic' might not necessarily be well cooked. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 01:43, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

== Contributors ==

Can anyone on Wikibooks alter recipes?  Is there a policy for that?  People have differences in taste—someone might treble garlic in a recipe, for example, or someone else might remove it entirely.  Is there any policy covering amendations to recipes in that regard?  (Sorry, I'm completely new to the Cookbooks section of Wikibooks, and I'm wondering how stuff like this is resolved.)  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:59, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Jade Knight, I don't believe we have a policy quite that strict. With traditional recipes, it's desirable to keep the recipe as authentic as possible, then note variations such as a personal preference for treble the garlic in the &quot;Notes, tips and variations&quot; section at the end of the recipe. For other recipes, I would tend to do much the same, unless I think that the recipe is plain wrong (e.g. 2 Tbs salt that probably ought to be 2 tsp). I have seen ingredients change dramatically in some recipes, and when that happens, I generally check similar recipes on other websites to see which version is the more popular before deciding whether to keep the new changes or move them to &quot;Notes, tips and variations&quot; (or reverting if necessary). 
:An interesting case on the point of traditional recipes is [[Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara]]. See its discussion page for the tussle over the ingredients and origins of this classic Roman recipe! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:25, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

::So, if I post a recipe, it's fair for me to watch over it and make sure it remains true the original, with variations listed as such?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 05:51, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Pretty much! It is the nature of wikis that content is fair game for further editing by anyone at any time. However, silly vandalism aside, I find that most edits to recipes are for the better - e.g. sharpening the language a bit, adding personal variations at the end, or restoring the authentic ingredients to a traditional recipe. Not all though, so add your recipes to your watchlist if you care! Or just watch the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=102 recent changes] frequently. 
:::Be aware, however, that you don't [[wikibooks:Ownership|own]] the recipes you contribute to Wikibooks - so don't be upset when someone does make a change. Be prepared to accept that a different version may be better, too. You never know, your &quot;true original&quot; may less true or original than you think! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:10, 3 July 2007 (UTC)
::::Ultimately, in cookery, there's no such thing as a real &quot;original&quot;.  However, what is best is such a subjective thing—even within a recipe.  For example, I can't stand celery in tuna noodle casserole.  Some people love it.  Who is the ultimate arbiter on whether a change is an &quot;improvement&quot; to the recipe or not?  This is the sort of thing I'm talking about—naming variations is one thing, cleaning up text is one thing, but someone deciding they have (arbitrarily) a better version of a recipe doesn't really jive.  I understand reasoning between having two separate foreign and &quot;native&quot; versions of various recipes, but that's different than altering a recipe because someone else likes another version more… at the same time, though, we probably don't want to have 50 different chocolate chip cookie recipes here.  So what do we do?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 10:34, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::I'd say we try to keep a happy medium. That means accepting some changes, moving some to ''Notes, tips and variations'', and rejecting some changes. But, once again, I must remind you of [[Wikibooks:Ownership|WB:OWN]] - once you make your contribution here, it's &quot;ours&quot;, not &quot;yours&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;. It is perfectly legitimate for someone to come along and amend a recipe if they think it is wrong or sub-optimal. I've seen changes made to recipes I've submitted, and had to make the choice between the three actions I mentioned.
:::::If you are primarily concerned with preserving a recipe in the form you treasure most, and have it accessible to all on the Internet, then get a website - [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider|Wikibooks pages are not personal homepages]]. The Wikibooks Cookbook is primarily a textbook on preparing food, with recipes as a necessary part of that. We are very lucky to have had so many recipes contributed to it, but ultimately it isn't everyone's personal recipe book, it's a textbook, much like the other books here. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:19, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

::::::I think you're missing my question.  It's a matter of how the selection process is made—who is to determine what constitutes an improvement or not?  I understand how changes are made at places like Wikipedia and Wikiversity, but cooking is an entirely different story.  I'm trying to understand the method here.  The more wikibooks grows, the more there are likely to arise conflicts between editors who both think they have the &quot;right&quot; cheese fondue recipe, etc.  How are these resolved?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 22:14, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

:::::::I fail to see the difference. If two contributors got into it like that over something in a Wikibook (as has happened with other books here in the past), there would have to be some mediation. We have an option not available to WP in that each can have a separate book, or in the case of Cookbook recipes, each can have a separate recipe. I'd hate to see that happen here, however, but some people just can't seem to handle working in a collaborative environment. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:36, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

== Speaking of chocolate biscuit recipes... ==

[[Cookbook:Chocolate Chip Cookies]] seems silly to me. It currently has three actual recipes, and links to a few arbitrary external websites. I'd like to rip out the external links, and either remove the Hacked 'Neiman-Marcus' Cookies recipe or move it to a separate page on its own. Thoughts? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:07, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

:What's the Cookbook policy on external links to recipes?  Ideally, B:Cookbooks should aim to provide a few of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes imaginable.  But how do we determine which recipes are the best?  What makes the &quot;Neiman-Marcus&quot; cookies better or worse than the others?  These are the sort of things I'm wondering about.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 22:20, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

::External links are discouraged in general, as they often don't add much to a book. Books should be able to stand on their own without the need to make external references. Linking to recipes outside of the Cookbook itself isn't desirable, unless, for example, it is to an authoritative version of the recipe, or a more in-depth discussion about the history and procedure. Just linking to recipes isn't what the Cookbook is about. See also {{tl|spam}}. 
::Having said that, there's no actual policy position on external links (although it has been suggested that there should be). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:49, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

== Cookbook Search Template ==

I've created a new template that can be used to search the cookbook using the standard wiki search (not google). The template is [[Template:Cookbook Search]], and it looks like this:
{{Cookbook Search}}
We could even add a link to the google search into this template so that all the options are together for the user to use easily. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:24, 10 August 2007 (UTC)
:Absolutely not, thank you very much [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 06:20, 27 August 2008 (UTC)
:Looks like a great idea.  It may take some more edits to perfect it, but I do think the template belongs on the main cookbook page. [[User:Marcus2|Marcus2]] 14:44, 11 August 2007 (UTC)
: Nice, throw it up on the main cookbook page. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:03, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

: Looks good to me, the google search looked ugly anyways. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 16:26, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:Beaut, I like it! Much better, and more likely to help people find recipes and other Cookbook pages now. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:21, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

== mergefrom Chai Book ==

Found this book while categorizing. Looks like a &quot;how to make chai tea&quot;, which means to me it's &quot;recipes for making a type of food&quot;, which is another way to say a &quot;cookbook page&quot;.

== Randomized featured content ==

Hi all. I used to be pretty good at rotating the featured ingredients and recipes every couple of weeks or so. However, recently, I've done a poor job of it, and we've gone months with the same featured content. I think I might have found a solution.

I was doing some portal work over at the English Wikipedia, and I found discussions of randomizing the content of the portals, things like featured articles, pictures, etc. These aren't just random articles appearing, but a randomized choice from a list of hand picked content. They're using a template, [[w:Template:Random portal component]], to accomplish this.

Now, our Table of Contents page is very much like a WP portal, with links to content modules (recipes, ingredients, equipment, cuisines, etc), and the featured item paragraphs at the top. I think if we transwikied the template and its documentation here, to give full credit to the authors, and then starting building up the subpages it needs, in a few days or weeks we'd be ready to switch over to a more dynamic TOC for the Cookbook. Anyone else think it's a good idea? 

I can see other books using this as well. Imagine the [[Spanish]] book having a &quot;Selected verb&quot; and &quot;Selected noun&quot; on its main page or TOC, or the [[Using Firefox]] book having a &quot;selected tip&quot; area. Anyway, I'm getting off target. I just thought I'd run this up the flag pole, and see if anyone saluted. If we think it's a good idea, I can handle the transwikis, as I'm an admin on both projects.

Is the cookbook only for food, or can we add drinks? [[Special:Contributions/82.198.250.9|82.198.250.9]] ([[User talk:82.198.250.9|talk]]) 14:22, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

== Wok? ==

I heard you can cook just about anything in a Wok.  The [[Cookbook:Wok|Wok]] page doesn't go into detail on using a Wok to replace random pieces of cookware in certain situations (steaming with a Wok, boiling, stirfry, searing, etc).

--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] ([[User talk:Bluefoxicy|talk]]) 20:00, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

:You can cook just about anything in any heat-resistant receptacle the stops liquids falling out, for that matter. People tend to use the tools that they have to hand, but some tools are better at certain jobs than others. Woks are really good for stir-frying, whereas large stock pots are really good for boiling. You can still use a stock pot to stir-fry food and a wok for boiling, but there are often better tools at hand.

== Open Source Cookbook resuming activity ==

For those of us who remember the old, OLD comments made here about my Open Source Cookbook (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Cookbook/Archive_1#Moved_from_the_page here] for the original comment), I've finally gotten things in order to get back to work on the PDF'ed version of the book. I do still take submissions, and I've registered a new domain name to get things started, as well as set up a copy of MediaWiki over there for people. The cookbook's new home is http://www.oscookbook.org, and I'm currently working on getting everything set up web-wise [ht.
For the folks who have done so much wonderful work on the WikiBooks cookbook, I would love the opportunity to collaborate with [http://www.all-auto.ro/dezmembrari-auto dezmembrari-auto] se people and help improve the for-print version of the project I started so long ago! &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mabalmer|Mabalmer]] ([[User talk:Mabalmer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mabalmer|contribs]]) 2008-03-09T02:54:47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:G'day Matt, looks good. I'll keep tabs on it to see how it progresses, and might even add the odd recipe or two. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:15, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

== Improvements needed ==

The Cookbook appears to be in a bit of a mess and contributions (and I imagine, readers) seem to be rare these days.  The cookbook should be one of the principle parts of Wikibooks yet it's lacking in many ways.

1. There are very few good quality recipes here - with illustrative pictures, clear instructions, nutritional information and good detail.
2. Too much focus on the main page is given to 'food' as opposed to recipes for things that people actually can make!  When I visit a Cookbook I want to find recipes but (apart from the two featured at the top of the page) instead I have to follow about 2 or 3 links before I get to an actual recipe -&gt; for example click 'British cuisines' then 'Bubble and Squeak'.  Links to pages like 'healthy eating' should at least include examples of such dishes rather than a long essay about what healthy eating actually is.  Maybe there should also be a 'random recipe' link prominently displayed (if there is then it's hard to find)
3. I've often edited the Cookbook but I've never used it for making a meal - there are far many better cooking websites on the Internet - see http://www.recipezaar.com/ and an example recipe http://www.recipezaar.com/87085
4. We should focus on the front page on recipes of the day, healthy dish of the day, a region of the week (Indian this week, Argentinian next week, etc.)  The quoted website is much better although still lacking good photos and doesn't show metric measurements - but strangely the nutritional facts about the dish use metric which may explain why Americans are so obese if they are able to confuse two measuring systems in one page!
5. A link to recently added recipes could be interesting.

:Metric should all was go first, then Imperial if it was made in it second. [[User:MetricCook|There are .3 billion Americans vs. 6.4 billion Metric Users]] ([[User talk:MetricCook|talk]]) 17:26, 19 December 2009 (UTC)MetricCook

:Far too much attention is given to recipes in this book. Yes, we have lots of recipes that haven't been properly polished up to resemble those in a nice recipe book, but what this book really needs is greater attention to the following:
:* Ingredients - many pages are bare stubs, some have information that is wrong or dicey, few are good, and there aren't enough photographs of them
:* Equipment - again, lots of bare stubs, dicey information, plus US-centric stuff that leaves everyone else cold, and again, not enough photographs
:* Techniques - there is actually some pretty good information buried in some of the recipes, and some of our techniques pages are good, but there is much to be done here
:* Measurements - these pages need consolidation, standardisation, explanatory text, and conversion tables
:* Cuisines - this is where Wikibooks could really shine, with people from all parts of the world contributing, and some have - but Wikipedia has vastly better cuisine pages (which could be transwikied as a basis for our pages; some have)
:Recipes are OK, but you can get recipes anywhere. The five points above are far more important, and more relevant for a textbook website (which is what Wikibooks is, if you recall). I hope to get back to it sometime, but have other priorities so am hoping that others will take up the challenge!
:And I don't think the metric-vs-English measures issue is why Americans, and others, are getting fatter - blame [[w:Affluenza|affluenza]] and cheap carbohydrate-rich foods for that. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:28, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

:: I agree that recipes receive too much attention. I would actually not be opposed to nuking every single recipe we have and trying to direct focus to the things which are more encyclopedic and static. As you said, recipes can be found everywhere, and there is essentially an infinite number of them. On the other hand, we have a relatively finite number of cooking techniques and utensils, and only so many ingredients (though still quite a few). Once a recipe is written, it can't really be improved in the same way as an encyclopedia article can, and they just sit there.

::: Why isn't the wiki cookbook put up on a separate wikipage, it's a good idea but the problem as I see it is that it is in faqt not as much a book as it is a database. So I would sugest that it'd be as already pointed out cleaned up and then launched on a separate wiki with the name of wikicook or something...
::://Robert
:::: I second what Robert said.  My cooking skills are fairly rudimentary and I came here hoping to develop them.  But there's no structure to this textbook - no idea where to begin, or how to progress through it.  This book really needs a structure: an introduction and a clear, linear progression. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 22:41, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
::::: P.S. What you have on this page is the index that really should go at the '''back''' of the book.  The recipes should be interspersed into the textbook where they highlight particular techniques or tools. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 00:39, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

=== No nukes, please ===
I really don't think deleting all the recipes would be a good idea. While they are in some sense static, there's no reason that this ''needs'' to be the case. For one thing, variants on a recipe could be entered in using subpages (so if I make a pancake recipe and find a slight variation I like better or need to substitute something, I can make that a variant and link it from the original recipe page). 

I also think the recipes are useful in that they give examples of how the techniques and ingredients are used. However, to do this right it would be good to set up some DPL-readable templates on recipe pages (which is why I wandered onto this page in the first place: see section below). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:16, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

: I was thinking the opposite to most of the above comments.  Recipes are the most important element of the Cookbook.  People aren't interested in pages about 'forks', etc. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:36, 11 May 2008 (UTC)

::I'm not advocating the deletion of all the recipes (and I don't think Kellen is really either); I do think we seriously need to address the other aspects of the cookbook I raised above, but recipes are a necessary part of the book as they demonstrate the concepts that the other aspects should discuss. (But not the most important element - there are lots of recipes available on the Internet, but knowledge about cooking is much less available.)
::For DPL, realise that DPLs in WikiMedia projects can't be sorted nicely; however, I've added a gadget that does sort them, if you want to take advantage of that. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:22, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

::: I don't seriously think people will nuke the recipes, but if I was dictator, I might. As content, I don't really find the recipes interesting; they're not really collaborative, they're widely available, and just about any junk can &quot;qualify.&quot; One of the major things I was doing was formatting and categorizing all the existing recipes, and doing this revealed to me the deep crappiness of a large number of the recipes, which IMO would be best dealt with by deletion. The downside to deletion would be that people are probably motivated to write about techniques and ingredients because they're writing recipes, not the other way around. I agree with Xania that recipes are the &quot;most important part of the Cookbook,&quot; but at this point I tend to think that having a book of ''cooking techniques, equipment, and ingredients'' is a much better fit for a wiki than a ''cookbook''. The reason recipe sites have developed a lot of filtering techniques (search and ratings systems, in particular) is that they know they're going to get a large percentage of &quot;bad&quot; recipes and there has to be some way for their users to recognize these as such. We probably won't be able to have such software here on wikibooks; maybe they'll get something like that on the cooking wikia page, but wikimedia is too slow and wikibooks too low a priority for us to get any sexy features. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:02, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

I'm guessing it's partly a matter of perception. I've been working on the [[Bartending|Bartending Guide]], and have been looking to the Cookbook as a much better model than what the BG currently has. There is a lot of cross-book information that can and should be shared. For example, when talking about cocktail olives, it seems more logical to link to the cookbook's ingredients section on olives than to send people over to Wikipedia. I already see the reverse happening, where various alcohols (like Rum and Vodka) are linked to the BG from the Cookbook. The Bartending Guide is another Wikipedia &quot;dumping ground&quot;, and for the same reasons: Wikipedia is not a cookbook. I think that particular rule is quite annoying, because it has caused several good Wikipedia articles to be gutted of useful information, and the books here be bloated with snippets of information that basically become orphaned (after all, the editors who were interested in it originally are back on Wikipedia).

Should the cookbook be &quot;nuked&quot; and all the recipes be tossed out? Of course not! That's just deletionism taken to the extreme. We have a starting point, and it just needs to be brought back up to the good standards that it once maintained. The [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Food and Drink|WikiProject Food and Drink]] over at Wikipedia is a good starting place to find people at Wikipedia to help. It's currently a small group of people working to improve Wikipedia's F&amp;D articles, but if we get some cross-wiki communications going, the English Wikipedia can become a helpful friend instead of just a &quot;dumper&quot; over here. That's what has happened with the Bartending Guide. Working with the [[w:WP:MIX|Wikiproject Mixed Drinks]] on Wikipedia and the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending|WikiProject Bartending]] here, the amount of &quot;dumping&quot; has sharply decreased. I'm active in both projects, and that has helped to reduce the &quot;us vs. them&quot; attitude that plagued the &quot;bar recipes&quot; of both projects. So, don't &quot;throw the baby out with the bathwater&quot; by dumping the cookbook's contents. Just ask for help with the dumping issue, so that things don't snowball here while working to fix things. I eventually want to help on the Cookbook, but realistically, it's going to be a long time before the BG is finished enough for me to branch out. I'm just hoping that there's still a Cookbook left to work on when I'm done. I also like the DLP suggestions below, and would love to incorporate some of those ideas into the Bartending Guide, but do not know how to do so. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 16:23, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

: There's not really any tension between the Cookbook and wikipedia anymore; all the recipes that were there have been moved and integrated. The problem, my problem anyway, is that I don't think that the recipes fit wikibooks' collaborative model, and as a result we have an ever-growing collection of very low quality recipes, which can't be improved in the same way as a wikipedia article.

== Using DPL for the cookbook ==

About 2 years ago, [[User:Kellen]] had led the charge for getting DynamicPageList enabled here on Wikibooks, at least in large part as an organizational tool for the cookbook. I don't think it ever really went anywhere here, but I've been making great use of it on Wikiversity making the [[v:Bloom Clock/Keys|Bloom Clock keys]], and I think something similar (and simpler) could be done for the cookbook. What I have in mind is something like this:

#All recipe ingredient lists need to be categorized for the DPL to have something to grab onto. Probably the best way to do this would be to use a template that either just adds the categories, or perhaps adds categories at the same time as it organizes ingredients into a table (and creates links to the ingredients, etc.). 
#Ingredient pages could then have a DPL list of all recipes using an ingredient.
#Finally, a simple template could be created for use in the User namespace for finding recipes that use 3 or 4 ingredients.

The third point is the one I'm most interested in: how nice would it be if you could go to the market and pick up a few things that look good, interesting, or that you're curious about, and then come back to Wikibooks and run a DPL script to find a list of recipes you could make. They could also be categorized and searched for by time it takes to cook, ease/difficulty, etc. 

Part of my motivation is also a new clock on Wikiversity, the [[v:Fruit Clock|Fruit Clock]], which among other things will help people keep track of when fruits come into season in their location (including things like squash and tomatoes as fruit, of course). Both the bloom clock and the fruit clock make links to the cookbook for the plants they discuss, so this might help get new contributors and readers as well. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:16, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

: I did a ''lot'' of work categorizing each recipe by the &quot;major ingredients,&quot; so you should be able to get basic, useful, lists from the DPLs. Whether they're sorted or not, and whether they'll contain recipes added in the year... and a half? ... since I finished categorizing the existing recipes is another matter.

I think that wikipedia members should be able to have their own recipe books.  when you see a recipe you  like you click a button that says &quot;add to recipe book&quot; and it adds it to your personal recipe book. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:96.253.105.177|96.253.105.177]] ([[User talk:96.253.105.177|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/96.253.105.177|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Wikiversity ==

Discussion has begun at Wikiversity on how best to launch Wikiversity's own Cooking/Culinary/Food and Drink school.  What I'd like to see is collaboration and interaction between the Cookbook here and School there as much as possible.  I think some of the recent discussions here for how to improve the Cookbook are great; I was just mentioning to [[v:User:Blast|User:Blast]] that it would be great to have thorough pages documenting ingredients, alternative names, how to identify them, preparation principles, how to select when buying, etc.  The whole thorough bit.  One of the big questions in my mind is: what goes on Wikibooks, and what on Wikiversity?  I'd really appreciate brainstorming ideas anyone has on what Wikiversity can do to supplement the Cookbook.  One idea we're planning on implimenting in the next few weeks is to create a Reference Desk of sorts, where people can come in and ask any ingredient- or cooking-related question and get a helpful answer.  What else can we do?  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] ([[User talk:Jade Knight|talk]]) 08:31, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

== Wikicook? ==

I agree with what the user //Robert said; Wikibooks Cookbook is a book, in a way, but it acts more like a database of recipes than an actual book. I'm thinking of proposing Wikicook or Wikirecipes on Meta, but I'd like more opinions on the subject before I actually recommend it. I only see positive effects for having WikiCook as a new wiki, especially with the probability of greater attention.

I say the same think for Wikijunior, but I'd wait until it further matures, as was done with Wikiversity.

: I'm not sure what it is exactly that you have in mind, but be careful that Wikibooks does not allow [[WB:OR|original research]]. A recipe that claims health benefits will need a reliable source. Generally, that blocks &quot;alternative&quot; medicine, but most recipes should be fine. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:17, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

== Dutch oven cooking ==

The page at [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Dutch Oven Cooking]] could be used as a starting point for including tools, techniques and recipes for [[w:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]] cooking in ''Cookbook''. -- [[Special:Contributions/208.81.184.4|208.81.184.4]] ([[User talk:208.81.184.4|talk]]) 18:00, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

== Print Version of the Cookbook ==

Guys, right now I am playing around with the idea of creating a print version of the cookbook.  [[User:Mattwj2002/Collections/Cookbook|Here]] is what I have on my own workspace at the moment.  What do you guys think of this idea?  --[[User:Mattwj2002|Mattwj2002]] ([[User talk:Mattwj2002|talk]]) 06:00, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

== Here's my suggestion ==

As a few people have pointed out, Cookbook is more like a recipe database than a cookbook.  Or a cooking '''text'''book, which is presumably what we're aiming at.  I suggest using a structure something like this:
*Introduction - What is cooking? (heat + food - also touch on non-heat-based food preparation)  What are some of the principles of applying heat to food?  What will we be covering in this book?  Different culinary cultures around the world.
*Part 0 - Preparation - what equipment is needed?  Principles of mise-en-place.
*Part 1 - Frying - an explanation of applying heat through conduction - pros and cons, gotchas (burnt outside, raw inside), food density issues etc.
**Pan-frying - recipe #1: a simple omelette (+suggested variations). 3-4 progressively harder dishes.
*etc. etc.

I'd get started on it myself but unfortunately, I actually came to this page to learn about this stuff, so I'm not really up to contributing in that way. :(  But hopefully you get the idea.

:Also things like how the different types of cooker (gas, electric, induction, microwave) compare and gotchas like the fact that food continues to cook after you take it out of the pan.  Thanks. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 12:06, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
:And what is this thing about 'seasonal cooking' - what is it and why do you do it?  How do you go about combining flavours (sweet, sour, salty etc.).  What herbs do you use when and why?  What's an 'aromatic'? And so on. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 12:12, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

Would be nice to introduce some way of making it easy to compare measurements.
Like for example centi-litre (cl) compared to a tablespoon. It's not my area of expertise but hopefully one of yours. 10:00, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

== Vegan, but what about Raw Vegan ==

I saw cookbook, and right away searched for raw vegan. Unfortunately, it doesnt exist. I would love to see a raw vegan entry, even if it is empty initially. I think having it listed would inspire people to add. I know I would!

== Cookbook index of &quot;National and Ethnic Cuisines&quot; ==

In the &quot;National and Ethnic Cuisines&quot; section on the Cookbook frontpage most of the list is divided into continents or large regions except for &quot;British Cuisine&quot;.  Is there a reason for this?  I'm British but British cuisine (as laughable as it is) doesn't deserve its own place while other more notable and popular cuisines have to be fished out through the regional links.  I'd say that 'Italian', 'Chinese' and 'Indian' are the cuisines of most importance and possibly a few others like 'Mexican', 'Japanese', 'French' and 'Thai'.  This may be English Wikipedia but even us English speakers aren't arrogant (or dumb) enough to claim that British, American, Australian, South African, Canadian or New Zealand cuisines is better than the others.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:23, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

There seem to be two naming schemes in use: cuisine of ____ and ____ cuisine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using More Dimensions==

Julia and Mandelbrot sets can, of course, be constructed in spaces of higher dimension than two, but there is not very much gained with this, if we let the picture be a two-dimensional cut coloured in the usual way. We ought to let the cut be three-dimensional and let the set be seen as a body or a surface coloured in the same way as we have coloured a fractal landscape. We will here let the figure be white and let the light be artificial (with parallel rays), so that the picture becomes in grey-tone the nuance growing darker with the distance.

As to the function, we could let it be a mapping from the space into itself, but if it does not satisfy something corresponding to the Cauchy-Riemann differential-equations, the structure will be as in the non-complex case. These equations cannot be generalized to the three-dimensional space, but they can be generalized to the four-dimensional space, because in the four-dimensional space (in contrast to the three-dimensional space) we can introduce operations of calculation that are a natural extension of the operations of the complex numbers. 

==Properties of Quaternions==
The extension of complex numbers to four dimensions was discovered in 1843 by the Irish mathematician ''W.R. Hamilton'' (1805-65).  Hamilton called his new numbers ''[[wikipedia:Quaternions|quaternions]]''. The quaternions are the numbers of the form ''x + yi + uj + vk'', where ''x'', ''y'', ''u'' and ''v'' are real numbers and where the two new symbols ''j'' and ''k'', like ''i'', satisfy &lt;math&gt;j^2 = k^2&lt;/math&gt; = -1, and where the three symbols are connected by ''ij = k''.

Of these relations it follows that ''jk = i'' and ''ki = j'', but also that ''ji = -k'', that is, ''ji = -ij''. This means that the multiplication for the quaternions is not commutative. But apart from this, the quaternions, like the real numbers and the complex number, make up a ''field'': you can operate with them exactly as you operate with real and complex numbers. The ''skew-field'' of quaternions is an extension of the field of complex numbers, and the quaternions have the same nice and simple properties as the complex numbers. For instance: for a polynomial p(z) of degree n, the equation p(z) = 0 has exactly n roots (some possibly multiple), and if a quaternion function f(z) is differentiable at every point of an open domain (in the quaternions), then it is differentiable any number of times.

Therefore we can without problems generalize the theory of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets to the quaternions: all we have said (critical points, cycles, potential and distance function, ...) is valid almost without modifications - only the field lines need a comment.

==Choices in Rendering Quaternion Fractals==
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatman.jpg|thumb|right|Quaternion Mandelbrot set]]
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatjul.jpg|thumb|right|Quaternion Julia set]]
We need a startegy to get from 4 dimensional patterns to 2 dimensions.  We assume that our function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; (''z'' quaternion) is a polynomial with real coefficients, and that it only contains powers of even degree (e.g. &lt;math&gt;f(z) = pz^2 + qz^4&lt;/math&gt;), for then the three-dimensional subspace spanned by 1, ''i'' and ''j'' is left invariant by the iterations, and therefore we can restrict ourselves to this space. The critical points are complex numbers lying symmetrically around the x-axis, and we construct the Mandelbrot set from a finite critical point and ∞. A Julia set is a fractal surface, and we ought to have two ways of drawing: the filled-in Julia set, which is the complement to the Fatou domain containing ∞, and a Julia set with field lines in the inner Fatou domains (partly because there is nothing to see in an inner Fatou domain, and that the field lines are very decorative, partly because the picture is drawn faster when the domain is filled with field lines, because these lines stop the drawing procedure).

In the space we imagine a plane parallel with the ''x,y''-plane with which we intersect the fractal and look at the part of it lying back (or &quot;below&quot;) the plane. The intensity of the light is determined by the distance &quot;down&quot; to the fractal. The intersection plane parallel with the base plane (the ''x,y''-plane) is given by a height ''h''. For the Mandelbrot set the height must be positive, as we are not interested in the part lying under the ''x,y''-plane (because the Mandelbrot set is symmetric around the base plane and abates on the opposite side). The nuance of the colour is calculated by consecutive estimations of the distance to the boundary and, on the basis of these estimations, approximations in steps becoming smaller and smaller. If the boundary is too thin, the sequence of approximation may jump past the fractal (giving a black dot).

===Technical Detail of Calculation===
We can let the next step down be half of the estimated distance, but we must arrange the program so that we can make the steps smaller if there are faults in the picture. We must choose a little number ''stepmin'', so that if the calculated step ''u'' is smaller than this number, we set ''u = stepmin''. For each step, we add the calculated step to a number starting with 0, and when we have reached the boundary (or the interior of the Mandelbrot set or a filled-in Julia set or a field line), we divide the distance by the highest allowable distance, which in case of a Mandelbrot set is the height ''h'' of the plane, and in case of a Julia set is ''h'' + the maximum distance we can go below the base plane (e.g. 2). The result is a number in the interval [0, 1], and we construct a grey-tone scale indexed by the numbers t in this interval, such that 0 corresponds to white and 1 to black. We can, for instance, let the colour have (equal) RGB-values that are the integral part of the number &lt;math&gt;255/(1+turndown+tan(t \pi/2)/intensity)^{exponent}&lt;/math&gt;, with three parameters to adjust the nuance.

For the Mandelbrot set the iteration stops when the maximum number of iterations is reached or when the iterated point is outside a sphere of a very large radius. In the latter case we calculate the distance to the boundary, and let this number determine the next step down. The same applies to a filled-in Julia set. For an inner Fatou domain, the iteration stops when a point in the sequence is within a given little distance from a (given) point in the cycle. As we do not calculate the real iteration number, we need not calculate the attraction of the cycle, but we must know the order of the cycle and (on account of the field lines) the unit-quaternion corresponding to the angle of rotation in the complex case.

==Relation between Quaternion and Complex Fractals==
The intersection of the Mandelbrot set with the complex plane (that is, the base plane) is the corresponding complex Mandelbrot set, and this lies symmetrically around the x-axis (because the coefficients in our formula are real). The quaternion-Mandelbrot set (in the 3-dimensional space) is obtained by rotating the complex Mandelbrot set around the x-axis. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is thus a rotary symmetric fractal surface with the x-axis as generator, and it consists consequently of circles around the x-axis. The Julia set associated to a point in the complex plane (that is, of height 0) also consists of circles around the x-axis. But for a point outside the complex plane the Julia set consists of closed curves or segments of curves lying askew   in relation to the x-axis. In these fractal surfaces the structure is only fractal in one direction: in the direction orthogonal to this it will have the true character of a curve - a phenomenon we have seen in the non-complex fractals.

==The Field Lines==

[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatfield1.jpg|thumb|right|Field lines]]
[[Image:Juliasetsdkpictquatfield2.jpg|thumb|right|Field lines]]The norm of the quaternion ''z = x + yi + uj + vk'' is the real number |''z''| = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + u^2 + v^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and ''z'' can be written as the product of the norm and a unit-quaternion (quaternion of norm 1), this unit-quaternion is the ''argument'' of ''z''.

In our case where the fourth coordinate is 0, the argument is a point on the unit-sphere. And the little circle around one of the points in the cycle, which in the complex case stops the iteration, must now be replaced by a little sphere, and the field lines are constructed on the basis of regularly situated domains on this sphere. As such, we can choose the domains that result from a regularly decomposition of the equator circle and from the projection onto this.

===Technical Detail of Calculation===

The technique used to draw the field lines is, however, a little complicated. Drawing is done by working our way down in as large steps as possible, but now it must be examined if a field line is hit. As the steps initially are large, we risk jumping past the field line, therefore we must (by a trial iteration) examine if a field line is in our way, and if so, alter the further procedure. If a field line is in our way, we must go forward in smaller steps, and when it is hit, we must go backwards and forwards in smaller and smaller steps, in order to find the precise point of intersection with the field line. The steps we go down are usually (that is, when we disregard field lines) half of the estimated distance, and we may now have to reduce the steps.

If we set &lt;math&gt;g(z) = f(z) + c&lt;/math&gt;, and if the order of the attracting cycle is ''r'' and if ''z*'' is a point in the cycle, then ''z*'' is a fixed point for &lt;math&gt;g(g(...g(z)))&lt;/math&gt; (the ''r''-fold composition), and near ''z*'' this map has (in connection with field lines) character of a ''rotation'' with the argument &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of the quaternion &lt;math&gt;(d(f(f(...f(z))))/dz)_{z*}&lt;/math&gt; = the product of the quaternions &lt;math&gt;f'(z_i)&lt;/math&gt;, for the ''r'' points in the cycle.

A given direction &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (= quaternion of norm 1) outgoing from ''z*'' determines a field line, and this consists of the points ''z'' such that if the argument of &lt;math&gt;z_k - z*&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; = the last point in the iteration), then &lt;math&gt;\psi \beta^{-k} = \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we must know the ''k'''th power of a unit-quaternion, and this can be calculated by this formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (x, y, u, v)^k = (cos(k \kappa), ty, tu, tv)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is an angle such that &lt;math&gt;x = cos(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; and where t is calculated recursively by the following operation performed ''k'' times and starting with ''t'' = 0 and ''i'' = 0:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t = cos(i \kappa) + tx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i = i + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Let ''n'' be the number of field lines and let ''t'' be their relative thickness (a number in the interval [0, 1]). For the point ''z'', we have calculated &lt;math&gt;\psi \beta^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a unit-quaternion and therefore corresponds to a point on the unit sphere. As the domains of this determining the field lines are chosen such that they result from a regular decomposition of the equator circle, the condition depends only on the argument of the projection of this quaternion on the complex plane. If ''v'' is this angle (chosen in the interval [0, 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;[) divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, then ''z'' belongs to a field line if ''|v - i/n| &lt; t/(2n)'', for one of the integers ''i'' = 0, 1, ..., ''n''.

However, as we want to know if a field line is in our way, we do first perform a pre-calculation which calculates the distance to the boundary and determines the field line in question, and this is the one having the number ''i'' such that ''|v - i/n| &lt; 1/(2n)''. We calculate the number ''d = 2n|v - i/n| - t''. If d is negative, the point ''z'' actually belongs to the field line, and the point is coloured white. Otherwise, we regard ''d'' as a measure for the distance to the field line, and we multiply the calculated step by ''d'', so that the steps become smaller when we are near a field line.

We must find the precise point in our way down where the field line is hit. Therefore we go backwards and forwards in smaller and smaller steps. We call the actual height ''h1'' and the old height ''h2''. When we for the first time are inside a field line, we set ''h3 = h1'' and ''h1 = (h1 + h2)/2'', and calculate again if we are inside the field line. If no, we set ''h2 = h1'' and ''h1 = (h1 + h3)/2'', if yes we set ''h3 = h1'' and ''h1 = (h1 + h2)/2''. We do this until ''h2 - h1 &lt; stepmin''. The distance to the field line is then ''h - h1'' (''h'' is the height of the plane).

      <comment>/* The Drawing in More Details */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If, in a three-dimensional coordinate system, we imagine the plane with the Mandelbrot or the Julia set as the ''x,y''-plane and plot the distance function in the ''z''-direction, we have a surface looking like a landscape, and we can see it from the side. Such a picture has to be drawn from the top and downwards (on the screen), and from the far distance towards the near (in the landscape), so that something will grow and hide what was previously drawn.

The distance function can have singularities, which means that the surface has points in which it grows towards infinity. As these vigorous rises are unaesthetic if they are numerous and dominant, we must modify the distance function (third picture). We can also modify it in order to create a more interesting landscape (second picture).

We can let the light be &quot;natural&quot;, like the light from the sun. Then we imagine the rays are parallel (and given by two angles), and we let the colour of a point on the surface be determined by the angle between this direction and the slope of the surface at the point. The intensity (on the earth) is independent of the distance, but the light grows whiter because of the atmosphere, and sometimes the ground looks as if it is enveloped in a veil of mist (second picture). We can also let the light be &quot;artificial&quot;, as if it issues from a lantern held by the observer. In this case the colour must grow darker with the distance (third picture).

We look at the landscape in a direction inclining downward from the eye, and the drawing window has this line as normal in its centre. A vertical line (of pixels) in the drawing window corresponds to a line in the base plane with the fractal. And for each of these lines, we start in the point farthest back and go towards the observer colouring pixels in the corresponding vertical line of the window in the following way: If p is a point on the line in the base plane, we calculate the value of the distance function in p. If the line from this point on the surface to the eye intersects the window, we shall colour this pixel. We calculate the slope of the surface in the point, by calculating the distance function in two points very near p in the x- and y-direction. The little triangle spanned by the three values lies on the surface. We take the scalar product of the normal (unit) vector of the triangle and the direction (unit) vector of the light - in case of artificial light this is the direction vector from the eye to the point.

This number (multiplied by the density) can be combined with other factors determining the colour: the height over the ground or the distance to the observer, for instance.

From the scalar product of the normal (unit) vector of the surface and the direction vector to the observer, we can approximately calculate the distance we must go towards the observer in order to colour the adjacent pixel above or below the just coloured pixel (for rise or fall of the landscape in the direction towards the observer, respectively). As this calculation cannot be exact, the steps must possibly be diminished by a factor. We stop the drawing for this line, when we are so near the observer that the bottom pixel of this vertical line of the window is coloured - possibly we do continue the drawing, if something grows up nearer the observer and we want this to be seen. Instead of finishing a vertical line before we go to the next, we can make the drawing looking more fascinating by going to the next vertical line for each step towards the observer, so that the drawing looks like a wave motion from the top and downwards.

The surface is primary constructed from a function proportional to the distance function, but the program should be made so that this function can be worked up. In the first turn the singularities should be made finite by choosing a relative maximum height ''hm0''. This number times the width of the section is the maximum height ''hm'' in the landscape, and we can replace the height ''h'' by ''hm * arctan(h/hm)'', for instance. The (constant) number ''hm'' should however be made varying, by dividing it by a number proportional to the exponential function of the real iteration number, in order to lower the maximum height near the boundary. Instead of making the singularities finite, we can simply cut them down by replacing ''h'' by ''hm'' when ''h'' &gt; ''hm''. We can also regulate ''h'' by dividing it by &lt;math&gt;1 + (h/hm)^2&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, or we can convert the singularities to craters by replacing ''h'' by &lt;math&gt;hm^2/h&lt;/math&gt; when ''h'' &gt; ''hm''.

Furthermore, the surface can be smoothed out by multiplying ''h'' by (for instance) the number &lt;math&gt;1 - arctan(a*s^b)/(\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the slope of the surface and ''a'' and ''b'' are parameters determining the effect.

For natural light, we can get the colour growing whiter (mist) or darker with the distance and the height, by mixing the colour with grey or black, respectively, according to this number (in the interval [0, 1]): &lt;math&gt;arctan(a * (dist/maxdist)^b + c/(1 + d*h))/(\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a, b, c'' and ''d'' are parameters determining the effect.

For artificial light, we can get the colour growing darker with the distance, by mixing with black according to the number &lt;math&gt;arctan(l*s*(width/dist)^e)/(\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the scalar product of the direction vector from the eye and the slope (unit) vector, and ''l'' and ''e'' are parameters determining the effect.

===The Drawing in More Details===

We must start by choice of a scale which we apply for both the window and the landscape, namely by assigning a distance ''gg'' to the width ''ww'' (in pixels) of the window (or the picture). Then the width of a pixel is ''hh = gg/ww'', and in the coordinate system in the window having the centre as origo, the line ''i'' pixels from the left border has abscissa ''xs = -gg/2 + i×hh''.

The landscape is seen from a point on the ''z''-axis having ''z''-coordinate ''z0'', along a line ''lc'' in the direction of the (positive) ''y''-axis which intersects this in a point having ordinate ''yc''. The fractal motif is displaced such that this point (0, ''yc'') in the base plane becomes the centre of the fractal motif: if the real centre of the fractal motif is (''x1'', ''y1''), we add (''x1'', ''y1'') to the coordinate set in the ''x-y''-system when we calculate the height and the slope.

The line (in the ''y-z''-plane) from ''z0'' orthogonal to ''lc'', intersects the ''y''-axis in a point having ''y''-coordinate -''yv'' (''yv'' positive), this point is the ''vanishing point'' (seeming infinitely far away from the observer). We let ''d'' (= ''yc+yv'') be the distance from the vanishing point to the base point ''yc''. If ''m'' is the distance ''lc'' (from the observer to the base point) divided by the distance from the observer to the window, the vertical line in the window having abscissa ''xs'', corresponds to the line in the base plane going through the vanishing point (0, -''yv'') and the point (''m×xs'', ''yc''). And the point on this line having ordinate ''y'', has abscissa ''m×xs×(d + y - yc)/d''.

Now we choose a vertical line in the window (lying ''i'' pixels from the left and thus having abscissa ''xs = -gg/2 + i×hh)'', and we will colour this line by going along the corresponding line in the base plane from the distant towards the near. Assume that we on this line have reached the point having ordinate ''y''. This point has abscissa ''m×xs×(d + y - yc)/d'', and we shall calculate the height ''z'' and the slope ''s'' of the surface at the point having abscissa ''x1 + m×xs×(d + y - yc)/d'' and ordinate ''y1 + y - yc''. In the ''y-z''-plane we have the line segment ''lz'' from the observer (0, ''z0'') to (''y'', ''z''). The pixel in the window to be coloured (lying ''i'' pixels from the left), lies ''j'' pixels from the top, where ''j'' is the integral part of the number ''wh/2 - wj×tan(acz)'', here ''wh'' is the height of the window (in pixels), ''wj'' is the distance from the observer to the window also measured in pixels, and ''acz'' is the angle from ''lc'' to ''lz''.

After this pixel have been coloured, we must estimate the ordinate ''dy'' of step we shall go forward (in the direction of the negative ''y''-axis) in order to colour the next (adjacent) pixel (above or below). In the ''y-z''-plane we have the line segment ''ly'' from the observer (0, ''z0'') to (''y'', 0). We let ''ay'' be the angle from the (negative) ''z''-axis to ''ly'' and let ''ayz'' be the angle from ''ly'' to ''lz''. If we set

::&lt;math&gt;p = \left(1 + \frac{tan(ayz)}{tan(ay)}\right)\cdot \frac{cos(ay)}{ly} + \left|sin(ay)\right|\cdot \frac{s - z\cdot\frac{y - s(z0 - z)}{lz^2}}{cos(ayz)\cdot lz}&lt;/math&gt;,

''dy'' is given by

::&lt;math&gt;dy = cos(acz)^2/(wh p)&lt;/math&gt;,

that is, the new ''y'' is ''y - dy''.

As this is only an estimation (found by differential calculus), we must arrange the program so that we can multiply the steps ''dy'' by a factor ''r'' &lt; 1.

The drawing of the vertical line in the window is finished when the last pixel is drawn (number ''wh'' from the top) ''and'' when the new ''y'' is smaller than a certain ''y'' value depending on the situation of the lower border of the window, on the visual angle and on whether the landscape is turned upwards or downwards (when the surface is below the base plane and the visual angle is small, this ''y'' value can lie rather far behind the lower border of the window).

===Gaps Between the Iteration Bands===

There is a circumstance which can make it necessary to move forward in smaller steps, namely the tendency for gaps to develop between iteration bands, especially if a largish power appears in the formula. At the moving towards the boundary, the value of the distance function becomes smaller and smaller, but at the curves where the iteration number is increased by 1, there is a tendency towards that the calculated distance is a little smaller than it should be. The reason is, that the iteration number used in the calculation of the distance estimation must be very large, and this presupposes that the bail out radius is very small (- or very large for iteration towards infinity), but ''if'' the bail out radius is as small as it ought to be, the colouring between the iteration bands becomes unclean, because the calculation of the slope is uncertain - in the same way as a fractal picture always becomes unclean when we zoom in sufficiently many times: the precision of the computer is no more enough.

===Interpolation===

We can solve the problem with gaps between the iteration bands by applying interpolation: if (in the downward drawing, that is, the drawing of the visual side of the surface) the next pixel drawn is not the pixel next below, we can fill the gap by applying interpolation of the colour values. With this technique we can always produce a picture which is without perceptible faults. Furthermore, the technique means that if we let the reducing factor ''r'' be larger than 1, we can draw a picture which is good enough for choice of motif and colouring very fast (faster than usual fractal pictures, because the fine fractal pattern is lesser discernible).

===Drawing Pixel for Pixel===

The above drawing method is rather effective because we estimate beforehand the situation of the next pixel to be drawn. However, every time something grows up and hide the previous drawn, pixels are drawn again. Furthermore, the irregular way of drawing means that a well working program can be rather complicated (interpolation and calculation of the place in the landscape where to start at the top and stop at the bottom). It is possible to make a simpler program where the picture is drawn regularly from pixel to pixel, implying that each pixel is coloured only one time, but then several calculations are necessary for each pixel. For a given pixel on the screen we go in steps along the line from the observer through this pixel, and we stop when the calculations show that we are below the surface. In principle we could let the steps have one and the same size, but then this size had to be very small and the number of calculations would consequently be very large. Fortunately we have a tool by which we can adjust the steps so that they at first are rather large and then become smaller in the right rate, namely the distance estimation by which the landscape is constructed. But this method presupposes (or rather, works best) when the landscape is turned downwards, that is, formed below instead of above the base plane, because we then can start the stepwise approximation at the point where the line from the observer intersects the base plane and because we can let (the horizontal extent of) all the steps be ruled by the distance estimation.

From the point where the line from the observer intersects the base plane, we go successively forward in steps whose projection on the base plane is half of the estimated distance, for instance. At each step we calculate the height of the step point (on the line) and the height of the surface (below or above this point), and continue as long as the first is smaller than the later. When this is no more the case, we are below the surface, and then we must go backwards and possibly again forwards. Also these steps must be ruled by the distance estimation, because they must be smaller near the boundary. We can let step be ''e×d×dist'', where ''dist'' is the distance estimation and ''e'' = ±1 for the step point above/below the surface, and where ''d'' is a factor which is at first fixed to a given small number (e.g. 0.5) and which is divided by 2 every time ''e'' alters sign. We perform the stepwise approximation until the difference between the two heights is smaller than a given smal number, ''or'' until the maximum iteration number or the boundary is reached, or the number of performed operations is larger than a given large number in order to ensure that the procedure stops. If the found point on the surface corresponds to the complex number ''z'' (in the base plane), we calculate the height of the surface at two points very near ''z'' in the ''x''- and ''y''-direction, in order to find the slope of the surface.

===Shade effect===

We can (as the pictures below show) get the landscape to look more realistic by drawing shades (in the case of natural light or light not coming from the observer): a point on the surface is in shade, and thus made darker, if the line from the point in the direction of the light source has a point below the surface. The method is most profitable in the case of a turned downwards landscape, but even in this case it can be necessary to perform calculations for points outside the visible part of the landscape (unless the light source is above the visible part of the landscape):

1. Identify five independent variables that you believe affect trip generation. Pose hypotheses about how each variable affects number of trips generated.

2. Identify three different types of trip distribution models. Which one includes the most information? Which one is most common?

3. You are given the following situation: The towns of Saint Cloud and Minneapolis, separated by 110 km as the crow flies, are to be connected by a railroad, a freeway, and a rural highway. Answer the following questions related to this problem


Trip Generation and Distribution


Your planners have estimated the following models for the AM Peak Hour

&lt;math&gt;
T_i = 500 + 0.5 * HH
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
T_j = 250 + 0.5 * OFFEMP_j + 0.355 * OTHEMP_j + 0.094 * RETEMP_j
&lt;/math&gt;

Where: 
&lt;math&gt;
T_i = &lt;/math&gt;Person Trips Originating in Zone i


&lt;math&gt;
T_j = &lt;/math&gt;Person Trips Destined for Zone j


&lt;math&gt;
HH_i = &lt;/math&gt; Number of Households in Zone i


&lt;math&gt;
OFFEMP_j = &lt;/math&gt;Office Employees in Zone j


&lt;math&gt;
OTHEMP_j = &lt;/math&gt;Other Employees in Zone j


&lt;math&gt;
RETEMP_j = &lt;/math&gt;Retail Employees in Zone j


Your are also given the following data

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Saint Cloud !! Minneapolis
|-
| HHi || 47,604 || 476,040
|-
| OFFEMPj || 33,675 || 336,750
|-
| OTHEMPj || 14,500 || 145,000
|-
| RETEMPj || 22,000 || 220,000

|}
			
		
		
		

The travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! To Minneapolis !! To Saint Cloud
|-
| From Minneapolis || 5 || 70
|-
| From Saint Cloud || 70 || 5
|}
			

(a) (10) What are the number of AM peak hour person trips originating in and destined for Saint Cloud and Minneapolis.

(b) (10) Assuming the origins are more accurate, normalize the number of destination trips for Saint Cloud and Minneapolis.

(c) (10) Assume a gravity model where the impedance &lt;math&gt;f(Cij) = C_{ij}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. Estimate the proportion of trips that go from Saint Cloud to Minneapolis. Solve your matrix within 5 percent of a balanced solution.

1. Identify five independent variables that you believe affect mode choice. Pose hypotheses about how each variable affects share of travel by each mode.

2. Explain Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives

3. You are given the following mode choice model. 

&lt;math&gt;
U_{ij} = -2 C_{ijm} + 5 D_T -5 D_W 
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
&lt;math&gt;C_{ijm} = &lt;/math&gt; travel time between i and j by mode m

&lt;math&gt;D_T = &lt;/math&gt; dummy variable (alternative specific constant) for transit

&lt;math&gt;D_W = &lt;/math&gt; dummy variable (alternative specific constant) for walking

Here auto is assumed the baseline mode.

The auto travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Origin \ Destination !! To Dakotopolis !! To New Fargo
|-
| From Dakotopolis || 5 || 9
|-
| From New Fargo || 9 || 4

|}
		


The transit travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Origin \ Destination !! To Dakotopolis !! To New Fargo
|-
| From Dakotopolis || 10 || 15
|-
| From New Fargo || 15 || 8

|}



The walk travel time between zones (in minutes) is given by the following matrix:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Origin \ Destination !! To Dakotopolis !! To New Fargo
|-
| From Dakotopolis || 10 || 30
|-
| From New Fargo || 30 || 10

|}


Using a logit model, what is the probability of a traveler taking transit?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Homework ==
1. If trip distribution depends on travel times, and travel times depend on the trip table (resulting from trip distribution) that is assigned to the road network, how do we solve this problem (conceptually)?

2. Do drivers behave in a system optimal or a user optimal way? How can you get them to move from one to the other.

3. Identify a mechanism that can ensure the system optimal outcome is achieved in route assignment, rather than the user equilibrium. Why would we want such an outcome? What are the drawbacks to the mechanism you identified?

4. Assume the flow from Dakotopolis to New Fargo, is 5300 vehicles per hour. The flow is divided between two parallel facilities, a freeway and an arterial. Flow on the freeway is denoted &lt;math&gt;Q_f&lt;/math&gt;, and flow on the two-lane arterial is denoted &lt;math&gt;Q_r&lt;/math&gt;. The travel time on the freeway (&lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:

&lt;math&gt;C_f = 5 + Q_f/1000&lt;/math&gt;

The travel time on the arterial (Cr) is given by

&lt;math&gt;C_r = 7 + Q_r/500.&lt;/math&gt;

(a)	Apply Wardrop's User Equilibrium Principle, and determine the flow and travel time on both routes from Dakotopolis to New Fargo. 

(b)	Solve for the System Optimal Solution and determine the flow and travel time on both routes. 

5. Given a flow of 10,000 vehicles from origin to destination traveling on three parallel routes. Flow on each route A, B, or C is designated with &lt;math&gt;Q_A, Q_B, Q_C&lt;/math&gt; in the Time Function Respectively. Apply Wardrop's Network Equilibrium Principle (Users Equalize Travel Times on all used routes), and determine the flow on each route. 


&lt;math&gt;T_A = 500 + 20Q_A&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_B = 1000 + 10Q_B&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_C = 2000 + 30Q_C&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PL/SQL==
===Introduction===
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extension of SQL. It is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages and it enhances the capabilities of SQL by injecting the procedural functionality, like conditional or looping statements, into the set-oriented SQL structure.

===Advantages of PL/SQL===
* Procedural Language Capability: PL/SQL consists of procedural language constructs such as conditional statements (if else statements) and loops like (FOR loops).
* Block Structures: PL/SQL consists of blocks of code, which can be nested within each other. Each block forms a unit of a task or a logical module. PL/SQL Blocks can be stored in the database and reused.
* Better Performance: PL/SQL engine processes multiple SQL statements simultaneously as a single block, thereby reducing network traffic. 
* Exception Handling: PL/SQL handles exceptions (or errors) effectively during the execution of a PL/SQL program. Once an exception is caught, specific actions can be taken depending upon the type of the exception or it can be displayed to the user with a message.

===Limitation===
PL/SQL can only use SELECT, DML(INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE) and TC(COMMIT,ROLLBACK,SAVEPOINT) statements, DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) and DCL(GRANT, REVOKE) cannot be used.

===Basic Structure===
Each PL/SQL program consists of SQL and PL/SQL statements which form a PL/SQL block. A PL/SQL Block consists of three sections: 

'''Declaration Section:'''
This section is optional and it starts with the reserved keyword DECLARE. This section is used to declare any placeholders like variables, constants, records and cursors, which are used to manipulate data in the execution section. 

'''Execution Section:'''
This section is mandatory and it starts with the reserved keyword BEGIN and ends with END. This section is where the program logic is written to perform any task. The programmatic constructs like loops, conditional statement and SQL statements form the part of execution section. 

'''Exception Section''':
The section is optional and it starts with the reserved keyword EXCEPTION. Any exception in the program can be handled in this section, so that the PL/SQL Blocks terminates gracefully. If the PL/SQL Block contains exceptions that cannot be handled, the block terminates abruptly with errors.

Every statement in the above three sections must end with a ; (semicolon). PL/SQL blocks can be nested within other PL/SQL blocks. Comments can be used to document code. 

This is how PL/SQL looks. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
/* multi-lines comments */
-- single line comments
DECLARE 
    Variable declaration
BEGIN 
    Program Execution 
EXCEPTION 
    Exception handling
END;
&lt;/source&gt;

===PL/SQL Placeholders===
Placeholders are temporary storage area. Placeholders can be any of Variables, Constants and Records. Oracle defines placeholders to store data temporarily, which are used to manipulate data during the execution of a PL SQL block. 

Depending on the kind of data you want to store, you can define placeholders with a name and a datatype. Few of the datatypes used to define placeholders are as given below. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
Number(n,m), Char(n), Varchar2(n), Date, Long, Long Raw, Raw, Blob, Clob, Nclob, Bfile 
&lt;/source&gt;
The placeholders, that store the values, can change through the PL/SQL Block. 

====PL/SQL Variables====
The General Syntax to declare a variable is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
variable_name datatype [NOT NULL := value ]; 
&lt;/source&gt;
* variable_name is the name of the variable.
* datatype is a valid PL/SQL datatype. 
* NOT NULL is an optional specification on the variable. If NOT NULL is specified, you must provide the initial value.
* value or DEFAULT value is also an optional specification, where you can initialize a variable.
* Each variable declaration is a separate statement and must be terminated by a semicolon. 

The below example declares two variables, one of which is a not null.
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
DECLARE 
  emp_id varchar2(10);
  salary number(9,2) NOT NULL := 1000.00;
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of a variable can change in the execution or exception section of the PL/SQL Block. We can assign values to variables in the two ways given below. 

1) Directly assign value to variable. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
variable_name:=  value;
&lt;/source&gt;

2) Assign values to variables directly from the database columns.
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
SELECT column_name
INTO variable_name 
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];  
&lt;/source&gt;

The example below will get the salary of an employee with id '12345' and display it on the screen.
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
DECLARE
  var_emp_id varchar2(10) = 'A12345'; 
  var_salary number(9,2);  
BEGIN 
  SELECT salary
  INTO var_salary
  FROM employee
  WHERE emp_id = var_emp_id;
  dbms_output.put_line(var_salary);
  dbms_output.put_line('Employee ' || var_emp_id || ' earns salary ' || var_salary); 
END; 
/
&lt;/source&gt;
NOTE: The slash '/' indicates to execute the above PL/SQL Block. 

====PL/SQL Records====
Records are composite datatypes, which contains a combination of different scalar datatypes like char, varchar, number etc.  Each scalar data types in the record holds a value. A record can store values of a row in a table. 

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
TYPE record_name IS RECORD 
  (col_name_1 datatype, 
   col_name_2 table_name.column_name%type); 
&lt;/source&gt;
A datatype can be declared in the same way as you create a table, like col_name_1. If a field is based on a column from database table, you can define the datatype as col_name_2. You can also use %type method to declare datatype of variable and constant.
Similar to %type, if all the fields of a record are based on the columns of a table, it can be declared by using %rowtype method.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
record_name table_name%ROWTYPE;
&lt;/source&gt;

For Example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  TYPE rec_employee IS RECORD 
   (emp_id          varchar2(10), 
    emp_last_name   employees.last_name%type, 
    emp_dept        employees.dept%type,
    salary          number(9,2)
   ); 
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  rec_employee employees%ROWTYPE; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Declaring the record as a ROWTYPE
Advantages:
1) Do not need to explicitly declare variables for all the columns in a table.
2) If the column specification in the database table is altered, the code does not need to update.

Disadvantage:
1) When a record is created as a ROWTYPE, fields will be created for all the columns in the table and memory will be used to create the datatype for all the fields. 

'''Assign values to record'''
Similar to variable, you can assign value to record either by direct assign or through the SELECT statements
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
record_name.col_name := value;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
SELECT col_1, col_2 
INTO record_name.col_name_1, record_name.col_name_2 
FROM table_name 
[WHERE condition]; 
&lt;/source&gt;
If the records is declared as ROWTYPE, SELECT * can be used to assign values.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
SELECT * INTO record_name
FROM table_name 
[WHERE condition]; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The column value of the record can be retrieved as below syntax
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
var_name := record_name.col_name; 
&lt;/source&gt;

====Scope of Variables and Records====
PL/SQL allows the nesting of Blocks within Blocks i.e, the Execution section of an outer block can contain inner blocks. Variables which are accessible to an outer Block are also accessible to all nested inner blocks; however, the variables declared in the inner blocks are not accessible to the outer blocks. 

Based on their declaration we can classify variables into two types. 
*Local variables - These are declared in a inner block and cannot be referenced by outer blocks.
*Global variables - These are declared in an outer block and can be referenced by its itself and by its inner blocks. 

In the below example, two variables are created in the outer block and assigning their product to the third variable created in the inner block. The variables 'var_num1' and 'var_num2' can be accessed anywhere in the block; however, the variable 'var_result' is declared in the inner block, so it cannot be accessed in the outer block.  
&lt;source lang=&quot;plsql&quot;&gt;
DECLARE
  var_num1 number;
  var_num2 number;
BEGIN 
  var_num1 := 100; 
  var_num2 := 200; 
  DECLARE 
    var_result number;
  BEGIN
    var_result := var_num1 * var_num2; 
  END;
  /* var_result is not accessible to here */ 
END; 
/
&lt;/source&gt;

====PL/SQL Constants====
As the name implies a constant is a value used in a PL/SQL Block that remains unchanged throughout the program. A constant is a user-defined literal value. You can declare a constant and use it instead of actual value.

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;
&lt;/source&gt;
For example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  comm_pct CONSTANT number(3) := 10; 
&lt;/source&gt;

You must assign a value to the constant while declaring it. If you assign a value to the constant later, Oracle will prompt exception. 

===PL/SQL Conditional Statements===
PL/SQL supports programming language features like conditional statements, iterative statements.

The syntax of conditional statements:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
IF condition_1 THEN 
 statement_1; 
 statement_2; 
[ELSIF condtion_2 THEN 
 statement_3;] 
[ELSE 
 statement_4;] 
END IF;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note: be aware of the keyword ELSIF, there is no 'E' before 'IF'.

===PL/SQL Iterative Statements===
An iterative statements are used when you want to repeat the execution of one or more statements for specified number of times. There are three types of loops in PL/SQL:

'''1. Simple Loop'''
A Simple Loop is used when a set of statements is to be executed at least once before the loop terminates. An EXIT condition must be specified in the loop, otherwise the loop will get into an infinite number of iterations. When the EXIT condition is satisfied the process exits from the loop.

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
LOOP 
  statements; 
  EXIT; 
  {or EXIT WHEN condition;}
END LOOP; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
a) Initialize a variable before the loop body.
b) Increment the variable in the loop.
c) Use a EXIT WHEN statement to exit from the Loop. If you use a EXIT statement without WHEN condition, the statements in the loop is executed only once.

'''2. While Loop'''
A WHILE LOOP is used when a set of statements has to be executed as long as a condition is true. The condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. The iteration continues until the condition becomes false.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
WHILE &lt;condition&gt; 
 LOOP statements; 
END LOOP; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
a) Initialize a variable before the loop body.
b) Increment the variable in the loop.
c) EXIT WHEN statement and EXIT statements can be used in while loops it is seldom used.

'''3. FOR Loop'''
A FOR LOOP is used to execute a set of statements for a pre-determined number of times. Iteration occurs between the start and end integer values given. The counter is always incremented by 1. The loop exits when the counter reaches the value of the end integer.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
FOR counter IN start_val..end_val 
  LOOP statements; 
END LOOP; 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
a) The counter variable is implicitly declared in the declaration section, so it's not necessary to declare it explicitly.
b) The counter variable is incremented by 1 and does not need to be incremented explicitly.
c) EXIT WHEN statement and EXIT statements can be used in FOR loops but it is seldom used.

===PL/SQL Cursors===
A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed by it. This temporary work area is used to store the data retrieved from the database, and manipulate this data. A cursor can hold more than one row, but can process only one row at a time. The set of rows the cursor holds is called the active set. 

There are two types of cursors in PL/SQL: 

====Implicit cursor:====
When you execute DML statements like DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE and SELECT..INTO statements, implicit statements are created to process these statements.

Oracle provides few attributes called as implicit cursor attributes to check the status of DML operations. The cursor attributes available are %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, %ROWCOUNT, and %ISOPEN.

For example, When you execute INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements the cursor attributes tell us whether any rows are affected and how many have been affected.
When a SELECT... INTO statement is executed in a PL/SQL Block, implicit cursor attributes can be used to find out whether any row has been returned by the SELECT statement. PL/SQL returns an error when no data is selected.

The status of the cursor for each of these attributes are defined in the below table.  
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Attribute !! Return Value 
|-
| SQL%FOUND || The return value is TRUE, if the DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE affect at least one row and if SELECT ….INTO statement return at least one row.
The return value is FALSE, if DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE do not affect row and if SELECT….INTO statement do not return a row. 
|-
| SQL%NOTFOUND || The return value is FALSE, if DML statements like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE at least one row and if SELECT ….INTO statement return at least one row.
The return value is TRUE, if a DML statement like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE do not affect even one row and if SELECT ….INTO statement does not return a row.
|-
| SQL%ROWCOUNT || Return the number of rows affected by the DML operations INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT
|-
| SQL%ISOPEN || Always return FALSE
|}

uses implicit cursor attributes:
&lt;SOURCE lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE  var_rows number(5);
BEGIN
  UPDATE employee 
  SET salary = salary + 2000;
  IF SQL%NOTFOUND THEN
    dbms_output.put_line('None of the salaries where updated');
  ELSIF SQL%FOUND THEN
    var_rows := SQL%ROWCOUNT;
    dbms_output.put_line('Salaries for ' || var_rows || 'employees are updated');
  END IF; 
END; 
&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

In the above PL/SQL Block, the salaries of all the employees in the 'employee' table are updated. If none of the employee's salary are updated we get a message 'None of the salaries where updated'. Else we get a message like for example, 'Salaries for 100 employees are updated' if there are 100 rows in 'employee' table.

====Explicit cursor:====
An explicit cursor is defined in the declaration section of the PL/SQL Block. It must be created when you are executing a SELECT statement that returns more than one row. Even though the cursor stores multiple records, only one record can be processed at a time, which is called as current row. When you fetch a row the current row position moves to next row.

There are four steps in using an Explicit Cursor.
* '''DECLARE''' the cursor in the declaration section.
* '''OPEN''' the cursor in the Execution Section.
* '''FETCH''' the data from cursor into PL/SQL variables or records in the Execution Section.
* '''CLOSE''' the cursor in the Execution Section before you end the PL/SQL Block.

Declaration
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;
&lt;/source&gt;
For example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE
   CURSOR cur_emp IS 
   SELECT * 
   FROM employees
   WHERE salary &gt; 10000; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Using Cursor
When a cursor is opened, the first row becomes the current row. When the data is fetched it is copied to the record or variables and the logical pointer moves to the next row and it becomes the current row. On every fetch statement, the pointer moves to the next row. If you want to fetch after the last row, the program will throw an error. When there is more than one row in a cursor we can use loops along with explicit cursor attributes to fetch all the records.

&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
OPEN cursor_name;
FETCH cursor_name INTO record_name|variable_list;
CLOSE cursor_name;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note:
* We can fetch the rows in a cursor to a PL/SQL Record or a list of variables created in the PL/SQL Block.
* If you are fetching a cursor to a PL/SQL Record, the record should have the same structure as the cursor.
* If you are fetching a cursor to a list of variables, the variables should be listed in the same order in the fetch statement as the columns are present in the cursor.
* When we try to open a cursor which is not closed in the previous operation, it throws exception.
* When we try to fetch a cursor after the last operation, it throws exception.

For Example:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  rec_emp employees%rowtype;
  CURSOR cur_emp IS 
  SELECT *
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary &gt; 10000; 
BEGIN 
  OPEN cur_emp; 
  FETCH cur_emp INTO rec_emp; 
    dbms_output.put_line (rec_emp.first_name || '  ' 
                       || rec_emp.last_name); 
  CLOSE emp_cur; 
END; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Oracle provides some attributes known as Explicit Cursor Attributes to control the data processing while using cursors. We use these attributes to avoid errors while accessing cursors through OPEN, FETCH and CLOSE Statements.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Attributes !! Return Values
|-
| Cursor_name%FOUND || TRUE, if fetch statement returns at least one row. 
FALSE, if fetch statement doesn’t return a row.
|-
| Cursor_name%NOTFOUND || TRUE, , if fetch statement doesn’t return a row.
FALSE, if fetch statement returns at least one row.
|-
| Cursor_name%ROWCOUNT || The number of rows fetched by the fetch statement.
If no row is returned, the PL/SQL statement returns an error.
|-
| Cursor_name%ISOPEN || TRUE, if the cursor is already open in the program.
FALSE, if the cursor is not opened in the program.
|}

Cursor with a Simple Loop:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  CURSOR cur_emp IS 
  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees; 
  rec_emp cur_emp%rowtype; 
BEGIN 
  IF NOT cur_emp%ISOPEN THEN 
    OPEN cur_emp; 
  END IF; 
  LOOP 
    FETCH cur_emp INTO rec_emp; 
    EXIT WHEN cur_emp%NOTFOUND; 
    dbms_output.put_line(cur_emp.first_name || ' ' ||cur_emp.last_name 
      || ' ' ||cur_emp.salary); 
  END LOOP; 
END; 
/ 
&lt;/source&gt;

The cursor attribute %ISOPEN is used to check if the cursor is open, if the condition is true the program does not open the cursor again.
The cursor attribute %NOTFOUND is used to check whether the fetch returned any row. If there is no row found, the program would exit. Typically, when the cursor reach the last row, no more row can be fetched.

Cursor with a While Loop:
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
  CURSOR cur_emp IS 
  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees; 
  rec_emp cur_emp%rowtype; 
BEGIN 
  IF NOT cur_emp%ISOPEN THEN 
    OPEN cur_emp; 
  END IF; 
  FETCH cur_emp INTO sales_rec;  
 WHILE cur_emp%FOUND THEN  
 LOOP 
   dbms_output.put_line(cur_emp.first_name || ' ' ||cur_emp.last_name 
   || ' ' ||cur_emp.salary); 
   FETCH cur_emp INTO sales_rec; 
 END LOOP; 
END; 
/
&lt;/source&gt; 
Using %FOUND to evaluate if the first fetch statement returned a row, if TRUE, the program moves into the while loop. Inside the loop, use fetch statement again to process the next row. If the fetch statement is not executed once before the while loop, the while condition will return false in the first instance and the while loop is skipped. 

Cursor with a FOR Loop:
When using FOR LOOP, you do not need to declare a record or variables to store the cursor values, do not need to open, fetch and close the cursor. These functions are accomplished by the FOR LOOP automatically.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
DECLARE 
 CURSOR cur_emp IS 
   SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees; 
 rec_emp cur_emp%rowtype; 
BEGIN 
  FOR rec_emp in cur_emp 
  LOOP  
    dbms_output.put_line(cur_emp.first_name || ' ' ||cur_emp.last_name 
    || ' ' ||cur_emp.salary);  
  END LOOP; 
END;
/
&lt;/source&gt;
When the FOR loop is processed a record 'rec_emp' of structure 'cur_emp' gets created, the cursor is opened, the rows are fetched to the record 'rec_emp' and the cursor is closed after the last row is processed. By using FOR Loop, you can reduce the number of lines in the program.

===PL/SQL Exception Handling===

===PL/SQL Procedures===
When calling store procedure from the PL/SQL Block, you simply use the store procedure name to call. If you prefix the 'EXECUTE' keyword in front of the store procedure name, you will receive an error.
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
my_sproc;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
EXECUTE my_sproc;

PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol &quot;my_sproc&quot; when expecting one of the following:
:= . ( @ % ; immediate
The symbol &quot;:=&quot; was substituted for &quot;my_sproc&quot; to continue.
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=plsql&gt;
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE my_sproc;

PLS-00222: no function with name exists in this scope
&lt;/source&gt;

The overhand knot with draw-loop similar to the [[Knots/Stopper knots/Overhand knot|overhand knot]]. It releases with a tug on the free end, which allows it to be untied easily. To tie it, form a loop, then make a bight out of the working end and put it through, tightening by pulling on the standing end.

==Cells==
[[Image:Chloroplasten.jpg|thumb|right| Plant cells]]

All living things are made of cells. They are the components and building blocks of life.

==What is a cell?==
''A cell is a bag of liquid that holds in the stuff of life.''


A '''cell''' is the smallest unit of living (things)organism.  If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.  '''Robert Hooke''', a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.  They looked like rooms.  Small rooms are sometimes called ''cells'', so he named them that.

==What types of cells are there?==
There are two kinds of cells:
'''eukaryotes''', which have a large ball in them called a ''nucleus'', and '''prokaryotes''', which do not.

Most prokaryotes are very small.  Prokaryotes include just two '''kingdoms''': '''Bacteria''' and '''Archea'''.
All of the rest of the kingdoms are Eukaryotes: '''Animals''' , '''Plants''', '''Fungi''', and '''Protists'''.

==What do cells look like?==
Cells are surrounded by a thin oil layer called the ''cell membrane''.  It separates the inside of the cell from the outside.  Some cells also have a firm box around them called a ''cell wall'' that keeps it from breaking.  The water that fills a cell is called the ''cytoplasm''.  Inside a cell, knowledge is stored in a thing called a ''chromosome''.  It tells the cell how to work, like steps in a book.

Eukaryotic cells hold their chromosomes in a structure called a '''nucleus''', which has its own oily membrane around it.  Cells also have many other membrane-bound things called '''organelles''', which means &quot;little organs&quot;.  Some organelles found in eukaryotic cells are called ''ribosomes'', ''vacuoles'', ''mitochondria'', and ''chloroplasts''.
[[Image:Human spermatozoa.png|left|600px|Human sperm cell]]


Cells that do different things have different shapes. A plant leaf cell takes light and uses it to make sugar. To do this, it has green organelles called ''chloroplasts''. To get the most light  it pushes cytoplasm in circles around a hollow bubble of water in the center of the cell called a ''vacuole''. 

A human sperm cell carries its chromosomes, found in the nucleus, to an egg cell in order to make a new baby. It has a large tail called a ''flagella'' that helps it to swim. It also has many organelles called ''mitochondria'' that give it power like gasoline gives power to a motor.

====Words====
:'''nucleus''' - A ball of membrane in the middle of the cell that holds the chromosomes.
:'''chromosomes''' - Things that hold the knowledge of the cell.
:'''prokaryote''' - A cell without a nucleus.
:'''eukaryote''' - A cell with a nucleus.
:'''organelles''' - Little things inside a cell.
:'''cytoplasm''' - The gel-like inside of a cell.
:'''membrane''' - An oil bag that holds water.
:'''vacuole''' - An organelle full of water and waste inside a cell.
:'''mitochondria''' - An organelle that makes power in a cell.
:'''chloroplast''' - An organelle that makes sugar found in a plant or protist.
:'''flagella''' - A tail on a cell that makes it swim.
:'''golgi body''' - An organelle which helps in secretion.
:'''ribosome''' - An organelle which helps in synthesis of proteins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=|Next=Cells}}
'''Biology''' is the study of ''Life''.  It helps us understand many things, such as how our body works, how our body keeps warm, and what we are made of.  Biology is very important to know.  Some subjects in Biology are Genetics, Zoology, Botany, and Ecology.

A Biologist is someone who studies Biology.

==What is life?==
Living things are different from things that are not alive.  It is usually easy to tell what is living and what is not, except with really small &quot;microscopic&quot; life forms and colorless, lifeless-looking mosses.

Here are some properties of living things.  Some non-living things can have some of these properties.

:Living things can change and grow.  However, volcanoes also change and grow.

:Living things can move.  However, the wind is moving air, and water always moves downhill.

:: You probably want to know how plants can move.  They can grow, and sometimes move more rapidly than that, in response to things such as the sun or water. One example is that sunflowers will turn during the course of the day so that they are always facing the sun.  Another example is that if a plant gets tipped over, it will want to turn upwards.

:Living things can reproduce.  That is they can produce copies of themselves, over and over.  This is the most important difference between living and non-living things.

:: In order to reproduce,  living things need nutrition, that is chemicals and energy sources in order to assemble the materials needed to reproduce themselves.  In this process , living things must excrete waste.  Waste is material which is of no use, or harmful.

Animals, bacteria, and plants are examples of living things.  Rivers, mountains, oceans, and soil are examples of non-living things, but often they are homes for living things.

Cars and tables are not living things because they cannot reproduce themselves.

== Levels of Life==
Living things can be many sizes. Also, biologists organize the structures and groupings of living creatures according to size.   A living creature is called an organism.  Organisms can consist of single cells or multiple different types of cells grouped into tissues and organs.  
From small to large, these are how living things are grouped.

*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|Cells]]
*:Most cells are only a few microns wide, so small they can only be seen with a microscope.  A micron is one thousandth of a millimeter.
*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Tissues|Tissues]]
*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Organs|Organs]]
*[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems|Organ systems]]
*Organisms
*Populations
*Communities
*Ecosystems
*Biomes
*Biosphere
*: The biosphere is the whole network of living things on planet Earth &amp;mdash; eight thousand miles in diameter, twenty five thousand miles around the equator.

Each thing in the list is made up of the things above it.  For example, communities are made of many populations and populations are made up of many organisms.

==Kingdoms==

When we look at living things we divide them up into groups and give the groups names. This is called '''classification'''.

Living things are classified into groups of different sizes.  The biggest groups contain almost everything.  The smallest groups have only a few types of living things in them.

The groups are, from large to small:

:Domain
:Kingdom
:Phylum
:Class
:Order
:Family
:Genus
:Species


The domains are ''Bacteria'', ''Archaea'', and ''Eukarya'', but most people still find it easiest to divide things by '''kingdom'''.

The six kingdoms are:
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Archaea|Archaea]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|Bacteria]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Animals|Animalia (Animals)]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Plants|Plantae (Plants)]]
:[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Fungi|Fungi (Funguses and mushrooms)]]

[[Image:Ocelot.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ocelot, a cat]]

==Animals==

Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move. Only animals have brains (though not even all animals do; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).

Animals are found all over the earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.

Humans are a type of animal.  So are dogs, cats, cows, horses, frogs, fish, and so on and on.

Animals can be divided into two main groups, vertebrates and invertebrates.  Vertebrates can be further divided into mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.  Invertebrates can be divided into arthropods (like insects, spiders, and crabs), mollusks, sponges, several different kinds of worms, jellyfish &amp;mdash; and quite a few other subgroups.  There are at least thirty kinds of invertebrates, compared to the five kinds of vertebrates.

Archea are creatures made up of single cells. They have been on Earth for a long, long time. Their name means old.

Archea have no nucleus in their single cell. They were once called bacteria, but they were taken out of the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|kingdom bacteria]] because they are so different.

==Bacteria==

'''Bacteria''' are single celled creatures with no nucleus. They are very, very small. They grow all over the Earth, in the ground, in the water, and even in our bodies.

Some bacteria can cause diseases, but most do good things like break down waste and make ''oxygen''.

==Fungi==

'''Fungi''' are mostly made of many cells. Fungi made of single cells are called ''yeasts''. They are also part of a group of living things called 'Eukaryotes', just like animals and plants. We're closer to mushrooms and yeasts than you think!

Lots of people, when they see fungi, think of mushrooms, however there are lots of different types of fungi, not just mushrooms and toadstools.

Fungi are very important because they break down waste. The leaves on the bottom of a forest would get higher and higher if fungi were not there to eat it.

Fungi are also important producers of food for humans. Also, yeasts are used to make wine, beer, and bread.  Some fungi are bad for our food, however, such as mould.

==Protists==

[[Image:Protist_collage.jpg|thumb|300px|protists]]

Most '''protists''' are made of single cells.  They are bigger than [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Archaea|archaea]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]], and protist cells have a nucleus.

There are many different kinds of protist cells.  Most live in the water, but some live in the soil or in animals.  Some protists can cause diseases.

Green Algae is in the kingdom Protista.  These can be small single cells or very large with many cells.  ''Sea weed'' is algae and is in the kingdom Protista.

==Plants==

Plants are made of many [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|cells]].  Plants are usually green.  Plants make their food from the sun.  They use the light, carbon dioxide, and water to make glucose (sugar).  Animals, fungi, some bacteria, and some protists eat plants for food.


Plants make ''oxygen'' which humans breathe, and they take in ''carbon-dioxide'' which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).  Plants make their food from the sun by ''photosynthesis''.  They also provide shade.  We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants.  Most foods that we eat are plants.  Without plants, animals could not survive.

==What is photosynthesis?==

Photosynthesis is making sugar using the energy of light.

===Why are plants green?===
Plants are green because they have green Chloroplasts. 

But why are Chloroplasts green?
Chloroplasts are green because they contain the green pigment ''chlorophyll'' in their thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs red and blue light.

==Organs==

[[Image:Humhrt2.jpg | A heart|thumb]]
Many living things have '''Organs'''.

Your Heart, Brain, Lungs, Liver, and Kidneys are organs.

Organs are made of two or more [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Tissues |tissues]].

Organs each have something that they do. The heart pumps blood. The lungs give you air. 

Organs work together in groups called [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems|Organ systems]].

[[Image:Grafik_blutkreislauf.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Circulatory System]]

==The Circulatory System==

The '''Circulatory System''' moves blood around your body. This blood carries food and ''oxygen'' around to all of the cells of the body. It also carries signals called '''hormones''' that help the body work together.

The major organ of the circulatory system is the '''heart''', which pumps the blood.  Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called '''arteries''' and comes back to the heart in tubes called '''veins'''.  The smallest tubes are called '''capillaries'''.

[[Image:Digestive_system_diagram_en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Digestive system]]
==The Digestive System==
The '''digestive system''' is what a human uses to eat. Food comes in through our ''mouth'' is broken down in our ''stomach'' and our body takes the food in through the ''intestines''. Then the waste goes out through the ''anus''.

The digestive system is made of many organs. Here are some of the organs and their functions:
:'''Oesophagus''' - Pushes food down into the stomach. 
:'''Stomach''' - Breaks down complex sugar by acid.  
:'''Liver''' - Makes a thing called ''bile'' that breaks down fat.
:'''Gall bladder''' - Stores the bile and adds it when it is needed.
:'''Pancreas''' - Makes chemicals that break down food.
:'''Small intestine''' - Absorbs food for body.
:'''Large intestine''' - Absorbs water and salt.
:'''Rectum''' - Stores waste.
:'''Appendix''' - Vestigial organ(has no function in human body).

==The Endocrine System==

The human body is made of many, many cells. To make the cells work together, the body sends signals through the blood called ''hormones'' that tell the cells in the body what to do. 


The '''Endocrine System''' is the [[../|organ system]] made of the organs that make hormones.

The endocrine system organs:

#Pineal gland
#Pituitary gland
#Thyroid gland
#Thymus
#Adrenal gland

==Immune System==
[[Image:PBEosinophil.jpg|thumb|A disease, that our Immune System tries to fight against.]]
The '''immune system''' protects our bodies from disease. Cells called ''white blood cells'' found in our blood are able to kill bad things such as [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Viruses|viruses]].

There are many different types of white blood cells. Some of them make things called '''antibodies''' that stick to things that enter our bodies making them easy to find. Other white blood cells get rid of bacteria and stop viruses like the flu.

When our immune system does not work well, we are vulnerable to disease caused by [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]] and [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Viruses|viruses]].  Problems with the immune system include '''allergies'''; in allergies, white blood cells attack things that are not bad, like pollen in our eyes or cat dander.  '''AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)''' is a disease caused by a virus that kills some white blood cells, leaving our bodies vulnerable to bacteria or viruses.

==The Integumentary System==

The '''Integumentary System''' is the system of the body made up of the skin, the nails, and the hair.

Skin keeps you cool by sweating. It also protects you by keeping things out of your body. The hair on your body keeps you warm.
Skin also holds [[../Nervous System|nerves]] that we use to touch and hold and kiss.  Your nails help you pick up things.  The skin is the largest organ of the human body.

The ''muscles'' of the body are what make the body move. 
They are made of muscle [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Tissues|tissues]].

All of the muscles of the body together make up the '''muscular system'''. 

Signals from the [[../Nervous System#Senses|nervous system]] tell the muscles when to move.  The muscles are attached to the [[../Skeletal System|skeleton]] which holds them up.

[[Image:Nervous_system_diagram.png|thumb|right|363px|The nervous system]]

==The Nervous System==

The ''nervous system'' helps you sense the world around you. It includes the ''brain'' and the ''nerves'' as well as the ''senses''.

The nervous system can sense changes inside and outside the body through specialized cells called ''receptors''. 
This information, in the form of small electric currents, is analyzed and responses are generated in the nervous system.  These responses, again in the form of small electric currents, are conveyed to the appropriate organs such as muscles or glands, at a great speed.

==={{anchor|Senses}}The Senses===
Your five senses are: ''smell'' (with your nose), ''taste'' (with your tongue), ''touch'' (with your fingers, and so on), ''sight'' (with your eyes), and ''hearing'' (with your ears). 
[[Image:Nose with glasses.jpg|thumb|left|100px|A child's nose]]

If human beings couldn't smell, they wouldn't know if their food had a bad odor.  If they couldn't taste either, they might like to eat everything, or, also bad in a different way, they might not like to eat anything.  If they couldn't see, it would be harder for them to find their way around and avoid danger.  And if they couldn't hear, they could not communicate with each other as easily.

==How are babies made?==

In humans there are two sexes: ''Men'' and ''Women''.  Babies are made when [[Wikijunior:Biology/Cells|cells]] called ''sperm'' (produced by men) get together with cells called ''eggs'' (produced by women) in a process called '''fertilization'''.  When the cells combine, they form a new cell, called a '''zygote''' (''zy'' rhymes with ''eye''; ''gote'' sounds like ''goat'') which has all it needs to make a new man or woman.  The zygote will make a baby like his mother and father.

==Where do babies come from?==
[[Image:Month_6.svg‎ |thumb|right| A baby grows in its mother.]]

Babies come from their mother. To make a baby, the father must put his sperm into the mother's body. This is called ''having sex''. The man puts his ''penis'' into the woman's ''vagina'' and the sperm cells swim into the mother's body.
Fertilization happens in the mother. The new zygote grows into a ball which will stick to the mother's '''womb'''. This ball grows into a baby.

Nine months later (266 days after fertilization) a new baby will come out of the mother's vagina in a process called '''birth'''.

====Words====
'''cell''' - Things that are alive are made of little boxes called cells.

'''womb''' - The place in a body where a baby grows. 

'''zygote''' - The one cell made from a sperm cell and an egg cell that will grow into a person.

'''sperm''' - A sex cell made by a man.

'''egg''' - A sex cell made by a woman.

'''fertilization''' - When sperm and egg get together and make a zygote.

[[Image:Lungs_diagram_simple.svg|thumb|right|300px|Lungs]]

==The Respiratory System==
The '''Respiratory System''' is how air gets into our bodies. We breathe in and out with our '''lungs'''. The air we breathe in has something called ''oxygen'' that our cells need. Cells make ''carbon dioxide'' which can poison our bodies. Our lungs push this out of our bodies.

The respiratory system works together with the [[../Circulatory System|circulatory system]] to make sure that air gets to each cell of the body.

Parts of the respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. 

*Air comes in through the nose and mouth. 
*Dust is removed by the hair in the nose. 
*Air goes through the pharynx (in the back of the mouth), the larynx or the voice box, and down the trachea (windpipe). 
*The trachea splits into two major bronchi, one for each lung. 
*This further splits into smaller bronchi, then into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles'' which lead into the air sacs called ''alveoli''. 
*This is where the oxygen goes into the blood and carbon dioxide comes out.

==The Skeletal System==
[[Image:Human_skeleton_front_en.svg|thumb|The human skeleton.]]
The '''Skeletal System''' is made of all of the bones in the body.  It protects the [[../Reproductive System|reproductive organs]] and is a place for [[../Muscular System|muscles]] to attach.  Bones are a very important part of the human body.  Without them, we would simply collapse, and be very unstable.  They support all of our tissue and muscles, and they are very difficult to break.

The inside of the bones is called the ''bone marrow''.  This is where most [[../Circulatory System|blood cells]] are made.

==The Urinary System==

The '''Urinary system''' takes bad things out of the blood and washes it out of the body.  This liquid waste is called '''urine'''.  Without the urinary system, poisons would fill up the blood and kill a person.  The '''kidneys''' are [[Wikijunior:Biology/Organs|organs]] that filter the blood and remove poison.  Urine is stored in a bag called the '''bladder''' and it leaves the body through a tube called the '''urethra'''.

==Tissues==

Organisms are made of tissues.  Tissues are groups of [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|cells]] that work together.  
Plant leaves have tissues that capture light and make sugar. Most animals have '''muscle''' tissues that help them move.

When two or more tissues work together to do one thing they make up [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Organs | organs]].

In plants, there are two types of tissues:

*'''Meristematic tissue''': This has actively dividing cells.
*'''Permanent tissue''': This type of tissue has developed cells. They do not divide.
**'''Simple permanent tissue''': This type of permanent tissue has only one kind of cells.
***'''Parenchyma''': They have loosely packed cells. The cells do not have a particular function.
***'''Collenchyma''': They have cells which have layers called [[w:pectin|pectin]]. They contain chlorophyll.
***'''Sclerenchyma''': They have dead cells. Between the cells, there are layers called lignin.
**'''Complex permanent tissue''': This type of tissue contains different kinds of cells.
***'''Xylem''': This type of tissue contains mainly dead cells. They help to move water from the roots to leaves.
***'''Phloem''': This type of tissue contains mainly living cells. They help moving food materials from leaves to other parts.

==Viruses==
[[File:Rotavirus Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|A virus called a rotavirus, which can cause diarrhoea.]]
Viruses are much smaller than other living things like [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Kingdoms/Bacteria|bacteria]], so small that it would take around one hundred viruses laid end to end just to make the length of a bacterium! Viruses are not really alive.  They do not do all of the [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Introduction#What is life?|things that living things do]].  They can only make more copies of themselves when they are inside living cells.

Viruses often kill [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Cells|cells]], and also make you ill. Lots of diseases are caused by viruses, the most famous ones being the flu and many colds.

==Too many subcategories?==
The use of 13 sub-categories makes more work when checking for recent changes. Why not cut them down to a smaller number (1 if possible). [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:23, 21 May 2010 (UTC)
:I have modified the template [[Template:French/Section_template]], [[Template:French/Grammar/Tenses and moods]] &amp; [[Template:French/Grammar]] to use the {{BookCat}} template to put all the book's pages into the French category, without removing the old sub-categories yet. This is because the templates are quite elaborate and I am not confident about making large changes. Some more simplification in the templates could make the book easier to maintain I think, as well as helping to fix the print version of the book which seems to be broken at present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[http://perlwikipedia.googlecode.com Perlwikibot]''' is a framework for writing MediaWiki bots written in [[w:Perl|Perl]], a free and open-source cross-platform programming language. &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; itself provides classes and methods to perform many common tasks. There are currently no ready-to-run scripts like those found in [[pywikibot]]&lt;!--once 3.0 is released, we can link to my git repo--&gt;.

== Using ==
Documentation is best found by the command &lt;code&gt;perldoc MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt;, or from [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MediaWiki::Bot CPAN]. There is also some documentation on the [http://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/w/list Google Code wiki].

===Upgrading===
{{sbox|colour=AA0000|1=
;Important note
:&lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; 3.0 has breaking changes. Please review the [[/3.0 release|release notes]] and upgrade your client code prior to attempting to use the new release.
}}

=== Ready-to-run scripts ===
As mentioned above, perlwikibot does not currently provide ready-to-run scripts. [http://hashbang.ca/~mike/page/projects/perlwikibot-scripts Perlwikibot-scripts] will attempt to provide a port for most pywikibot scripts after the 3.0 release. [[/clean_sandbox.pl/]] guides the user through writing a high-quality script for that project.

== Getting help ==
First, check the documentation. If your question is not answered there, you can contact the development team in three ways, listed here from most to least preferred:

# Email [http://groups.google.com/group/perlwikibot perlwikibot@googlegroups.com]
# [http://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/issues/entry Submit a bug]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a complete step-by-step guide on how to run your own [[pywikibot]] on Wikimedia projects, from your Mac, hopefully more easy and readable than the original one.

== Downloading ==
=== Downloading MacPython ===
Apple provides an installation of Python with every Mac OS X installation, by default. You don’t need to install Python, but you might want to update it. Here are the instructions.

First of all, you need to download Python, the application that reads the scripts and does something with them. Download MacPython from [http://python.org/download/ here], choosing “Python 2.5.2 for Macintosh OS X”. Open the downloaded dmg file and install it. In Applications in Finder you should now find a folder named “MacPython 2.5”. Nothing else needs to be done here, close Finder.

'''NOTE:''' A new application will be installed on your Mac, with the name “IDLE”. It’s just difficult and confusing, and nothing worth spending time on trying to use.

=== Downloading SVN ===
Many Wikimedia projects require that you always should run the latest version of the Pywikipedia framework. The easiest option is to use SVN. This is no harder than running the bot itself. 

If you are using 10.5 or below, download “My Subversion-1.5.5 Package” from [http://web.archive.org/20040404043620/homepage.mac.com/martinott/ this page]. Open the Subversion-1.5.5 package, and complete the installation. Now, everything is all set to download the scripts.

=== Downloading the scripts ===
Open Terminal, you can find it by searching for it in Spotlight. Now, copy-paste the following into Terminal, and press enter/return:
&lt;pre&gt;svn checkout http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/ pywikipedia&lt;/pre&gt;

A folder will be created in the ''“home”'' folder (look in the left column in the Finder for the house icon and your username), with the name “pywikipedia”, in which all the scripts will be when the downloading is finished. You can see when it’s finished by looking for the following in the last line in Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;NAME_OF_COMPUTER:~ USER_NAME$&lt;/pre&gt;
This text is equal to the one appearing when you open Terminal (it is called ''prompt'').

== Configuring ==
You need to configure your bot before you can use it.
For this purpose we’ll use pico, a simple and straight [[w:Text user interface|TUI]] text editor.
Go in Terminal and &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; to your pywikipedia directory, e.g.:
 cd pywikipedia
Then type &lt;tt&gt;pico user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt;.
Follow the instructions below; when you’re done press CTRL-O to write the file on disk and CTRL-X to quit the editor.

=== Language ===
&lt;pre&gt;mylang = 'xx'&lt;/pre&gt;
“xx” is the main language you want your bot to work on, equivalent to the language code of the Wikimedia project in which the bot’s going to run.

=== Family ===
If the bot’s main wiki is Wikipedia, go right to the Username(s) section. If the bot’s main wiki is for instance Wikibooks, add this line to user-config.py:
&lt;pre&gt;family = 'wikibooks'&lt;/pre&gt;

'''NOTE:''' Running bots on Wiktionary is more complicated than on the other projects, and is not recommended for beginners. This will not be described further in this guide. If you’re running your bot on Commons, both &lt;tt&gt;mylang&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;family&lt;/tt&gt; are to be set to “commons”.

=== Username(s) ===
Now, you’ll define the desired username(s) of the bot. Don’t register the bot on the wikis yet. You can do this by using the following:
&lt;pre&gt;usernames['FAMILY']['MYLANG'] = u'ExampleBot'&lt;/pre&gt;
“MYLANG” is the same as you defined in the &lt;tt&gt;mylang&lt;/tt&gt; option, and the same with “FAMILY”. If you’re running the bot on Wikipedia, the &lt;tt&gt;family&lt;/tt&gt; option is not defined, but should be “wikipedia” in the above line (se examples below). The line can be defined as many times as you like (only one per wiki), for each of your bots on different WM wikis. The default will be what’s defined in &lt;tt&gt;mylang&lt;/tt&gt;, except when running interwiki; the bot will edit on all the wikis defined in user-config.py.

=== Encoding ===
It’s recommended that you change the encoding to UTF-8. Especially if you are editing a wiki with non-ASCII characters, this is important, if you don’t change the encoding, you’ll end up with “?”s all over the place. For example, the Spanish name María will render like Mar?a. Add this line to user-config.py:
&lt;pre&gt;console_encoding = 'utf-8'&lt;/pre&gt;

=== API login ===
Because of some problems with SUL bots, the bot must log in via API. Add this line to user-config.py:
&lt;pre&gt;use_api_login = True&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, by using Save as, save the file in the “pywikipedia” folder. Then, close TextEdit.

=== user-config.py examples ===
==== EksempelBot on no.wikipedia ====
&lt;pre&gt;
mylang = 'no'
usernames['wikipedia']['no'] = u'EksempelBot'

console_encoding = 'utf-8'
use_api_login = True
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== ExampleBot on Commons ====
&lt;pre&gt;
mylang = 'commons'
family = 'commons'
usernames['commons']['commons'] = u'ExampleBot'

console_encoding = 'utf-8'
use_api_login = True
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== BeispielBot on de.wikipedia and de.wikibooks, with de.wikipedia as main wiki ====
&lt;pre&gt;
mylang = 'de'
usernames['wikipedia']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'
usernames['wikibooks']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'

console_encoding = 'utf-8'
use_api_login = True
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Registering the username on the wanted wikis ===
It is recommended that you are registered on the wikis where you want to run your bot. Then, when you’re logged into your own user account, write “Special:Userlogin” in the search box, then, choose to register an account. Now fill out the required fields on the page and continue. If the account creation is successful, you should now be able to run the bot.

With '''[[m:Help:Unified login|SUL]]''' it’s easy to run bots on several wikis. If you’ve created the bot account recently, the account is already merged.

If you created it some time ago and it’s not merged, or if it was created some time ago on other wikis, you’ll have to merge it in Special:MergeAccount. Now, when [[#Logging in|logging in]], the other accounts will automatically be registered as you enter the same password for all wikis.

=== Bot flag and test edits ===
'''Don’t forget to apply for bot flag/permission to run the bot!''' On en.wikipedia and he.wikipedia (there may be more), you have to apply before you make test edits. On other wikis you can apply and make test edits right away. When you make test edits, use the [[#Arguments|argument]] -pt:15, which tells the bot to wait 15 seconds between each edit (4 edits/min), so the recent changes list doesn’t get flooded with the bot’s edits.

== Running ==
=== Navigating to the right folder ===
To run the scripts, you first need to navigate to the folder in which the scripts are. Write the following in Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;cd /Users/USER_NAME/pywikipedia&lt;/pre&gt;
“USER_NAME” is the ''home'' text to the right of the house icon in Finder.

==== Tip ====
The above can be unnecessarily boring to write each time you want to use the bot. Terminal saves every command you use, and you can use old commands by pressing arrow up. With one press on the arrow up button, you see the last command used. Most likely, the command you see is not the right one; simply keep pressing arrow up until you see the right one. Then, press enter/return. Now, you can start running the bot. When you’re running a script followed by another when the first one is done, you don’t have to use the navigation command once again; only if you close Terminal.

=== Logging in ===
Now, you need to log into the bot accounts on the wiki(s), by typing the following into Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;python login.py&lt;/pre&gt;
Terminal will ask for the password. Type the password you used when you registered the bot’s username.

If you have accounts on multiple wikis, use
&lt;pre&gt;login.py -all&lt;/pre&gt;
Type in the passwords, as above.

Logging in is only necessary once, the bot stays logged in.

=== Running the scripts ===
After navigating to the right folder, you can now select scripts, by writing:
&lt;pre&gt;python SCRIPT_NAME.py&lt;/pre&gt;

To see an overview of some scripts with description pages, look [[Pywikipediabot/Scripts|here]].

==== Arguments ====
Arguments are written by using a dash: - and then the name of the argument, &lt;tt&gt;-pt:15&lt;/tt&gt; for instance. Many scripts require arguments, for example [[interwiki.py]]:
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -start:! -autonomous&lt;/pre&gt;
As default, the bot will run interwiki from the main language and project, and correct them on all registered wikis. The -start and -autonomous arguments says that it’ll check all pages on the wiki and add/modify interwikis. It will not remove anything, and it will give up when discovering conflicts, see [[interwiki.py]].

===== Global arguments =====
All scripts recognize the following arguments:
;-help
:Shows the script’s help text
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-lang:xx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Selects the language you want to work on. Overrides the mylang option in user-config.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-family:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Selects the family you want to work on. Overrides the family option in user-config.
;-log
:Enable the logfile. Logs will be stored in the logs subdirectory.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-log:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Enable the logfile, using “xyz” as the filename.
;-nolog
:Disable the logfile (if it's enabled by default).
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-putthrottle:nn&lt;/nowiki&gt; or short &lt;nowiki&gt;-pt:nn&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between saving pages. The default value is zero.

== Maintenance ==
=== Updating ===
To update your scripts, simply write the following into Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;svn update pywikipedia&lt;/pre&gt;
When it’s done, it will say “At revision XXXX” (“XXXX” depending on the latest revision). If you have [[#Modifying|modified]] some of the scripts, don’t worry, your modifications will be merged with the changes made by updating.

If you have experience using [[w:Automator|Automator]], you can do the Shell process in a workflow and save it to your desktop or on your dock, so you can reach it more easily. It’s a good idea to secondary click on it, then, while pressing Alt/Option, hold the cursor over Always open in, then choose Automator runner.

=== Modifying ===
You might want to go through the script text before you run it, because for some languages the script may be bot specific. Secondary-click on it, hold the cursor on Open in, then choose Other, scroll down and double-click on TextEdit. However, this is not mandatory, and not recommended for beginners, but if you have to; be careful when editing the scripts!

=== Reverting ===
If you want to revert your changes to a script, simply run the following:
&lt;pre&gt;svn revert NAME_OF_SCRIPT.py&lt;/pre&gt;

If a script suddenly doesn’t work, and produces the output &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;SyntaxError: invalid syntax&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, you have encountered an SVN conflict.

Revert the script as described above. Then try to run it. If it works, run the following in Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;svn resolved NAME_OF_SCRIPT.py&lt;/pre&gt;

You can now try to make the same edits again, if desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Configuration==
&lt;includeonly&gt;You do not need to &quot;install&quot; this package to be able to make use of it. You can actually just run it from the directory where you unpacked it or where you have your copy of the SVN sources.&lt;/includeonly&gt;

Before you run any of the programs, you need to create a file named
&lt;tt&gt;user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt; in your &lt;tt&gt;pywikipedia&lt;/tt&gt; directory. You can create it manually (it needs at least two or three variables configured, see below) or run the script &lt;tt&gt;generate_user_files.py&lt;/tt&gt; by typing &lt;tt&gt;python generate_user_files.py&lt;/tt&gt; in the command line shell and hit ENTER. That helps to complete this process.

===For [[Special:SiteMatrix|Wikimedia projects]]===
Open a text editor (e.g. Notepad in Windows) and save the text file as &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;, in the &lt;tt&gt;pywikipedia&lt;/tt&gt; folder.

Add the following lines to &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;:

{| cellpadding=5
|'''Code'''
|'''Explanation'''
|-
|valign=top width=400px| 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
family = 'wikipedia'
mylang = 'en'
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=top| 
xx is the code for the language code you are working on, &quot;en&quot; is English&lt;ref name=&quot;mylang&quot;&gt;If you want to work with more than one language, choose the most common one. You can override this on the command line by using &lt;code&gt;-lang:zh&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/ref&gt;. Family is the project name&lt;ref name=&quot;family&quot;&gt;[[Main Page|Meta]] uses 'meta' for both language code and wiki family, [[commons:Main Page|Commons]] uses 'commons' for both, and [[testwiki:Main Page|Testwiki]] uses 'test' for both. You can override this on the command line by using &lt;code&gt;-family:wikibooks&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.
|-
|valign=top|
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
usernames['wikipedia']['en'] = u'ExampleBot'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;&gt;The 'u' in front of the username stands for [[:w:en:Unicode|Unicode]]. The 'u' is required if your username contains non-ASCII characters.&lt;/ref&gt;
|valign=top|
Your &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; file needs to specify the bot's username. 

In this example, the user is working on English Wikipedia, and has created a bot account with the username &quot;ExampleBot&quot;.
|-
|valign=top|
''(Optional)''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
usernames['wikipedia']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'
usernames['wikipedia']['en'] = u'ExampleBot'
usernames['wiktionary']['de'] = u'BeispielBot'
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=top|
''(Optional)'' 

If you are working on more than one Wikimedia project, you can also add several usernames.
|-
|valign=top|
''(Optional)''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
console_encoding = 'utf-8'
textfile_encoding = 'unicode_escape'
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=top|
''(Optional, and rarely needed)'' 

If this is the encoding used by your system. Always try without first.
|}

Now save &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; again.

The [[pywikibot]] may be used to do all kind of things that are important for the maintenance of a [[MediaWiki]] project. When this software is to be used outside of the [[m:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] projects, some configuration needs to be done.

Some non-Wikimedia projects, or ''families'', are already supported. These can be found in the ''families'' folder [http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/families/] which can be [[Using_the_python_wikipediabot#Download|downloaded]]. 

Using the existing files as examples, it should be easy to adapt the bot to your own project. 

{{:../Overview}} &lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;#REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt;

==Instructions==
===user-config.py file===
Open a text file. (Notepad.exe is a text file editor)

Save the text file as &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;, in the main pywikipedia folder.

Add the following '''three''' required lines to &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;:

{| cellpadding=5
|'''Code'''
|'''Explanation'''
|-
|valign=top width=400px| 
 mylang = 'xx'
|valign=top| 
xx is the code for the language code you are working on, &quot;en&quot; is English.&lt;ref name=&quot;lan&quot;&gt;If you want to work with more than one language, choose the most common one, as you can override configured value in command line by &lt;tt&gt;-lang&lt;/tt&gt; parameter.&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|valign=top|
 usernames['sitename']['en'] = u'ExampleBot'&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;&gt;The 'u' in front of the username stands for Unicode. The 'u' is important if your username contains non-ASCII characters. If you are using ASCII characters only, you can remove the 'u' (if you have troubles loging in with your bot, otherwise you can leave the 'u' as is).&lt;/ref&gt;
|valign=top|
Your &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; file needs to specify the bot's username. 

In this example, the user is working on English sitename, and has created a bot account with the username &quot;ExampleBot&quot;.
|-
|valign=top|
 family = 'sitename'
|valign=top|
&quot;Sitename&quot; is the name of the site you're working on. 

Sitename is the same name as the sitename in the above username line (usernames[''''sitename'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;]['en'] = u'ExampleBot'.) 

|}

Now save &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; again.

===family.py file===

Modify the existing files, or create a new file, in a [[w:text editor|text editor]]. 

Save the file in the pywikipedia/families folder, with a name such as &lt;code&gt;mozilla_family.py&lt;/code&gt;

Follow the sections below in order (each section makes the following section easier). 

You must have the correct details as described in the sections below. Potential problems (this might help you in troubleshooting):
* errors in the custom namespaces mean the family file won't work properly (though you'll get a warning when you login?)
* an error in specifying index.php will prevent you logging in; 
* an error in specifying api.php seems likely to lead to problems, since the wiki is accessed via API.

The &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in the families folder offers considerable documentation of the options available to family files. In fact, &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; is a simple 'prototype' family file. You can just copy &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; to sitename_family.py, then open up the sitename_family.py file in a text editor, and tweak it per the instructions below. 

==== index.php ====

To check you have the correct path for your index.php, test which address redirects to your wiki's homepage - probably one of these:
* wikidomainname.org/wiki/index.php
* wikidomainname.org/w/index.php
* wikidomainname.org/index.php

(You may be able to guess from the address of a regular wiki page, but you need to check it - e.g. a wiki page may be wikidomainname.org/Foo but the correct path may be ''''w/index.php'''' - this occurs at fr.ekopedia.org for example.)

Near the end of your file, you find this, for example. Modify or remove the &quot;/w&quot; as necessary:

&lt;pre&gt;
     def path(self, code):
         return '/w/index.php' #The path of index.php, look at your wiki address. 
# This line may need to be changed to /wiki/index.php or /w/index.php, 
# depending on the folder where your mediawiki program is located.&lt;/pre&gt;

==== api.php ====

The API.php file is found in the same place as index.php - but you can test by navigating to (say):
: your.domain.org/wiki/api.php
or
: your.domain.org/w/api.php
or
: your.domain.org/api.php

The correct address will give you an auto-generated MediaWiki API documentation page (the important thing is that it confirms you have the correct address).

For the '/w/api.php' case, api is defined like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
     def apipath(self, code):

         return '/w/api.php' #The path of api.php&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Custom Namespaces ====

Adding a custom namespace to a family file is not well documented in the &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; file. The [[#Example: Uncyclopedia|Uncyclopedia]] example below has some examples using custom namespaces, but the addition of these namespaces to your family file requires knowing the numerical ID of each namespace.

'''Finding the details you need''': Start with the api url (which you found above) and add this string to the end:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;?action=query&amp;meta=siteinfo&amp;siprop=general|namespaces|namespacealiases|statistics&lt;/nowiki&gt;

...so your address might look something like:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://your.domain.org/wiki/api.php?action=query&amp;meta=siteinfo&amp;siprop=general|namespaces|namespacealiases|statistics&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The resulting page will will list the information about your namespaces that you need for the family file, including the numerical ID.

Typically these numerical IDs start at 100, and each even number is a content space and the following odd number is the talk space for that content space. However, to get the exact list, directing your browser to your Wiki's API.php file, and calling certain commands, is ideal.

Also, note that &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; lists two ways to provide ''translations'' of namespaces - either changing a specific language's namespace like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;self.namespaces[2]['en'] = u'Wikiuser'
self.namespaces[3]['en'] = u'Wikiuser talk'&lt;/source&gt;
Or else changing an entire batch of languages in one go:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;self.namespaces[4] = {
    '_default': [u'WIKINAME', self.namespaces[4]['_default']], # REQUIRED
    'de': 'Name des wiki',
    'es': 'Nombre del wiki',
    'fr': 'Nom du wiki',
    # ETC.
}&lt;/source&gt;
When adding custom namespaces, you '''do not have a choice''' - you '''must''' use the second style. The first method only works because &lt;code&gt;self.namespaces[2]['en']&lt;/code&gt; already exists. With custom namespaces, they do not, so you must use the second style, with curly braces and everything, even if you only have one language. For example, suppose you have a News namespace, and your Wiki only operates in English:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;self.namespaces[100] = { 'en': 'News' }
self.namespaces[101] = { 'en': 'News talk' }&lt;/source&gt;

If you do not use this format, the family file '''will not work''' - and more importantly, the resulting error message '''will not help''' - it will ask you to create a &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; file, even if that file already exists and works correctly.

==== Custom User Groups &amp; Permissions ====

PyWikipedia assumes that the Wiki it is running on uses the standard, default user groups and that each group is assigned the usual permissions. This means that it may refuse to do things that its account would allow, and it may attempt to do things that its account is not allowed to do (these attempts will fail, so this is not a security issue).

The fact that it will attempt things it is not allowed to do is minor, but the inability to perform certain actions (e.g. deleting pages) without being in the &quot;Sysop&quot; group can be a sizable limitation. If the bot account has such permissions without being in the &quot;Sysop&quot; group (being part of some other, non-standard group), the only known work-around is the edit Wikipedia.py itself. This file controls most bot actions, and is found in the main folder PyWikipedia has been installed to.

In the _getUserData() function within Wikipedia.py, a pair of lines like this exists:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;        if 'Sysop' in self._rights[index]:
            self._rights[index].extend(['delete', 'undelete', 'block', 'protect', 'import', 'deletedhistory', 'unwatchedpages'])&lt;/source&gt;
In version 2008-10-29T19:21:05.438703Z 6043, this is line 4705 and 4706, but that line number may be different, even very different, in other versions. Using the Find function of your text editor to find &quot;&lt;code&gt;def _getUserData(&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (to find the function definition) is recommended.

In order to get the rights listed in the second line, the first line must be changed to recognize your custom user group (note: if your custom user-group has some, but not all of those rights, changing this will not give you those rights - it will simply let PyWikipedia attempt to exercise them if you direct it to. Doing so is strongly '''not''' recommended as the program's behavior in such a case is undefined). The exact name of the user group can be found by logging in manually as the bot, and viewing the HTML code of any Wiki page. Near the top, a line as follows should appear:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;var wgUserGroups = [ ... ]&lt;/source&gt;
Where the ellipsis is replaced by a list of the groups that the bot is a member of. Choose the one that matches the custom user group that gives you the rights that you are attempting to exercise, and replace Sysop in the above code from Wikipedia.py with that name. This should activate those rights for PyWikipedia.

===Running the PyWikipedia Bot===

Refer to [[Using_the_python_wikipediabot#Use|Using the python wikipediabot]] on how to run the bot.

==Examples==
=== Example: Mozilla wiki === 
The Mozilla Foundation's wiki, wiki.mozilla.org, is a very simple example because it is only available in one language.

This is the contents of &lt;code&gt;families/mozilla_family.py&lt;/code&gt;. Hints for you to write your own family specification are underlined.

&lt;source lang=python&gt; # -*- coding: utf-8  -*-
 
import family
 
 # The official Mozilla Wiki. #Put a short project description here.
 
class Family(family.Family):
 
     def __init__(self):
         family.Family.__init__(self)
         self.name = 'mozilla' # Set the family name; this should be the same as in the filename.
         self.langs = {
             'en': 'wiki.mozilla.org', # Put the hostname here.
         }

         # Translation used on all wikis for the different namespaces.
         # Most namespaces are inherited from family.Family.
         # Check the family.py file (in main directory) to see the standard
         # namespace translations for each known language.
         # You only need to enter translations that differ from the default.
         self.namespaces[4] = {
             '_default': u'MozillaWiki', # Specify the project namespace here.
         }
 
         self.namespaces[5] = {
             '_default': u'MozillaWiki talk', # Specify the talk page of the project namespace here. 
         }
 
     def version(self, code):
         return &quot;1.4.2&quot;  # The MediaWiki version used. Not very important in most cases.
 
     def scriptpath(self, code):
         return '' # The relative path of index.php, api.php : look at your wiki address. 
# This line may need to be changed to /wiki or /w, 
# depending on the folder where your mediawiki program is located.
# Note: Do not _include_ index.php, etc.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example: Starwars ===
This is the content of the Starwars wiki at wikia. The file is located at &lt;code&gt;families/starwars_family.py&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Example: Memory Alpha === 
'''memoryalpha_family.py''' is the &quot;family&quot; definition of Memory Alpha, www.memory-alpha.org, a Star Trek wiki. This specification is a little bit more difficult because it has several languages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 # -*- coding: utf-8  -*-
 import family
 
 # The Memory Alpha family, a set of StarTrek wikis.
 
 class Family(family.Family):
     def __init__(self):

         self.langs = {  # All available languages are listed here.
             'de': None, # Because the hostname is the same for all languages,
             'en': None, # we don't specify it here, but below in the hostname()
             'nl': None, # function.
             'sv': None,
         }
 
         # Most namespaces are inherited from family.Family.
         self.namespaces[4] = {
             '_default': u'Memory Alpha', # All languages use the same project namespace name.
         }
         self.namespaces[5] = {
             '_default': u'Memory Alpha talk',
             'de': u'Memory Alpha Diskussion',

         self.biglangs = ['en', 'de'] # Not very important
 
     def hostname(self,code):
         return 'www.memory-alpha.org' # The same for all languages
 
     def scriptpath(self, code):
         return '/%s' % code # The language code is included in the path
 
     def version(self, code):
         return &quot;1.4&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example: Uncyclopedia === 
The various [[Uncyclopedia:Babel:Main_Page|Uncyclopedias]] are slightly more awkward as not all are hosted at the same domain or under the same name. Domain names and paths must be specified individually. Just over half are [[Wikia:Main_Page|Wikia]]-hosted; exceptions include fi: hu: ja: ko: no: pt: sv: and zh-tw:. Many have their own registered domain names and many use custom namespaces.

The approaches which work for an Uncyclopædia or a Memory Alpha project typically can be adapted to other Wikia.

''Note: There have been subsequent updates and changes, see [[botwiki:python:uncyclopedia_family.py]] or [[uncyclopedia:es:usuario:Chixpy/uncyclopedia_family.py]] for more current versions of the Uncyclopedia interwiki bot configuration. There are also unresolved issues in which some interwiki languages are not available from all Uncyclopedia projects or point to incorrect/inconsistent destinations; proceed with caution.''

== Notes ==

=== Language ===
For a single-language site, the language specified does not matter as long as it is consistent between the user-config.py and families/foo_family.py

=== Login failed. Wrong password? ===

Pywikipedia does not report anything more useful than success, failure, or host connection failure.  If possible, try accessing the web server logs (apache uses access_log by default) and take a look at the URL strings.  

You could also try running login.py in 'very verbose' mode, ie: &lt;code&gt; python login.py -v -v &lt;/code&gt;  . This will dump a lot of information, including possibly the html code from the server, so you can see exactly what is going on. (this option does however run the risk of possibly revealing some security sensitive info so be careful...)

Make sure your ''scriptpath'', the relative path to your api.php and index.php files, is defined appropriately for your wiki in your families file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def scriptpath(self, code):
    return '/wiki' 
&lt;/source&gt;

If this does not help, add a line like

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
  authenticate['www.mywiki.com'] = ('botName','botPassword')
&lt;/source&gt;

to your user-config.py file.

See the [[#Example: Mozilla wiki|mozilla configuration ]] for clues.

=== Mismatched interwiki configuration ===
In some projects (such as Uncyclopedia), each language operates as an independent wiki. This may mean that interwiki tables differ from one individual wiki to another within the same project. Interwiki.py is built on the assumption that, if outbound interlanguage links are available at all from a language, the list of available link-destination languages and the destination URL for each will match perfectly across all wikis in the project.

This leads to some potential pitfalls:
* If one language is missing outbound language interwiki support entirely, one must avoid giving pywikipediabot an account on that wiki (in user-config.py) in order to ensure that interwiki.py leaves that one language wiki untouched. 
* If one language is using a valid but incomplete interwiki table, running interwiki.py on that language wiki will create broken links. Unlike the case where one language is missing project-wide, there is no clean and easy workaround.
* If a language in a project has been forked (not just mirrored), the interwiki for each individual language pair will point to only one of the multiple forks. Verify the wiki your bot is looking at is the same one that is being linked from the wiki you're editing - otherwise the bot will delete some valid links as &quot;page does not exist&quot;.

=== Customisation of namespaces ===
Some projects use non-standard extensions to provide [[mw:Extension:Special page to work with the interwiki table|Special:Interwiki]] and [[mw:Extension:Simple namespaces|Special:Namespaces]] lists; where available, these lists should be checked against the configuration files to detect any additional namespace customisations.

=== Short URL rewrites ===
If your site uses short URL rewrites, you may have to add &quot;/api.php&quot; to the blacklists, Otherwise, your bot scripts will not be able to access api.php.

Check your rewrite conditions in your apache conf file, and make an appropriate addition.

=== Bot &amp; private wikis ===
Some wikis require logging in into mediawiki before being able to view any wikipage. If you have any such site, add to your custom family file :
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def isPublic(self):
    return False
&lt;/source&gt;

Fixing '''Permission Denied''' problems
&lt;pre&gt;
Creating page [[Category:Help]] via API                                     
Unknown Error. API Error code:permissiondenied                              
Information:Permission denied 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Your wiki may require users to be part of a particular group in order to edit pages.  If so, login to your wiki as an administrator and use [[Special:UserRights]] to put your bot into the proper group(s) to avoid API permission problems.

=== Bot &amp; HTTP auth ===
Some sites will require password identication to access the HTML pages at the site. If you have any such site, add lines to your user-config.py of the following form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
authenticate['en.wikipedia.org'] = ('John','XXXXX') # where John is your login name, and XXXXX your password.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we are ready to really start using the bot. You need to get to a textual interface to your Operating System. 

On '''Windows''' this is done by opening the start menu, and clicking on 'Run'. You are asked to give the name of a program, type &quot;cmd.exe&quot;. 
* Change the root to C: by typing chdir C:\
* Type chdir \&quot;name of the folder where pywikipedia bot has been [[../Installation|downloaded]]&quot; ''(For example: chdir \&quot;pywikipedia&quot; if the file is in the C: folder.)''

Windows has known problems with supporting Unicode in its standard system terminal. You may need to use alternative consoles (such as [http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/ ConEmu]) if your wiki is in language requiring Unicode encoding.

On '''Mac''', find Terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities.

On '''Linux''' or any other '''Unix''', use any terminal application such as gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, or simply the text-mode console.

Run the script [[../login.py/]] by typing &quot;python login.py&quot; (or just &quot;login.py&quot;). 

Python will then return:

'''&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000000; color:#c0c0c0; font-family:Lucida Console; font-size:12px;&quot;&gt;
Password for user your_bot on your_site:en:&lt;/pre&gt;'''


Use the password you used for the bot's login name. Note that your input will not be visible for privacy reasons. The bot can't work anonymously. Unless you change your password, you normally need to run this program only once, the bot usually does not get logged off.

The bots are in the main pywikipedia folder when downloaded. But if necessary, use the command cd to go to the directory where the bot files are saved. 

Now run any of the bots here by typing &quot;python botname.py&quot; (If you are using Windows, you can leave out &quot;python&quot;).

==Scripts==
:''Main page: [[../Scripts/]]''

===Command-line arguments===
Although many bot scripts have their own command line arguments, which should be documented on their respective pages (or in their source code), all bots unless specifically stated to the contrary recognize the following command line arguments:

; -help
: Print a list of global bot arguments (this list), followed by bot-specific help if available.
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-lang:xx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Set the language of the wiki you want to work on to language code &lt;code&gt;xx&lt;/code&gt;, overriding the configuration in &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;.
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-family:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Set the family of the wiki you want to work on, ''e.g.'', wikipedia, wiktionary, wikivoyage, ...  This will override the configuration in &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;.
; -log
: Enable the logfile. Logs will be stored in the logs subdirectory.
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-log:xyz&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Enable the logfile, using &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; as the filename.
; -nolog
: Disable the logfile (if it's enabled by default).
; &lt;nowiki&gt;-putthrottle:nn&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between saving pages. The default value is 10.

For example, &lt;code&gt;python scriptname.py -family:wiktionary&lt;/code&gt; will run the &quot;scriptname&quot; bot on wiktionary articles, overriding the default family setting in your user configuration.

==Permission on Wikimedia projects==
Make sure that your bot is approved by the wiki community where you are going to use it. Strictness of this differs greatly between various projects; at some you need to announce it in advance and get approval before you start, at others you can do whatever you want.

Using your normal browser, create a login name and password for the bot. It is best to use a name that makes clear that it is a bot, and preferably also who is operating it. A common method is to use your own login name and add the word 'bot' to it, but several other forms also exist.

On the English Wikipedia, bots are only allowed to be used if they are approved at [[w:en:Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval|Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval]].

====Request a bot flag====
If you heavily use a bot, it will clutter recent changes. To avoid that, you can get your bot registered as such. In that case it will not be shown on Recent changes unless a user specifically asks to get bots included.

This can be done by a bureaucrat. You can put a request to get your or someone else's bot registered at [[m:Steward requests/Bot status|Requests for bot status]]. You will probably be asked for some kind of evidence that your local community agrees with your bot.  On the English language Wikipedia, requests should be made at [[w:Bots/Requests for approval|Requests for approval]].  It is probably good to get your bot registered whenever it will edit many pages in a single run.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to report a bug==
When you report a bug please try to include:

* PyWikipediaBot version in use. It's recommended to test if the bug is still present in latest SVN revision available.
* Python version (python -V) and operating system you use (e.g. Windows, Linux, MacOS...)
** For above purpose, [[../version.py/]] will be useful.
* A nice summary
* Full description of the problem/report
* How to reproduce bug full information (script, command line, family, and language used)
* The console output provided by the script (included the Python traceback if you are reporting a crash)

To submit a new bug visit the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=93107 bug tracker] provided by SourceForge.

==Development==
If you have a function you want to have a bot for that is not yet provided by one of the bots, you can ask one of the programmers to write it for you. Or even better, you can try to work on the bots yourself. Python is a nice language, and not hard to learn. We will welcome you.

===Tips===
Here and in [[../wikipedia.py/]], there are some very basic tips for getting started writing your own bot:
*be sure you've set up your user-config.py file (see [[#Configuring for Wikipedia|above]])
*To gain access to the pywikipedia framework, use: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import wikipedia
&lt;/source&gt;
*to retrieve a page, use the following, where pageName is, e.g., &quot;Wikipedia:Bots&quot; or &quot;India&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
site = wikipedia.getSite()
page = wikipedia.Page(site, u&quot;pageName&quot;)
text = page.get(get_redirect = True)
&lt;/source&gt;
*to update a page, use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
page.put(u&quot;newText&quot;, u&quot;Edit comment&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
*look at some of the pywikipedia files for other ideas -- basic.py is relatively easy to read even if you're new to pywikipedia.
*you can find all available Page methods in the wikipedia.py file.
*basic.py gives you a setup that can be used for many different bots, all you have to do is define the string editing on the page text.
*To [[w:iteration|iterate]] over a set of pages, see pagegenerators.py for some objects that return a set of pages. An example use of the CategoryPageGenerator that does something for each page in the [[w:Category:Living people|Category:Living people]] category:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import catlib
import pagegenerators
import wikipedia
site = wikipedia.getSite()
cat = catlib.Category(site,'Category:Living people')
gen = pagegenerators.CategorizedPageGenerator(cat)
for page in gen:
  #Do something with the page object, for example:
  text = page.get()
&lt;/source&gt;

===Contributing changes===
If you changed the bot and want to send a patch to the maintainer, 
# Update to the current version (it will merge your changes with the improvements already committed to the SVN Repository), 
# Resolve any conflicts caused by the update (grep for &quot;=====&quot; ;-) and
# Type:
:&lt;pre&gt;$ svn diff &gt; svn.diff&lt;/pre&gt;

Review the diff to ensure it only includes the changes you want to contribute.  The lines at the beginning starting with &quot;?&quot; should be removed.

If you are in direct contact with a Pywikipediabot developer, you can send the file svn.diff to him, but preferably attach the patch to a ticket in the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=603140&amp;group_id=93107&amp;func=browse Pywikipedia bug tracking system].

===Multiple accounts===
It is a common need to run python wikipedia bot under different accounts (main and/or multiple bot accounts). It can be done in two ways.

====Separate pywikipedia distributions====
One can install completely separate instances of pywikipedia in different directories (1 for each account) and have diferent &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; files in each of them. However, when updating the installation ''via'' SVN, one needs to run &lt;code&gt;svn update&lt;/code&gt; on each folder separately. Also, every installation takes some disk space, which might be a problem on accounts with limited quota.

====One pywikipedia distribution with symbolic links====

Let's assume user &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; has a current SVN working copy of pywikipedia in &lt;code&gt;/home/foo/pywikipedia&lt;/code&gt;. For each of the accounts, he creates a separate directory:

 foo@bar:~$ '''mkdir foobot'''
 foo@bar:~$ '''cd foobot'''

Pywikipedia needs then some symlinks to the main code tree created in the working directory:

 foo@bar:~/foobot$ '''ln -s ~/pywikipedia/families'''
 foo@bar:~/foobot$ '''ln -s ~/pywikipedia/userinterfaces'''
&lt;!-- THAT'S ALL IT NEEDED IN MY CASE - ADD MORE IF NECESSARY --&gt;

Then, &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt; for this account must be created as described in [[#Configuration|Configuration section]] above.

Finally, the bot must be logged in the usual way:

 foo@bar:~/foobot$ '''python ~/pywikipedia/login.py'''

The working directory is ready. The scripts will however require a slight modification to run (the path to the pywikipedia tree must be added to Python's path).
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 import sys, os
 sys.path.append(os.environ['HOME'] + '/pywikipedia')
 import wikipedia
&lt;/source&gt;

That's all. Updating to the newest version of pywikipedia on ''all accounts at once'' is now a matter of running &lt;code&gt;svn update&lt;/code&gt; only in the &lt;code&gt;~/pywikipedia&lt;/code&gt; directory.

=====On Windows 2000+ with NTFS=====
&lt;!-- This works on my VirtualBox running Windows XP Pro with an NTFS file system. --&gt;
A similar set-up can be created on Windows systems running Windows 2000 or later that use NTFS as their filesystem. This can be achieved by using the &lt;code&gt;junction&lt;/code&gt; tool (available from [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx Microsoft's website, part of the sysinternals suite]). 

As above, create your new directory, but to create the symlinks, create &lt;code&gt;families&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;userinterfaces&lt;/code&gt; as directories inside of that. ('''NB''': The cmd.exe &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; appears not to work properly in all the time, so using the Right-click-&gt;New menu or File-&gt;New menu is suggested.)

 C:\...&gt; junction families C:\pywikipedia\families
 C:\...&gt; junction userinterfaces C:\pywikipedia\userinterfaces

The rest of the method is the same as above.
 
Symlink/junctions should be deleted using the &lt;code&gt;junction&lt;/code&gt; program, as you may accidentally lose data in the original directory (see [http://www.shell-shocked.org/article.php?id=284]).

==Bot &amp; Proxy==
There is probably (not tested!) draft workaround described 
[http://nl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Overleg_gebruiker:Andre_Engels&amp;oldid=10418345#pywikipedia_proxy here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{pywikibot/SVN}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
This is a script which helps to add a text '''at the end''' of the page but above categories, interwiki and template for the stars of the interwiki (default setting), or add a text '''at the top''' of the page.

This needs Python with at least v2.4 (not v2.3).

==Parameters==
These command line parameters can be used to specify which pages to work on:
 
&amp;params;
 
Furthermore, the following command line parameters are supported:
 
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
-page               Use a page as generator
-text               Define which text to add
-summary            Define the summary to use
-except             Use a regex to check if the text is already in the page *
-excepturl          Use the html page as text where you want to see if there's the text, not the wiki-page.
-newimages          Add text in the new images
-untagged           Add text in the images that don't have any license template
-always             If used, the bot won't ask if it should add the text specified
-up                 If used, put the text at the very top of the page *
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 
== Example ==

=== Adding a template to specific pages ===
It will add the text &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; at the very top of the pages with &quot;Category:Template documentation&quot;. Pages which have the text &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; .

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;add_text.py -cat:template_documentation -text:&quot;{{Documentation subpage}}&quot; -except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Dd]ocumentation [Ss]ubpage&quot; -up&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;-cat:template_documentation&lt;/code&gt; : only target entries categorized in the page of &quot;Category:Template documentation&quot;
* &lt;code&gt;-text:&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; : add the template &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (excluding the quotes)
* &lt;code&gt;-except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Dd]ocumentation [Ss]ubpage&quot;&lt;/code&gt; : regex commands to exclude entries which have this template already in the page
* &lt;code&gt;-up&lt;/code&gt; : Put the text at the top of the page instead

Another example:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;python add_text.py -cat:catname -summary:&quot;Bot: Adding a template&quot; -text:&quot;{{Something}}&quot; -except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Ss]omething&quot; -up&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Adding category to pages without any category ===
This is a real instance that is used on it.wikipedia to put the template in the page without any category.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python add_text.py -excepturl:&quot;class='catlinks'&gt;&quot; -uncat -text:&quot;{{Categorizzare}}&quot; -except:&quot;\{\{([Tt]emplate:|)[Cc]ategorizzare&quot; -summary:&quot;Bot: Aggiungo template Categorizzare&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Script which manages categories. This needs Python with at least v2.4 (not v2.3). 

== Syntax ==
The syntax is:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python category.py [global-arguments] action [-option]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
where action can be one of these:
 * add         - mass-add a category to a list of pages
 * remove      - remove category tag from all pages in a category
 * move        - move all pages in a category to another category
 * tidy        - tidy up a category by moving its articles into subcategories
 * tree        - show a tree of subcategories of a given category
 * listify     - make a list of all of the articles that are in a category

and option can be one of these:
 * -person     - sort persons by their last name (for action 'add')
 * -rebuild    - reset the database
 * -from:      - The category to move from (for the move option)
                 Also, the category to remove from in the remove option
                 Also, the category to make a list of in the listify option
 * -to:        - The category to move to (for the move option)
               - Also, the name of the list to make in the listify option
         NOTE: If the category names have spaces in them you may need to use
         a special syntax in your shell so that the names aren't treated as
         separate parameters.  For instance, in BASH, use single quotes,
         e.g. -from:'Polar bears'
 * -batch      - Don't prompt to delete emptied categories (do it
                 automatically).
 * -summary:   - Pick a custom edit summary for the bot.
 * -inplace    - Use this flag to change categories in place rather than
                 rearranging them.
 * -nodelsum   - An option for remove, this specifies not to use the custom
                 edit summary as the deletion reason.  Instead, it uses the
                 default deletion reason for the language, which is &quot;Category
                 was disbanded&quot; in English.
 * -overwrite  - An option for listify, this overwrites the current page with
                 the list even if something is already there.
 * -showimages - An option for listify, this displays images rather than
                 linking them in the list.
 * -talkpages  - An option for listify, this outputs the links to talk pages
                 of the pages to be listified in addition to the pages
                 themselves.
 * -recurse    - Recurse through all subcategories of categories.
 * -match      - Only work on pages whose titles match the given regex (for
                 move and remove actions).
 * -create     - An option for add: if a page doesn't exist, do not skip it,
                 create it instead

If action is &quot;add&quot;, the following options are supported:

 -cat             Work on all pages which are in a specific category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-cat:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-cat:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -catr            Like -cat, but also recursively includes pages in
                  subcategories, sub-subcategories etc. of the
                  given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-catr:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-catr:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -subcats         Work on all subcategories of a specific category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcats:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-subcats:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -subcatsr        Like -subcats, but also includes sub-subcategories etc. of
                  the given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcatsr:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-subcatsr:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

 -uncatcat        Work on all categories which are not categorised.

 -uncatfiles      Work on all files which are not categorised.

 -file            Read a list of pages to treat from the named text file.
                  Page titles in the file must be enclosed with [[brackets]]
                  or separated by newlines. Argument can also be given as
                  &quot;-file:filename&quot;.

 -filelinks       Work on all pages that use a certain image/media file.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-filelinks:filename&quot;.

                  Depends on python module pYsearch.  See yahoo_appid in
                  config.py for instructions.

 -search          Work on all pages that are found in a MediaWiki search
                  across all namespaces.

 -google          Work on all pages that are found in a Google search.
                  You need a Google Web API license key. Note that Google
                  doesn't give out license keys anymore. See google_key in
                  config.py for instructions.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-google:searchstring&quot;.

 -namespace       Filters the page generator to only yield pages in the
                  specified namespaces.  Separate multiple namespace
                  numbers with commas.

 -interwiki       Work on the given page and all equivalent pages in other
                  languages. This can, for example, be used to fight
                  multi-site spamming.
                  Attention: this will cause the bot to modify
                  pages on several wiki sites, this is not well tested,
                  so check your edits!

 -links           Work on all pages that are linked from a certain page.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-links:linkingpagetitle&quot;.

                  all pages on the home wiki, starting at the named page.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-start:pagetitle&quot;.

                  You can also include a namespace. For example,
                  &quot;-start:Template:!&quot; will make the bot work on all pages
                  in the template namespace.

 -prefixindex     Work on pages commencing with a common prefix.

 -titleregex      Work on titles that match the given regular expression.

                  not used anywhere.
                  Argument can be given as &quot;-unusedfiles:n&quot; where
                  n is the maximum number of articles to work on.

                  Argument can be given as &quot;-withoutinterwiki:n&quot; where
                  n is some number (??).

 -random          Work on random pages returned by [[Special:Random]].
                  Can also be given as &quot;-random:n&quot; where n is the number
                  of pages to be returned, else 10 pages are returned.

 -randomredirect  Work on random redirect target pages returned by
                  [[Special:Randomredirect]].  Can also be given as
                  &quot;-randomredirect:n&quot; where n is the number of pages to be
                  returned, else 10 pages are returned.

 -gorandom        Specifies that the robot should starting at the random pages 
                  returned by [[Special:Random]].

 -recentchanges   Work on new and edited pages returned by [[Special:Recentchanges]].
                  Can also be given as &quot;-recentchanges:n&quot; where n is the number
                  of pages to be returned, else 100 pages are returned.

 -redirectonly    Work on redirect pages only, not their target pages.
                  The robot goes alphabetically through all redirect pages
                  on the wiki, starting at the named page. The
                  argument can also be given as &quot;-redirectonly:pagetitle&quot;.

                  You can also include a namespace. For example,
                  &quot;-redirectonly:Template:!&quot; will make the bot work on
                  all redirect pages in the template namespace.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For the actions tidy and tree, the bot will store the category structure locally in category.dump. This saves time and server load, but if it uses these data later, they may be outdated; use the -rebuild parameter in this case.

Or to do it all from the command-line, 

== Example ==

=== Adding category ===

If your list of pages is in a file, enter:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python category.py add -file:FILENAME
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you don't enter a filename, you will be prompted for a page that has the file list.

Follow the on-screen instructions - you will be prompted for the category name.

To create a new category from a list of persons, you will usually want them to be sorted alphabetically by last name (assuming Western surname conventions). E.g. Adding the &quot;Artist&quot; category to the page &quot;Jane Smith&quot;, it would be added in the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Artists|Smith, Jane]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Type:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
python category.py add -person
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and follow the on-screen instructions.

=== Move category ===
If you want to move all pages in a category to another category, you could do the following:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
category.py move
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You will be prompted for the old category (that you also want to keep but enter it)
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
OldCategoryname
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Enter the name of the category without the 'Category:' prefix.

You will now be prompted for the new category, now enter the old and new Category like this:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
NewCategoryName
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

To do it all from the command-line, use the following syntax:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
category.py move -from:&quot;OldCategoryname&quot; -to:&quot;NewCategoryName&quot;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For example, this syntax will move all pages in the category US to the category United States.
&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
category.py move -from:US -to:'United States'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is a script which copies images from a wikimedia wiki to Commons.

The script requires the python-tk (aka Tkinter) package, which depends on many [[w:X Window System|X-server]] packages.

== Parameters ==
*-page:Image:&lt;imagename&gt; — work with a single image on a single page
*-newimages:n — work with the ''n'' number of new images
*-cat:&lt;categoryname&gt; — work in the specific category
*-transcludes:&lt;template&gt; — work with all images transcluding a template

Global arguments are available as well.

Interwiki.py creates Interlanguage links between the different language versions of a project.

==Getting started==
We assume you have taken these steps (downloading Python and bot, creating &lt;tt&gt;user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt;, running &lt;tt&gt;login.py&lt;/tt&gt;). Now to start, type &quot;interwiki.py&quot; (without the &quot;'s), or if that does not work, &quot;python interwiki.py&quot;.

The bot will ask for a page to check. Give a page on your home Wikipedia, preferably one with one or more interwiki-links that could however have more. The bot will read this page, and if it has any interwiki-links, it will check those pages as well, and the interwiki-links from those, etcetera. After it has finished that, what happens on what pages it found.
* If the page has no interwiki links, or if the links found are identical to the ones on the page, the bot will stop silently.
* If the bot finds interwiki links to new languages, or finds that an interwiki-link has to be changed, it will do so.
* If the bot finds that an interwiki link is to be removed, it will ask your permission to do so.
* If the bot finds more than one page for a language, it will go into an interactive mode. It will give the pages found with the pages that link to that page, and ask for each language with more than one link, which if any should be linked to, then ask for each language with one link whether it should be linked.

Note that these behaviours can be changed using options, see below.

You can also specify the page to work on directly, using &quot;interwiki.py pagename&quot;. But there are more possibilities, see below.

== Working on more than one page ==
Using the XML Export, the pywikipediabot-software can get more pages at once, upto 60 at a time. To use this possibility, you can use the bot on a set of pages. The most common form is getting pages in alphabetical order from Special:Allpages, using the -start option.

=== -start ===
If you add the option -start, the bot will go through the pages alphabetically, starting at the word specified. If you want to start at the letter B, for example, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -start:B&quot;. In particular, if you want to do the whole Wiki, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -start:!&quot;

=== Restarting: -continue, -restore ===
Going through the whole wiki can, in large or even moderately large wikis, take a long time. Thus, it may well happen that you are forced to end the program before it has finished. In that case you can use &quot;interwiki.py -continue&quot; next time. The bot, when it crashes or is stopped (through control-c), will make a file specifying the pages it is working on. If you use the continue-option, it will continue with those pages, and after that continue alphabetically. If you want to restart a non-alphabetical run, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -restore&quot; instead. It will just restart the pages it was working on.

Be warned that only the '''last''' bot run that was stopped will be recoverable. The bot will save its information to a file interwiki.dump, and if another run is broken off, even if it is only on one page, it will overwrite the file.

=== Autonomous mode ===
When working on a lot of pages, you may want the bot to just continue, rather than asking you every time it sees a problem. This is done by adding the option &quot;-autonomous&quot;. If this option is used, the bot will skip all problems and removals, and save a log of those in &lt;tt&gt;autonomous_problems.dat&lt;/tt&gt;. If you want it to do removals as well, add the &quot;-force&quot; option too; in that case it is good to check the removals afterward (often a page is removed because of a correctable typo).

==== The file sax_parse_bug.dat ====
Sometimes there is an error message mentioning a file &lt;tt&gt;sax_parse_bug.dat&lt;/tt&gt; on the screen while running interwiki.py, and then it starts retrieving some pages one-by-one instead of in a single batch. This is caused by an illegal character in one of the pages to be retrieved.

The tool &lt;tt&gt;xmltest.py&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to trace this problem. Run it with the filename as argument:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python xmltest.py sax_parse_bug.dat&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will generate a python stack trace. The last line of that stack trace will show a line number and column where the illegal character is in the file. Please check this position, and if possible, correct the wiki page associated with it.

=== Running on years AD ===

There is a special option '''-years''' that makes sure not to follow links to centuries and decennia that are common on some wikipedias (like ja:). Even then, this option should be used in combination with an exceptions file (see below) because the la: and ia: number pages are about the numbers and not about the years.
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -autonomous -years&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will take a while to start up while it is preparing hints for all pages named &lt;nowiki&gt;[[1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; through &lt;nowiki&gt;[[2050]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you stop the robot during a -years run and want to restart it later, you can tell the robot at which page to restart by using '''-years:XYZ''' where XYZ is the year where the robot stopped last time. You can also make the robot start B.C. by making XYZ a negative number.

&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -autonomous -years:-500&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=== Running on a simple list of pages ===

Sometimes you have a list of pages available. Just a file of subjects, each subject on a separate line, formatted as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[xx:yyy]] comments&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The '''-file''' option can be used to run the interwiki bot over such a list of subjects. An example of such a file could be an &lt;tt&gt;autonomous_problem.dat&lt;/tt&gt; file that you want to treat manually:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -file:autonomous_problem.dat&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Using hints ==
Upto now, we have only worked on adding interwikis on pages that already have some. But the bot can also be used to add them on pages that have none yet. This is done by using hints. If for example you want to add interwikis to the page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[en:House]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and think there might be a page at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[fr:Maison]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that would be about the same subject, you can type (if your bot is set to run on English by default) &quot;interwiki.py House -hint:fr:Maison&quot;.

If the link is to the same title, you can remove the title, and even the second :. Also, if you want to link to the same word in several languages, you can combine them with commas. So instead of &quot;interwiki.py Albert Einstein -hint:de:Albert_Einstein -hint:fr:Albert_Einstein -hint:id:Albert_Einstein&quot; (those underscores are necessary, otherwise the bot will regard the 'Einstein' part of the pagename), you can write &quot;interwiki.py Albert Einstein -hint:de,fr,id&quot;,

=== Special hints ===
Some special hints have been defined to do a number of languages at once. You can use them instead of the language part of a hint. Currently the following special hints exist for Wikipedia:
* 10: Ten of the largest Wikipedias
* 20,30,50: Idem, for twenty, thirty and fifty languages
* all: All Wikipedias with at least ~100 articles
* cyril: All languages in Cyrillic script
The same are defined for Wiktionary, but at the moment of writing, 30, 50 and all are the same for Wiktionary. It is intended to add more options.

=== Asking for hints ===
When working on multiple pages such hints in the command line are rarely useful. In that case (or if you want to decide on the hints later), you can use the options &quot;-askhints&quot;, &quot;-untranslated&quot; and &quot;-untranslatedonly&quot;. If you choose the -askhints option, for each page you will be asked for one or more hints. They can be like the hints after -hint: on the command line, but the ':' may not be omitted, and spaces are allowed. Thus, valid hints would for example be &quot;en:John Smith&quot;, &quot;de,nds,af:&quot; or &quot;50:&quot;. &quot;-untranslated&quot; asks for hints only if there are no interwiki links yet; &quot;-untranslatedonly&quot; is like -untranslated, but other pages are not worked on at all.

Instead of giving a hint, you can give an empty line. This specifies that all hints for this page have been given (or that you have no hints for it). Note that if you have given a hint, the bot will keep asking for more hints until you press enter. Another option is to input a question mark and nothing else; in that case you get shown the beginning of the text to the page. If after that you input the question mark again, it will give a larger part of the text, etcetera.

It might in these cases be useful to have the &quot;-confirm&quot; option added, so the bot gets interactive before making a change. This can be used to check whether the links are correct and/or as an impetus to create a backlink.

=== Wiktionary ===
For Wiktionary there is the special &quot;-wiktionary&quot; option. It works like &quot;-hint:all&quot;, but has some extras because on Wiktionary some languages use capitalisation and others don't, and links to another word are never correct.

On non-capitalising wiktionaries, links to capitalising wiktionaries are only added for capitalised words. Also, any link found to a word that differs more than just in capitalisation, is ignored completely.

== Automatic translation ==
For years (both AD and BC) and days of the year, the bot can automatically translate it in a large number of languages. If you do not want this automatic translation (for example because it takes long to go over such a large number of languages), it can be switched off with the &quot;-noauto&quot; option.

With the option &quot;-years:&quot; followed by a number (positive or negative), the bot goes through the years from the given year to 2050. If &quot;-years&quot; without any addition is given, the beginning year is taken to be the year 1.

With the option &quot;-days&quot; the bot goes through the days of the year; however, this bot only works correctly on nl:.

== Avoiding unwanted links ==
If you want to run the bot, but know that for a given page, it will get to links that it should not get, you can use the -noredirect or -neverlink or -select or -ignore options.

-noredirect means that if a redirect page is found, the redirect is not followed, as is the normal behaviour, but the page is skipped.

-neverlink:xx with xx: a language code means that '''any''' links to the language xx: are ignored.

-select lets you select or deselect every single links that is being found individually, before any page is changed.

-ignore:zxx:pagetitle excludes the page named &quot;pagetitle&quot; in language &quot;zxx&quot; and its interwiki links from inclusion, even if there are interwiki links pointing to it.

== Working with the logfile ==

Each run of the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; program will write not only to the screen, but also to a file called &lt;tt&gt;logs/interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt;. You may have seen that once a subject is completed, a list of ''other'' Wikipedias interwiki links is printed preceded by 'WARNING:'. To use these lines, the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt; file is more convenient than the screen.

First an explanation why this is important. Assume you have a page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Subject]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that links to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[fr:Mon Sujet]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[nl:Mijn Onderwerp]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Assume also that neither the nl: nor the fr: page list your en: page: they only know each other. A run of &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; on either fr: or nl: will not find your en: page. This can be referred to as ''the backlink problem'': there can be an ''unknown'' language that link to the others, but as long as none of the others link back, there is no way of discovering the existance. Do we really need to add these ''back''links manually? No, that is where the warnings come in. In the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;WARNING: fr:[[Mon Sujet]] does not link to [[en:My Subject]]
WARNING: nl:[[Mijn Onderwerp]] does not link to [[en:My Subject]]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
If the person running &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; either on fr: or on nl: would have this information, that would be sufficient to get the network of links completed. 

For this reason there is another option for the &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.py&lt;/tt&gt; program:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python interwiki.py -warnfile:english_treelang.log&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
In this mode the program will read the warnfile, and start to process all of the pages that are mentioned for its home language using the &quot;does not link to&quot; lines as hints. 

This process can still take a long time. If you trust the operator that sent you the log, and the log is recent, you can also do:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python warnfile.py english_treelang.log&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will not verify any of the suggestions in the warnfile, but blindly implement them at full speed, saving the Wikipedia server a lot of efforts.

Now, instead of sending the whole &lt;tt&gt;interwiki.log&lt;/tt&gt; file to everyone, there is a special program to split it up:
&lt;table bgcolor=&quot;#ffffcc&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;python splitwarning.py&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
This will read your interwiki.log and create files called &lt;tt&gt;warning_XX.log&lt;/tt&gt; (one for each language) that are more convenient to use..

== Overview of the options ==
Here is a list of the options, with an explanation of those that have not yet been discussed.
* '''-array:''' (usage: &quot;-array:nn&quot; with nn a number) When working on several pages, make sure to have at least this number of pages the bot is working on, if possible. The default value is 100; when using -untranslatedonly or a similar option, you might want to set it lower.
* '''-always:''' Always save the page, even if only one byte has changed (default: save the page only if at least one link has actually changed)
* '''-askhints:''' Ask hints (see above)
* '''-async:''' Puts the page on a queue to be saved to wiki asynchronously. This enables loading pages during saving throtteling and gives a better performance.
* '''-autonomous''' Work in autonomous mode (see above)
* '''-confirm''' Always ask permission before changing a page.
* '''-select''' Ask for each link whether it should be include before changing any page.
* '''-days:''' Work on the days
* '''-file:''' (usage: &quot;-file:filename&quot;) Specifies a file containing a list of pages to process.  (Page names are specified as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[project:lang:pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[lang:pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or &lt;nowiki&gt;[[pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* '''-force:''' When an interwiki link is to be removed, just do it, don't ask for permission
* '''-hint:''' Give a hint (see above)
* '''-name:''' Old option; equivalent to &quot;-hint:all&quot;, but capitalizes the last word when trying on eo:. Might get deprecated.
* '''-namespace:''' Number or name of namespace to process. Can be used multiple times. Do not use with the -start parameter (use something like -start:Category:! instead)
* '''-neverlink:''' Do not link to a specific language (see above)
* '''-noauto:''' Do not use automatic translation (see above)
* '''-nobacklink:''' Do not give a list of missing links on pages linked to
* '''-nobell:''' Give no audio sign when asking for input.
* '''-noredirect:''' If the bot finds a page linked to is a redirect, it is skipped (normal behaviour: It follows the redirect)
* '''-noshownew:''' Do not show new links found
* '''-number:''' (usage&quot;-number:nn&quot; with nn a number) In combination with -start, checks only the first nn pages rather than the whole wiki.
* '''-same:''' Old option; equivalent to &quot;-hint:all&quot;; might get deprecated
* '''-showpage:''' When using -askhints or some such option, always show the page text, even if not prompted.
* '''-skipfile:''' (usage &quot;-skipfile:filename&quot;) On a run using -start, do not do the pages in the file start
* '''-untranslated:''' Ask hints for untranslated pages (see above)
* '''-untranslatedonly:''' Ask hints for untranslated pages (see above)
* '''-warnfile:''' Use the logfile for pages and hints (see above)
* '''-wiktionary:''' Special wiktionary options (see above)
* '''-years:''' Work on the years

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Pywikibot/SVN}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Script which fixes double redirects, and  deletes broken redirects.

Requires access to MediaWiki's maintenance pages or to a XML dump file.
Delete function requires adminship.

==Syntax==
Syntax:
  python redirect.py ''action'' ''[-argument]''

where ''action'' can be one of these:
* double - fix redirects which point to other redirects
* broken - delete redirects where targets don't exist. Requires adminship.

and ''argument'' (optional) can be:
* xml:filename.xml - Retrieve information from a local XML dump (http://download.wikimedia.org). If this argument isn't given, info will be loaded from a special page of the live wiki. Cannot be used with moves or api.
* api - Retrieve information using Mediawiki's API. Cannot be used with xml.
* moves - Instead of using Special:Doubleredirects, use the page move log to find double-redirect candidates (only works with action &quot;double&quot;, does not work with -xml)
* namespace:n - Namespace to process. Works only with an XML dump or API. Can be repeated multiple times.
* offset:n - With XML number of redirect to restart with (see progress).  With -moves, the number of hours ago to start scanning moved page
* always - Don't prompt you for each replacement.
* start:page - with API start page
* until:page - with API last page
* number:page - with API number of pages to process

If neither api nor api nor moves are present, information will be loaded using a special page

==Example==
This syntax fixes all the double redirects. Since no argument is defined, it uses [[Special:DoubleRedirects]] of the live wiki to find double redirects by default. It will ask for confirmation before making changes:
  redirect.py double

'''Replace.py''' is part of the [[Pywikibot]] framework.

This bot replaces text. It will retrieve information on which pages might need changes either from an XML dump or a text file, or only change a single page. To get some more information, use
 python replace.py -help

==Files ==
The bot uses three files in addition to the framework:
;&lt;tt&gt;replace.py&lt;/tt&gt; : the main module
;&lt;tt&gt;fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt; : a few predefined &quot;fixes&quot;
;&lt;tt&gt;user-fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt; : a file to add ones own fixes. The file is created nearly empty by &lt;tt&gt;generate_user_files.py&lt;/tt&gt;

Files that may be used for input and/or output:
;&lt;tt&gt;filename.txt&lt;/tt&gt; : a file with a list of articles if specified with the parameter &quot;-file&quot;
;&lt;tt&gt;filename.xml&lt;/tt&gt; : a local XML dump if used with parameter &quot;-xml&quot;
;&lt;tt&gt;replacelog&lt;/tt&gt; : the log with a name that may be specified with parameter &quot;-log&quot;

==Parameters==
===Local===
You can run replace.py with the following parameters (for example, &lt;code&gt;python replace.py -file:articles_list.txt &quot;errror&quot; &quot;error&quot;&lt;/code&gt;).

| Work on all pages in the wiki, starting at a given page. Choose &quot;&lt;code&gt;-start:!&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to start at the beginning. '''Note''': You are advised to use &lt;code&gt;-xml&lt;/code&gt; instead of this option; this is meant for cases where there is no recent XML dump.
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;| Replace parameters
|-
| -except:XYZ ''(older versions only)''
| Ignore pages which contain XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -excepttitle:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip pages with titles that contain XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -excepttext:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip pages which contain the text XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -exceptinside:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip occurences of the to-be-replaced text which lie within XYZ. If the -regex argument is given, XYZ will be regarded as a regular expression.
|-
| -exceptinsidetag:XYZ ''(newer versions only)''
| Skip occurences of the to-be-replaced text which lie within an XYZ tag. Possible values of XYZ include link, nowiki, ref, header, interwiki, and hyperlink.
|-
| -summary:XYZ
| Set the summary message text, bypassing the default edit summaries.
|-
| -fix:XYZ
| Perform one of the predefined replacements tasks, which are given in the dictionary 'fixes' defined inside the file &lt;tt&gt;fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;user-fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt;. The -regex argument and given replacements will be ignored if you use -fix. Currently available predefined fixes are:
* HTML - convert HTML tags to wiki syntax, and fix XHTML.
* syntax - try to fix bad wiki markup.
* case-de - fix case errors in German.
* grammar-de - fix grammar and typography in German.
|-
| -namespace:n
| Number of namespace to process. The parameter can be used multiple times. It works in combination with all other parameters except for the -start parameter. (If you want to change all pages in a particular namespace, add the namespace prefix; for example, &lt;code&gt;-start:User:!&lt;/code&gt;.)
|-
| ''unnamed''
| First unnamed argument is the old text, second argument is the new text. If the -regex argument is given, the first argument will be regarded as a regular expression, and the second argument might contain expressions like \\1 or \g&lt;name&gt;.

==Examples==

If you want to change templates from the old syntax, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, to the
new syntax, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, download an XML dump file (page table) from
http://download.wikimedia.org, then use this command:

    &lt;nowiki&gt;python replace.py -xml -regex &quot;{{msg:(.*?)}}&quot; &quot;{{\1}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note that the you can match patterns across more than one line:

    &lt;nowiki&gt;python replace.py -regex -start:! &quot;First line\nSecond line&quot; &quot;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Replace.py can be used to insert or append text to a page (note the replacement text has an embedded new line):

    &lt;nowiki&gt;python replace.py -regex '(?ms)^(.*)$' &quot;\1
    &gt; [[Category:NewCat]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you have a dump called foobar.xml and want to fix typos, e.g.
Errror -&gt; Error, use this:

    python replace.py -xml:foobar.xml &quot;Errror&quot; &quot;Error&quot;

If you have a page called 'John Doe' and want to convert HTML tags to wiki
syntax, use:
    
    python replace.py -page:John_Doe -fix:HTML

If you run the bot without arguments you will be prompted multiple times for replacements:

    python replace.py -file:blah.txt

The script asks the user before modifying an article. It is recommended to double-check the result to be sure that the bot did not introduce errors (especially with misspelled words).  It is possible to specify a set of articles with an external text file containing Wiki links : 

&lt;pre&gt;
 [[plane]]
 [[vehicle]]
 [[train]]
 [[car]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The bot is then called using something like : 

  python replace.py [global-arguments] -file:articles_list.txt &quot;errror&quot; &quot;error&quot; 

Rather than specifying regular expressions at the command line, it's preferable to add them to &lt;tt&gt;user-fixes.py&lt;/tt&gt;

  python replace.py -file:articles_list.txt -fix:example2

=== Example: Replacing multiple paragraphs ===
The original text of the page [[Meta:Sandbox]] is:
&lt;pre&gt;This page is for any tests.

Welcome to the sandbox!&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to switch the statement (the second one goes before the first one), you type the following syntax:
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto&quot;&gt;replace.py -page:Meta:Sandbox -regex &quot;This page is for any tests.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the sandbox!&quot; &quot;Welcome to the sandbox!\n\nThis page is for any tests.&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

To add a new line we use &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Solve disambiguation.py screenshot ck.jpg|thumb|450px|Helping you choose the right page out of several disambiguated ones.]]

'''solve_disambiguation.py''' is a [[pywikibot|python bot]] script to help a human solve links to disambiguation pages by presenting a set of options.

Type in the disambiguation page on the command line. The program will pick up the page, and create a menu of all outbound links found on the page, with a unique number adjacent to each link.   It will then automatically loop over all pages which refer to the disambiguation page, and show 30 characters of context on each side of the reference to help you make the decision between the alternatives. It will ask you to type the number of the appropriate replacement, and perform the change.

It is possible to choose to replace only the link (just type the number) or
replace both link and link-text (type '&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;' followed by the number).

Multiple references in one page will be scanned in order, but typing '&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;' (next)
on any one of them will leave the complete page unchanged. To leave only some reference unchanged, use the '&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;' (skip) option.

Command line options (in addition to the general options for all bots):

;&lt;nowiki&gt;-pos:XXXX&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
:adds &lt;code&gt;XXXX&lt;/code&gt; as an alternative disambiguation
;-just
:Only use the alternatives given on the command line, do not read the page for other possibilities.
;-redir      
:If the page is a redirect page, use the page redirected to as the (only) alternative; if not set, the pages linked to from the page redirected to are used. If the page is not a redirect page, this will raise an error.
;-primary    
:&quot;Primary topic&quot; disambiguation (Begriffsklärung nach Modell 2).  That's titles where one topic is much more important, the disambiguation page is saved somewhere else, and the important topic gets the nice name.  All links found on page &lt;code&gt;XXXX&amp;nbsp;(disambiguation)&lt;/code&gt; will be listed as options for the user, but the bot will still work on links to &lt;code&gt;XXXX&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-primary:XY&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Like the above, but use XY as the only alternative, instead of searching for alternatives in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Keyword (disambiguation)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Note: this is the same as &lt;code&gt;-primary -just -pos:XY&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-file:XYZ&lt;/nowiki&gt;   
:Reads a list of pages, which can for example be gotten through extract_names.py. XYZ is the name of the file from which the list is taken. If XYZ is not given, the user is asked for a  filename.
:Page titles should be listed one per line, with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[brackets]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:The &lt;code&gt;-pos&lt;/code&gt; parameter won't work if &lt;code&gt;-file&lt;/code&gt; is used.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-always:XY&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Instead of asking the user what to do, always perform the same  action. For example, &lt;code&gt;XY&lt;/code&gt; can be &quot;r0&quot;, &quot;u&quot; or &quot;2&quot;. '''Be careful''' with  this option, and check the changes made by the bot. Note that  some choices for XY don't make sense and will result in a loop, ''e.g.'', &quot;l&quot; or &quot;m&quot;.
;-main
:Only check pages in the main namespace, not in the talk,  wikipedia, user, etc. namespaces.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;-start:XY&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Goes through all disambiguation pages in the category on your wiki that is defined (to the bot) as the category containing disambiguation pages, starting at XY. If only '-start' or '-start:' is given, it starts at the beginning.

To complete a move of a page, one can use:

    python solve_disambiguation.py -just -pos:New_Name Old_Name

'''Table2wiki.py''' is part of the [[pywikibot]] framework.

Converts HTML-tables to MediaWiki's language.

Example of the simplest syntax:

table2wiki.py &quot;article name&quot; 
This way only 1 article is changed.

The process can also take place automatically, to do this a xml dump is needed:

 table2wiki.py -xml:20050406_cur_table.xml -lang:en 
-xml = name of the xml dump.

Note: Every change needs to be checked. This bot can make mistakes.

This [[pywikibot]] script replaces a template with another, and converts the old MediaWiki boilerplate format to the new template format.

== Usage ==
: Syntax: &lt;code&gt;python template.py [-remove] [xml[:filename]] &quot;oldTemplate&quot; [&quot;newTemplate&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;
: Example: &lt;code&gt;python template.py &quot;Cities in Washington&quot; &quot;Cities in Washington State&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
Specify the template on the command line. The program will pick up the template page, and look for all pages using it. It will then automatically loop over them, and replace the template.

=== Command line options ===
* -remove: Remove every occurence of the template from every article
* -subst: Resolves the template by putting its text directly into the article. This is done by changing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; into &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* -xml: retrieve information from a local dump (http://download.wikimedia.org). if this argument isn't given, info will be loaded from the maintenance page of the live wiki. argument can also be given as &quot;-xml:filename.xml&quot;.
* -namespace: Only process templates in the given namespace number (may be used multiple times).
* -summary: Lets you pick a custom edit summary.  Use quotes if edit summary contains spaces.
* -always: Don't bother asking to confirm any of the changes, Just Do It.
* -category: Appends the given category to every page that is edited.  This is useful when a category is being broken out from a template parameter or when templates are being upmerged but more information must be preserved.
* oldTemplate: old template name
* newTemplate: new template name. If only one argument is given, the bot resolves the template by putting its text directly into the article. This is done by changing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; into &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If you want to address a template which has spaces, put quotation marks around it.

Script to upload images to MediaWiki wikis.
== Usage ==
 python upload.py [Global-arguments] [-keep] [-filename:targetFilename] [-noverify] [URL-or-filename [description-text]]

{{Pywikibot/global options}}

== Arguments ==
{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 | -keep
 |Keep the filename as is
 |-
 | -filename
 |Target filename
 |-
 | -noverify
 |Do not ask for verification of the upload description if one is given
 |}

If any other arguments are given, the first is the URL or filename to upload, and the rest is a proposed description to go with the upload. If none of these are given, the user is asked for the
file or URL to upload. The bot will then upload the image to the wiki.

The script will ask for the location of an image, if not given as a parameter,
and for a description.

If the -filename argument is given, then it is used as the name of the image on the wiki; otherwise it is based on the filename or url of the input file.

If -keep is not specified, then the target filename undergoes some further checking, and the user is asked for confirmation. The / character is forbidden, and the filename extension (after the dot) must be one of these: gif, jpg, jpeg, mid, midi, ogg, png, svg, xcf, djvu. If the check is failed, then the user is prompted for a new filename.

Spaces in the filename will automatically be converted to underscores, since mediawiki doesn't allow spaces. The encoding of the filename will also be converted to the encoding used on the target site (typically unicode). The script also attempts to convert the description to the wiki's target encoding, or, as a last resort, will convert characters to html entities.

Error detection is based on both the http status and the contents of the response, which is assumed to be in English; error detection may fail if the bot's account has been set not to show an English interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Pywikibot/SVN}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''weblinkchecker.py''' is a script from the [[pywikibot]] framework. The script finds broken external links.

weblinkchecker.py can either check all URLs found in a single article, or in all articles (in alphabetical order). It will only check HTTP and HTTPS links, and it will leave out URLs inside comments and nowiki tags. To speed itself up, it will check up to 50 links at the same time, using multithreading.

The bot won't remove external links by itself, it will only report them; removal would require strong artificial intelligence. It will only report dead links if they have been found offline at least two times, with at least one week of waiting between the first and the last time. This should prevent users from removing links just because of a temporary server failure. Please keep in mind that the bot can't yet differentiate between '''failures of your own connection''' and a server failure, so make sure you're on a stable Internet connection.

The bot will save a history of broken links to the &lt;code&gt;deadlinks&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory, e.g. &lt;code&gt;deadlinks/deadlinks-wikipedia-de.dat&lt;/code&gt;. This file is not intended to be read or modified by humans. The dat file will be written when the bot terminates (because it is done or the user pressed CTRL-C).

After the bot has checked some pages, run it on these pages again at a later time. This can be done with this command:

&lt;code&gt;python weblinkchecker.py -repeat&lt;/code&gt;

If the bot finds a broken link that was already broken at least one week earlier, it will log it in a text file, e.g. &lt;code&gt;deadlinks/results-wikipedia-de.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The written text has a format that is suitable for posting it on the wiki, so that others can help you to fix or remove the broken links from the wiki pages.

Additionally, it's possible to report broken links to the talk page of the article in which the URL was found (again, only once the linked page has been unavailable at least twice in at least one week). To use this feature, set &lt;tt&gt;report_dead_links_on_talk = True&lt;/tt&gt; in your &lt;tt&gt;user-config.py&lt;/tt&gt;.

Reports will include a link to the [http://web.archive.org/ Internet Archive Wayback Machine] if available, so that important references can be kept.

For syntax explanation run:
 python weblinkchecker.py -help

'''cosmetic_changes.py''' makes little changes in one or several wiki pages that make the source code look cleaner. These changes are not supposed to change the look of the rendered wiki pages.

Before running it on a specific wiki, each sub-module should be reviewed and checked if it is helpful for this wiki.


This script performs the following operations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/cosmetic_changes.py source code, function &quot;change&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''fix self interwiki'': interwiki links to the site itself are displayed like local links, removing their language code prefix.
* ''standardize page footer'': makes sure that categories, stars templates for featured articles and interwiki links are put to the correct position. templates and interwiki links are sorted into the right order.
* ''clean up links'': improves how links are presented by doing the following:
** replaces underlines by spaces, also multiple underlines.
** removes unnecessary leading spaces from a title.
** removes unnecessary trailing spaces from a title.
** converts URL-encoded characters to unicode.
** removes unnecessary initial and final spaces from a label.
** tries to capitalize the first letter of the title.
* ''clean up section headers'': for better readability of section header source code, puts a space between the equal signs and the title; for example: &quot;==Section title==&quot; becomes &quot;== Section title ==&quot; .
* ''put spaces in lists'': for better readability of bullet list and enumeration wiki source code, puts a space between the * or # and the text.
* ''translate and capitalize namespaces'': makes sure that localized namespace names are used. Does not change &quot;image&quot; alias on en-wiki or fr-wiki.
* ''resolve html entities''
* ''valid xhtml'': tries to make a valid XHTML document, for example, replacing &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; by &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;
* ''remove useless spaces''
* ''remove non breaking space before percent'': newer MediaWiki versions automatically place a non-breaking space in front of a percent sign, so it is no longer required to place it manually.
* ''fix syntax'': correct mediawiki syntax for external links
* ''fix HTML'': translates some HTML-entities into the corresponding mediawiki syntax; remove unneeded &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag.
* ''fix style'': convert wikitable to wikitable class (de-wiki and en-wiki only).
* 'fix typo'': change ccm with preleading number to cm³; change º to ° if it concerns degree Celsius or Fahrenheit
* ''hyphenate isbn numbers'': tries to hyphenate an ISBN

'''login.py''' is the python program that logs the user running the pywikipedia bot on to the system using the data that can be found in '''user-config.py'''.

==Logging in as a bot==
Bots provide specified result and as a consequence, they should not need the attention that other changes require. By having a specific user to run the bot software, the changes created in this way will be hidden on a typical '''recent changes''' screen. Bot status is given when a community is in favour with someone running a bot.

If you want to login also with your sysop account (deleting moved categories...) you have to add
&lt;pre&gt;
sysopnames['wikiproject']['languagecode'] = u'YourSysopUsername'
&lt;/pre&gt;
to ''user-config.py'' and start ''login.py'' with the '''-sysop''' parameter

==How it knows where to login==
In the user-config.py file there are three components:
#the language: mylang
#the family: family - this indicates wiki name, including [[w:|wikipedia]] or [[wikt:|wiktionary]]
#the username: username - this can be any user but it should be a user who is registered to run as a bot.

In order to login to all the projects/languages mentioned in user-config.py, the option &lt;tt&gt;-all&lt;/tt&gt; can be used, and if the same password is used throughout all these projects, it can be combined with &lt;tt&gt;-pass&lt;/tt&gt; so that the program doesn't ask for a password for each site.
 login.py -all -pass
will login on all projects in user-config.py, using the same password for all.

'''archivebot.py''' is a script to archive discussion pages.

The bot examines backlinks (Special:Whatlinkshere) to the requested page(s).
It then goes through all pages (or a specific page if specified using options)
and archives old discussions. This is done by breaking a page into threads,
then scanning each thread for timestamps. Threads older than a specified
threshold are then moved to another page (the archive), the name of which can
be based on either the thread's name or a counter that is incremented when the
archive reaches a certain size.
The archive bot is usually used in the article talk page, user talk page, and Reading room.

==Parameters==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #99B3FF; color: black; border: #668CFF solid 0.2em; padding: 0.85em; margin-left: 3em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 3em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Usage: archivebot.py [options] [LINKPAGE(s)]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file=FILE  load list of pages from FILE
  -p PAGE, --page=PAGE  archive a single PAGE
  -n NAMESPACE, --namespace=NAMESPACE
                        only archive pages from a given namespace
  -s SALT, --salt=SALT  specify salt
  -F, --force           override security options
  -c PAGE, --calc=PAGE  calculate key for PAGE and exit
  -l LOCALE, --locale=LOCALE
                        switch to locale LOCALE
  -L lang, --lang=lang  current language code
  -T TIMEZONE, --timezone=TIMEZONE
                        switch timezone to TIMEZONE
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Examples==

(Got any good examples? This page could use them.)

'''basic.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework. It is not a complete bot; rather, it is a template from which simple bots can be made. You can rename it to mybot.py, then edit it in whatever way you want.

== Parameters ==
The following parameters are supported:

;-debug:If given, doesn't do any real changes, but only shows what would have been changed.

All other parameters will be regarded as part of the title of a single page,
and the bot will only work on that single page.

== Example ==
&lt;code&gt;python basic.py -debug User:MyUserName&lt;/code&gt;
:This tries to add 'Text ' in front of the page ''User:MyUserName''. Since the -debug option is given, the page wouldn't be changed.

Options:
;-onlynew
:Only run on pages that do not yet have a category.

&lt;!-- r7866 --&gt;

'''category_redirect.py''' will move pages out of redirected categories.

The bot will look for categories that are marked with a category redirect
template, take the first parameter of the template as the target of the
redirect, and move all pages and subcategories of the category there. It
also changes hard redirects into soft redirects, and fixes double redirects.
A log is written under &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;userpage&gt;/category_redirect_log&lt;/code&gt;. Only category pages
that haven't been edited for a certain cooldown period (currently 7 days)
are taken into account.

==Parameters==

No bot-specific parameters.

'''Copyright.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework that checks copyright text in Google, Yahoo! and Live Search.

Google search requires to install the pyGoogle module from http://pygoogle.sf.net and get a Google API license key from http://code.google.com/apis/soapsearch/ (but since December 2006 Google is no longer issuing new SOAP API keys).

Yahoo! search requires pYsearch module from http://pysearch.sourceforge.net (Debian and Ubuntu package this as &lt;tt&gt;python-pysearch&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;python-yahoo&lt;tt&gt;, depending on your version) and a Yahoo AppID from http://developer.yahoo.com.

Windows Live Search requires to install the SOAPpy module from http://pywebsvcs.sf.net (Debian and Ubuntu package this as &lt;tt&gt;python-soappy&lt;/tt&gt;) and get an AppID from http://search.msn.com/developer.

== Configuration ==
Before use the script you have to add to user-config.py one or more search engine keys. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
yahoo_appid = 'Key'
msn_appid = 'Key'
&lt;/source&gt;

== Parameters ==

;g
:Use Google search engine
;ng
:Do not use Google
;y
:Use Yahoo! search engine
;ny
:Do not use Yahoo!
;maxquery
:Stop after a specified number of queries for page (default: 25)
;new
:Check only the new pages
;repeat
;output
:Use this option to enable the output
:Append results to a specified file (default: 'copyright/output.txt')
;file
:Work on all pages given in a local text file. Will read any [[wiki link]] and use these articles. Argument can also be given as &quot;-file:filename&quot;.
;cat
:Work on all pages which are in a specific category. Argument can also be given as &quot;-cat:categoryname&quot;.
;subcat
:When the pages to work on have been chosen by -cat, pages in subcategories of the selected category are also included. When -cat has not been selected, this has no effect.
;page
:Only check a specific page. Argument can also be given as &quot;-page:pagetitle&quot;. You can give this parameter multiple times to check multiple pages.
;ref
:Work on all pages that link to a certain page. Argument can also be given as &quot;-ref:referredpagetitle&quot;.
;filelinks
:Works on all pages that link to a certain image. Argument can also be given as &quot;-filelinks:ImageName&quot;.
;links
:Work on all pages that are linked to from a certain page. Argument can also be given as &quot;-links:linkingpagetitle&quot;.
;start
:Work on all pages in the wiki, starting at a given page.
;namespace:n
:Number of namespace to process. The parameter can be used multiple times.

== Examples ==

If you want to check first 50 new articles then use this command:
 python copyright.py -new:50

If you want to check a category with no limit for number of queries to
request, use this:

This script can be used to delete pages en masse. You will need an admin account on the relevant wiki. Also add:

&lt;tt&gt;sysopnames['wikipedia']['en'] = 'adminname'&lt;/tt&gt;

To &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;

Where ['wikipedia'] is the name of the the family in which you are working on.

'adminname' is the username.

===Examples===

*Delete everything in the category &quot;To delete&quot; without prompting.

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py -cat:&quot;To delete&quot; -always&lt;/tt&gt;

*Delete everything in the pages linked to the page, without prompting.

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py &quot;deletepage&quot; -always&lt;/tt&gt;

*Delete pages inside a text file:

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py -file:nuke.txt -always -summary:&quot;Because I feel like it&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

The format of the text file should be as the following:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# [[Main Page]]
# [[Talk:Main Page]]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

*Restore pages:

&lt;tt&gt;python delete.py -undelete -file:respawn.txt -summary:&quot;It was a foolish mistake&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

===Arguments===

* -cat:   Delete all pages in the given category.
* -links:      Delete all pages linked from a given page.
* -always      Don't prompt to delete pages, just do it.
* -summary:    Supply a custom edit summary.
* -undelete:   Actually undelete pages instead of deleting. Works only with -page and -file.
* -file:       Delete all pages listed in a given text file.  The list should be of the format
** &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# [[page1]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# [[page2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;''etc.''&lt;/code&gt;

===Usage output===

Usage is reported thus;

 Global arguments available for all bots:
 
 -lang:xx          Set the language of the wiki you want to work on, overriding
                   the configuration in user-config.py. xx should be the
                   language code.
 
 -family:xyz       Set the family of the wiki you want to work on, e.g.
                   wikipedia, wiktionary, wikivoyage, ...
                   This will override the configuration in user-config.py.
 
 -log              Enable the logfile. Logs will be stored in the logs
                   subdirectory.
 
 -log:xyz          Enable the logfile, using xyz as the filename.
 
 -nolog            Disable the logfile (if it is enabled by default).
 
 -putthrottle:nn   Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between
                   saving pages.
 
 
 This script can be used to delete and undelete pages en masse.
 Of course, you will need an admin account on the relevant wiki.
 
 Syntax: python delete.py [-cat:categoryName|-page:pageName|...] [-summary:&quot;text&quot;] [-undelete] [-always]

'''Imageharvest.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework. It is used to copy multiple images to a wiki.  It takes a URL as an
argument and finds all images (and other files specified by the extensions in 'fileformats') that URL is referring to, asking whether to upload them. If further arguments are given, they are considered to be the text that is common to the descriptions.

A second use is to get a number of images that have URLs only differing in numbers. To do this, use the command line option &quot;-pattern&quot;, and give the URL with the variable part replaced by '$' (if that character occurs in the URL itself, you will have to change the bot code, my apologies).

Other options:
&lt;pre&gt;
-shown      Choose images shown on the page as well as linked from it
-justshown  Choose _only_ images shown on the page, not those linked
&lt;/pre&gt;

Syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
    python imageharvest.py http://www.sitename.org/folder 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Imagetransfer.py''' is a script of the [[pywikibot]] framework. It is used to copy images from one wiki to another wiki. If you want to transfer image to Wikimedia Commons you should use [[../imagecopy.py/]].

Syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
    python imagetransfer.py [common-arguments] pagename [-interwiki] [-tolang:xx] [-tofamily:yy]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Arguments:
&lt;pre&gt;

  -interwiki   Look for images in pages found through interwiki links.

  -tolang:xx   Copy the image to the wiki in language xx

  -tofamily:yy Copy the image to a wiki in the family yy

  -file:zz     Upload many files from textfile: [[Image:xx]]
                                                [[Image:yy]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

If pagename is an image description page, offers to copy the image to the target site. If it is a normal page, it will offer to copy any of the images used on that page, or if the -interwiki argument is used, any of the images used on a page reachable via interwiki links.

 &amp;nbsp;
 -prefix           Move pages by adding a namespace prefix to the names of the pages.
                   (Will remove the old namespace prefix if any)
                   Argument can also be given as &quot;-prefix:namespace:&quot;.
 &amp;nbsp;
 -always           Don't prompt to make changes, just do them.
 &amp;nbsp;
 -skipredirects    Skip redirect pages (Warning: increases server load)
 &amp;nbsp;

                   texts.
                   Argument can also be given as &quot;-summary:XYZ&quot;.
 &amp;nbsp;
 -pairs            Read pairs of file names from a file. The file must be in a format
                   &lt;nowiki&gt; [[frompage]]
                   [[topage]]

'''Pagefromfile.py''' is part of the [[pywikibot]] framework.

With this script you can create pages from a textfile.

The file should be in UTF-8 and if you want to create multiple pages from a file you should separate the articles as specified by the '''-start''' and '''-end''' arguments.

The pagename will be the first headword in your textfile (the first word between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''' '''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). It is currently automatically inserted in the uploaded page.

'''WARNING''': the script parses the input text in a recursive way, so it can easily run out of memory if the text contains several pages. It is advisable to break the input text into single pages and upload them individually.

Specific arguments:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!| arg || Description || Default
|-
|| -start:xxxx  
|| Specify the text that is the beginning of a page
|| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{-start-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|| -end:yyyy 
|| Specify the text that is the end of a page
|| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{-stop-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|| -file:zzz   
|| Give the filename we are getting our material from  
|| &lt;tt&gt;dict.txt&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|| -include   
|| The beginning and end text should be included in the page.
|| do not include
|-
|| -notitle
|| Do not include the title line in the page.
|| include title line
|-
||-titlestart:xxx
|| Use &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for identifying the beginning of the page title
|| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||-titleend:xxx
|| Use &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for identifying the end of the page title
|| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
||-summary:xxx
|| Use &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; as the summary for the upload.&lt;br /&gt;Leave &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; empty so as to use mediawikis autosummary.
|| depending on language
|-
||-minor
|| Set minor edit flag on page edits.
|| not selected
|-
||-dry
|| Do not really upload pages, just check and report messages.
|| not selected
|-
||-safe
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, do nothing, i.e. skip it.
|rowspan=&quot;4&quot; valign=&quot;middle&quot;| -safe
|-
||-appendtop
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, add the text to the top of it.
|-
||-appendbottom
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, add the text to the bottom of it.
|-
||-force
|| If the page to be uploaded already exists, overwrite the existing page.
|}

E.g.: &lt;tt&gt;Filename.xml&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
xxxx
'''PageName'''
Text here

yyyy
xxxx
'''AnotherPageName'''
Another text
yyyy
&lt;/pre&gt;
Usage:
&lt;pre&gt;
pagefromfile.py [global-arguments] -start:xxxx -end:yyyy -file:Filename.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''protect.py''' can be used to protect and unprotect pages en masse. To do this, you need an admin account on that wiki.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import wikipedia

def protect(pageName, reason):
    site = wikipedia.getSite()
    page = wikipedia.Page(site, pageName)
    page.protect(reason, False)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    try:
        protect('Test', &quot;Bot: Test&quot;)
    except:
        wikipedia.stopme()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()     
&lt;/source&gt;

See [[Pywikibot/wikipedia.py|wikipedia.py]] for more details of the protect function.

Docs in code:
&lt;pre&gt;
Syntax: python protect.py OPTION...

Command line options:

-page:       Protect specified page
-cat:        Protect all pages in the given category.
-nosubcats:  Don't protect pages in the subcategories.
-links:      Protect all pages linked from a given page.
-file:       Protect all pages listed in a text file.
-ref:        Protect all pages referring from a given page.
-images:     Protect all images used on a given page.
-always:     Don't prompt to protect pages, just do it.
-summary:    Supply a custom edit summary.
-unprotect:   Actually unprotect pages instead of protecting
-edit:PROTECTION_LEVEL Set edit protection level to PROTECTION_LEVEL
-move:PROTECTION_LEVEL Set move protection level to PROTECTION_LEVEL

## Without support ##
## -create:PROTECTION_LEVEL Set move protection level to PROTECTION_LEVEL ##

Values for PROTECTION_LEVEL are: sysop, autoconfirmed, none.
If an operation parameter (edit, move or create) is not specified, default
protection level is 'sysop' (or 'none' if -unprotect).
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''standardize_interwiki.py''', this bot moves the interwiki links on top of the articles. It is recommended to check whether this kind of bot is accepted on your wiki. This bot should '''not''' be used if you are not sure what you are doing. You should run this bot under strict supervision because when it is launched, it will parse all articles starting from the one you specified and will not stop : 

 python standardize_interwiki.py -start &quot;plane&quot;

Paramaters:

'''-start''' - Will ask you which page you want to start from. For example, entering &quot;plane&quot;, will start at &quot;plane&quot; and then move to the next article starting with &quot;pl&quot;, etc. This may flood the edits.

'''standardize_notes.py''' is a [[pywikibot]] script for improving references and citations.

The current version
* Uses [[en:Wikipedia:Footnotes]] numbered link format through &quot;ref&quot; and &quot;note&quot; templates.
* Converts inline URLs to Footnotes format links to citation entries.
* Converts older link formats such as Footnotes2 to Footnotes format.
* Searches for existing footnotes or citations in several section names, such as &quot;Notes&quot; or &quot;References&quot;.
* Creates citation entries using [[en:WP:CITE]] citation templates.
** For citations for which only a URL is known, attempts to access the URL.
*** Attempts to get title information from HTTP or PDF information.
** &quot;Web reference&quot; citations are created by default.
** &quot;News reference&quot; citations are created for certain URLs.
* Rebuilds notes section in same sequence as text references.
* Some multiple references are converted to &quot;ref_label&quot; and &quot;note_label&quot; multiple links.
* Detects some duplicate citations, labels them with &quot;see above&quot;.
* Keeps existing notes, does not yet examine content of notes other than leading &quot;*&quot; or &quot;#&quot; list indicator.

Default behavior includes displaying changes and asking for confirmation to perform the intended changes.

If no title information is found or there are errors in accessing the URL, the title will contain the URL.

'''Welcome.py''' is a script of the [[Pywikibot]] framework used to welcome new users. This script works out of the box for wikis that have been defined in the script. It is currently used on the Dutch, Norwegian and Italian Wikipedia, and Wikimedia Commons and English Wikiquote.

If you want download the latest version of this code use [[Pywikibot/SVN|SVN]] or copy the script from [http://botwiki.sno.cc/wiki/Python:Welcome.py this wiki].

Ensure you have community support before running this bot!

== URLs to current implementations ==
* Arabic Wikipedia: http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/ويكيبيديا:سجل_الترحيب
* Wikimedia Commons: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Welcome_log
* Dutch Wikipedia: http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Logboek_welkom
* English Wikiquote: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Welcome_log
* Persian Wikipedia: http://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/ویکی‌پدیا:سیاهه_خوشامد

Because of the fact that every project has different settings, the Bot won't work if you don't put the right translation of the dictionaries that are already in the script.

== Description of basic functionality ==
* Request a list of new users every period (default: 3600 seconds)
* Ignore local bot accounts and users with ''bot'' as part of his name which may be a global bot
* Check if new user has passed a threshold for a number of edits (default: 1 edit)
* Optional: check username for bad words in the username or if the username consists solely of numbers; log this somewhere on the wiki (default: False)
* If user has made any edits, check if user has an empty talk page
* If user had an empty talk page, add a welcome message
* Optional: Once the set number of users have been welcomed, add this to the configured log page, one for each day (default: True)
* If no log page exists, create a header for the log page first.

== Parameters ==
This script (by default not yet implemented) uses two templates that need to be on the local wiki:
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{WLE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: contains mark up code for log entries (just copy it from Commons)
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;: contains the information for new users

This script understands the following command-line arguments:
&lt;pre&gt;
    -edit[:#]      Define how many edits a new user needs to be welcomed
                   (default: 1, max: 50)

    -time[:#]      Define how many seconds the bot sleeps before restart
                   (default: 3600)

    -break         Use it if you don't want that the Bot restart at the end
                   (it will break) (default: False)

    -nlog          Use this parameter if you do not want the bot to log all
                   welcomed users (default: False)

    -limit[:#]     Use this parameter to define how may users should be
                   checked (default:50)

    -offset[:TIME] Skip the latest new users (those newer than TIME)
                   to give interactive users a chance to welcome the
                   new users (default: now)
                   Timezone is the server timezone, GMT for Wikimedia
                   TIME format : yyyymmddhhmmss

    -timeoffset[:#] Skip the latest new users, accounts newer than
                    # minutes

    -numberlog[:#] The number of users to welcome before refreshing the
                   welcome log (default: 4)

    -filter        Enable the username checks for bad names (default: False)

    -ask           Use this parameter if you want to confirm each possible
                   bad username (default: False)

    -random        Use a random signature, taking the signatures from a wiki
                   page (for instruction, see below).

    -file[:#]      Use a file instead of a wikipage to take the random sign.
                   If you use this parameter, you don't need to use -random.
                   
    -sign          Use one signature from command line instead of the default

    -savedata      This feature saves the random signature index to allow to
                   continue to welcome with the last signature used.

    -sul           Welcome the auto-created users (default: False)

    -quiet         Prevents users without contributions are displayed

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Extra-functionality guide ==
 
Report, Bad Word and White List Guide:
 
# Set in the code which page it will use to load the bad word list, the white list and the report.
# In these pages you have to add a &quot;tuple&quot; with the names that you want to add in the two lists. For example: ('cat', 'mouse', 'dog'). You can also write other text in the page; it will work without problems.
#What will the two pages do?  Well, the Bot will check if a badword is in the username and set the &quot;warning&quot; to True. Then the Bot checks if a word of the white list is in the username. If yes, it removes the word and rechecks in the bad-word list to see if there are other bad words in the username.
# '''Example''':
#* dio is a badword
#* Claudio is a normal name
#* The username is &quot;Claudio90 fuck!&quot;
#* The Bot find dio and set &quot;warning&quot;
#* The Bot find Claudio and set &quot;ok&quot;
#* The Bot find fuck at the end and set &quot;warning&quot;
#* Result: The username is reported.
#When a user is reported you have to check him and do the following:
#* If he's ok, put out the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#* If he's not, block him
#* You can decide to put in a &quot;you are blocked, change to another username&quot; template or not.
#* Delete the username from the page.

'''Important''': The Bot checks the user in this order:
* Searches to see if he has a talkpage (if yes, skip).
* Searches to see if he's blocked, if yes he will be skipped.
* Searches to see if he's in the report page, if yes he will be skipped.
* If no, he will be reported.

== Random sign guide ==
 
* Set the page that the bot will load
* Add the signs in this way:
&lt;pre&gt;*&lt;white space&gt;SIGN
&lt;new line&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
'''Example''':

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
* [[User:Filnik|Filnik]]
* [[User:Rock|Rock]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
 
'''Note''': The white space and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; aren't required but I suggest you to use them.

==  Known issues/FIXMEs ==
* exits when wiki is down.
* add variable for how many users to skip (f.e. the 10 latest users, that may not have made any edits)
* use default pages if a wiki is not configured, so no configuration of the script would be required at all. Suggestion: use English language defaults.
* The regex to load the user might be slightly different from project to project. (in this case, write to [[User:Filnik|Filnik]] for help...)
* If the User talk: translation has non-standard character it won't work.
* Add in the report, the badword used to detect the user.

'''wikipedia.py'''([http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/wikipedia.py]) is a module available with the [[Pywikibot|pywikibot framework]]. This module offers some internal classes and functions to be used in front-end scripts to provide automated editing and retrieve information from edit histories of users and pages, categorization of pages and so on. Based on the APIs explained here, you can create your own front-end program for automating actions at Wikipedia. Running wikipedia.py itself directly, one would get the version information as output.

== Page class, site class and wikipedia.stopme() function ==
The most important class (and the most used) is the Page class. It provides all the common action for a wikipage. To use that, you must first of all call it, and only afterwards can you use its internal function.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia # Import the wikipedia module

site = wikipedia.getSite() # Taking the default site
page = wikipedia.Page(site, 'PAGENAME') # Calling the constructor
print page
wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example, you import the wikipedia module. After that it's needed to define the site where the page is. If you take it how it's done in the example, you'll take the page that is in the project set in user-config.py. 

If you want to load the page of a different project you have to do as in the following example. At the end, there is &lt;tt&gt;wikipedia.stopme()&lt;/tt&gt; that is needed so that your other bot processes aren't slowed down.
 
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
enWikisrcSite = wikipedia.getSite('en', 'wikisource') # loading a defined project's page
page = wikipedia.Page(enWikisrcSite, 'Main Page')
text = page.get() # Taking the text of the page
print text
wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

== Rewrite code better  ==
In the previous example, you import wikipedia. The site is defined as English Wikisource, with the parameters 'en' and 'wikisource'. Then we define the Main Page as the page to take. And we load the text.

Then we print the text to the screen to let the user read it.  Actually, this code is not really clean and good. An experienced coder can improve it as follows.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
# Define the main function
def main():
    titleOfPageToLoad = u'Main Page' # The &quot;u&quot; before the title means Unicode, important for special characters
    wikipedia.output(u'Loading %s...' % titleOfPageToLoad)
    enwiktsite = wikipedia.getSite('en', 'wikisource') # loading a defined project's page
    page = wikipedia.Page(enwiktsite, titleOfPageToLoad)
    text = page.get() # Taking the text of the page
    wikipedia.output(text) # Print the text, encoding it with wikipedia's method

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

This code is better than before for many reasons. First of all, it uses a function and it's not procedural as before. In this way, the main function will only be invoked if the script is called directly. This makes it possible to import it from another script, making the code more modular and reusable.

Furthermore, the try/finally block guarantees that stopme() is always called, even when an exception is raised. This prevents the slowing down of other process and is quicker when you test a script.

Another interesting new thing is the use of wikipedia.output(). It does the same job of printing &quot;something&quot; but, and this is the important thing, it encodes and decodes the text using the encoding defined in user-config. This makes sure that special characters like Umlauts or Cyrillic letters are shown correctly. '''Note:''' If you don't put the text in the u&quot;something&quot; (with the u) the function will return a (handled, but ugly to see) error. (the text variable contain already the code encode in a good way, so it won't raise an exception).

Unfortunately, you can't always be sure that the page you are trying to load exists. To prevent that, wikipedia.py will raise a NoPage exception. You can use an except block to solve the problem, as in the following example.

== site.allpages() function and the wikipedia.py errors ==
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
# Define the main function
def main():
    site = wikipedia.getSite()
    startpage = '!'
    for page in site.allpages(startpage): # Use a generetor object, this will yield all pages one by one
        pagename = page.title() # Take the title of the page (not &quot;[[page]]&quot; but &quot;page&quot;)
        wikipedia.output(u&quot;Loading %s...&quot; % pagename) # Please, see the &quot;u&quot; before the text
        try:
            text = page.get() # Taking the text of the page
        except wikipedia.NoPage: # First except, prevent empty pages
            text = ''
        except wikipedia.IsRedirectPage: # second except, prevent redirect
            wikipedia.output(u'%s is a redirect!' % pagename)
            continue
        except wikipedia.Error: # third exception, take the problem and print
            wikipedia.output(u&quot;Some error, skipping..&quot;)
            continue     
        wikipedia.output(text) # Print the output, encoding it with wikipedia's method

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we can see our first generator object that is in wikipedia.py. First of all, we define the site (it's suggested to do it immediatly, because it's quite impossibile not to use a site's function if you need to work with wikipedia). The second variable is the page from which the Bot will load all the pages on your wikimedia's project. 

Then, in the line below, you start a for cycle parsing every page on Wikipedia. Look out, because the function allpages() isn't a sub-function of wikipedia, but of site! (so, you can determine from what project you want to load all the pages). 

The allpages() function has optional parameter, one of these are the start page (default = '!'), then there is the namespace (default = 0), then if you want to include redirects (default: True), and the throttle (default: True). In the example, if you wanted to use the optional parameters as well, you would have used:
&lt;pre&gt;
def allpages(self, start = '!', namespace = 0, includeredirects = True, throttle = True)
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the line below, we load the page's title, in this way you don't print &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; but Page, so it's a better output. Two lines below, you find the try/except block. 

The Bot tries to load the page and if it doesn't exists (maybe someone has deleted it while the bot was running) it will print only a empty text (you can do what you want, I've choosen this only for explanation purpose). If the page is a redirect, it will notify it and, to make sure that nothing will happend, we put an extreme Exception that don't block the Bot (for example, if there is a Spamfilter's problem, it will be handled in this way). The possible Wikipedia's Errors are:

&lt;pre&gt;
*wikipedia.Error                General Error
*wikipedia.NoUsername           the Username is not in user-config.py
*wikipedia.NoPage               The Page does not exist
*wikipedia.IsRedirectPage       The Page is a redirect page
*wikipedia.IsNotRedirectPage    The Page is not a redirect page
*wikipedia.LockedPage           The Page is locked
*wikipedia.LockedNoPage         Page does not exist, and creating it is not possible because of a lock (cascading protection)
*wikipedia.NoSuchEntity         No entity exist for this character
*wikipedia.SectionError         The section specified by # does not exist
*wikipedia.PageNotSaved         Saving the page has failed (General Error)
*wikipedia.EditConflict         There has been an edit conflict while uploading the page
*wikipedia.SpamfilterError      Saving the page has failed because the MediaWiki spam filter detected a blacklisted URL.
*wikipedia.ServerError          Got unexpected server response
*wikipedia.UserBlocked          Your username or IP has been blocked
*wikipedia.PageNotFound         Page not found in list
&lt;/pre&gt;

== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).get() and wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).put() analysis ==
Now we have only done a few tests, but the real job of a Bot, on Wikipedia, is to modify pages! It's not made to print in a DOS screen what is in a page. So, let's try to make the Bot to put the text inside a page.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
# Define the main function
def main():
    site = wikipedia.getSite()
    pagename = 'Wikipedia:Sandbox'
    page = wikipedia.Page(site, pagename)
    wikipedia.output(u&quot;Loading %s...&quot; % pagename) # Please, see the &quot;u&quot; before the text
    try:
        text = page.get(force = False, get_redirect=False, throttle = True, sysop = False, 
                                             change_edit_time = True) # text = page.get() &lt;-- is the same
    except wikipedia.NoPage: # First except, prevent empty pages
        text = ''
    except wikipedia.IsRedirectPage: # second except, prevent redirect
        wikipedia.output(u'%s is a redirect!' % pagename)
        exit()# wikipedia.stopme() is in the finally, we don't need to use it twice, exit() will only close the script
    except wikipedia.Error: # third exception, take the problem and print
        wikipedia.output(u&quot;Some Error, skipping..&quot;)
        exit()
    newtext = text + '\nThis is a nice test, deleteme please'
    page.put(newtext, comment='Bot: Test', watchArticle = None, minorEdit = True)  # page.put(newtext, 'Bot: Test') &lt;-- is the same

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;

In this script there are options specified that are already set by default. This is to show examples of options that can be used with this useful function. So, you can use &lt;tt&gt;text = page.get()&lt;/tt&gt; to load the text and only &lt;tt&gt;page.put(newtext, 'Bot: Test')&lt;/tt&gt; to put the changes, if you don't need to change the other options.

=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).get() ===
*force = False : if force is set as True, the Bot will ignore all the exceptions raised, included redirects, so you won't get errors (but your code can make mistakes..)
*get_redirect = False : if it is set to True, the Bot won't stop himself but it will follow the redirect (f.e. if you have &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Php]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that redirect to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[PHP]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the bot will load PHP).
*throttle = True : to slow down the Bot so as not to over-stress the Server. Within wikimedia projects, you must to set it to be True.

*sysop = False: To get the page as sysop (if you need to do some sysop's actions with this page (you can log-in as sysop if you need to edit protected pages or to do something that only sysops can do).
*nofollow_redirects=False : Like force it won't raise an exception if you load a redirect... but it will raise in all the other cases.
*change_version_date = True : set it to False if you have already loaded the page before and do not check this version for changes before saving.

=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).put() ===
.put(newtext, comment='Bot: Test', watchArticle = None, minorEdit = True)
*newtext is the text that you'll put on Wikipedia
*comment = None : is the comment that the Bot will use when it will make a change. (default = &quot;Wikipedia python library&quot;)
*watchArticle = None : if you want to put the article edited to your bot's watchlist you have to change it to True
*minorEdit = True : The Bot will make a minor-edit. If it's not necessary, set it to True also if you make big-changes. '''Note''': If you edit a user's talk page, if you want to let them know of the change that you've done, set this parameter to False otherwise set it to True.

If you want to change the default comment, you can use the function wikipedia.setAction(text) to use text instead of &quot;Wikipedia python library&quot; to be sure that your code won't have strange summary's messages.

== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).getReferences(), .move(), .protect(), .delete() and .undelete() ==
The Page class has a lot of function that let you make what you want and there are so many function that also what you think that was impossibile to do with a Bot can become reality. For example, do you know that (if you are a sysop) you can load a deleted revision, using the Bot? (and you can also undelete it!) But now it's better to explain the main and most used function (by the way, you can find what you need also taking a look at the code and searching &lt;tt&gt;def getDeletedRevision(&lt;/tt&gt;)

=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).getReferences() ===
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import wikipedia
def main():
    page = wikipedia.Page(wikipedia.getSite(), 'Wikipedia:Sandbox')
    for pagetoparse in page.getReferences(follow_redirects=True, withTemplateInclusion=True, onlyTemplateInclusion=False, redirectsOnly=False):
        wikipedia.output(pagetoparse.title())
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    finally:
        wikipedia.stopme()
&lt;/source&gt;
It's a generator, this means that it returns all the pages that reference to the page defined with the wikipedia.Page() class. If you need to load the entire list of referred pages to work with them, use:
&lt;pre&gt;
pages = [page for page in s.getReferences()]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Like the previous examples, you can use the reference function as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in page.getReferences():
    wikipedia.output(i.title())
&lt;/source&gt;
The parameters available are:
(follow_redirects=True, withTemplateInclusion=True, onlyTemplateInclusion=False, redirectsOnly=False):
*follow_redirect=True : as above, it returns also redirects if it's True (otherwise it won't return the redirects)
*withTemplateInclusion=True : if you use a page as template, in the references appears a &quot;included in page [...]&quot; so, if you need only to load the pages that links to the page, set to True otherwise set to False.
*onlyTemplateInclusion=False : if True, it will load only the pages that use the page as a Template and not the other.
*redirectsOnly=False : if True, it will return only the redirects to the page
&lt;!--
=== wikipedia.Page(site, pagename).move() ===
This function can be useful when you are writing a script. But you have to know that there is already a script, &lt;tt&gt;movepages.py&lt;/tt&gt;, that can be used in most of cases. By the way, can be useful to know how to implement this feature in one of your script, so, here we are, ready to explain how to use it.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
site = wikipedia.getSite()
page = wikipedia.Page(site, 'Project:Sandbox')
page.move('Project:Sandbox new', 'Bot: Test', movetalkpage = True, sysop = False, throttle = False)
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example you can see that we--&gt;

*[[Pywikibot/blockpageschecker.py]] &amp;mdash; This is a script originally written by Wikihermit and then rewritten by Filnik, to delete the templates used to warn in the pages that a page is blocked, when the page isn't blocked at all. Indeed, very often sysops block the pages for a setted time but then they forget to delete the warning! This script is useful if you want to delete those useless warning left in these pages.
*[[Pywikibot/capitalize_redirects.py]] &amp;mdash; Bot to create capitalized redirects where the first character of the first word is uppercase and the remainig characters and words are lowercase.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''rciw.py''' is a simple IRC script to check for Recent Changes through IRC, and to check for interwikis in those recently modified articles.

Can not be run manually/directly, but automatically by maintainer.py

In use on hu:, not sure if this scales well on a large wiki such as en: (Depending on the edit rate, the number of IW threads could grow continuously without ever decreasing)

Params:

== Wikibooks ==

As this is becoming more and more textbook-like, I'd like to import it to [[Wikibooks]], where it can be integrated and linked with other texts, such as [[b:Linux Guide|Linux Guide]], which will be very helpful to readers. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/b&gt;]].[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[:b:en:User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;@en.wb&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 22 January 2010 (UTC)
:It should go somewhere else, that's for sure. If not Wikibooks, maybe Wikiversity or MediaWiki.org. Meta-wiki needs to be depopulated of stuff that applies to MediaWiki installations in general (rather than just Wikimedia projects). Also, isn't the name &quot;Pywikipediabot&quot; kinda misleading, since it can be used on other wikis? [[User:Tisane|Tisane]] 22:13, 8 April 2010 (UTC)

== Login issues ==

When trying to login (login.py) I am asked for the password for the relevant user. I supply this. It then asks for the CAPTCHA solution. I enter this. It then tells me that Login failed. Obvious answer is I am entering one or the other incorrectly. However, I have tried many times. I have changed my password on the wiki and then retried. Same result. Am I coming up against a known issue? Apart from entering wrong answers, which I am sure I am not doing, is there another reason that I cannot log in?[[Special:Contributions/88.108.210.61|88.108.210.61]] 08:58, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

When I check both the Index.php and the api.php files two things are apparent. First, they are at:

and
http://fightingfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Api.php

respectively (i.e. not w/index.php)

and second, neither of them have content. Whereas if you were to check http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Index.php it is the MainPage (and http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Api.php does nto exist).

Does anyone know what I need to do from here?[[Special:Contributions/88.108.210.61|88.108.210.61]] 11:38, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

== Python Subject and Category ==

Hi, I read the message on the mailing list and thought I should suggest that this book be categorized under [[:Category:Python programming language]], and listed on [[Subject:Python programming language]].  As I am not part of this community I do not think it appropriate to [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] in this case. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 02:37, 23 May 2010 (UTC)
:While Pywikibot does ''use'' Python, and it does discuss some Python code, it does not appear to be a book ''on'' Python, which the books in that category/subject cover specifically.  It would be like putting books on software that runs on Windows in [[Subject:Microsoft Windows]].  That said, a different category below [[:Category:Computer software]] (or that category itself) or some other category may be appropriate.  [[:Category:Utility software]] is the best I could come up with at this time. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:51, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

== missing important info ==

The page says how to download and configure the package but doesn't say what the package actually does.  Yes, automates some bot tasks.  But WHAT tasks does it automate?  I'm trying to examine the evolution of a bunch of enwiki articles through their edit history, which means I have to pull a lot of diffs and process them.  It would help a lot if the front page or overview page of this document listed the main functions that the bot framework supplies, so I could tell at a glance if it was going to be useful.  Is it just a lightweight wrapper for the MW API?  I'm beginning to get that impression.

== CVS diff ==
You recommend using &quot;cvs diff&quot;. Surely you want to recommend &quot;cvs diff -u&quot;? This gives a much more robust diff format than the default (submitting patches in a format other than unidiff is a common newbie dev mistake). Subversion uses that format by default, and is nicer than CVS in lots of other ways, so you might want to move to that instead :) [[User:Hairy Dude|Hairy Dude]] 08:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:pywikipediabot is a framework for which most of the users have installed CVS tools, and these users are not using CVS for anything else. It is bad enough that we required normal users to use developers tools to use the programs, migrating to subversion will not happen any time soon! You are completely right that -u should be used to generate patches against cvs. [[User:Rob Hooft|Rob Hooft]] 12:01, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

== CVS instructions ==

I think the CVS instructions need updating. They don't seem to work- did the CVS repository move to another address? --[[User:129.21.121.171|129.21.121.171]] 18:33, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

== Unicode problem ==

I am writing a bot to run on Hindi Wikipedia. I am using python wikimedia framework. I am getting an error, &quot;UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: unexpected code byte&quot; when executing the following code, 

        f = codecs.open('hi-towns.csv', 'r', config.textfile_encoding)
        x = f.read().decode('utf8')

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, [[User:Ganeshk|Ganeshk]] 03:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
:This was solved. - [[User:Ganeshk|Ganeshk]] 15:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

== Not updated? ==

TortoiseCVS does not seem to work with Pywikipedia, &lt;s&gt;and the link http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=93107 seems to be dead&lt;/s&gt;. - [[User:Soulkeeper|Soulkeeper]] 19:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

== python-xml ==

On another list it mentioned that the python-xml libraries were needed as well. With Fedora Linux I got that using 'yum install PyXML'. Other systems probably vary. [[User:143.52.82.248|143.52.82.248]] 13:57, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

== doc included in framework ==

I extracted the documentation included in wkipedia.py with this :
&lt;pre&gt;
import wikipedia
import codecs

manuel = file(&quot;manuel.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
doc = wikipedia.__doc__

for ligne in doc:
    manuel.write(ligne)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Maybe one can include this somewhere ?

''(To work in Python25 http://www.python.org/download/, the files must be downloaded into the Python25 folder).''
I have installed Python25 and downloaded pywikipedia from cvs today, the pywikipedia files are on a different disk than the Python25 folder, and it works. I conclude that what this line claims is false. I am not 100% sure so I didn't edit it out myself. If anyone is 100% sure, please edit it out. [[User:Theroachman|Theroachman]] 23:47, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

:I've always thought this was false because I think I have Python 2.5 on the other computer I used to run Pywikipediabot on. But I just verified. I installed Python 2.5 and altered my environment variable so that the system would use Python25 instead of Python24, and Pywikipediabot runs the exact same as it did with Python 2.4 so this line must be false. I really don't get why anyone would have added this line. It's more unproductive than productive, IMHO you should never go and put frameworks like Pywikipediabot into the core folder of the programs running them.
:Also, for those who use TortiseCVS there is a bit of confusion with the CVSROOT for those who have never used it before, I'm going to tweak that to.

Does anyone know how to run a bot, record edits that it would have made, but not actually make the edtits? (also known as a Dry-run)
:Within this framework, you have to edit the code in wikipedia.py under the Site class, under the postData method so that &quot;con.send(data)&quot; line prints data instead, you'll have to comment out the rest of that method as well.

Because when I try that, it tells me &quot;SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character&quot;.

== Various options ==

I think we need a bit more options described in the configuration section.  There's a few options that were essential for getting the bot to work (e.g. adding 'Colorized_output = False') that are not described on the main page - and if there are other variables available, they should be listed. Of course, the necessity of that variable probably counts as a bug. --[[Special:Contributions/76.10.156.14|76.10.156.14]] 20:33, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

Hi all,

I'm making a few experimentations with the pywikipediabot but I'm facing a major problem; i was able to set up Python and the bot in itself, though when I want to launch login.py, it asks me my password and I can't type a thing. I tried on WP FR and EN but it didn't change a thing. Can anyone help me on that point? Many thanks. --[[User:Bombastus|Bombastus]] 10:23, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

: Hi there ! When the bot asks you to enter your password, you can enter it on your keyboard, even if the letters don't appear on the screen. Once it's done, press Enter and the bot will tell you if it's logged in or not. -[[User:Urobore|Urobore]] 06:32, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

I can only access my MediaWiki at my hoster through (s)ftp and thus installed a phpshell to have some shell functionality. Unfortunately this is not an interactive shell. Can I still use these bots in an non-interactive mode. I already fail at the login. I guess it asks for the password.

I am especially interested in using weblinkchecker.py and replace.py. But ideally I would like to be able to use all scripts.

===answer===
modify your &quot;pflegewiki_family.py&quot; like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
# -*- coding: utf-8  -*-

import family

# The meta family

class Family(family.Family):
    name = 'PflegeWiki'
    def __init__(self):
        self._addlang('de',
                        location = 'www.pflegewiki.de',
                        namespaces = { 4: u'PflegeWiki',
                                      5: u'Diskussion' })

    def path(self, code):
        return '/index.php'

&lt;/pre&gt;
should work then

=== wont work for me neither ===

The script claimns that my password is wrong but when I use the url (login and passord) from the config in a browser everything works. The family looks like.
&lt;pre&gt;
# -*- coding: utf-8  -*-

import family

class Family(family.Family):
    name = 'fridewiki' #Set the family name; this should be the same as in the filename.

    def __init__(self):
        family.Family.__init__(self)
	
	self.langs = {
            'de':'vierzig4.dyndns.org',
	}


    def version(self, code):
        return &quot;1.4.2&quot;  #The MediaWiki version used. Not very important in most cases.

    def path(self, code):
        return '/mediawiki/index.php' #The path of index.php
&lt;/pre&gt;

did i forget something?
:I used to have the same problem.Later I solved it. It's caused by the wrong path(sel,code) setting. Make sure http://yousitename.com/mediawiki/index.php could point the real index.php file --[[User:Farm|Farm]] 11:01, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

Whats annoying is that my installation was working but now it throws errors about character sets so I down loaded the latest files to see if that fixed it

::Probably not everybody else is as stupid as I am, but check that all your cases are consistent - i.e. if you've used lowercase in the filename, use lowercase when you refer to the family. Also, check what case your login uses. Just a tip that would have saved me about an hour... :$

== Uploaded images blank or corrupt ==

I'm having trouble using upload.py to upload images correctly to our MediaWiki 1.4-based site. I've been able to login to the server with the bot account, run the upload script, and the script reports a correct upload. However, when I look at the images on the site, they are the correction dimensions, but are either: a) blank, or b) blank with a few lines of corrupted pixels at the top of the image.

Here's some of the things I've tried:
* Uploading with the standard web browser user interface using the bot account (works fine).
* Tried using my standard administrator user account with the script (same bad result).
* Tried using other image formats; .png, .gif, .jpg (same result).
* Tried different image files (same result).
* Moved image location to the same location as the script on disk (same result).

I don't think it's a permissions problem, since I'm able to upload the files manually using the same account, though I admit I don't know much about MediaWiki permissions. Any ideas?

==Pagefromfile.py==
I've tried to load a file into my own MediaWiki. But I get the message 'DBG&gt; page may be locked?' and 'Page &lt;title&gt; already exists, not adding!' However the page doesn't exist in my MediaWiki. whats wrong?

== Compatibility between Mediawiki 1.6.1 and Pywikipedia &quot;snapshot-20060312&quot; ? ==

Hello,

I'm having problems loging using login.py on my non-wikimedia project, so I wonder if there is any incompatibilities between Compatibility between Mediawiki 1.6.1 and Pywikipedia &quot;snapshot-20060312&quot; ?

I think so because of the differents POST URLs generated using the normal login method and logging using login.py

In /var/log/apache2/access.log :

If I try to log using the login.py script, it fails:&lt;br /&gt;

If I try to log using my browser, it succeeds:&lt;br /&gt;

'''If it suceeds''' : URL = Special:Userlogin&amp;action=submitlogin&amp;type=login&lt;br /&gt;


Here is the output when I try to log in :

When trying to connect pywikipedia bot to a wiki in location www.example.com/folder/folder/wiki/index.php the failure displayed below occured. Basically it seemed the URL in the families file was not recognised.

In families file I had specified 
 self.langs         = { 'en':         'www.example.com/folder/folder/wiki/', }

The solution to the failure was to specify only the domain the self.langs, and the subfolders in the call to &quot;path&quot;,

== Working with LDAP authentication? ==

Does anyone know if there's a way to get this bot working with [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_talk:LDAP_Authentication#Making_work_with_Pywikipediabot LDAP Authentication]?  I had no problems running it before I went to LDAP, but now it doesn't seem to work, any ideas?

[[User:HotMonkeyAC|HotMonkeyAC]] 20:28, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

: in login.py, there's a block of code that sets wpName, wpPassword, etc. To get LDAP working, add this
&quot;wpDomain&quot; : &quot;MYDOMAIN&quot;,

===This doesn't work===
I did this, replacing MYDOMAIN as above with my LDAP domain name, and no change in behavior - it still fails, complaining of either a bad password or bad CAPTCHA data.


I got this to work with LDAP by putting self.domain = 'domain here' in wiki_family.py, where domain here is the LDAP domain. It did not work with self.name = 'domain here' as it says it should in the documentation README-family.txt -[[User:Funkmaster 801|Funkmaster 801]] 18:45, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

This also does not work - when I added the &lt;tt&gt;self.domain = 'domain here'&lt;/tt&gt; line, (substituting my actual domain, of course) it simply generates a syntax error.  Can you post a family file that works so I can see what I might be doing wrong?

With the embedded colon??  Not sure how that's supposed to map to a MediaWiki variable that way, but I'll try it.

Okay - this doesn't work, just tested it.  I didn't expect it to, with the colon embedded in the key name like that.  Removing the colon and trying again - okay, once I checked my path override in my family file, '''''it finally worked'''''.  Now I'll test it with the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; login.py file from the latest version and see if that works - it may have been my family file the entire time.

My conclusion is that a lot of people are confusing the rendered path that MediaWiki generates with the raw URL you need to reach the login page itself.  You have to get there without the use of the MediaWiki-massaged path, which will ''not'' succeed.

Also, the new login.py does ''not'' work.  Hard-coding the LDAP domain as AdrianArcher identified, however, did work.

:The name=&quot;blah&quot; of the family file must match the family=&quot;blah&quot; in the user-config.py file. Also, this same name has to be applied to the name of the family file, so it is &quot;blah_family.py&quot; (mercs, presumably, in this case).

:Further, it looks like (hard to be sure once you've copied and pasted it into the webpage) that your indentation is kind of messed up. &lt;code&gt;name=&lt;/code&gt; should be &lt;code&gt;self.name=&lt;/code&gt;, and it should be after &lt;code&gt;def __init__&lt;/code&gt;. Also, I don't know what &lt;code&gt;_addlangs()&lt;/code&gt; is, it might be a valid function, but it's not mentioned in the README file for families (which I recommend you read). Same thing with &lt;code&gt;path()&lt;/code&gt; - it's not in the readme, &lt;code&gt;scriptpath()&lt;/code&gt; is. It doesn't even look like the Mercs Wiki ''uses'' a script path...

:I think, though I am not certain, that you would use this:
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;# -*- coding: utf-8  -*-

import family

# The mercs wiki

class Family(family.Family):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'mercs'
        self.langs = {
            'en': 'mercs.wikia.com',
        }

        self.namespaces[4]['en'] = u'Mercs Wiki'
        self.namespaces[5]['en'] = u'Mercs Wiki talk'

        self.namespaces[110] = { 'en': u'Forum' }
        self.namespaces[111] = { 'en': u'Forum talk' }

    def scriptpath(self, code):
        return ''&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
:I made this using [http://mercs.wikia.com/api.php?action=query&amp;meta=siteinfo&amp;siprop=general|namespaces|namespacealiases|statistics Mercs Wiki's API], and the &lt;code&gt;README-family.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in the Family folder. I'm somewhat new at this, but I think that will work.

== Custom Namespaces ==

I added a bunch of information that I could not find ''anywhere'' when I was trying to set up my installation of PyWikipedia to work on a Wiki with custom namespaces (much thanks to the people on #pywikipediabot for helping me out with this in the first place). It's a bit wordy and some of it ''probably'' ought to go elsewhere, but I didn't know where and I figured it'd be easier for people to move what I wrote to someplace appropriate. If you have any questions/comments on the text, let me know. --[[User:DragoonWraith|DragoonWraith]] 22:09, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

== Re: Custom User Groups &amp; Permissions ==

As a suggestion, you can try to add:

&lt;tt&gt;sysopnames['wikipedia']['en'] = 'adminname'&lt;/tt&gt;

to &lt;code&gt;user-config.py&lt;/code&gt;, where ['wikipedia'] is the name of the the family in which you are working on, and 'adminname' is the username (as seen in on [[Pywikipediabot/delete.py]]).

I've tried this and works, it solved my problems with &quot;redict.py broken&quot;.

I haven't a user on this wiki but if this is ok please add it to the main page.

== No JSON object could be decoded ==

I'm having this error while trying to login.py in a 1.17alpha wiki:

 Error downloading data: No JSON object could be decoded
 Request en:/wiki/api.php?
 Retrying in 1 minutes...

I've checked the user,pass and scriptpath and everything is allright. The strange thing is that in apache's access.log I've seen this:

 &quot;POST /wiki/api.php HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 3930 &quot;-&quot; &quot;PythonWikipediaBot/1.0&quot;

So it is trying to connect, but it don't work. 

Does anyone know what is happening?? What other things can I check?

== Login failed. Wrong password or CAPTCHA answer? ==

I have not used in the bot in about 18 months. I returned to it yesterday and having got as far as the login.py prompt everything seemed good. It asks me for the password for the relevant user. I supply it. It tells me it is logging in to the wiki as the relevant user name. It then says &quot;Opening CAPTCHA in your web browser...&quot;. It asks me for the solution. I supply it. It returns the message: &quot;Login failed. Wrong password or CAPTCHA answer?&quot;. I cannot remember having this problem 18 months ago and nothing has changed in my set-up files. I went for the obvious, i.e. wrong passwords. I checked five times, ensured caps lock was off; I changed my password; I then shifted to an alternate user name.....every time the same message. Can anyone help? Is there something obvious I am missing?[[Special:Contributions/88.108.210.61|88.108.210.61]] 09:56, 5 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

I wonder what policies different Wikimedia projects (mostly, enwiki) have for using this, and other things that require &lt;tt&gt;sysopnames&lt;/tt&gt; to be set.

i've used the bot with the -file parameter but nothing happens on my wiki.

the pages (which are all redirects) are still there

what's the syntax of the textfile, i used one article name (without &quot; ' or something like that) per line

== File Format ==

I am having the same file problem, I've tried with and without delimiters and the script still does nothing, no error message, just ends. [[User:82.38.112.222|82.38.112.222]] 11:11, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

== Blocking unwanted links ==

We need a per-page way for local editors to specify that a given interwiki link on a given page is unwanted, and a default configuration of the bots that will understand and honor such a request. The bots should never be allowed to make edits against local consensus of human editors. So we need a way for human editors to tell the bot what not to do. 

The case I have in mind is [[:w:en:Ingria]], which is visited almost daily by a dozen different interwiki bot accounts and gets a link added to the highly controversial ru-sib wiki, which always get reverted. There is a local consensus among the editors of the article that this link is not wanted. I'm not going to delve into the policies and politics of why one should or shouldn't link to ru-sib, or whether or not it is okay for editors of one language wiki to boycott another. The point is simply that it shouldn't be up to the bot to decide.

In this particular case the issue could be solved by having all bot operators set their bots to &quot;-neverlink ru-sib&quot;, but we can't really expect all bot owners to know about this case in advance. Also, there might be cases where the rejection is not of a whole language but specific to individual pages. So, we really need something ''on the page'' to stop the bot, and we need the bot to understand that ''in its default configuration''.

As this constant revert war against a dozen different bots is getting disruptive, I very strongly urge developers to come up with a technical solution. Otherwise, I might take the step of blocking every interwiki bot on enwiki that runs without &quot;-neverlink ru-sib&quot;.

Apparently this is where I'm supposed to report that [[:en:User:Wybot]] is misbehaving. It's incorrectly inserting/removing interwiki links on templates.

The first change causes the interwiki links to be included on all transcluded pages, while the second change removed valid interwiki links intended for the main template and inserted other interwiki links that should have been wrapped in a noinclude section to avoid being included on the main template. --[[:en:User:PEJL|PEJL]] 08:06, 16 September 2007 (UTC)

::(I'm not sure if this is the right place to post; if not, feel free to move the discussion to someplace more appropriate, but please notify me.)  One of the issues seems to be (at least in the case of the second link) the fact that the IW links are kept on a transcluded subpage (along with other documentation).  Apparently, this confuses the bot.  This may be bad practice, I don't know, but it certainly simplifies life when dealing with a protected template.  The other issue, where it moves the IW links outside of the noinclude tags appears to simply be a bug in the bot.

== working with categories ==

How can I run the bot for interwikiing the categories, p.e. new created categories, or subcategories wich arise from a given category? --[[User:A1|A1]] 21:50, 11 December 2007 (UTC)
:You can use &lt;code&gt;interwiki.py -cat:&quot;Stubs&quot;&lt;/code&gt; for interwikiing the Category:Stubs. --[[User:Plasmarelais|Plasmarelais]] 17:21, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== Running on template space on EN ==

Is there a way that we could get an interwiki bot running on EN that will add links to the [[en:WP:DOC|/doc sub page]] and recognize other iw links from templates using this pattern too?  II know that there have been operators who have attempted this but because of the special nature of the templates most of the edits needed to be revert.  —[[en:User:Dispenser|Dispenser]] 03:47, 3 February 2008 (UTC)

==Removal of links==
Can someone please explain on what basis the bot decides that links are to be ''removed''? How can this ever be done safely without human confirmation? There is no one-one correspondence between articles in different language wikipedias, so linking can't be expected to be one-one either. (User:Kotniski from en:WP)


:It seems to remove some based on whether both articles are categorised/tagged as disambiguation pages. This sometimes has unhelpful results. 

:I would say that the pywiki bot SoxBot III removed these interwiki links incorrectly on 1 March 2008. Having noticed the first one, I checked a dozen or so others from that date and found the others.  

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abimelech&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=195066608] Removed 2 valid interwikis, perhaps because the EN is tagged as disam but the others are not. 

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adoni_%28disambiguation%29&amp;diff=195193341&amp;oldid=185702822] Removed valid disambiguation to disambiguation link, perhaps because the EN has disambiguation subcategories/specific templates rather than the general disambiguation category/template.

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_2:_Freddy%27s_Revenge&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=195040153] Removed redirects rather than replacing them.  

:I raised these with the editor who ran the bot and he referred me here. User:Fayenatic_london on en:WP

The above is not meant to be an answer to the question raised by user:Kotniski, but additions to it with specific examples of problems. Please would someone who is able to improve the program look into these faults and answer us? - User:Fayenatic_london on en:WP, 23 July 2008
:A problem like the one above was reported today on enwiki at [[en:Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#SassoBot]]. While looking at the code of interwiki.py, I discovered [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia/interwiki.py?revision=6103&amp;view=markup this change] that was put in by a_engels in November, 2008. It allows the hard cases (DAB in one language and non-DAB in the other) to be skipped. So the bot will either do nothing or allow the operator to fix the pages up manually. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] 04:16, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

== Algorithm used ==

Can someone explain how bot works in some cases? For example,&quot;finds that an interwiki-link has to be changed&quot; - how bot recognizes this? Another case - &quot;finds that an interwiki link is to be removed&quot; - when it happens? Thanks [[User:DixonD|DixonD]] 11:20, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
:I guess the bot finds iwls needing a change either by following redirects or in the following situation. If en:A and de:A were connected right, then de:A moved to de:B and kept its iwl. Later the bot finds de:B pointing to en:A but en:A still linking on de:A which is a broken link. With one direction working it can repair the broken one.&lt;br&gt;The bot finds links to be deleted, if none of the cases above worked or a page has a link to a moved or deleted page without redirect. Another case is, that the iwl is incorrect or pointing on a page that never existed. --[[User:Plasmarelais|Plasmarelais]] 17:27, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== where do we put the option? ==

*''If you add the option -start, the bot will go through the pages alphabetically, starting at the word specified. If you want to start at the letter B, for example, you can use &quot;'''interwiki.py -start:B'''&quot;. In particular, if you want to do the whole Wiki, you can use &quot;interwiki.py -start:!&quot;''. I don't know where we put the option (which scripts, interwiki.py or user-config.py)?.
* When I run this script on &quot;vi&quot;, I receive this report:
&lt;code&gt;

How can I fix this?--[[User:Tranletuhan|Tranletuhan]] 05:58, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

:The option &lt;code&gt;-start:B&lt;/code&gt; is not to be put into any script. You have to add it after the name of the script when you type in the command line. Or did I get you wrong? --[[User:Plasmarelais|Plasmarelais]] 17:08, 2 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Arguments==

This may be a n00bish question, but why isn't there a full list of the available arguments for this script on the page? To get this, I had to run the script with the -help switch, which gave the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
This script can move pages.

These command line parameters can be used to specify which pages to work on:

-cat              Work on all pages which are in a specific category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-cat:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-cat:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

-catr             Like -cat, but also recursively includes pages in
                  subcategories, sub-subcategories etc. of the
                  given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-catr:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-catr:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

-subcats          Work on all subcategories of a specific category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcats:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-subcats:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

-subcatsr         Like -subcats, but also includes sub-subcategories etc. of
                  the given category.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-subcatsr:categoryname&quot; or
                  as &quot;-subcatsr:categoryname|fromtitle&quot;.

-search           Work on all pages that are found in a MediaWiki search
                  across all namespaces.

-google           Work on all pages that are found in a Google search.
                  You need a Google Web API license key. Note that Google
                  doesn't give out license keys anymore. See google_key in
                  config.py for instructions.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-google:searchstring&quot;.

-interwiki        Work on the given page and all equivalent pages in other
                  languages. This can, for example, be used to fight
                  multi-site spamming.
                  Attention: this will cause the bot to modify
                  pages on several wiki sites, this is not well tested,
                  so check your edits!

-links            Work on all pages that are linked from a certain page.
                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-links:linkingpagetitle&quot;.

                  Argument can also be given as &quot;-start:pagetitle&quot;.

                  You can also include a namespace. For example,
                  &quot;-start:Template:!&quot; will make the bot work on all pages
                  in the template namespace.

-prefixindex      Work on pages commencing with a common prefix.

-titleregex       Work on titles that match the given regular expression.

I've used pagefromfile.py and when i try to import an article that is greater than a certain (250?) characters then it will fail. Does anyone know if there is a limitation to the length of the article? And so yes, what can you do about it? --[[User:BB70|BB70]] 13:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

Looking at a recent edit to this page, I see a complaint from someone that the proper technique didn't work.  I ''know'' that on the English Wiktionary, the alternate technique now listed does not work correctly.

== Creating Redirects ==

I tried creating redirects using Pagefromfile but it became an article.

My text file is like so...

 xxxx
 #REDIRECT &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;'''Article'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 yyyy

the script created was so, except for the xxxx and yyyy.  What I need is that the &lt;nowiki&gt;'''Article'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; be not included.  That the end result will become 

 #REDIRECT &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What can be added to the script to achieve this?  I do not know phyton programming.  -- Hiong-eng

:So do you need strip title from contents of inserted article? Please see [[Talk:Pagefromfile.py#title]]! (you need to edit pagefromfile.py file):) --[[User:Liso|Liso]] 21:01, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

::oops, sorry, I missed that :) thanks! -- Hiong-eng

This has been fixed now, there is a -notitle keyword.
To make a redirect, make a file dict.txt that looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{-start-}}
'''Article title'''#REDIRECT[[New title]]
{{-stop-}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

and type:
 python pagefromfile.py -notitle

== redirected page ==

Lets there are two pages A and B. B is redirected to A (B--&gt;A)

I try to do the following
&lt;pre&gt;
xxxx
'''B'''
bla-bla
yyyy

== Bug: &quot;\n&quot; in replacement text ==

I can't put a newline in the replacement text.  For example:
  python replace.py &quot;AbcDef&quot; &quot;Abc\nDef&quot;
actually inserts the literal characters &quot;\n&quot; rather than a newline.

== Correct command for interwiki purposes ==

Suppose that we have a page, say [[:w:Door]], with 19 links to it. We decide to tarnswiki it to Wiktionary, and we want all links to [[:w:Door]] to be directed towards [[:wikt:door]]. What is the correct command to achieve that, using replace.py? [[User:Huji|Huji]] 17:28, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== use xml dump ==

if I use a xml dump with the option -xml the program must modify not only the online page, but also the xml version, so if I redo the same operation the script finds that the page is already modified. --[[User:Wiso|Wiso]] 15:36, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== Isredirect and putthrottle ==

2 issues:

I have tried to edit pages using -ref:, and when I use that, it says &quot;Isredirect&quot;. When I don't use that, it works. 

I have also tried putting -putthrottle: to 12, and it does it in shorter amounts of time. 

why are these happening?

== How could I replace the text wich contain two or more lines? ==

For example I must change the text:

 ==Subtitle==

with the following:

 ==Subtitle==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

How could I do it? The problem is that I could not press enter while typing the replaceing text and I couldn't use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; because it will not cause the expected effect --[[User:A1|A1]] 20:04, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Nothing happens ==

I need some help with replace.py

I installed Python25 and Pywikipedia on my computer

The purpose : use it on a MediaWiki installation (in french), in version 1.6.7

I configured my user-config.py, my [name_of_the_wiki]_family.py that I put in families directory...

And i launched the /cmd on Windows in order to use Python

I've already created an account for the bot on the Wiki ( its name is Orthobot)

Then I launch python.exe login.py (and there isn't any problem)

Then I launch replace.py like that :

python.exe replace.py -page:Abheva &quot;sanscrit&quot; &quot;sanskrit&quot;

The bot finds the page, finds the word, asks me if I want to replace it...

And it says the page has been replaced.

But the problem is that, when I look at this page, the replacement hasn't been made

So, I don't understand : everything seems to be ok but It doesn't work

Any idea ?

[[User:Urobore|Urobore]] 22:39, 7 February 2008 (UTC)

:: No, the page isn't locked, nor semiblocked. However, I just found a means to resolve the problem even if I don't understand why. In fact, it is a public Wiki but blocked for non-registered users (only registered one can Edit a page). Moreover, a non-registered user can't create a new account (it means I create accounts for users who wants to participate to the wiki). Concretly, my LocalSettings.php contains :
:: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:: So, I put the second line = ''true'' instead of ''false'' and it resolved the problem (the page &quot;''Abhava''&quot; has been edited). 
::&lt;br /&gt;
:: It means I'll have to edit my &lt;code&gt;LocalSettings.php&lt;/code&gt; each time I'll want to use a Pywikipedia. But I don't understand exactly why because the Bot has an account and should be able to edit a page without the autorization as a non-registered user : in Edit History of the page &quot;''Abhava''&quot;, the Bot only appears as a non-registered IP address (mine) and not as a user. It means there should be a problem with the login of the Bot (it can't log in on the wiki and, so, is able to edit a page only as a non-registered user). So : have you got an idea about this problem of login identification of the bot ?

Hi,

When I try to upload an image using this script I get a 403 Forbidden page back. Manually uploading using the bot user account works and editing an article using the editarticly.py script works to. Anybody knows why upload.py does not work? I'm running Mediawiki 1.6.3 and am using the newest upload.py available. thnx --[[User:GrandiJoos|GrandiJoos]] 18:16, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

=== An Idea ===
GrandiJoos -
You should be able to get information about why the page is forbidden by checking the server logs. These should be available through your web hosting service, and are automatically kept by the web server program (like Apache). In general there are two reasons for a 403 error: wrong permissions on the file, or wrong un/pw. If you are able to access your wiki when you log in, then you are probably requesting a nonexistent file. The server logs should record every file that was requested by a client that it couldn't find.

Also, make sure you check the path specified by grandijooswiki_family.py (or whatever_family.py) is accurate. This is the default:

    def path(self, code):
        return '/wiki/index.php'

And if your wiki is in the root folder of your server, you might need this:

    def path(self, code):
        return '/index.php'

Hope that helps

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Future feature ==

It would be pretty neat if one day this could also check whether a page is saved in the Internet Archive (which should be pretty easy to do, since all you have to do is append the page's address which you are checking to &quot;http://web.archive.org/web/&quot;, and see whether it returns &quot;$PAGE is not available in the Wayback Machine.&quot;).

Even neater would be if one could take a positive result and have the bot automatically insert in the article a link to the most recent archived copy, but that would not be as easy. --[[User:129.21.121.171|129.21.121.171]] 21:16, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

Is it possible to feed the output from this into the replace.py or some other script? [[User:ST47|ST47]] 19:02, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== Environment proxy variables (http_proxy, no_proxy) support ==

Weblinkchecker now uses httplib which does not honor environment proxy variables http_proxy, no_proxy.
So if you are behind a proxy and your wiki is NOT in the outer world, there is no way to check the links normally.
Here's a patch which adds the support for these variables, though the resulting proxy support is very buggy - works only in Python 2.6 with your wiki address first in no_proxy variable, like no_proxy=&quot;www.wiki.local, *.local&quot;
It would be great to merge this patch (or its fixed version) into your SVN...

&lt;!--
    PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE
    YOU CAN EDIT THE TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS COMMENT
--&gt;
== Usage ==
{{tl|Multicol}} is used to start a multi-column section of a page. Between each block of column text insert &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|Multicol-break}}&lt;/tt&gt; and close the last column with &lt;tt&gt;{{tl|Multicol-end}}&lt;/tt&gt;. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Multicol}}
 This text appears in the first column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the second column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the third column.
 {{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can have any number of columns. Each column will be the same width, equally dividing the available horizontal space. Each column has a small right margin (20 pixels), creating a &quot;gutter&quot; that prevents text in one column from touching text in the column to its right.

== Parameters ==
This template has two optional parameters: the overall width of the set of columns and the width of the gutter.  The overall width of the set of columns can be an absolute value (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;40em&lt;/tt&gt;) or a percentage of the available page width (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;50%&lt;/tt&gt;). This parameter defaults to &lt;tt&gt;100%&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, to create a multi-column section that is only 50% the width of the page:

&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Multicol|50%}}
 This text appears in the first column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the second column.
 {{Multicol-break}}
 This text appears in the third column.
 {{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The multi-column region is always positioned on the left side of the containing block. To change this, place the above Wikitext in a &lt;tt&gt;div&lt;/tt&gt; block that has the [[Cascading Style Sheet|CSS]] attribute &lt;tt&gt;text-align&lt;/tt&gt; set to either &lt;tt&gt;center&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;right&lt;/tt&gt;, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;{{center|
 {{Multicol|50%}}
 ...
 {{Multicol-end}}
 }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Related templates ==
The templates {{tl|Col-begin}} and friends do something similar to this template and its friends, but this template may be easier to use. Each of the following examples produce the same result (a 3-column table in which all columns have equal width):

&lt;center&gt;
{{Multicol|50%}}
&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Multicol}}
 Column 1
 {{Multicol-break}}
 Column 2
 {{Multicol-break}}
 Column 3
 {{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Multicol-break}}
&lt;pre&gt;
 {{Col-begin}}
 {{Col-3}}
 Column 1
 {{Col-3}}
 Column 2
 {{Col-3}}
 Column 3
 {{Col-end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Multicol-end}}
&lt;/center&gt;

It's simpler to add more columns to the {{tl|Multicol}} example than to the {{tl|Col-begin}} example, because in the latter case, all occurrences of {{tl|Col-3}} would need to be changed to {{tl|Col-4}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''clean_sandbox.pl''' is a simple script using the unreleased 3.0 version of perlwikibot. It simply cleans a wiki's [[WB:SB|sandbox]] by submitting an edit with some standard text, overwriting whatever was there previously.

==Preamble==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use utf8;
use Carp;
use Getopt::Long;
use Pod::Usage;
use Config::General qw(ParseConfig);

use MediaWiki::Bot 3.0.0;

my $VERSION = '0.0.1';
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we use two pragmas that should be considered mandatory: &lt;code&gt;strict&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;warnings&lt;/code&gt;. These are tools to make you a better programmer by forcing you to follow some rules.

We also use &lt;code&gt;Getopt::Long&lt;/code&gt; to get command line options from the user. This greatly simplifies parsing @ARGV - you should never do it yourself. Always use a Perl module - &lt;code&gt;Getopt::Long&lt;/code&gt; is one, but there are others.

&lt;code&gt;Pod::Usage&lt;/code&gt; allows us to give the user man-style documentation using Perl's POD markup embedded in the source code.

&lt;code&gt;Config::General&lt;/code&gt;allows us to easily parse configuration files. Again, there are others, but this one provides several features we'll make use of, like heredocs.

Finally, we need &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; version 3.0.0 or higher. 3.0.0 is still under development, so method calls are subject to change.

The &lt;code&gt;$VERSION&lt;/code&gt; string will be used later, and might be used by other scripts that &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; this file, like we did for &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt;.

==POD==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
=head1 NAME

clean_sandbox.pl - Cleans a wiki's sandbox

=head1 SYNOPSIS

clean_sandbox.pl --wiki=meta --summary=&quot;Cleaning the sandbox&quot;

Options:
    --help      Opens this man page and exit
    --version   Print version information and exit
    --dry-run   Do everything but edit
    --debug     Print debug output
    --wiki      Sets which wiki to use
    --text      Sets what text to use
    --page      Sets what page to edit
    --summary   Sets an edit summary
    --username  Sets a non-default username
    --password  Request a password prompt

=head1 OPTIONS

=cut
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we provide some documentation for the user. This uses POD (see &lt;code&gt;perldoc perlpod&lt;/code&gt;), and will be parsed and shown to the user if they provide the &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; option. The &lt;code&gt;=head1&lt;/code&gt; control inserts a heading with the rest of the text on the line. More POD is included in the rest of the file, but isn't included in this page.

== Parsing the command line ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $help;
my $version;
my $dry_run;
my $debug;
my $wiki;
my $text;
my $page;
my $summary;
my $username;
my $password;

GetOptions(
    'help|h|?'      =&gt; \$help,
    'version|v'     =&gt; \$version,
    'dry-run'       =&gt; \$dry_run,
    'debug|verbose' =&gt; \$debug,
    'wiki=s'        =&gt; \$wiki,
    'text=s'        =&gt; \$text,
    'page=s'        =&gt; \$page,
    'summary=s'     =&gt; \$summary,
    'username=s'    =&gt; \$username,
    'password:s'    =&gt; \$password, # We can ask for it interactively!
);
&lt;/source&gt;
This declares variables for all our command line options, and gets &lt;code&gt;Getopt::Long&lt;/code&gt; to parse &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt; and assign to those variables for us. This is much better than attempting to do so manually.

On the left, is the option name, and any aliases. For example, &lt;code&gt;help|h|?&lt;/code&gt; provide a name (help) and two aliases (h and ?). The presence of that option on the command line is assigned to &lt;code&gt;$help&lt;/code&gt;. Others, like &lt;code&gt;dry-run&lt;/code&gt; have only the canonical name. Still others take a mandatory parameter, like &lt;code&gt;wiki=s&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the parameter is mandatory; the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; indicates that it is a string. Lastly, password has an optional string parameter indicated by &lt;code&gt;:s&lt;/code&gt;. This option's parameter is optional because we prefer to prompt for the password interactively. Command line arguments are visible to all users on the system, so doing that should be avoided.

==Version data==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ($version) {
    require File::Basename;
    my $script = File::Basename::basename($0);
    print &quot;$script version $VERSION\n&quot; and exit;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the user specified &lt;code&gt;--version&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, &lt;code&gt;$version&lt;/code&gt; will be true. We print a simple message containing the version string we declared above, then exit.

==Prompt for password==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (defined($password)) { # I think this is wrong, actually... we'll prompt interactively even if they do --password pass. Should check defined and false.
    require Term::ReadKey;

    print &quot;[clean_sandbox.pl] password: &quot;;
    Term::ReadKey::ReadMode('noecho');      # Don't show the password
    $password = Term::ReadKey::ReadLine(0);
    Term::ReadKey::ReadMode('restore');     # Don't bork their terminal
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If &lt;code&gt;--password&lt;/code&gt; was specified on the command line, we interactively prompt for their password. To do this, we can use &lt;code&gt;Term::ReadKey&lt;/code&gt;, which provides several methods useful for this task. First, note that &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated at runtime, whereas &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated at compile-time, even if it would never run. &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; also &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt;s default methods into the current context, whereas &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; doesn't. We could &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt; ourselves, but it is just as easy not to in this case.

We'll use a standard method of reading in the password. First, we show the prompt, then set the terminal to 'noecho' readmode. This means the user's keystrokes won't display anything on-screen. Next, we read in the user's input and assign it to &lt;code&gt;$password&lt;/code&gt;. Previously, this variable simply told us whether &lt;code&gt;--password&lt;/code&gt; was specified on the command line - now it holds the text of the password. Finally, we restore the original characteristics of the user's terminal. If we don't do that, it continues operating in 'noecho' mode, which they won't like.

==Reading configuration==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (!$username or !$password or !$wiki) {
    warn 'Reading config/main.conf' if $debug;
    my %main = ParseConfig (
        -ConfigFile     =&gt; 'config/main.conf',
        -LowerCaseNames =&gt; 1,
        -AutoTrue       =&gt; 1,
        -UTF8           =&gt; 1,
    );
    $username = $main{'default'} unless $username; warn &quot;Using $username&quot; if $debug;
    die &quot;I can't figure out what account to use! Try setting default in config/main.conf, or use --username&quot; unless $username;
    die &quot;There's no block for $username and you didn't specify enough data on the command line to continue&quot; unless $main{'bot'}{$username};

    $password = $main{'bot'}{$username}{'password'} if (!$password);
    warn &quot;Setting \$password&quot; if $debug;
    $wiki = $main{'bot'}{$username}{'wiki'} unless $wiki;
    warn &quot;Setting \$wiki to $wiki&quot; if $debug;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If we don't have all of username, password, and wiki already, then we should read them in from a config file. &lt;code&gt;Config::General&lt;code&gt; provides the &lt;code&gt;ParseConfig&lt;/code&gt; method to do this.

We give it the filename (relative to the current file), and a few options. &lt;code&gt;UTF8&lt;/code&gt; is important because this file can and will include UTF8 characters under many circumstances. An example config file:

&lt;pre&gt;
default = Mike's bot account

&lt;bot Mike's bot account&gt;
    password    = fake password
    wiki        = enwikibooks
&lt;/bot&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

When &lt;code&gt;Config::General&lt;/code&gt; reads this in, it creates a [http://pacific-design.com/perl/perldata.html hash] which represents the data. Once we have that hash, we try to get the data we're missing, and warn the user if we can't accomplish that.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $bot = MediaWiki::Bot-&gt;new(); # Create a default object so we can query sitematrix if need be
$bot-&gt;{'debug'} = $debug;
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that some of the &lt;code&gt;warn&lt;/code&gt; statements are conditional on &lt;code&gt;$debug&lt;/code&gt;. This is another command line flag that asks the script to output additional information about what it is doing to make debugging easier. We ask &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; to do the same.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $domain;
if (!$text or !$page or !$summary) {
    warn 'Reading config/clean_sandbox.conf' if $debug;
    my %conf = ParseConfig (
        -ConfigFile     =&gt; 'config/clean_sandbox.conf',
        -LowerCaseNames =&gt; 1,
        -UTF8           =&gt; 1,
    );
    if ($wiki =~ m/\w\.\w/) {
        $domain = $wiki;
        $wiki = $bot-&gt;domain_to_db($wiki);
    }
    %conf = %{ $conf{$wiki} }; # Keep just the part we want.

    $text    = $conf{'text'} unless $text; warn &quot;Setting \$text to $text&quot; if $debug;
    $page    = $conf{'page'} unless $page; warn &quot;Setting \$page to $page&quot; if $debug;
    $summary = $conf{'summary'} unless $summary; warn &quot;Setting \$summary to $summary&quot; if $debug;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we use &lt;code&gt;Config::General::ParseConfig&lt;/code&gt; to parse another config file. This one contains data for many wikis about where their sandbox is located, what standard text should be put on it, and what edit summary they want to be used. This is useful because some bot operators might not speak the language where their bot cleans the sandbox. It also means they don't have to always specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;--page &quot;Project:Sandbox&quot; --text &quot;{{/Don't edit this line}}\n&amp;lt;!--Practice your editing here--&gt;&quot; --summary &quot;Bot: cleaning sandbox&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; every time. That data can be stored in the config file instead.

Because this file contains data for many wikis, and we don't need all of it, we throw away most of it. &lt;code&gt;ParseConfig&lt;/code&gt; creates a large hash, but we keep only the part about the wiki we actually want to edit. Then, we find any data we're missing.

== Create a bot object ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$domain = $bot-&gt;db_to_domain($wiki) if ($wiki !~ m/\w\.\w/);
$bot = MediaWiki::Bot-&gt;new({
    host        =&gt; $domain,
    login_data  =&gt; { username =&gt; $username, password =&gt; $password },
});
&lt;/source&gt;
Unlike earlier versions of Perlwikibot, 3.0 will handle lots automatically to make writing scripts easier. Here, we create a new bot object, which will automatically be logged in and configured for us. Check POD documentation for &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; for details about the &lt;code&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; constructor.

== Make the edit ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
die &lt;&lt;&quot;END&quot; if $dry_run;
This is where we would attempt the following edit:
\$bot-&gt;edit({
    page        =&gt; $page,
    text        =&gt; $text,
    summary     =&gt; $summary
    is_minor    =&gt; 1,
});
on $domain
END
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a here-document (heredoc) - it allows us to print a multi-line string easily. If the user specified &lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, we want to do everything up to this point, but not actually edit. So, if &lt;code&gt;$dry_run&lt;/code&gt; is set, we print out this multi-line string showing what ''would'' have happened, and die. The &lt;&lt; part of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&quot;END&quot;&lt;/code&gt; tells Perl that a heredoc follows; END tells Perl what delimiter to look for to know the heredoc has ended; the double-quotes tell Perl that we want it to be an interpolated string.

===Actually make the edit===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
warn &quot;Editing...&quot; if $debug;
$bot-&gt;edit({
    page        =&gt; $page,
    text        =&gt; $text,
    summary     =&gt; $summary
    is_minor    =&gt; 1,
}) or die &quot;Couldn't edit&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
This actually makes the edit by calling &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt; method, and passing it the page name, what text to put, the edit summary, and that it is a minor edit. See POD for details on &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt;.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |Question Options allows you to offer different types of content as answer options.  For example you could ask a user to sequence a list of images, or match images to names or use animations of sounds as options for answers.  You can add Options to the Partial Credit, Matching, Sequencing and Plugin question types.


[[File:QW Question Options.png|center]]

To add an option you right click on the question and choose ''Add - Option''.  You can then add text, images, sounds or animations.  Here is a link to a short quiz on British Design Classics featuring the options feature [[http://www.questionwritertracker.com/quiz/6235/TTPKZF4N.html]]


Question Writer still uses the text answers you have defined but adds the options.  For matching question types, each match follows the choice.  The plugin questions can be programmed to use the option content in any way.  For example the Horizontal Slider Plugin Question uses the first option as the slider background and the second option as the slider button.

Here is a step by step description of how to add images to a matching question.

First add your question, it must be either a Partial Credit, Matching, Sequencing or Plugin question types but for this example we are using a matching question.

In the question properties you can type in the Question, eg “Match the colours to the images?”  You do not need to add any text into the choices or matches fields.

The next step is to add options to the Question.  With your mouse over the question, right click and select '''Add''' and then, from the drop down list that appears, select '''Option'''

[[File:QW Options add option.jpg|center]]

You need to add an option for each possible answer option you want to give, ie the choice and it’s respective match. 

After you have added your first option you can add your image to that option.  So with your mouse on the option, right click and select Add and then Image 

[[File:QW Options add image.jpg|center]]

You can then add the option to match with that image, eg a text option, though it could be another image or a sound.

[[File:QW Options text.jpg|center]]

When you have added all your choices and matches you can preview your question.

[[Image:Groene kikker achter Bekaert-draad.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A frog is a kind of Amphibian.]]
'''Amphibians''' are animals that live on land and in water. When they are young, they need to be in water like fish, or they will die. They don't die because they breathe oxygen from the water with their [[w:gills|gills]], lung-like breathing slits that separate oxygen from water. Then, when they are adults, they have to breathe oxygen from the air to stay alive. They will drown if they try to breathe water as adults.

'Amphibian' comes from two [[Greek]] words: &quot;amphi&quot; and &quot;bio&quot;. Amphi means &quot;both&quot;. Bio means &quot;life&quot;. 

One example of an amphibian is a frog. A frog starts as a [[w:tadpole|tadpole]], which looks like a fish, with a tail. Then it goes through a stage called ''metamorphosis'', and grows up into a frog, and it lives like a mammal or a bird, where it breathes air and only goes into the water sometimes.

'''Birds''' are vertebrates. Their bodies have feathers, which keep them warm and waterproof. Birds usually have different kinds of feathers for warmth and waterproofing. Birds breathe oxygen. They usually eat fish, insects, worms and plants. There are birds on every continent of the world. Some birds do not fly but use their wings so they can move through the water. Some birds are so large that they are the same size as people. Some scientists believe dinosaurs evolved into birds.

Birds get their food in many ways. If they are trying to eat worms, they will peck around at the ground until they find one or if they see one on the dirt, they will pick it up. Some birds like fish. To get fish to eat, they will land on the water if they see some fish, and then they will usually jab their neck and mouth under the water to try and bite the fish.

==Examples==
*Swan
*Penguin
*Flamingo
*Loon
*Hawk
*Dove

A '''fish''' is an animal that has to spend all its time in the water. If it comes out of the water for too long of a time, it will die. A fish uses gills to get oxygen (air to breathe) from the water. Fish are usually covered with scales. One kind of fish is the shark. Some people keep fish as pets, and some people like to eat fish. 

Some fish live in fresh water (or sweet water), and some fish live in salt water. It is also possible for fish to live in water where a river runs into an ocean and the water mixes. This is called brackish water.

People eat many kinds of fish. The fish that people eat most include carp, cod, herring, perch, sardines, tilapia, trout, tuna, and many others. Some people keep fish as pets. Goldfish are a popular type of pet fish.

Most kinds of fish have bones. Some kinds of fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have real bones (their skeletons are made of cartilage). Some scientists say that these are not real fish, but most people call them fish. Some other animals that live in the sea, such as starfish and jellyfish, are called fish, but are not really fish.

The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish. People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats, or with big nets from big boats. People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait. This is often called fishing.

A fish is a cold-blooded, water dwelling animal with a backbone and gills throughout its life.

There are over 27,000 known living fish species,
Since the dawn of humanity, people and fish have been linked. Fish provide humans much of their protein, offer fun by fishing and provide a sense of beauty. The relationship has not been as favorable for fish: in 1999, seventy percent of the world's major fish species were determined to be fully- or over-exploited.

There are more insects than any other creature in the world. For every person on this earth, there are hundreds or possibly thousands of insects. Insects are usually very small and easy to kill, but because there are so many of them, it would be difficult to kill them all.

Insects have probably been around longer than any other animal. They are called insects because they are divided into a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Insects always have six legs, which is why spiders are not insects. Insects have an exoskeleton instead of a regular skeleton, which means they are easy to destroy, but the exoskeleton keeps them relatively intact.

Insects usually live in giant colonies of themselves, although some of them, such as flies, do not. They start as maggots and later begin to fly. Insects usually eat leaves or other insects.

Throughout human history, people have been bothered by insects. Some insects are parasites who cause diseases and might even feed on human blood, like mosquitoes. This is why humans have developed various techniques for trying to destroy insects.

Some insects have been good for people. Bees help farmers by spreading flower pollen which makes more flowers.

A '''mammal''' is one of the animal kingdoms, and because people are mammals we know much about them.
==Features==

Mammals are warm blooded; the heat they need to live is made inside their body.
Usually, mammals feed their young with milk they make from their body.
Mammals have  what is called hair or blubber, even if there is not much of it.
Mammals give birth to living young (although ''monotremes'', like the platypus, lay eggs).
Mammals' babies grow completely inside its mother's uterus (in marsupials, like the kangaroo, a baby grows mostly in a pocket of skin on the mother's stomach).

'''Mollusks''' are not members of the insect family, but many people think they are. Mollusks can be distinguished from insects by their lack of wings, and the fact that they are not warm-blooded. Although one might be tempted to be scared of mollusks, they are normally quite gentle and harmless. Mollusks have not been known to attack human beings in the wild or in captivity. To care for a mollusk, wash it ''gently'' and feed it small leaves or twigs. Most people do not recommend keeping mollusks as pets, however. A mollusk may or may not have a shell. This is not how you distinguish a mollusk; other animals have shells such as turtles. Nevertheless mollusks are often considered pesks, and are hunted in gardens and by small children.

==Features==
[[Image:Alligator grin-scubadive67.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An alligator is a kind of reptile.]]
Every reptile has features that make them different from other animals.

*Reptiles always have a backbone, even if it is a very small one.
*Their bodies are covered in scales. 
*They have lungs.
*They are cold blooded. This means that their body temperature changes depending on the weather. If it is hot outside, their body temperature rises. If it becomes cold, their body temperature drops.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parts of the instrument==
Parts of the instrument include, starting at the mouthpiece end of the instrument, the mouthpiece, leadpipe, main tuning slide, main body of the instrument, and bell.  The main body of the instrument conatins three (sometimes four) valves, each valve connected to a separate and distinct slide.  When no valves are pressed, the air moves through the instrument without entering any of the valve slides.  When a valve is pressed, the air moves through the instrument and through the slides of the valves which are depressed, thus lengthening the instrument and lowering its fundamental pitch.

==Posture and hand position==
Proper posture can be obtained by either standing or sitting tall with the elbows at a 45 degree angle with the ground.  The angle of the trumpet to the plane of the player's face generally should be slightly less than 90 degrees.  An upward horn angle (i.e. &quot;bells up&quot;) can be obtained by altering posture at the waist or neck, but this should be used only for special effect as it can interfere with proper breathing.  The angle of the trumpet with the plane of the player's face should never be significantly altered.

==Proper breathing==
A perfect inhalation breath can be accomplished the following way:  Exhale fully and count out loud to twenty without breathing in any additional air.  The natural inhalation which occurs upon reaching the number twenty is a natrually good breath, provided the throat stays open and relaxed and the shoulders also stay relaxed and do not rise closer to the ears.  Proper exhalation, the basis of proper breath support, occurs when the muscles in the diaphragm and abdominal area push the air out of the lungs.  The throat must stay relaxed in order for proper tone production to occur.  The abdominal area should be firm during proper exhalation.

==Embouchure formation==
In proper embouchure formation, the corners of the lips are firm and slightly drawn down.  The center of the lips will be slightly firm, but not nearly as firm as the corners.  The teeth are separated to approximately a pencil's width.  The lips are rolled in slightly so that the buzz can occur near where the moist inside of the lip meets the dry outside of the lip.  Both lips must be even; they should touch but not overlap one another.  The chin must remain firm, and air pockets should never be allowed to form between the teeth and the outer walls of the mouth with which the teeth make natural contact.  The mouthpiece should rest approximately 50% on the upper lip and 50% on the lower lip.  Common causes of a tight tone quality are 1) teeth which are too close together, and 2) too much tightness in the center part of the lips (where wet meets dry).

==Proper tonguing==
To tongue properly, the upper side of the tongue's tip is placed where the upper front teeth meet the gumline.  A seal must be made between all of the upper teeth and the edge of the tongue so that no air can escape in the instant before actual tonguing occurs.  The tongue should never be allowed to protrude between the top and bottom front teeth, and the tip of the tongue should never be so far back that it only touches the gums/membranes of the mouth and not the front teeth.

==First sounds on the mouthpiece==
The mouthpiece should be held with the thumb and first finger of the non-dominant hand.  It should be held on the &quot;dirt line&quot; which may be slightly scratched or worn away from repeated insertions into the leadpipe.  The first sound on the mouthpiece should be air-based.  This can be accomplished by forming the embouchure, placing the mouthpiece on the lips, and blowing air (no buzz) through the mouthpiece.  While continuing to try to blow air, cover up the tip of the mouthpiece with the dominant hand first finger and let the pressure build up for a second or two.  When the finger is released, the pressure will be released and the air will once again pass through the mouthpiece, but if everything is properly lined up, the sudden release of pressure will automatically start a proper air-based buzz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening SPSS==
There are two ways to open SPSS.  The first way is quite simple if the SPSS icon is already on your desktop all you have to do is double click the icon:

[[File:02openingSPSS01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Double-clicking the SPSS icon should open the program, as illustrated below:
[[File:02openingSPSS02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Alternatively you can open SPSS through the start button on your computer (if you're running Windows).  If the SPSS icon is not on your desktop you must go through your computer's Start button. Click “Start” → “All programs” → “SPSS Inc.”  From this point if you have more then one version of SPSS on your computer you have to pick the version you are going to open. I am going to use version 16.0. From here click SPSS 16.0 , and finally click the SPSS 16.0 icon.  All the steps are shown below in a screen shot:
[[File:02openingSPSS04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

If you followed the steps above when you click SPSS 16.0 the program should open on your computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The previous chapter mentioned syntax and including it in your Log in the Output Window.  Syntax is computer programming language and can be used to tell SPSS to run analyses and to manipulate data (see Chapter 24 for more information).  Sometimes SPSS is set to include syntax in the Output Window by default; sometimes it is not.  This chapter will show you how to change the Preferences in SPSS to include the syntax in the Log and Output Window.  Doing so provides you with a history of everything you've done in each session with SPSS.

To begin with, you can see what a basic analysis looks like without syntax:
[[File:07syntaxinoutput01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

To tell SPSS to include syntax in your Output Window, go to “Edit” → “Options.”
[[File:07syntaxinoutput02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once you click options, this window will pop up. Click the viewer tab.
[[File:07syntaxinoutput03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Select the “Viewer” tab, then check the box at the bottom left hand corner that says “Display commands in the log.”
[[File:07syntaxinoutput04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click “OK.”

To see the syntax in the output window you can now run any test and the Log will include the syntax.  This is illustrated below with a Frequencies analysis:
[[File:07syntaxinoutput05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can now track everything you've done in SPSS and slowly teach yourself SPSS syntax.  The utility of doing so is explained in detail in the chapter on syntax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter will illustrate how to change the settings to order the variable list in windows alphabetically. By default SPSS arranges the variable list in the same order as found in the data editor, however it is also possible to arrange the list alphabetically.  This is very useful when you have many variables as you can then search for variables simply by typing the name of the variable in the variable list box and SPSS will jump to that variable.

Setting SPSS to display variable names instead of labels was covered in Chapter 7.  Setting SPSS to display the variables alphabetically is very similar.  To begin, select “Edit” → “Options”:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

After having selected the “options” tab, you will see this window:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Select the “Alphabetical” option in the “Variable Lists” box on the top left hand side:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once you've selected the “Alphabetical” option, click on the “OK” button as shown above. 

Once you have done this, another small window will pop up.  This window notifies you that “Changing any option in the Variable List group will reset all dialog box settings to their defaults, and all open dialogs will be closed.”  Basically this just means you won't see any changes in any dialogs you currently have open.  Click “OK” once again:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

To see the ordered variable lists you can click on any option that includes a variable list.  This is illustrated below using “Descriptives.”  Click on “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics”  →  “Descriptives”: 
[[File:08variablesalphabetical05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You should end up with a window similar to the below one.  The variables in the left hand side box should be ordered alphabetically:
[[File:08variablesalphabetical06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can now easily search through a list of variables by typing in the name and SPSS will jump directly to that variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter will cover how to create new variables in SPSS.  Creating a new variable is a foundational skill for users of SPSS statistical software, and a necessary step before performing the statistical tests and procedures covered in later chapters.  This chapter will provide examples with screenshots to illustrate how you can create variables with ease.

Creating a new variable in SPSS can be completed with just a few clicks, and some simple data entry. First, switch the Data Editor window to “Variable View” (see Chapter 5 for more information on Variable View): 
[[File:11creatingnewvariables01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once in the “Variable View” tab click on an empty cell in an empty row in which you wish to create the new variable under the column labeled “name.”  (If working from a blank SPSS data set this will be in the first row, if working from a preexisting data set, you will need to scroll down to the next open row).  Once you have created the new variable, it will appear as, “VAR0001”:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can rename the variable by clicking into the cell and typing the name you desire to change it to.  In this example the variable has been named “Age.”
[[File:11creatingnewvariables03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can specify the type of the variable by clicking in the cell under the column labeled “Type.”  An ellipsis will appear:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click on the ellipsis to open the Variable Type Dialog box:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Using this option you may specify the type of the variable you are preparing to analyze, as well as the width and decimal places.  Most variables will be “Numeric,” meaning there will be a number used, either because the number itself is meaningful (interval/ratio variables) or because it represents distinct categories.  String variables are text variables.  You can also have Date and Currency variables.

Closing the variable type window, we continue to move to the right, examining the various characteristics of variables.  You can input a label for your variable, which is a description of the variable: 
[[File:11creatingnewvariables06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

You can also assign values for the different categories of the variable.  This is particularly useful for nominal and ordinal variables for which you assign a unique number to each category (e.g., for race you may have: 1=white, 2=black, 3=Native American, etc.)  To access the values option, click on the cell under the “Value” column and an ellipsis will appear.  Click on the ellipsis and enter your values and value labels in the “Value Label” dialog box:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables07.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Next you will need to specify the values of any missing values you may have.  It is generally a good idea when using any statistical program to include a Value for cases where people did not respond.  This Values should be included in the Value Labels, but should also be included in the “Missing” column as it will prevent SPSS from attempting to use those values in calculations.  To add these values to the list of Missing Values, click on the cell in the “Missing” column.  Click on the ellipsis that appears in order to access the “Missing Values” dialog box:
[[File:11creatingnewvariables08.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

While there are no right or wrong values to assign for missing data, it is common to uses iterations of 9.  For instance, if a variable has 4 categories (1, 2, 3, and 4) and missing values, you can assign a “9” to indicate that the value is missing for that person.  If there are 20 categories, you could use “99.”  If there are 200 categories, you could use “999,” and so on.  This is a widespread practice, but not mandatory.  You could choose a different system to indicate missing values.

Finally, you must specify your level of measurement.  This may be done by clicking on the cell under the column labeled “Measure” and choosing from Nominal, Ordinal, and Scale.  Nominal and ordinal variables should be labeled under their corresponding names, while interval and ratio variables should be labeled as “Scale.”

Repeat this process for as many variables as you need to create and/or define.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Descriptive statistics are used to describe variables.  Examples of descriptive statistics include: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.  In this chapter you'll learn how to have SPSS calculate three descriptive statistics for you: the mean, median and mode.

In order to generate descriptives in SPSS, you first need to open up a data set. In this case we are going to use the Genetic Counseling example data set.  The variable we'll use to illustrate descriptive statistical analysis is “age.”

To calculate descriptives in SPSS, click “Analyze” → “Descriptive Statistics”  → “Frequencies.”
[[File:15descriptives01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once you click on Frequencies, a Frequencies Window will appear on the screen. Find the variable labeled “age” and click the blue arrow to move it over into the Variable Box.
[[File:15descriptives02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once you have done this, click on the tab that is labeled Statistics. A new window will appear.  In this window, select mean, median, and mode then click “Continue.”
[[File:15descriptives03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once the box disappears, click “OK” in the Frequencies Box and the mean, median, and mode, for the age of participants should appear in the Output window.
[[File:15descriptives04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

In the example above, the mean (average) age of participants is 35.93. The median, or middle number in the data set is 33, and the mode or the most commonly occurring age of participants in this study is 28.

==Distribution Curves in SPSS==
If you want to see where the mean, median, and mode fall on a frequency distribution curve, SPSS can do this for you. This is useful when you are trying to determine if the curve is normal or skewed.  Skewness statistics are used to determine whether sample data are so skewed that they suggest that the population scores are skewed (a detailed discussion of skewness statistics is beyond the scope of this book).  We are going to continue with the above example with using the variable of “age.” 

First, repeat all of the above steps when you were finding the mean, median, and mode. When you have the “Frequencies” window open, click the tab that is labeled “Charts.” 
[[File:15descriptives05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Now select the radio button that says “Histograms” and choose “With Normal Curve.” Click “Continue” then “OK,” and your chart should pop up in the Output box:
[[File:15descriptives06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The frequency curve in this example shows that the mean (35.9), median (33), and mode (28), create a positively skewed distribution (meaning some very large values in a positive or higher direction).

      <text xml:space="preserve">An independent samples t-test is used for comparing the means on an interval/ratio variable between two categories on a nominal/ordinal variable. It answers the question of whether the difference between means is statistically significant in the population of interest (assuming good sampling) or whether the difference is due to sampling error. To do this test, you need two variables from one population and sample.  The independent variable is nominal/ordinal and the dependent is interval/ratio. 

To illustrate this concept, this chapter tests to see if there is a statistically significant difference between whether or not Genetic Counselors believe in life after death and how spiritual they consider themselves.  

To run the t-test you will click “Analyze” → “Compare Means”  → “Independent Samples T-Test”:
[[File:18independentttest01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Since the spirituality scale is the interval/ratio variable it will act as the dependent variable. That is, how spiritual one considers himself depends on his belief in life after death.  Find the spiritual scale variable (labeled “sprscale”) and click the arrow to move it over to the test variable section.  Next, find the views on life after death variable (labeled “postlife”) and click the arrow to move that over to the grouping variable section. 

You will see question marks next to the grouping variable. This is because SPSS allows you to choose which categories of the independent variable you want to include (the variable could include more than just two categories).  You will need to tell SPSS which groups to compare by clicking the “define groups” button. To find these labels, go back to the Data Editor in Variable View and click on the “Values” button for the “postlife” variable. You will see this screen:
[[File:18independentttest02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The above screenshot shows that not believing in an afterlife is labeled “0” and believing is labeled “1.”  Once you know what your values are for believing in an afterlife, return to the t-test dialog.  In the define groups window, add zero for “No” and one for “Yes”:
[[File:18independentttest03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Once you've defined your groups, click “Continue.”  You'll return to the primary “Independent-Samples t-test” window:
[[File:18independentttest04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Click OK, and SPSS will run the T-Test. Two tables will appear in the output:
[[File:18independentttest05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

A lot of information appears in these tables. The first table is simply the “Group Statistics” table, which includes: sample sizes, means, standard deviations and standard errors of the means. 

The second table, labeled the “Independent Samples Test,” is what you use for determining whether or not you can reject the null hypothesis.  Because you are comparing two means, two different variances are obtained. There is a long equation used to determine which variance to use, but SPSS does this for you by running the Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances. If the variances are relatively equal, that is one sample variance is no larger than twice the size of the other, then you can assume equal variances. By looking at the output of the Levene’s test you decide which row to use. If the significance is .05 or below, use the bottom row, or “equal variances not assumed.” If the significance is above .05 use the top row.  In this example, since the significance is .000, we'll examine the bottom row. 

Both the top and bottom row provide the same information, they just use different tests to calculate the test statistic, which results in slightly different calculations.  This table provides the test statistic or t value, the degrees of freedom and other values helpful for determining confidence intervals.  A key statistic provided is the p-value, listed in the “Sig (2-tailed)” column.  If your p-value is greater than .05 you fail to reject the null (meaning the difference in means is likely due to chance or sampling error).  If your p-value is less than .05 you can reject the null (meaning there is in fact a statistically significant difference in the means and it is not due to sampling error). In this case, you can reject the null hypothesis (because the significance is .000, which is substantially less than .05).  

You should always interpret your analysis, “How spiritual someone considers him/herself is affected by someone's belief in an afterlife.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Chi-Square test is used when trying to find a relationship between two nominal or ordinal variables.  To reiterate, a nominal variable is one that is only measured by naming categories such as class, quality or kind.  An ordinal variable is similar to a nominal variable, but the categories can be put in an order (e.g., ranked highest to lowest).

To calculate Chi-Square, we use a cross-tabulation, crosstab for short, which shows the frequencies of joint occurrences between two variables.

The hypothesis we will test in this chapter is whether or not there is a relationship between religious affiliation and belief in the afterlife.  We will test this using an alpha of .05.
To do a Chi-Square test in SPSS, complete the following steps:

You must have two nominal variables from a single sample that you can use to see if there is a relationship between them.  For this example we will use religion (relig) and belief in the afterlife (postlife).  For this example religion is the independent variable and belief in the afterlife is the dependent variable.  This will be important later.

To run the test, select: Analyze → Descriptives → Crosstabs.

Once you click Crosstabs, a window will pop up where you will enter your chosen variables to be tested.  Select the independent variable (relig)  to go in the column and the dependent variable (postlife) to go in the row.
[[File:20chisquare01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Next, click the statistics button and check the Chi-Square box.
[[File:20chisquare02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Hit continue and then click on the cells button and check observed, expected and column percentages.
[[File:20chisquare03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Then hit OK and an output window with the resulting cross-tabulation will pop up.
[[File:20chisquare04.png|center|thumb|400px|NOTE:  The expected frequency of each cell must be at least five in order to rely on the Chi-Square test.  If it is not five, a different statistical test must be completed.]] 

Next you must interpret the data.  At the bottom of each column and end of every row there is a total for that specific group.  The bottom right cell is the total number of cases in the sample.  In each cell, it shows the observed joint occurrence between the two variables and the expected occurrence based on the totals that were observed.  If there is NO relationship between the variables, the observed and expected frequencies will be the same.  For our example, this is clearly not the case.  They are different but we must look at the last box from our output window to see if our relationship is legitimate or if it was due to sampling error.
[[File:20chisquare05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

As we stated in the beginning, our alpha is .05.  If the “Asymp. Sig. (2-sided)” for the Pearson Chi-Square statistic is less than .05, there is a relationship between the variables based on the level of confidence we stated in the beginning.  As seen in the table below, the Chi-Square significance value is .000 which is less than our value of .05 which shows that there is a relationship between one’s religion and their belief in the afterlife.

Finally, we interpret the test in everyday terms, which also means we look more closely at the crosstab table as well.  In the crosstab table it is clear that Protestants and Catholics are much more likely to report a belief in the afterlife than are Jews or Nones.  Thus, we can say, “Jews and the non-religious are significantly less likely to believe in an afterlife than are Protestants and Catholics.”  Do note that care must be taken in interpreting Chi-Square crosstabs as it is not always perfectly clear where the significant differences between scores lie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ANOVA is an extension of the two group difference of means test (t-test). The t-test is used to  compare two group means, but ANOVA allows for comparing three or more group means, which is easier than conducting numerous t-tests.

To conduct a One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test in SPSS, you must first begin by choosing two variables.  The variables we will use in this example are religious affiliation and frequency of prayer.  Basically we are asking, “Does religion affiliation have an influence on how often people pray?”

Once you know what you want to compare, you can tell SPSS to run the analysis by clicking on “Analyze” → “Compare Means” → “One-Way ANOVA”:
[[File:21ANOVA01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The One-Way ANOVA dialog box will appear:
[[File:21ANOVA02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

In the list displayed on the left, click on the variable that corresponds to your dependent variable (should be an interval/ratio variable).  In our example this is frequency of prayer. Move it into the Dependent List by clicking on the upper arrow button. In this example, we are asking if religious preference has any effect on how often people pray.

Now select the (quasi) independent variable from the list on the left and click on it. Move it into the Factor box by clicking on the lower arrow button.  In our example this is religious affiliation.
[[File:21ANOVA03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click on the Options button in the One-Way ANOVA dialog box. The One-Way ANOVA dialog box appears:
[[File:21ANOVA04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Click in the check box to the left of Descriptives (to get descriptive statistics), Homogeneity of Variance (to get a test of the assumption of homogeneity of variance) and Means plot (to get a graph of the means of the conditions). 

Click on the Continue button to return to the One-Way ANOVA dialog box. In the One Way ANOVA dialog box, click on the “OK” button to perform the analysis of variance. The SPSS output window will appear. The output consists of six major sections. The first is the descriptives section:
[[File:21ANOVA05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The Descriptives table provides various descriptives for the groups being compared, including the group sample size, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, standard error, and confidence interval for the mean. In this example, there were 64 Jewish individuals, the mean frequency of prayer was 4.70 (on a six point scale; technically it is an interval-like ordinal variable), and the standard deviation was 1.217. There were 132 Catholic individuals with a mean frequency of prayer at 3.38, and a standard deviation of 1.438.

The ANOVA output gives us the analysis of variance summary table. There are six columns in the output:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Column !! Description
|-
| Unlabeled (source of variance) || This column describes each row of the ANOVA summary table. It tells us that the first row corresponds to the between-groups estimate of variance. The between-groups estimate of variance forms the numerator of the F ratio. The second row corresponds to the within-groups estimate of variance. The within-groups estimate of variance forms the denominator of the F ratio. The final row describes the total variability in the data.
|-
| Sum of Squares || The sum of squares column gives the sum of squares for each of the estimates of variance. 
|-
| Df || The third column gives the degrees of freedom for each estimate of variance. The degrees of freedom for the between-groups estimate of variance are given by the number of levels of the IV-1. In this example there are five levels of the independent variable.
|-
| Mean Square || The fourth column gives the estimates of variance (the mean squares). Each mean square is calculated by dividing the sum of square by its degrees of freedom.
|-
| F || The fifth column gives the F ratio. It is calculated by dividing mean square variance between-groups by the mean square variance within groups.
|-
| Sig. || The final column gives the significance of the F-ratio. This is the p-value. If the p-value is less than or equal to your alpha level, then you can reject null hypothesis that all means are equal. In our example, the p-value is .000. 
|}

Here is the actual ANOVA table from the example:
[[File:21ANOVA06.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that religious affiliation does significantly affect frequency of prayer for genetic counselors.

It's great that this has been imported here.  Keep in mind, though, that most of these pages were, and still are, tagged as stubs.  I agree with that assessment of the pages.  Each ends with a short bulleted list of animals, presumably with the notion that there would be something about each one.  Those lists have now been made links to Wikipedia articles, which I think is ultimately inappropriate; Wikibooks are supposed to be largely self-contained, and this has had the unfortunate effect of making these pages feel like annexes to Wikipedia.

Note that some of the additional content one might consider adding is at least similar to stuff that's redundant to other Wikijunior books &amp;mdash; [[Wikijunior:Bugs]] comes to mind.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:13, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

:I agree.  Though I just noticed that some of the links changed when I imported.  For example, on [http://simple.wikibooks.org/wiki/Animal_Kingdoms/Content/Amphibians this page] all the links point to simple.wikipedia, where as on [[Wikijunior:Animal Kingdom/Amphibians]] everything points to wikipedia.  This was not exactly intentional, but ultimately we don't intend to link to either form of wikipedia, so I am not too worried about the change. But maybe it is something to kept on the back of my mind if I do other imports from simple.wikibooks. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:41, 22 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

;Important note
:This release includes breaking changes. These release notes will guide you through the process of updating your calling code.
}}

The 3.0 release marks a major transition. For starters, all methods use the API where possible. This means that return formats have changed in some cases. Likewise, some method calls have changed. Some of these still accept a backward-compatible form; this will be noted where applicable.
__TOC__
==Breaking changes==
===All methods===
;Overview
:Nearly all methods now return &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; on failure.

;Rationale
:Separating errors from returned data is important. If you require the error code or error details, they are available in &lt;code&gt;$bot-&gt;{'error'}-&gt;{'code'}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$bot-&gt;{'error'}-&gt;{'details'}&lt;/code&gt; respectively.

;Impact
:Any method calls which did not ignore the return value must now check for &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;.

====Example: &lt;code&gt;get_text()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_pages()&lt;/code&gt;====
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=These methods now return &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; for non-existent pages instead of an error code.
|rationale=per above
|impact=Any special cases you had for handling error codes must now look for &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; instead. Calls involving pages which exist are unaffected.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $text = $bot-&gt;get_text('Non-existent page');
print $text if defined($text);

my @pages = ('Page 1', 'Page 2', 'Page 3');
my $thing = $bot-&gt;get_pages(\@pages);
foreach my $page (keys %$thing) {
    my $text = $thing-&gt;{$page};
    print &quot;$text\n&quot; if defined($text);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|old-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $text = $bot-&gt;get_text('Non-existent page');
print $text unless ($text eq &quot;2&quot;);

my @pages = ('Page 1', 'Page 2', 'Page 3');
my $thing = $bot-&gt;get_pages(\@pages);
foreach my $page (keys %$thing) {
    my $text = $thing-&gt;{$page};
    print &quot;$text\n&quot; unless ($text eq &quot;2&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

===&lt;code&gt;login()&lt;/code&gt;===
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=This method now returns true on success; false on failure.
|rationale=In Perl, non-zero is true and means success. Even the syscall wrappings in Perl follow this convention.
|impact=All calls to &lt;code&gt;login()&lt;/code&gt; which checked return values must be updated.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$bot-&gt;login({
    username =&gt; &quot;Mike's bot account&quot;,
    password =&gt; $password,
}) or die &quot;Couldn't log in&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
|old-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $failure = $bot-&gt;login(&quot;Mike's bot account&quot;, $password);
die &quot;Couldn't log in&quot; if $failure;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

===&lt;code&gt;linksearch()&lt;/code&gt;===
{{Perlwikibot/breaking-change
|overview=This method now uses keys 'url' and 'title'
|rationale=This reduces confusion in cases where the programmer wishes to use a callback hook to do incremental processing. Without this change, accessing data would have been done with two different sets of keys.
|impact=Any call needs to have the key names updated.
|new-call=
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $options = { max =&gt; 10, }; # I only want some results
my @links = $bot-&gt;linksearch(&quot;slashdot.org&quot;, 1, undef, $options);
foreach my $hash (@links) {
    my $url = $hash-&gt;{'url'};
    my $page = $hash-&gt;{'title'};
    print &quot;$page: $url\n&quot;;
}

# Use a callback:

== Hello! ==

Hi there,

I came to your talk page after seeing your book stubs, [[Role Playing Games]] and [[Print (command)]]. Please don't be scared by the deletion warnings! I think I understand what you want to write, and it makes sense. The warnings and messages are just because we got a little confused by the formatting and organization of the text and pages. For that reason, it would be nice if you explained in more detail what are your plans for the books you intend to write, so that we can clear any misunderstandings and help you to sort out the rough edges and technical details of a Wikibook. You can reply directly here, on my talk page (link at the sig) or just post a more public question at [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance]]. See you, [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:27, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

:(cross-replying from my talk page) No need to apologize, everyone must start as a newbie :) A couple general suggestions to get you started:

:* First of all, familiarize yourself with the basics of markup - things like wiki links, section headers and such. There are a couple good links on the &quot;Welcome&quot; box above; [[Using Wikibooks]] in particular should make for a good read. Another approach is taking advantage of the fact that all pages here use the same syntax, so if you want to see how something was done in a page just click &quot;Edit&quot; and check the source.

:* Name the pages within your book hierarchically. For instance, you might want to create pages like [[Role Playing Games/Introduction]] or [[Role Playing Games/Dungeons and Dragons]].

:* Arguably the most important thing to keep in mind for creating a book is structure. Think of the subjects you want to cover (History of RPGs, pen-and-paper game systems, typical fantasy settings, or whatever else you'd like) and arrange them in a logical, nice-flowing order. Then, convert each topic into a new chapter (which could be one or a few pages), and link these from a table of contents in the main page (you can even link to non-existing pages, just to remind yourself and others that there is a gap in the book that should be covered eventually).

:* Be careful with writing style, too. Avoid speculation, wild/unsupported claims or writing in an excessively personal point of view. Also, for your particular book one thing that could become problematic would be diving too deep into particular games/series (say, by writing character guides).

:* Don't be afraid to ask more questions! A good place to go is the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|reading room]], where you are certain to find nice people willing to help.

:Good luck! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:22, 1 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Command line usage ===
OpenSCAD can not only be used as a GUI, but also handles command line arguments. Its usage line says:

OpenSCAD 2014.03+ has these options:

 openscad     [ -o output_file [ -d deps_file ] ]\
              [ -m make_command ] [ -D var=val [..] ] \
              [ --version ] [ --info ] \
              [ --camera=translatex,y,z,rotx,y,z,dist | \
                --camera=eyex,y,z,centerx,y,z ] \
              [ --imgsize=width,height ] [ --projection=(o)rtho|(p)ersp] \
              [ --render | --preview[=throwntogether] ] \
              [ --csglimit=num ] \
              filename

Openscad 2013.05 had these options:

 openscad     [ -o output_file [ -d deps_file ] ]\
              [ -m make_command ] [ -D var=val [..] ] [ --render ] \
              [ --camera=translatex,y,z,rotx,y,z,dist | \
                --camera=eyex,y,z,centerx,y,z ] \
              [ --imgsize=width,height ] [ --projection=(o)rtho|(p)ersp] \
              filename

Earlier releases had only these:

 openscad [ -o &lt;i&gt;output_file&lt;i&gt; [ -d &lt;i&gt;deps_file&lt;/i&gt; ] ] \
          [ -m &lt;i&gt;make_command&lt;/i&gt; ] [ -D &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;=&lt;i&gt;val&lt;/i&gt; [..] ] &lt;i&gt;filename&lt;/i&gt;

The usage on OpenSCAD version 2011.09.30 (now deprecated) was:

 openscad [ { -s stl_file | -o off_file | -x dxf_file } [ -d deps_file ] ]\
          [ -m make_command ] [ -D var=val [..] ] filename

=== Export options ===

When called with the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; option, OpenSCAD will not start the GUI, but execute the given file and export the to the &lt;i&gt;output_file&lt;/i&gt; in a format depending on the extension (&lt;code&gt;.stl&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.off&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;.dxf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.csg&lt;/code&gt;).  

Some versions use -s/-d/-o to determine the output file format instead  check with &quot;openscad --help&quot;.

If the option &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; is given in addition to an export command, all files accessed while building the mesh are written in the argument of &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; in the syntax of a Makefile.

==== Camera and image output ====

For 2013.05+, the option to output a &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; image was added. There are two types of cameras available for the generation of images.  

The first camera type is a 'gimbal' camera that uses Euler angles, translation, and a camera distance, like OpenSCAD's GUI viewport display at the bottom of the OpenSCAD window.

!!! There is a bug in the implementation of cmdline camera, where the rotations do not match the numbers in the GUI. This will be fixed in an upcoming release so that the GUI and cmdline camera variables will work identically. 

The second camera type is a 'vector' camera, with an 'eye' camera location vector and a 'lookat' center vector. 

--imgsize chooses the .png dimensions and --projection chooses orthogonal or perspective, as in the GUI. 

By default, cmdline .png output uses Preview mode (f5) with OpenCSG. For some situations it will be desirable instead to use the full render, with CGAL. This is done by adding '--render' as an option.

=== Constants ===

In order to pre-define variables, use the &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; option. It can be given repeatedly. Each occurrence of &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; must be followed by an assignment. Unlike normal OpenSCAD assignments, these assignments don't define variables, but constants, which can not be changed inside the program, and can thus be used to overwrite values defined in the program at export time.

If you want to assign the -D variable to another variable, the -D variable MUST be initialised in the main .scad program

 param1=0;   // must be initalised
 len=param1; // param1 passed via -D on cmd-line
 echo(len,param);

without the first line len wound be undefined.

The right hand sides can be arbitrary OpenSCAD expressions, including mathematical operations and strings. Be aware that strings have to be enclosed in quotes, which have to be escaped from the shell. To render a model that takes a quality parameter with the value &quot;production&quot;, one has to run

 openscad -o my_model_production.stl -D 'quality=&quot;production&quot;' my_model.scad

=== Command to build required files ===

In a complex build process, some files required by an OpenSCAD file might be currently missing, but can be generated, for example if they are defined in a Makefile. If OpenSCAD is given the option &lt;code&gt;-m make&lt;/code&gt;, it will start &lt;code&gt;make &lt;i&gt;file&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; the first time it tries to access a missing &lt;i&gt;file&lt;/i&gt;.

=== Makefile example ===

The &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; options only make sense together. (&lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; would not consider modified dependencies when building exports, &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; would require the files to be already built for the first run that generates the dependencies.)

Here is an example of a basic Makefile that creates an .stl file from an .scad file of the same name:

 # explicit wildcard expansion suppresses errors when no files are found
 include $(wildcard *.deps)
 
 %.stl: %.scad
 	openscad -m make -o $@ -d $@.deps $&lt;

When &lt;code&gt;make my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; is run for the first time, it finds no .deps files, and will just depend on &lt;code&gt;my_example.scad&lt;/code&gt;; since &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; is not yet preset, it will be created unconditionally. If OpenSCAD finds missing files, it will call &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; to build them, and it will list all used files in &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl.deps&lt;/code&gt;.

When &lt;code&gt;make my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; is called subsequently, it will find and include &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl.deps&lt;/code&gt; and check if any of the files listed there, including &lt;code&gt;my_example.scad&lt;/code&gt;, changed since &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; was built, based on their time stamps. Only if that is the case, it will build &lt;code&gt;my_example.stl&lt;/code&gt; again.

==== Automatic targets ====

When building similar .stl files from a single .scad file, there is a way to automate that too:

 # match &quot;module foobar() { // `make` me&quot;
 TARGETS=$(shell sed '/^module [a-z0-9_-]*().*make..\?me.*$$/!d;s/module //;s/().*/.stl/' base.scad)
 
 all: ${TARGETS}
 
 # auto-generated .scad files with .deps make make re-build always. keeping the
 # scad files solves this problem. ([[Talk:OpenSCAD User Manual/Using OpenSCAD in a command line environment|explanations are welcome]].)
 .SECONDARY: $(shell echo &quot;${TARGETS}&quot; | sed 's/\.stl/.scad/g')
 
 # explicit wildcard expansion suppresses errors when no files are found
 include $(wildcard *.deps)
 
 %.scad:
 	echo -n 'use &lt;base.scad&gt;\n$*();' &gt; $@
 
 %.stl: %.scad
 	openscad -m make -o $@ -d $@.deps $&lt;

All objects that are supposed to be exported automatically have to be defined in &lt;code&gt;base.scad&lt;/code&gt; in an own module with their future file name (without the &quot;.stl&quot;), and have a comment like &quot;&lt;code&gt;// make me&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in the line of the module definition. The &quot;&lt;code&gt;TARGETS=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; line picks these out of the base file and creates the file names. These will be built when &lt;code&gt;make all&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, for short) is called.

As the convention from the last example is to create the .stl files from .scad files of the same base name, for each of these files, an .scad file has to be generated. This is done in the &quot;&lt;code&gt;%.scad:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; paragraph; &lt;code&gt;my_example.scad&lt;/code&gt; will be a very simple OpenSCAD file:

 use &lt;base.scad&gt;
 my_example();

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;.SECONDARY&lt;/code&gt;&quot; line is there to keep &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; from deleting the generated .scad files. If it deleted it, it would not be able to automatically determine which files need no rebuild any more; please post ideas about what exactly goes wrong there (or how to fix it better) on the [[Talk:OpenSCAD User Manual/Using OpenSCAD in a command line environment|talk]] page!

=== Windows notes ===

On Windows, openscad.com should be called from the command line as a wrapper for openscad.exe. This is because Openscad uses the 'devenv' solution to the Command-Line/GUI output issue. Typing 'openscad' at the cmd.exe prompt will, by default, call the .com program wrapper.

=== MacOS notes ===

On MacOS the binary is normally hidden inside the App folder. If OpenSCAD is installed in the global Applications folder, it can be called from command line like in the following example that just shows the OpenSCAD version:

 macbook:/$ /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD -v
 OpenSCAD version 2013.06

[[Image:Twarog.jpg|thumb|Curd]]
'''Curds''' are a [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy product]] obtained by ''curdling'' (coagulating) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] with rennet or an edible acidic substance such as [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] and then draining off the liquid portion (called whey). Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria or yeast) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheese is produced this way.

In India, the word ''curd'' is frequently used to mean [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]. In South India, it is common practice to finish any meal with curd or buttermilk. In Sweden, curds is a major ingredient of the traditional baked cheesecakes Ostkaka (with egg, flour, almonds), which is eaten with jam and cream.</text>

:Make by default deletes intermediary files under certain conditions, see [http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/make/Special-Targets.html].  The .PRECIOUS target is also used for this purpose, and the linked page is not really clear which one is more appropriate. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:67.232.185.87|67.232.185.87]] ([[User talk:67.232.185.87|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/67.232.185.87|contribs]]) 04:24, 23 May 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:: using .PRECIOUS would be inappropriate here as it might leave partially completed files (as of reading your link, i should probably add the .DELETE_ON_ERROR target as well). the question is not what .SECONDARY does, but why, when the intermediate files are deleted, make would re-bulid the whole project on subsequent runs *although not a bit was changed*. --[[User:Chrysn|chrysn]] ([[User talk:Chrysn|talk]]) 22:44, 26 May 2010 (UTC)
::: For each .stl make will check if the sources are newer. Since the .scad files are regenerated, they are newer than the .stl files. Hence make will rebuild them. 

Could someone include a real world example that shows/explains why 'Automatic targets' is useful? [[User:Mimarx|Mimarx]] ([[User talk:Mimarx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mimarx|contribs]]) 02:29, 23 February 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rendering a movie: see Anim8tor help file.

'''Exporting a movie with an alpha mask:''' 
Anima8tor allows you to export a movie with an alpha channel. This option allows you to create very advanced professional effects once the footage is imported into a video editing program such as AfterEffects. You can export your movie in three ways: AVI, BMP sequence or JPG sequence. It is recommended you export your 3D movie (with alpha) as a BMP sequence with alpha. In the render movie window, make sure you have checked the box Movie with Alpha. With a BMP sequence each frame will be exported with no compression at the highest possible quality. Always import raw footage into a video editor with no compression. Compress you movie out of AfterEffects, but not going into AE. All source footage and images should be extremely high resolution.

NOTE: In the SAME folder you have selected to accept your BMP sequence, there will be two sets of files. This is not evident at first, so look carefully. On a PC choose LIST from window viewing option. If you scroll down there will be a second sequence of BMP pics, but these will be the ALPHA channel pics. They will be black and white. They will have nearly the same name as the movie bmp sequence and this can trip you up if you don't look carefully. It is the reason I have taken time to get online and write this page. I want to save others two days of wasted time. 

You will have two sequences in the same folder. Recommend you drag-select and cut-paste the second BMP alpha sequence to its own folder, to avoid confusion. 

In the editor, we will use AfterEffects as example, create a new file and new composition. IMPORT FILE and navigate to your folder where you saved your anim8tor sequence. RIGHT CLICK on the first name001.bmp file and then BMP SEQUENCE will become an option in that window. Repeat and now import your alpha (black and white) bmp sequence. The two names will be separated only by one letter, pay attention. Drag your movie onto the timeline. Drag your alpha on top of that layer. You can now use the AE track matte feature to turn the alpha sequence into a mask. Google 'track matte' if you are not sure how to do get that going. 

Anim8tor is not a complex 3D program overall, there is no argument with that fact - however, the creator of Anim8tor, Steven, is/was a coder involved in 3D video card drivers - so interestingly his particular approach involved putting many basic, powerful functions into Anim8tor.

'''Using Modifiers in Anim8tor:''' 
The Anim8tor help manual is thin when it comes to explaining MODIFIERS so I'd like to share some of my trouble solving research and hopefully save you some time. Please read the basic tutorials on modifiers available in the anim8tor manual and within online tutorials and refer back to this article later if you find something not obvious with those guys. 

There are probably two basic reasons to use the modifier. When building your model, perhaps to get an exact shape or angle of a piece. Secondly down the road when you have finished your model and you want to animate the object so it moves and bends realistically in the SCENE MODE time line. 

Select the MODIFIER tool. The yellow modifier grid box will begin to grow exactly at the tip of the cursor arrow. As you drag the mouse the yellow box will grow but if you position the cursor in the middle of an object and click-drag, note that you will not see the yellow box until you have dragged it to be large enough to see outside of object. Don't get fixated on drawing the modifier yellow grid box too exactly. Its quite adjustable after and I recommend you draw it next to the object or part of your object to be modified so you can see the box growing as you drag. After you finish click-dragging out the modifier box you can select the MOVE TOOL and move the yellow box around as you would any object. As well you can select either one of the SCALE tools. Try selecting the NON-UNIFORM SCALE tool as this will allow you to adjust the width of the modifier box. To scale the height, grab the uniform scale tool, and then again the non-uniform to tweak the width. Move the yellow modifier box over the area to be modified. Use the ARCH ROTATE viewing tool to rotate your view, so you can get the yellow box exactly in place. One thing to keep in mind when sizing your modifier box and placing it over the area to be deformed, is how completely the modifier box encompasses the object. You may need to experiment and what I have found is that you may get strange results if you put the modifier box over a portion of an object and not all. Which may result only part of the object deforming and leaving some jagged artifact bits stretched out. Again, it just depends so experiment and if all else fails just put the box over the whole portion, so all of the mesh moves together. 

Another note about the modifier box, in BEND mode I have noticed that after you have positioned and scaled your yellow grid box, you might want to ROTATE the grid box so you it bends in the direction you want. The modifier box can be rotated in place easily. Select VIEW and then LEFT from the top menu so you are looking at the side of the object now. Select the modifier box and then select the ROTATE tool and rotate the modifier box one quarter turn. Remember you can deselect any of the XYZ buttons so that the modifier box will only rotate about its axis, so it wont get all wobbly when you try to rotate it around a bit. Don't forget to toggle XYZ back on if you turned one off, btw. 

After you have drawn a modifier box, moved it into position and rotated the box if needed, you can grab the SELECT tool and drag the marquee over the modifier box and the object so they are selected together and turn white - then choose BUILD at the top menu - then MODIFIERS and in the sub window you select BIND MODIFIER. Now the box is locked to your object, but nothing has happened. Next double click your modifier box and a window will pop-up allowing you to enter values. After you enter your values and hit OK, the modifier will bend, twist, or whatever you have chosen. To have an object bend in the opposite direction just put a minus before the number, example -45. Save often and experiment with different values. If you find that your box doesn't seem to be oriented right, you can go back to the top menu and choose UNBIND MODIFIER, now the yellow box will separate from the object as it was in the beginning and you can move the box around, or rotate it, or scale it. After you tweak, don't forget to BIND AGAIN. A subtle, quirky thing is to make the yellow box wide enough so even though the box may end mid portion of the object, if you imagine its lines continuing down, and you ensure that all of the object falls within the box (by scaling the box wider, taller etc.) you will probably be able to get the right bend you want without any weird left over distortions. It seems that the cubical influence of the modifier box extend further than the visible yellow lines, so just make sure everything in the zone of the box sort of falls within it. So why not just extend the modifier box entirely over the area to be bent - the problem with that is that everything within the box will bend uniformly. Imagine you've made a snake. Its straight as a stick after you model him. You could use the bend modifier to put some smooth bends in his body at various points, but if you put ALL of the snake inside the yellow box, he will bend in one big crescent arch. So you have to position the box over a portion of him, but as I explain making sure the although only a portion is within the yellow box, all of the snake is within the yellow box zone. What I do is use the ARCH ROTATE view tool, and move around so I can peek down into my yellow modifier box, like looking down a gun barrel, to make sure all the bits of the object fall within this box scope. As I say, you might not have problems with your modifier box and areas outside of it, but if you do, try the above. 

After you have entered your values and hit OK and the object deformed, you need to finish up the modifier session by selecting again from the TOP MENU, BUILD, then choose MODIFIERS then choose EFFECT MODIFIERS. Now you have closed the that particular modifier session and the object will forever retain that shape. You can move on to another part of your object and repeat the process. 

Someone posted an interesting tutorial on using a combination of MODIFIERS and MORPH TARGET so that you can create little movement groups and use the MORPH TARGET clips within the SCENE time line, thereby creating some sophisticated and ordered movements. Movements can as well be done with bones and joints, but using MODIFIERS and MORPH TARGET bundles is another animal and may suit your needs in particular cases better.</text>

== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
About 15 million people.  Followers of Judaism are called &quot;Jews&quot;.

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==
Judaism is practiced in most areas of the world, most notably Israel and the United States which hold the largest Jewish populations. While [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]] has the largest European Jewish population, the [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] also has a small but prominent Jewish population.
There are only a few countries on Earth that do not have Jews, for example, Saudi Arabia and North Korea.

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
* The Torah, always a living law as the written Torah is understood in light of the oral Torah
* God, a unity
* The people (Israelites Jews), called into being by God as members of one family, a corporate personality, a community of faith
* The land (known today as Eretz Yisrael), a bond going back to Abraham, the &quot;father of the Hebrew nation&quot;

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==
The Torah, also called the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses, is the most sacred of Jewish books. It is part of the Tanakh, which is the Hebrew Bible (called &quot;the old testament&quot; by [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Christianity|Christians]]).
The Mishna and the Talmud are of tremendous importance in Judaism, though the word &quot;sacred&quot; doesn't really apply to these books.

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Hanukkah is one Jewish holiday.

== What is the history of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

== Who are some famous people who have practiced {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

== What is a story from {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 8608540;'''1996''' -- '''Final report of a phase I/II trial of hyperfractionated and accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy with carmustine for adults with supratentorial malignant gliomas. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Study 83-02.''' (Werner-Wasik M, Cancer. 1996 Apr 15;77(8):1535-43.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The use of HF with BCNU and dose escalation up to 81.6 Gy is both feasible and tolerable, although late toxicity increases slightly with increasing dose. The best MST with the least toxicity were observed for AA in the lower received HF doses (72 and 64.8 Gy). Accordingly, 72 Gy in two 1.2 Gy fractions was used as the investigational arm of a completed Phase III trial (RTOG 90-06). In contrast, for GBM patients, longer survival times were noted in the higher received HF doses (78.6 and 81.6 Gy), suggesting the role for further dose escalation. The low toxicity rate with AHF arms suggest that further dose escalation is possible and is currently occurring in RTOG 94-11.&quot;

Severe white matter changes continued to increase significantly as the total dose of hyperfractionated cranial irradiation was escalated. The time to onset of the white matter abnormalities appeared to be independent of dose.

== How many people follow {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Islam is the second-largest religion in the world and one of the fastest-growing religions, with about 1.5 billion Muslims (followers of Islam) in the world (more than 20% of the world's population).     

== Where is {{SUBPAGENAME}} practiced? ==
Islam is practiced in Arabia, North Africa many parts of Asia and some parts of south-east [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]].

== What are the main beliefs of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
Allah is the god of Islam. The major prophet in Islam is Muhammad. The Islamic Messiah(Man sent from Allah)is Isa.
The Pillars of Islam are five basic acts in Islam, considered obligatory for all Muslims. The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the shahadah (creed), (2) daily prayers (salat), (3) almsgiving (zakah), (4) fasting during the month of Ramadan and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) which has to be made at least once in a lifetime. The Shia and Sunni sects both agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts:

# The Shahadah, which is the basic creed of Islam that must be recited under oath with the specific statement: &quot;'ašhadu 'al-lā ilāha illā-llāhu wa 'ašhadu 'anna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh&quot;, or &quot;I testify that there is none worthy of worship except God and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&quot; This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the shahadah in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.
# Salah, or ritual prayer, which must be performed five times a day.
# Sawm, or fasting during the month of Ramadan. Muslims must not eat or drink (among other things) from dawn to dusk during this month, and must be mindful of other sins.
# Zakat, or alms-giving, which is giving a fixed portion of accumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy, and also to assist the spread of Islam.
# The Hajj, which is the pilgrimage during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah in the city of Mecca. Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime.

== What texts does {{SUBPAGENAME}} hold sacred? ==
The Qur'an (also spelled as ''Koran'') is the holy book of Islam. Muslims consider it as &quot;The Word of Allah (God)&quot;.

== What are some main holidays and practices of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==
'''Eid Al-Fitr''' and '''Eid Al-Adha''' are the 2 main holidays in Islam.  '''Ramadan''', a month of fasting (not eating during daylight hours) occurs in June, July or August each year.

== What is the history of {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

== Who are some famous people who have practiced {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

== What is a story from {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Plugin Question Requirement==

Plugin Questions need to follow certain rules very closely in order to function correctly within the Question Writer environment.

===Plugin Question Specification===

Plugin Questions are Flash components and are created in exactly the same way. If you are not familiar with creating Flash MX components, there is a good tutorial at

http://www.flashcomponents.net/tutorials/triangle/triangle.html

===Constructor===

The following values are made available in the constructor:

this._maxScore (String, points for fully correct answer)

this._isFeedback (String, either true or false, indicates whether feedback is being displayed)

this._responseid (String, response name)

this._listener (String, path to listener)


For each response option, a symbol id will be provided in the variables, 

this._option0, this._option1, this._option2 and so on.


For each response option, an identifier will be provided as Strings in the variables,

this._option0ident, this._option1ident, this._option2ident, and so on.


A number of tabIndex values will be provided as Strings in the variables,

this._option0TabIndex, this._option1TabIndex and so on.


Also, for each response option, an accessibility String will be provided in the variables,

this._option0access, this._option1access, this. _option2access, and so on

The name/value pairs specified in the parameters of the Plugin Question are also made available in the constructor. All the values are provided as strings.

===Requirements===

Your component should implement the following methods.

'''isFullyAnswered()'''

This method should return a boolean, true/false. It is primarily used when the user is required to answer all the questions on a page. Question Writer will use this method to ask the Plugin Question if the question can be regarded as being in a 'fully answered' state. Note, this state has nothing to do with the answer being correct, just that a full attempt has been made.

'''getAnswers()'''

This method should return an Array of Strings containing the score as the first element of the array followed by the current response(s) in subsequent elements of the array. If the responses relate to the options that have been passed into the question, the strings that represent these options are available in the constructor as the variables, this._option0ident, this._option1ident, this. _option2ident, etc.

If you aren't using options as your answers, then it is fine to return meaningful string(s) as the response(s). This must return an array of Strings - even if the question deals with numbers, it should convert those values to strings before returning them as answers.

The plugin should also use this function to store the answers to be used when question feedback is provided. It can do this by calling this method:
 
this.respObject.setPair(this._responseid+&quot;answers&quot;,answerArray);
 
'''setAnswers(Array)'''

This method should set the state of the Plugin Question based on the answers in the Array. This array will either send an empty array (when no attempt has yet been made on the question), or will return the Array that it had previously received when calling the 'getAnswers' method.

If the plugin is shown as feedback, it must access the answers from a stored location using the following method,

 
answerArray=this.respObject.getPairValue(this._responseid+&quot;answers&quot;);

　

A final requirement is that your Plugin Question should call this code when the state of the component changes.

eval(this._listener).updateFlash(this._responseid);

===Sequence of events===

This is the order in which events happen when the Plugin Question is placed on screen.

#The user clicks the next button and moves onto a page that contains the question.
#Question Writer places the question on screen, calling the Plugin Question's constructor.
#Question Writer calls the setAnswers(Array) method. If this is the first time this instance is appearing on screen, the Array will be empty.
#The user makes an attempt at the question
#The question calls 'eval(this._listener).updateFlash(this._responseid);'
#Question Writer calls 'getAnswer()' method and stores the array.
#Repeat steps 4 – 6 many times.
#The user clicks 'next' to move out of the page.
#Question Writer removes the question from the screen, destroying all information apart from the last answers array, which it stores.

===Packaging===

To package your component, first need to create a blank flash file. Drag your component onto the stage and then delete it. Your component should then be present in the library. Compile the flash file (as version 8 or less) as a .swf and this file is your finished Plugin Question.

===Filename===

The filename must be the same name as the symbol used for the Flash component plus the file extension (.swf).  The filename also contains additional parameters, as per the following example.

QWPQ-0-20-0-ComboBoxV1_7.swf

'''First Parameter''': (0) - This tells Question Writer how much on-screen space to allow for the Plugin Question. It should have a value of either:
0 - To indicate that Question Writer should allocate as much space as the largest option requires

1 - To indicate that Question Writer should allocate as much space as the first option requires

2 - To indicate that Question Writer should allocate enough space to display all the options

3 - To indicate that Question Writer should not allocate any space based on the option sizes

'''Second Parameter''': (20) - This is the number of additional pixels in width that QW understands your component to require.

'''Third Parameter''': (0) - This is the number of additional pixels in height that QW understands your component to require.

　

===Identification===

To make your component easy to use, you can change the dimensions of your flash file to 200x200 and add the following actionscript to the first frame in the main timeline to identify the symbol name, version and copyright information:

Note: It is best to make the check (this._parent==null), rather than (this==_root) as _root is replaced by Question Writer.

if(this._parent==null){
this.createTextField(&quot;version&quot;, 10, 0, 0, 200, 200);
this.version.multiline = true;
this.version.wordWrap = true;
this.version.text = &quot;Symbol: QWPQ-0-20-0-ComboBoxV1_7.swf\nVersion 1.0\nCopyright
2003-2010 Central Question Ltd.&quot;;
}

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |The '''plugin question type''' allows for an unlimited number of question types. Anything that can be programmed in Flash (up to version 8) can be used as a question type. Plugin Questions allow you to ask any type of question, with any type of layout or display, and any type of scoring logic. 

Plugin Questions can also use content that is entered in Question Writer. This means that a programmer is only required to create the initial question type – the content can be supplied through the usual Question Writer interface. And once a Plugin Question is created, it can be used over and over again in different quizzes

Three sample Plugin Questions are provided with Question Writer. Check in the samples directory to open the 'PluginQuestions.qwz' file in Question Writer. View the quiz here[[http://www.questionwritertracker.com/index.php/quiz/display?id=6077&amp;token=P6PGB9ZK]], to see how the questions integrate seamlessly into a quiz.{{clr}}
|}


[[File:QW Plugin.PNG|center]]


Plugin Questions are created as .swf files - this file contains all the layout code and scoring logic. Question Writer then provides the file with the parameters and options of the question. Take the Horizontal Slider Plugin Question provided with Question Writer for example. 


[[File:QW Plugin parameters.PNG|center]]


The parameters are used to tell it the maximum and minimum values that the slider can take and whether to display the slider's current value. The first option is used to provide a background graphic, and the second option is used to provide the slider button. In this way, the Plugin Question is programmed once, but virtually any type of slider can be created with it using the parameters and options.

To create your own Plugin Question, you'll need the services of a Flash programmer. The interface is described in [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Plugins/Plugin Interface|Plugin Question Requirements]], and you can also download the source code (.fla) to a sample Plugin Question (The Cycle Plugin Question) as a basis to work from [[http://www.questionwriter.com/downloads/QWPQ-0-0-0-CycleV1_2.zip]].

{{closed|Closed as {{keep}}.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:07, 23 May 2010 (UTC)}}As per [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1794200#The_Nature_of_Angelic_Beings above].  Original research and point of view problems. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:03, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Keep}} There are four content pages linked from the main page. From these, only [[The Ten Commandments/Do Not Covet]] strikes me as wholly unacceptable POV - and note the bulk of the text was not written by the same editors responsible for the rest of the book. The other pages are, in spite of being written from a Judeo-Christian perspective, quite reasonable actually. There are other annoying - but theoretically correctable - issues, such as the lack of references and the thinness of the contents. All things considered, take my position as a weak keep. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:59, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Keep}}  I find the fact that the book attempts to address multiple religions speaks a long way to its attempt at NPOV.  The fact it discusses specifics of translations without reference is very problematic.  It is also quite a stalled stub, and has not received any attention for a few years.  If this pattern continues I could see deleting it at some point in the future. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:43, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' - I believe that in this case a POV cleanup would be rather difficult, and giving it time to improve probably won't help much, in my opinion.

{{Closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Speedy Delete'''&amp;mdash; Consensus of book contributors. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:11, 19 May 2010 (UTC)}}
[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Speedy Delete''': Unmaintained; Empty; see [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] &amp; [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Chess/Q&amp;A]] --16:44, 18 May 2010 (UTC)[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]])

: &lt;del&gt;[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''&lt;/del&gt; Whether it's unmaintained is irrelevant. Even though it were empty (which it's not) the creator ([[User:PAC]] who has several hundred edits to [[R Programming]] and continues to [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/R_Programming|contribute]] under the username [[User:PAC2]]) saw it as useful. Since the book is still active, I suggest taking this up with the book contributors first. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:22, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
:: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' as the page creator and major book contributor agrees. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:38, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

I quote the User PAC here from the talk page:

&lt;nowiki&gt;== Speedy deletion ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I agree with the speedy deletion of this page 

[[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]]) 08:24, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

There is already consensus that Wikipedia's Reference desk is the correct place for asking questions.

My favorite quote from the last discussion ''I mean, whoever saw books automatically answering people's questions!'' by Kayau. 

--[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 03:56, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

: Considering [[User_talk:PAC2#Request for deletion|this message]] written a couple hours ago it can only be assumed that Swift had not seen the &quot;I agree&quot; message from PAC2 and therefore set out to ask for his input, in perfectly good faith. No need to make a war about that... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 04:35, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Its hard to assume good faith, as it seemed to me Swift did not read [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] before opposing on all Q&amp;A. Regardless, I will Take a break from editing ''Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion'' for a few days. As this will be my last message here, WB:RFD, for a few days, I will take the opportunity to apologize to Swift, for any misgivings that may be construed. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 05:21, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: 33rogers, you're misunderstanding the point of [[WB:AGF]]. The idea is to go beyond what seems to you and assume good faith regardless. The reason for this is that based on limited information we often draw false conclusions regarding the intent of others. In some cases emotions even lead us astray and skew our rationality.
:::: The trigger seems to be that you believe that I hadn't read the discussion on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] before taking part in the discussion. The logical flaw in that conclusion appears to be that you believe one can only come from that discussion with one view. You furthermore make the mistaken assumption that a (prematurely closed) discussion on the deletion of a single page somehow demonstrates community consensus on where to ask questions (whether this applies only to WikiMedia projects or the wider Internet community is unclear). Quite on the contrary, there are comments noting both that these are well within scope (Adrignola) and potentially useful (Panic2k4).
:::: You then seem to argue that I had ignored the note on the talk page from the user and my note on [[User talk:PAC2]] somehow supports your view that I was not acting in good faith. At this point you're not making any sense at all.
:::: &quot;''[...] I will take the opportunity to apologize to Swift, for any misgivings that may be construed.''&quot; After your thinly veiled allegation of bad faith, don't cut your break short on my account. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:38, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

Again, I agree with the deletion of the page [[:R Programming/Q&amp;A]]. [[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]]) 08:30, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

'''Speedy delete''' requested by creator who is also the only notable contributor. If you don't count the person who asked a question. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:13, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' As far as I'm concerned, this now satisfies the [[WB:SPEEDY]] criteria and can be deleted without further delay but will leave that up to a less involved admin. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:38, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::Agreed and done. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:08, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

This section allows you to use HTML or a variety of embedded fonts (selected from a drop down box) and to select a different font  or font size for your title or body text to replace the default fonts set up within the theme used.

[[Image:QWText settings2.jpg|center]]


===Use HTML To Format Text===
In the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4 this option can be found under Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings

When this option is switched on, you can change the way text is displayed by using HTML formatting. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags bold. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags italic. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;24&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Arial Red at point size 24&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags point size 24, color red, font face Arial. Relative sizes can be used - eg -2,-1,+1,+2 to make the text relatively larger or smaller. Absolute sizes can be used also - eg 36. Absolute sizes smaller than 8 are treated as HTML sizes (1 is very small, 7 is very large). Font colors can be HTML colors(red, yellow, white etc) or RGB style colors (color=&quot;#FFCCFF&quot;) 


[[Image:QW3 Using html1.jpg|left]]


[[Image:QW3 Using html2.jpg|right]]

{{clear}}
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Center Alignment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This causes a new paragraph to be created and any text in that paragraph to be aligned in the center. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This creates a new line.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;superscript&lt;/sup&gt;
E = MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a superscript.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;subscript&lt;/sub&gt;
The chemical symbol for Oxygen is 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a subscript

HTML formatting can be used in all text fields with one exception - it cannot be applied to the text that appears on next and back buttons.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |
===Respect Newlines in HTML===

If you are using the ''' Professional''' version of Question writer you can tick this box is ticked so that you can use HTML text formatting but still respect newlines in the text.


===Optimize Text for Small Screens===
Ticking this box is especially useful for small fonts and small screens like mobile devices.{{clr}}
|}

===Embed Font===
In the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4 this option can be found under Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings

When the quiz taker enters text at the keyboard, the quiz can either use a system font or (with this option checked) an embedded font. Using an embedded font guarantees that the font will be used and the chosen characters will be available. You can ensure that all the letters and accents that a user might want to enter are embedded by choosing the right character set for the quiz taker's language.

The embedded font is used in the Fill in the Blank and Essay style questions. It is also used when the user is prompted for Name/UserID at the start of the quiz.

For text entry in Japanese and other languages with large character sets, it is usually better to switch off this option as the number of characters is very large and leads to a very large file size.

In the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4 these options (apart from Override Body Text Font Color) can be found under Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings

[[File:QW Body text font.jpg|center]]

===Override Body Text Font===
By ticking the box and selecting a font you can override the default font used in the theme, for example if you want to customize the appearance of the quiz

===Override Body Text Font Size===

You can override the default font size used in the body text.  This might be useful eg if you have particularly long questions and have trouble fitting them on to a single page.

If you are using the '''Standard''' version of Question Writer 4, these options (apart from the Override Title Text Font Color) can be found in Quiz Properties - Appearance Settings.
 

[[Image:QW Title text font.jpg|center]]


===Override Title Text Font===

Each theme defines a different font to use in the quiz for titles - you can override that selection by choosing your own font here.


===Override Title Text Font Size===

As well as changing the font used you can also change the default font size for the titles.  This could be useful eg if you want to display your quiz using an OHP and need to make sure everyone in the room can read the text.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used to insert an empty, 1px wide, table cell into an HTML table or wikitable.  It can be used whenever an empty cell is required to balance a table, for instance when hardcoding mbox templates.

This template takes no parameters.

=== Technical details ===

Most browsers are not so picky about balancing the table. However some are. For instance in Safari you can get partly missing left or right border of the table if some table rows do not contain the right number of table cells.
&lt;includeonly&gt;

{{Infobox software
| name      = Perlwikibot
| author    = [[w:User:ST47|ST47]]
| developer = The Perlwikibot team
| released  = August 25, 2007

==What is this thing?==
perlwikipedia is a bot framework, similar to [[Pywikibot]], except it's written in [[Subject:Perl programming language|Perl]].

==Does that mean you're trying to make pywikibot obsolete?==
Of course not! Pywikibot is a valuable bot framework (the Tawkerbot2 code, as well as most major bots, are written using it), however, if Perl coders are confined to using Python, they can't customize and extend the code to fit their needs. With an open-source framework written in their &quot;native language,&quot; they'll be able to better write bots in a language that they are comfortable with, and even customize the framework to fit needs it wasn't originally imagined for.

==How complete is perlwikipedia?==
Perlwikibot is almost completely cross-wiki, so you can write bots for virtually any [[MediaWiki]] wiki with it.

===Editing and querying wikis===
* Retrieve the wikitext of articles, sections, and old revisions
* Edit pages
* Retrieve the history of articles
* Revert to old revisions of articles (manually, with undo, or with rollback)
* Retrieve the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] log
* Retrieve [[Special:WhatLinksHere|backlinks and transclusions]]
* Purge page caches
* Retrieve a listing of all pages in a category
* Run [[Special:Linksearch|linksearches]]

===Admin functions===
* Deleting and undeleting pages
* Blocking and unblocking users
* Protecting and unprotecting pages
* Performing transwiki imports (XML upload is in the works)

== Installation ==
The [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MediaWiki::Bot latest stable version] can be installed from [[w:CPAN|CPAN]]:
 user@host:~$ cpan
 cpan&gt; install MediaWiki::Bot
 ...

Or download from [http://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/downloads/list] and install it like you would any other Perl module:
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 sudo make install

=== Development versions ===
The latest unstable source code can be checked out from [[w:Subversion|SVN]]:

 svn checkout http://perlwikipedia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ perlwikibot

Unlike pywikibot, we ''do not'' recommend using the unstable source tree for production. Unlike pywikibot, perlwikibot is not simply a tree of files, actual installation is needed&lt;!--well, not really, but we can lie for effect :P--&gt;. Furthermore, the project is undergoing rapid development currently, including '''breaking changes''' in preparation for a 3.0 release.

==Who wrote perlwikibot?==
perlwikibot is maintained by [[w:User:ST47|ST47]], [[w:User:Shadow1|Shadow1]], [[w:User:Jmax-|Jmax-]], [[w:User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]], and [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]].

==Can I help?==
Sure! Check out the [https://openhatch.org/+projects/Perlwikibot OpenHatch page] for ways to get started, or jump into the [http://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/issues/list list of issues] and start hacking! ST47 can grant SVN commit access, but you must have a Google account.

== Parameters ==
All parameters are optional.

; name: name of software (Note: If you don't put the right thing here it breaks the latest release / latest preview fields when &quot;frequently updated&quot; is enabled. If you want the title at the top of the infobox to be different than the software templates, use the &quot;title&quot; parameter instead.)
; title: title
; logo: logo
; screenshot: screenshot image
; caption: caption for screenshot
; collapsible: can be set to &quot;yes&quot; in case of long vertical screenshot
; author: original author of the program
; developer: current developer of the program
; released: the release date of version 1.0 (or closely-matching release). For subsequent or prior releases, use &lt;code&gt;latest release date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Can use {{tl|Start date}} template.
; discontinued: whether this product is no longer being developed (changes the words 'Latest release' to 'discontinued).  Any value will do, though 'yes' or 'true' are preferred for clarity.  Use the last release version and date in the 'latest release' parameters, below.
; latest release version: latest released version number 
; latest release date: release date of the latest released version; suggested use of {{tl|Start date and age}} template
; latest preview version: version number of preview version or development branch
; latest preview date: preview date; suggested use of {{tl|Start date and age}} template
; frequently updated: if set to &quot;yes&quot;, latest release/preview date and version have to be defined in subtemplate by clicking the numbers directly in the infobox (make sure the &quot;name&quot; parameter above exactly matches the name of the subtemplate pages)
; programming language: programming language
; operating system: operating system.  For Unix-like multi-OS programs use: Any Unix-like
; platform: (Java, .NET).  For multi-platform programs use: Cross-platform
; size: in megabytes
; language: natural language (English, French)
; status: Should probably be one of: Planned, Active, Unmaintained, Discontinued, Abandonware
; genre: Type of program.  Probably wikilinked to an article such as Geographic information system.
; license: License such as &lt;code&gt;proprietary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;GPL&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Pick either ''license'' (American English) or ''licence'' (Commonwealth English), not both - select the one which matches the content of the article the template is used in.
; website: Web site of software package.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

==Usage==
This template returns a date, or date-time. It also includes the same date (and time) duplicated in a hidden (by CSS) ISO date format, for use in [[w:microformat|microformat]]s. This hidden date degrades gracefully when CSS is not available.

==Syntax==
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|year|month|day}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|year|month|day|HH|MM|SS|TimeZone}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (MM and SS are optional; TimeZone may be a numerical value, or &quot;Z&quot; for [[w:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]; see examples)

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||+01:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||+01:00}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||-07:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|||-07:00}}&quot;
*:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|Z}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|Z}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|+01:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|+01:00}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|-07:00}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|23|-07:00}}&quot;

An optional parameter, df, can be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; (or indeed any value) to display the day before the month. This is primarily used in articles about events in parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date.

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|df=y}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|df=y}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Start date|1993|02|24|08|30|df=yes}}&quot;

'''Note:''' The template will appear broken when the parameters are left blank (as seen above).

! Parameter
! Description
|-
|''yyyy''
|Four digits indicating the year in question. The year must always appear in a 4-digits form.
|-
|''mm''
|A number between 1 to 12, indicating the month. Leading zeros in the number are ignored.
|-
|''dd''
|A number between 1 to 31, indicating the day of the month. Leading zeros in the number are ignored.
|-
|'''df='''
|The optional parameter '''df''' can either be set to '''yes''' or anything other than '''yes'''. When set to '''yes''', date will be displayed in DMY format: Day appears to the left, month in the middle and year to the right. When set something other than '''yes''' or when this parameter is not included, date will be displayed in MD,Y format: Month appears to the left, day appears in the middle, a comma follows the day and finally year appears to the right.

As for choosing the right format to use, consult [[Wikipedia:MOSNUM#Full date formatting|Manual of Style (dates and numbers): Full date formatting]].
|-
|'''br='''
|The optional parameter '''br''' can either be set to '''yes''' or anything other than '''yes'''. When set to '''yes''', a line break will be inserted between the date and the age. When set something other than '''yes''' or when this parameter is not included, a breaking space will be inserted between the date and the age. In either case, a semicolon separates the date and age, immediately before the line break or space.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

This template returns a date, or date-time. It also include the same date (and time) duplicated in a hidden (by CSS) ISO date format, for use in [[w:microformat|microformat]]s. This hidden date degrades gracefully when CSS is not available.

===Syntax===

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|year|month|day}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|1993|2|24}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{End date|1993|2|24}}&quot;
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|1993|2|24|08|30}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{End date|1993|2|24|08|30}}&quot;

An optional parameter, df, can be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; (or indeed any value) to display the day before the month. This is primarily used in pages about events in parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date.

Examples:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{End date|1993|2|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{End date|1993|2|24|df=yes}}&quot;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

These templates ('''{{tl|Birth date}}''' and '''{{tl|Birth date and age}}''') return a person’s date of birth and optionally his/her age.

&lt;big style=&quot;color:#CC0000;&quot;&gt;Do NOT use this template when the person’s exact date of birth is disputed or unknown.&lt;/big&gt;

Using this template rather than simply inserting the date into articles allows for the inclusion of hidden metadata about the date. This metadata can be used by web browsers and other software tools to extract the details, and display them using some other website or mapping tool, index or search them.

=== Syntax ===
==== To display the birth date only ====

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|year of birth|month of birth|day of birth|additional parameters}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''Do not use with non-Gregorian dates''' because the resulting hCard hidden date will be false.

==== To display a birth date with calculated age ====
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|year of birth|month of birth|day of birth|additional parameters}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''This form is only intended for living persons.''' In the rare case that a living person's birth date is given in a non-Gregorian calendar this template should not be used. The parameter names 'year', 'month', and 'day' can be used instead of the first, second, and third parameters for 'Birth date and age' only. These parameter names are not available for the 'Birth date' template.

Examples:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&quot;

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|mf=yes}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|04|df=yes}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}

=== Month First (mf) and Day First (df) options ===

The '''df''' (day first) and '''mf''' (month first) parameters indicate the intended date format to display. The appropriate parameter should be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; e.g. '''df=yes''' or '''mf=y'''.

The default output of this template is to display the month before the day. This default may not be appropriate for articles about people from parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date. In such articles the parameter, &quot;df&quot;, should be set to display the day before the month.

The parameter &quot;mf&quot;, while not actually used by the template, will indicate that month first format is intended. Using these parameters can assist bots or other automated processing to detect which date format is intended; leaving the format as default may lead an editor or bot to change the format to an unintended value.

Do not specify both &quot;df&quot; and &quot;mf&quot; parameters in the same use of the template, as these formats are mutually exclusive.

Examples:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&quot;.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|df=yes}}&quot;.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&quot;.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; displays &quot;{{Birth date and age|1993|02|24|mf=yes}}&quot;.

This template returns the number of full years between two specified dates.  If the second set of parameters is not included, it will return the number of full years between a specified date and today's date. 

;Syntax&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{age|year1|month1|day1|year2|month2|day2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;  or 
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{age|year1|month1|day1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

; Examples&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{age|1989|7|23|2003|7|14}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{age|1989|7|23|2003|7|14}}&quot;
: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{age|1989|7|23}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{age|1989|7|23}}&quot;

: When using this template to calculate a person's age at death or a person's age on a specified date (rather than the person's current age), please substitute it into the page.
:: Example: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:age|1989|7|23|2003|7|14}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

; Note&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:This template does not check for incorrect input:
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{age|1980|7|14|1993|6|233}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{age|1980|7|14|1993|6|233}}&quot; (surplus days do not count as extra months)
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{age|1980|7|14|1993|88|14}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{age|1980|7|14|1993|88|14}}&quot; (surplus months do not count as extra years)

Returns a person's date of death and age at that date.

&lt;big style=&quot;color:#CC0000;&quot;&gt;Do NOT use this template when the person's exact date of birth or death is disputed or unknown.&lt;/big&gt;

=== Syntax ===
==== To display the death date with age ====
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''year of death''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''month of death''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''day of death''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''year of birth''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''month of birth''&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;''day of birth''&lt;tt&gt;|''additional parameters''}}&lt;/tt&gt;

; Format:
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|yyyy|mm|dd|yyyy|mm|dd|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|yyyy|mm|dd|yyyy|mm|dd|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== Examples ====
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; returns {{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt; returns {{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}

'''Note''': The template will appear broken when the parameters are left blank.

=== Day First (df) and Month First options ===
The '''df''' (day first) parameter indicates the intended date format to display. It is switched on by setting it to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; e.g. '''df=yes''' or '''df=y'''.

The default output of this template is the month before the day (American-based style). This default may not be appropriate in pages about people from parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date (e.g. Europe). In such cases the parameter df should be set.

It is possible to use similar parameter &quot;mf&quot; to stress the month-first format so that relying on the default does not lead an editor or bot to change the format to an unintended value; however, it is ignored by the template itself. (So, should both parameters be mistakenly used at once, df takes precedence.)

Examples:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt; displays &quot;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt; displays &quot;{{Death date and age|1993|2|24|1941|4|12|mf=yes}}&quot;

__NOTOC__
Returns a person's date of death.

Using this template rather than simply inserting the date into articles allows for the inclusion of hidden metadata about the date. This metadata can be used by web browsers and other software tools to extract the details, and display them using some other website or mapping tool, index or search them.

===Syntax===
====To display the death date only====

: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''year of death''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''month of death''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''day of death''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''additional parameters''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; where the month, day, and year are in the Gregorian calendar. '''Use of this template with non-Gregorian dates creates false hidden metadata.'''

====Examples====
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date|1993|2|4|df=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Death date|1993|2|4|df=yes}}&quot;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date|1993|2|4|mf=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns &quot;{{Death date|1993|2|4|mf=yes}}&quot;

'''Note''': The template will appear broken when the parameters are left blank.

=== Day First (df) and Month First (mf) options===
The '''df''' (day first) and '''mf''' (month first) parameters indicate the intended date format to display. The appropriate parameter should be set to &quot;y&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; e.g. '''df=yes''' or '''mf=y'''.

The default output of this template is to display the month before the day (American-based style). This default may not be appropriate articles about people from parts of the world where the day precedes the month in a date (e.g. Europe). In such articles the parameter, &quot;df&quot;, should be set to display the day before the month.

The parameter &quot;mf&quot; will indicate that month first format is intended. Using these parameters can assist [[WP:BOT|bots]] or other automated processing to detect which date format is intended; leaving the format as default may lead an editor or bot to change the format to an unintended value.

Do not specify both &quot;df&quot; and &quot;mf&quot; parameters in the same use of the template, as these formats are mutually exclusive.

Examples:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date | 1993 | 2 | 24 | df=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays &quot;24 February 1993&quot;.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Death date | 1993 | 2 | 24 | mf=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays &quot;February 24, 1993&quot;.

*{{tl|Birth date and age}} &amp;ndash; same as {{tl|Birth date}}, except that &quot;(age ##)&quot; appears after the death date

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Fact, the annotated code on the eclipselink implementation did not generate FKs btw the entity table and the collection table. I wonder why it happens. By the way, no PK is generated either, what can be a headache if you intend to design the database from the ORM mappings....

:Foreign key constraints should be generated, although the JPA does not require this (or schema creation in general).  Sounds like a bug in EclipseLink's schema creation.  Please log a bug on EclipseLink for this.  As for the primary keys, JPA does not define an Id for Embeddables, so defining a primary key would be difficult.  EclipseLink does allow defining a primary key on Embeddables used in an ElementCollection, so this may work.

== Section on calling files in other directories ==

I wonder if this section should not be moved to a separate item, since the information contained here is common to any command which calls another file (e.g. graphicx commands)? Also, the reference to *nix may be too cryptic for some of the readership this manual addresses. This section could thus be reduced to a single-sentence reference to a more complete and generally useful section.

==Sub folders issue==
Trying to implement subfiles example I encounter a problem. If you put your subfiles in subdirectories e.g. chapter 1, chapter 2 etc and use this subfiles to call subsubfiles (this may seem peculiar but it normal if you have a plot in chapter 1 and want to call it with \includegraphics{./plot.pdf}) when you try to compile the chapter 1 tex file it works ok but if you go on and try to compile the main tex file you will end up with an error &quot;./plot.pdf&quot; not found. This is most probably because the main tex file and the chapter1.tex are in different directories.

==Moved chapter==
This chapter was previously called General Guidelines and I could never figure out what it was supposed to contain, I renamed it to Modular Documents, which is actually 95% of the chapter. I moved the last 5% (the last paragraph) to the programming part. I left a link to the Macros chapter in the Basic chapter so that first time readers will get to know how much macros are important. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 14:28, 21 December 2012 (UTC)

It might be a good idea to incorporate data from [http://en.flossmanuals.net/Blender/Introduction| this FLOSS Manual].  It's GPL, so that shouldn't be a problem.  The [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page| Blender Wiki] could also be useful, and it's under the Open Content License.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Version==

It is unclear what version of the program is being used here; the screenshot looks slightly different from my install of 0.46 (but that could just be OS/personal preference differences). I think there is a need for guidelines with respect to software versions (especially unfinished software) and guides to said software. With 0.47 out now a lot of information will become obsolete or inaccurate, and this is a potential problem that can be prevented with proper guidelines. I'm going to start a discussion on this in the reading room as well. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 02:30, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

There is no mention on how to dock the toolbars. I'm using 0.48 and can't do this after I undock them.</text>

:I agree that it doesn't seem to completely fall under anything in [[WB:SPEEDY]]. Specifically, under criteria #5 it should go to [[WB:RFD|RFD]], but on the other hand it's ''not actually CSD'd yet''. Granted, it doesn't seem like this module has much hope so maybe it should go to RFD sooner, but the template used does give 7 days before it gets CSD'd and it's only been a bit more than 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Xerol/CleanupNotice}}
I've found two orphaned pages that are not linked anywhere in page text:
*[[A Quick Introduction to Unix/Links]]
*[[A Quick Introduction to Unix/Starting a Unix terminal]]

{{User:Xerol/OrphanNotice}}

I have added A Quick Introduction to Unix/TODO to outline planned expansions/additions.[[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]] ([[User talk:Jimbotyson|talk]]) 10:41, 13 October 2010 (UTC)


I have reverted the status of this wikibook to 75% after it was changed.  Looking at the todo list, the purpose of the wikibook, the title of the wikibook and the state of the wikibook I remain convinced that this is the correct status.  Wikibooks are collective efforts, so while I initiated this book; designed it; wrote most of the content, I understand that others may take different views.  Could I ask that if the status is changed the wikipedian *explains* the change so that I can understand why I should revert it to reflect my view of the completion status?

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you insert a random complex rational function in a fractal program, it is very unlikely that you will find an interesting locality in the Mandelbrot set. But sometimes you will witness a startling spectacle when you zoom in. And this is usually where two domains of different structures meet each other.

If you come across an interesting formula, then let the rest of us see it. You can here write the formula and the coordinates of the locality, and show a picture. You should also state the critical points, however you can neglect this, if you use ∞ and a real point of smallest numerical value, or if you (in case of iterations towards finite cycles) use two conjugate complex numbers of largest distance.

You should fell free to remove formulas that clearly have been surpassed by others.

:&lt;math&gt;z^2/2 + z^4/4 + c&lt;/math&gt; c = (0.7, 1.3)
:&lt;math&gt;1 - z^2 + z^5/(2 + 4z) + c&lt;/math&gt; c = (-0.163, 0.085)

Und wüßten's die Blumen, die kleinen,
wie tief verwundet mein Herz,
sie würden mit mir weinen
zu heilen meinen Schmerz.

Und wüßten's die Nachtigallen,
wie ich so traurig und krank,
sie ließen fröhlich erschallen
erquickenden Gesang.

Und wüßten sie mein Wehe,
die goldenen Sternelein,
sie kämen aus ihrer Höhe,
und sprächen Trost mir ein.

Die alle können's nicht wissen,
nur Eine kennt meinen Schmerz;
sie hat ja selbst zerrissen,
zerrissen mir das Herz.
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
And if they knew it, the blooms, the little ones,
how deeply wounded my heart is,
they would weep with me
to heal my pain.
 
And if they knew it, the nightingales,
how I am so sad and sick,
they would loose the merry sound
of refreshing song.
 
And if they knew my pain,
the golden little stars,
they would descend from their heights
and would comfort me.
 
All of them cannot know it,
only one knows my pain,
she herself has indeed torn,
torn up my heart.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Adding License Information to a media in WikiCommons ==

Hello,

I added a file by name Shekar.jpg yesterday and forgot to add license information to it. Now I can see that it is asking me to add license information to the file to prevent it from getting deleted, but I am not able to do that. Please help me. I donot want the file to get deleted. Thanks

[[User:Abhinavagarwal2010|Abhinavagarwal2010]] ([[User talk:Abhinavagarwal2010|talk]]) 20:48, 11 April 2010 (UTC)Abhinavagarwal2010
:If you take a look at [[WB:MEDIA]], you will see information on the basics.  You can see the full list of license tags at [[commons:Commons:Copyright tags|Commons:Copyright tags]].  Be sure to do that at [[commons:File:Shekar.jpg]] and not at Wikibooks, though.  In the future, the upload wizard at Commons will help you to select the correct license automatically. If you can't figure out the license that applies, you can ask the experts at [[commons:Commons:Help desk|Commons:Help desk]].  I hope that gets you pointed in the right direction. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:51, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

== Spam for overnightpools.com ==

Unregistered user [[Special:Contributions/208.75.10.42|208.75.10.42]] has repeatedly added this link in spite of being warned. I think the link overnightpools.com should be blacklisted and the user possibly blocked. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:15, 27 April 2010 (UTC)
:I've added it to the blacklist. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:36, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

I think this is causing the navigation box to the left to be bolded on this page, but it might not because the template itself isn't bolded from thereon... -- [[User:Matt5678|Matt5678]] ([[User talk:Matt5678|talk]]) 16:53, 30 April 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this topic, students learn and enhance their knowledge about how to be an astronaut! Yes, they will be taught about that cool suit they will wear and the great feelings and experiences of landing on such surfaces like the moon. However, this topic contains an element of challenge as students are encouraged to research an astronaut and then give extended responses on their favourite type of chocolate cake. Yum, cake.

      <comment>/* Police Obligations to Collect Evidence */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The Crown must disclose all materials information that is in its possession or control that is not clearly irrelevant, regardless of if the evidence is to be called at trial or is inculpatory or exculpatory.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Stinchcombe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp 1991 CanLII 45] (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 326 at 339 and 343 (Stinchcombe #1)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Stinchcombe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frl8 1995 CanLII 130] (SCC), [1995] 1 SCR 754 at 755 (Stinchcombe #2)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wickstead, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr47 1997 CanLII 370], [1997] 1 SCR 307&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to disclosure is founded in the principle of fair play between parties&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lemay [1952] 1 SCR 232; R. v. Boucher, [1955] SCR 16&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the right to make full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
s.650(3)&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
:'''To make defence'''&lt;br&gt;
::(3) An accused is entitled, after the close of the case for the prosecution, to make full answer and defence personally or by counsel.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Right to make full answer and defence'''&lt;br&gt;
802. (1) The prosecutor is entitled personally to conduct his case and the defendant is entitled to make his full answer and defence.
&lt;P&gt;
R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, stated disclosure by the crown is &quot;one of the components of the right to make full answer and defence which in turn is a principle of fundamental justice embraced by s. 7 of the Charter.&quot;&lt;Br&gt;
See also:R. v. Wood (1989) OntCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has an obligation to obtain from an investigative agency any relevant information that it is aware of and must &quot;take reasonable step to inquire about ...relevant information&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Darwish [2010] O.J. No. 604 (C.A.) at para 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The obligation also requires the Crown to preserve all relevant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R v La [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr18 1997 CanLII 309] (SCC), at para 17&lt;/ref&gt;

This obligation is jointly held by both Crown and police.&lt;ref&gt;R v McNeil [http://canlii.ca/t/2254d 2009 SCC 3] para 14&lt;/ref&gt;

 
The &quot;Stinchcombe disclosure regime&quot; only applies to &quot;material relating to the accused’s case&quot; that are &quot;in the possession or control&quot; of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;R v McNeil [http://canlii.ca/t/2254d 2009 SCC 3] at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==The &quot;Stinchcomb Principles&quot;==
The Martin Committee produced a report considering the decision. The report detailed the principles of the case, at p. 146:
# The fruits of the investigation which are in the possession of the Crown are not the property of the Crown for the use in securing a conviction, but, rather, are the property of the public to ensure that justice is done. Stinchcomb, at para. 12
# The general principle is that all relevant information must be disclosed, whether or not the Crown intends to introduce it in evidence. The Crown must disclose relevant information, whether it is inculpatory or exculpatory, and must produce all information which may assist the accused. If the information is of no use, then it is irrelevant and will be excluded by Crown counsel in the exercise of the Crown's discretion, which is reviewable by the trial judge.

{{reflist|2}}

==Defence Raising Disclosure Issues==
The duty to disclose is engaged once the accused requests information from the crown any time after the charge has been laid. &lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe #1 at 342&lt;/ref&gt;
If defence fails to raise the issue and remains passive, they are less able to claim that non-disclosure affected trial fairness.&lt;ref&gt;R v Dixon at 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Defence have an obligation to diligently pursue disclosure by actively seeking and pursuing disclosure once they become aware or ought to have been aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stinchcombe #1 at 341; Dixon 1998 CanLII 805 at para 37&lt;/ref&gt; This means the defence should bring any failure to disclose to the Court's attention at the earliest opportunity so that the judge can remedy any trial unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe at 341&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==When the Obligations Exist==
The Crown will only be subject to disclosure obligation where there is evidence in its possession or control ''and'' it is relevant.

===Burden===
Once the right to disclosure has been invoked by the Defence the onus is upon the Crown to comply with the obligation. The Crown may refuse to disclose certain information, but has the burden of proving why full disclosure should not be applied.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Durette, 1994 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 469 at para 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The information will not be considered disclosure where it is:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Chaplin, 1995 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 727 at para 25 (The Crown &quot;must justify non-disclosure by demonstrating either that the information sought is beyond its control, or that it is clearly irrelevant or privileged&quot;)&lt;br&gt; 
see also R. v. Bottineau, [2005] O.J. No. 4034 at para. 45&lt;/ref&gt;
# Irrelevant
# Not in the control of the Crown
# Privileged

Satisfying any one of these requirements will eliminate any disclosure obligations upon the Crown.

{{reflist|2}}
===Control===
:See also ''[[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Disclosure/Third Party Records]]''

Where evidence is not in the control of the Crown it may be the subject of a [[Criminal Procedure and Practice/Disclosure/Third Party|third party records]] application, also known as an &quot;O'Connor Application&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. O’Connor, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frdh 1995 CanLII 51] (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an O'Connor application the Defence must show that the evidence is &quot;likely relevant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
O'Connor&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Relevance===
Not all information in possession of police must be disclosed. It must only be &quot;relevant&quot; evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Banford, 2011 SKQB 418 (CanLII), 2011 SKQB 418, [2012] 3 W.W.R. 835 at para. 5 citing Stinchcomb, among others&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;threshold question in any instance of non-disclosure is whether the evidence was relevant&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Banford, 2010 SKPC 110 (CanLII), 2010 SKPC 110, 363 Sask. R. 26 (SKPC) at para. 13
&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is upon the crown to prove that the information was &quot;clearly irrelevant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 (S.C.C.) &lt;/ref&gt;

Relevance refers to whether &quot;it could reasonably be used by the defence in meeting the case for the Crown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McQuaid, 1998 CanLII 805 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 (S.C.C.) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Dixon, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805] (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 at para. 20&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;That is to say there is &quot;a reasonable possibility that the information could be useful to the accused in making full answer and defence.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Banford, 2011 SKQB 418 at para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of relevancy is where there is a “reasonable possibility that the information will be useful” to the accused in making full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Egger [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs37 1993 CanLII 98], [1993] 2 SCR 451 at 467 and para 20&lt;br&gt;
R v Dixon [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805], [1998] 1 SCR 244 at 22&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Utility consists of information used for:&lt;ref&gt; Dixon at 22&lt;/ref&gt;
# meeting the case for the Crown
# advancing a defence
# influencing the defence’s trial strategy, such as the decision to call evidence 

Relevance is not limited solely to inculpatory evidence nor only evidence that the Crown would adduce at trial. &quot;Relevant materials&quot; includes all materials for which there is a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that it may be useful for the Defence. All possible exclupatory evidence must be provided as well, however, this obligation does not extend to a duty to examine the exculpatory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1zkbl 2008 BCCA 257], [2008] B.C.J. No. 1341 at paras. 13-15, and by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Darwish,  [http://canlii.ca/t/2843v 2010 ONCA 124]&lt;br&gt;, 252 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at paras. 28-30 and 39-40 leave to SCC denied&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Duration of the Obligation==
The duty is engaged upon the request of the Defendant. It is continuous throughout the proceedings up to and including the trial. The Crown may object to the request on the basis that it is irrelevant, outside of their control, or otherwise privileged.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Chaplin, [1995] 1 SCR 727&lt;/ref&gt; The burden is on the Crown to justify the refusal to disclose.

The duty to disclose is ongoing and so any new information received must also be disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stinchcombe #1 at 343&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===After Verdict===
:''[[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Appeals#Fresh_Evidence|Fresh Evidence]]''

The right to disclosure may not extend to the into a conditional sentence breach hearing as there is less of a right to full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sitaram [http://canlii.ca/t/fl4r3 2011 ONCJ 199]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Specific Type of Disclosable Evidence==
Materials including statements and police notes are required to be disclosed under s. 603:
{{quotation|
603. An accused is entitled, after he has been ordered to stand trial or at his trial,
:(a) to inspect without charge the indictment, his own statement, the evidence and the exhibits, if any; and
:(b) to receive, on payment of a reasonable fee determined in accordance with a tariff of fees fixed or approved by the Attorney General of the province, a copy
::(i) of the evidence,
::(ii) of his own statement, if any, and
::(iii) of the indictment;
but the trial shall not be postponed to enable the accused to secure copies unless the court is satisfied that the failure of the accused to secure them before the trial is not attributable to lack of diligence on the part of the accused.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 603; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 101(E).|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec603 CCC]
}}

At a minimum, the Crown should disclose &quot;can say&quot; or &quot;will say&quot; statements from any witness it proposes to call at trial.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Stinchombe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp 1991 CanLII 45], [1991] 3 SCR 326 at para 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that is in an undecipherable form, such as unlockable encrypted data, does not need to be given to defence as disclosure as the Crown cannot properly vet it for disclosable and non-disclosable information.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Beauchamp, [http://canlii.ca/t/1x5pv 2008 CanLII 27481] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
{{reflist|2}}

===Examples of Typical Disclosure===
Police compile a package of the evidence consisting of the notes, reports and statements generated during their investigation that is forwarded to the Crown Attorney's office. This usually comprises the initial disclosure package that is made available to the Defence counsel.

Disclosure packages can contain any of the following:
# the '''Information''' outlining the charges laid;
# the '''Crown Sheet''' or '''Crown Brief''' summarizing in the evidence in narative form and listing the witnesses that are available;
# the '''Police Notes''' consisting of handwritten notes made by all the officers involved in the case during their investigation;
# the '''Witness statements''' consisting of the verbatim recollection of the potential witnesses to the offence (written, audio, or video form);
# A '''Cautioned Statement''' of the accused
# the '''Criminal record''' of the accused as recorded in provincial databases or CPIC (Canadian Police Information Centre) printout;
# Copies of '''Court Orders''' (Probation Orders; Prohibition Orders; Recognizances)
# '''Expert Reports'''
# '''Certificates of analysis''' (often for breathalizer machine results; drug analysis; or firearms test results);
# the '''Medical records''' of the victim in cases of resultant injuries;

==Vetting Disclosure==
When documents are to be released for disclosure, the police and crown are permitted to vet the materials for the purpose of removing information that may not be disclosable. Types of information that can be validly redacted from the disclosure before going out to the defence include:
# clearly irrelevant information
# information tending to identify a confidential police source
# police investigative techniques
# advice that would be covered by solicitor-client privilege (either defence counsel or crown counsel)

See further details on [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Privilege|Privilege]] section.

==Disclosing to Third Parties==
A third party request for the production of materials that are part of a proceeding must be made to the presiding judge.

Where a matter has been concluded, the superior court does not have jurisdiction to order the release or production of any documents or evidence to third party applicants.&lt;ref&gt;
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Canada (Attorney General), [http://canlii.ca/t/27gdn 2009 NSSC 400] (CanLII) upheld at [http://canlii.ca/t/2dsvw 2010 NSCA 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police Obligations to Collect Evidence==
:''See also [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Trials/Weighing_Evidence#Lack_of_notes]]''

There is no violation of the disclosure obligation arising from a failure to collect information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hanano, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pj31 2006 MBQB 202] (CanLII) at para. 20
&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no burden on the police to record evidence of all conversations with witnesses, even important ones.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wicksted, 1996 CanLII 641 (ON CA), [1996] O.J. No. 1576, 29 O.R. (3d) 144 at p. 155:
(&quot;As pointed out by the trial judge, counsel were unable to provide him, nor were counsel able to provide this court with any Canadian authority wherein a stay was granted for the failure of investigating police officers to record conversations with important witnesses.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the handwritten notes of an officer are illegible, then the obligation of disclosure can require the crown to transcribe the notes or otherwise provide them in legible form.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bidyk, [http://canlii.ca/t/560b 2003 SKPC 124]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Abrey, [http://canlii.ca/t/1s2zz 2007 SKQB 213] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The police do not have a general obligation under collect evidence in a certain manner or create specific material disclosure and so a failure to do so would not amount to a failure to provide disclosure or impact the right to make full answer and defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Korski, [http://canlii.ca/t/1s8h7 2007 MBQB 185] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Darwish&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Barnes, [http://canlii.ca/t/23mm0 2009 ONCA 432]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Incomplete notes do not breach the right to full answer and defence. As long as the majority of the officer's evidence is recorded in some fashion there will be no violation.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bailey, 2005 ABPC 61 at para. 38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The court have no authority to direct officers on how they should keep their notes.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pickton, [http://canlii.ca/t/2d7cm 2007 BCSC 2029], [2007] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.) at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They should not be micromanaging the police's handling of a case.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bailey, 2005 ABPC 61 at para. 38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The police have no obligation &quot;to conduct their investigation in any particular way, to record every word spoken in an interview or to take a written statement from every potential witness who is interviewed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Korski, [http://canlii.ca/t/1s8h7 2007 MBQB 185] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Police are not obliged &quot;to preserve everything that comes into their hands on the off-chance that it will be relevant in the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lees, 2011 SKPC 98, [2011] S.J. No. 507 (SKPC)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative police strategies and &quot;tactical information are presumptively not disclosable absent a particularized claim to relevance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pickton, 2005 BCSC 1240 at para. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Lost or Destroyed Evidence==
Not every instance of negligence that results in the loss of evidence such as a video tape result in a Charter breach.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lipovetsky, 2007 ONCJ 484, [2007] O.J. No. 4135 at para. 19 (&quot;Even where there is negligence on the part of the Crown, the loss of a videotape does not automatically violate the Charter. A Charter breach is established only where the lost evidence is shown by the applicant to be relevant to the issues at trial.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Dulude [2004] O.J. No. 3576 (C.A.) at para. 30.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of evidence will not result in the a breach of duty to disclose so long as the conduct of police was reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. La [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr18 1997 CanLII 309] (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680 at para. 21
&lt;/ref&gt;

Notifying the accused ahead of destruction of property inviting inspection may cure the prejudice cause by the loss of evidence from the destruction of property.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Berner, [http://canlii.ca/t/fttg9 2012 BCCA 466] - car in collision destroyed by police prior to trial. Officer sent registered mail letter to accused prior to releasing vehicle.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Consequences of Breaching the Obligation==
Where relevancy is in dispute, the burden rests on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that breach of the Charter right to disclosure has been violated.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R .411 (S.C.C)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38 (CanLII), [2009] 2 S.C.R 651 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a breach of the right to full disclosure is found it does not necessarily follow that the right to make full answer and defence was violated.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Dixon, at 23 and 24&lt;/ref&gt;
Where the right to make full answer and defence is not implicated, the usual remedy is either an adjournment or order of production.&lt;Ref&gt;
see R. v. Dixon, para. 31 and 33&lt;/ref&gt; In fact in general, where disclosure has not been given or is given late, the usual remedy is an adjournment.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Demeter (1975) 10 OR 321 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Caccamo, [1976] SCR 786&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjelland, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc38/2009scc38.html 2009 SCC 38], [2009] S.C.J. No. 38, at para 25
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===New Trial===
Where late disclosure results in an unfair trial, even after the trial, an new trial may be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. C(MH) 1991 1 SCR 763&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc38/2009scc38.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may not constitute a distinct Charter breach.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v. Douglas (1991) 5 OR 29 &lt;/ref&gt;

Late disclosure does not necessarily result in an unfair trial.&lt;ref&gt; R v Rejzek, [http://canlii.ca/t/26shr 2009 ABCA 393] at para 26&lt;/ref&gt; 
A number of factors should be considered.&lt;Ref&gt; See R v McQuaid, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805], [1998] 1 SCR 244 at para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Exclusion of Evidence===
Where late disclosure warrants the exclusion of evidence follow the following principles from R v Bjelland:
:(a)   Remedies under s. 24(1) of the Charter are flexible and contextual.  The exclusion of evidence cannot be ruled out under s. 24(1).  However, such a remedy will only be available where a less intrusive remedy cannot be fashioned to safeguard the fairness of the trial process and the integrity of the justice system.
:(b)   The Crown’s failure to disclose evidence does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of s. 7.  Rather, an accused must generally show “actual prejudice” to his ability to make full to answer and defence.
:(c)   An accused must receive a fair trial, however, the trial must be fair from both the perspective of the accused and of society more broadly.  A fair trial is one which satisfies the public interest in getting at the truth, while preserving basic procedural fairness for the accused.
:(d)   A trial judge should only exclude evidence for late disclosure in “exceptional” cases:
::(e)   where late disclosure renders the trial process unfair, and the unfairness cannot be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order, or
::(f)     where exclusion in necessary to maintain the integrity of the justice system.

{{reflist|2}}
===Stay of Proceedings===
Within the rights under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms include the &quot;right to full answer and defence&quot;. This right requires the Crown to provide all relevant evidence. A failure to do so may violate this right, and a breach of that right may entitle the accused to a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter. 

Where a section 7 Charter breach is alleged on the basis of violating the right to make full answer and defence due to failure to make disclosure, the issue will usually be left for the conclusion of trial. Not only to first determine whether there is insufficient evidence for gulit but also that the judge can properly assess whether the right to full answer and defence was violated in context of the case in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. F.C.B. 2000 NSCA 35 (CanLII), 2000 NSCA 35 (N.S.C.A.) &lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Banford 2010 SKPC 110 (CanLII), 2010 SKPC 110 (Sask. Prov. Ct.) at paragraph 10 (overturned at 2011 SKQB 418 (Sask. Q.B.) on other grounds). &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Salisbury, [2011] S.J. No. 259 (Sask.Q.B.)&lt;br&gt;
R v Burwell, 2011 SKPC 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Delayed disclosure can be a factor but not a sole basis of seeking a stay.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dias, 2010 ABCA 382 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Costs===
Where failure to disclose is flagrant and unjustified, the court may order costs.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc., 2001 SCC 81 (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Guilty Plea]]

==Plea of Not Guilty==
Where an accused refuses to make a plea or otherwise does not answer the question of plea, the presumption is that a plea of not guilty will be entered into the record (s. 606(2)).

==Special Pleas==

===Autrefois Acquit and Autrefois Convict===

{{quotation|
607(1) An accused may plead the special pleas of
:(a)      autrefois acquit;
:(b)      autrefois convict; and
:(c)      pardon.
&lt;br&gt;
...
&lt;br&gt;
607(5) Where an accused pleads autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, it is sufficient if he
:(a)      states that he has been lawfully acquitted, convicted or discharged under subsection 730(1), as the case may be, of the offence charged in the count to which the plea relates; and
:(b)      indicates the time and place of the acquittal, conviction or discharge under subsection 730(1).
&lt;br&gt;
608     Where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is tried, the evidence and adjudication and the notes of the judge and official stenographer on the former trial and the record transmitted to the court pursuant to section 551 on the charge that is pending before that court are admissible in evidence to prove or to disprove the identity of the charges.
&lt;P&gt; 
609(1) Where an issue on a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict to a count is tried and it appears
:(a)      that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in charge, and
:(b)      that on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been made that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is pleaded,
&lt;br&gt;
the judge shall give judgment discharging the accused in respect of that count.
&lt;br&gt; 
610(1) Where an indictment charges substantially the same offence as that charged in an indictment on which an accused was previously convicted or acquitted, but adds a statement of intention or circumstances of aggravation tending, if proved, to increase the punishment, the previous conviction or acquittal bars the subsequent indictment.

An accused is not acquitted until all available appeals have been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

An accused cannot plead to autrefoit acquit where the victim in the first trial is different from the victim in the second trial.&lt;Ref&gt;
Rex v. Sweetman, [1939] 2 D.L.R. 70, [1939] O.J. No. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

R v Button [http://canlii.ca/t/2d5kx 2010 NLCA 66] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Res Judicata===
The defence of res judicata prevent any convictions being entered for the same factual transactions as a previous conviction.

Res Judicata is &quot;an act which underlies an offence or an act which forms part of a series of connected acts which make up the factual basis of an offence resulting in a conviction cannot be used to constitute the factual basis of a conviction for a conviction for another offence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
R v. Allison and Direl (1983) 38 C.R. (3d) 333 per Martin J.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was codified under s. 12 of the Code:
{{quotation|
'''Offence punishable under more than one Act'''&lt;br&gt;
12. Where an act or omission is an offence under more than one Act of Parliament, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does the act or makes the omission is, unless a contrary intention appears, subject to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be punished more than once for the same offence.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 11.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec12 CCC]
}}

===Double Jeopardy===
Section 11(h) of the Charter states that &quot;Any person charged with an offence has the right ...if finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again&quot;

The rule against double jeopardy means that a person cannot be convicted of a single criminal offence twice.&lt;ReF&gt;comes from latin “nemo debet bis vexaris pro una et eadem causa”&lt;br&gt;
Cullen 1949 SCR 658
Riddle 1980 1 SCR 380
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the right under s.11(h) to apply the court must determine 1) whether the matter is of a &quot;public nature, intended to promote public order and welfare within a public sphere of activity&quot; and 2) whether the matter involves &quot;the imposition of true penal consequences&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Wigglesworth [1987] _ SCR _&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{CdnCrimOffencesBox/Break and Enter}}
==Overview==
The offence of break and enter encompasses situations where the accused was or attempted to trespass on private property with an intent to commit an indictable offence (i.e. a non-summary criminal offence). The most typical form of break and enter is a break into a commercial or private residence in order to steal property. The most serious form of break and enter is where the accused did the act knowing that there were people present and was prepared to use force against them in a robbery-like fashion. This is known as a &quot;home invasion&quot;.  

A less frequent form of break and enter is the entry into private property in order to confront a person found within intending to assault or threaten with violence. The parties normally know each other and arises from a dispute between them, sometimes domestic. 

The evidence in most of these cases is circumstantial, and so [[Canadian Criminal Law/Identity|identity]] is often a key point of litigation. In many cases the accused was found at some time later with stolen items in their possession for which the Crown can use to establish guilt by way of the doctrine of ''[[Canadian Criminal Law/Recent Possession|recent possession]]''.

==Legislation==

==Interpretation==

===Breaking===
Section 321 defines &quot;break&quot;:
{{Quotation|
321. In this Part,
&lt;br&gt;
:“break” means
::(a) to break any part, internal or external, or
::(b) to open any thing that is used or intended to be used to close or to cover an internal or external opening;&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec321 CCC]
}}

&quot;Breaking&quot; can include an actual break as defined in s. 321 or it can be &quot;constructive&quot; breaking. &quot;Constructive&quot; breaking can be established by the accused simply walking through a doorway.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Johnson, [1977] 2 SCR 646 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1977/1977canlii229/1977canlii229.html 1977 CanLII 229]&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply entering into a structure through an open door does not on its own amount to &quot;breaking&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Jewell (1974), OJ No 931 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; This includes staying in a store until after closing time.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Fairbridge, 1984 AJ. NO 828 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, entering through an unlocked but closed door after knocking does not amount to breaking.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. House, [http://canlii.ca/t/frwt3 2012 NLCA 41] at 13-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entering===
An entrance is defined in s.350: &lt;ref&gt;found to constitutional in R. v. T.B.K., [1998] CRR 328 (Ont.CA)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quotation|
'''Entrance'''&lt;br&gt;
350. For the purposes of sections 348 and 349,
:(a) a person enters as soon as any part of his body or any part of an instrument that he uses is within any thing that is being entered; and
:(b) a person shall be deemed to have broken and entered if
::(i) he obtained entrance by a threat or an artifice or by collusion with a person within, or
::(ii) he entered without lawful justification or excuse, the proof of which lies on him, by a permanent or temporary opening.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec350 CCC]
}}

There is a statutory presumption under s.350(b)(ii) to require the accused to prove lawfulness of entry. However, this has been established as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Singh (1987), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 278 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt; 
see also R. v. K., [http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii925/1998canlii925.html 1998 CanLII 925 (ON C.A.) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The time of the break is relevant to determine whether such a &quot;lawful justification or excuse&quot; exists. &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Farbridge (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 521 -- Accused hid in store lawfully until closing in order to steal. This was not considered breaking&lt;/ref&gt;

When concerning break and enter under s. 98, entrance was defined as follows:
{{quotation|
s. 98&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''Entrance'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section,
:(a) a person enters as soon as any part of his or her body or any part of an instrument that he or she uses is within any thing that is being entered; and
:(b) a person is deemed to have broken and entered if he or she
::(i) obtained entrance by a threat or an artifice or by collusion with a person within, or
::(ii) entered without lawful justification or excuse by a permanent or temporary opening.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;

}}

{{Reflist|2}}
===Place===
Section 348(3) defines place as:
{{quotation|
'''Definition of “place”'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section and section 351, “place” means
:(a) a dwelling-house;
:(b) a building or structure or any part thereof, other than a dwelling-house;
:(c) a railway vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or a trailer; or
:(d) a pen or an enclosure in which fur-bearing animals are kept in captivity for breeding or commercial purposes.&lt;br&gt;

|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec348 CCC]
}}

A place has been found, in certain circumstances, to include a fenced off area surrounding a structure.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. R.J.F.,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/1994/1994canlii7611/1994canlii7611.html 1994 CanLII 7611 (NS C.A.)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The concierge area behind a locked gate as well as the desk and drawer within fall in the definition of a &quot;place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Charron, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m6jl 2005 BCCA 607] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

When concerning a charge under s. 98,  &quot;place&quot; refers to &quot;any building or structure — or part of one — and any motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, railway vehicle, container or trailer.&quot;(98(2))

{{Reflist|2}}

===Dwelling House===
&quot;Dwelling house&quot; is defined in section 2:
{{quotation|
s. 2&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
“dwelling-house” means the whole or any part of a building or structure that is kept or occupied as a permanent or temporary residence, and includes
:(a) a building within the curtilage of a dwelling-house that is connected to it by a doorway or by a covered and enclosed passage-way, and
:(b) a unit that is designed to be mobile and to be used as a permanent or temporary residence and that is being used as such a residence;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec2 CCC]
}}
Detached building on private property does not usually amount to dwelling. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. N.M.,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2007/2007canlii31570/2007canlii31570.html 2007 CanLII 31570 (ON S.C.)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An incomplete building does not constitute a dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sappier,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbpc/doc/2005/2005nbpc37/2005nbpc37.html 2005 NBPC 37]&lt;/ref&gt; However, an abandoned building however is one.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. DeWolfe (1988), 82 N.S.R.(2d) 175 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

A driveway is not a dwelling house; it is a place where people drive and park their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Evans , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8 at para. 32
&lt;/ref&gt;

A motel room,&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Henderson, [1975] 1 WWR 360 (BCPC)&lt;/ref&gt; camp,&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nowlan,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbqb/doc/2009/2009nbqb117/2009nbqb117.html 2009 NBQB 117]&lt;/ref&gt; can be a dwelling.

{{Reflist|2}}

===Intent to Commit===
To make out the charge under 348(1)(a), there must be an &quot;intent&quot; to commit an indictable offence and the intent must be present at the time of the entering. Breaking and entering into a place is not a criminal offence without a sign of an offence while inside. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Taylor, [1984] ___ (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt; A person being chased into a house and damages the door is not enough to form intent to commit an indictable offence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schizgal, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fn46 2001 BCCA 238] &lt;/ref&gt;

Section 348(2) provides that where there is certain evidence of the accused breaking in or out of a place, there is a rebuttable presumption of an intent to commit an indictable offence.

{{quotation|
'''Presumptions'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused
:(a) broke and entered a place or attempted to break and enter a place is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and entered the place or attempted to do so, as the case may be, with intent to commit an indictable offence therein; or
:(b) broke out of a place is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke out after
::(i) committing an indictable offence therein, or
::(ii) entering with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About This Book==
This Wikibook deals with the production of pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets are very well-defined concepts.  The most natural way of colouring is by using the potential function, though it is not actually the method most usually used.  The book explains how to make pictures that are completely faultless in this regard. All the necessary theory is explained, all the formulas are stated and some words are said about how to put the things into a computer program.

The subject is primary pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot sets in their &quot;pure&quot; form, that is, without artificial intervention in the formula or in the colouring. Exceptions to this rule are techniques such as field lines, landscapes and critical systems for non-complex functions, that appeal to artistic utilization.

The book should not contain theory that has nothing to do with the pictures. Nor should it contain mathematical proofs.  For our purposes faultless pictures are enough evidence of correct formulas, because the slightest error in a formula generally leads to serious errors in the picture.

If you find that something in this book ought to be explained in more details, you can either develop it further yourselves or advertise for that on the discussion page.

If you add a new picture or replace an illustration by a new one, it should be of best possible quality and have a size of about 800 pixels. Draw it twice or four times as large and diminish it.

==Julia and Mandelbrot sets==

===Julia sets depend on a Rational Function===
If a complex rational function is entered in the computer program and submitted to a certain iterative procedure, you get a colouring of the plane called a Julia set (although it is the domain outside the Julia set that is coloured). However, in order to get a picture that has aesthetic value the function must have a certain nature. It must either be constructed in a specific way to ensure that the picture is interesting, or it must contain a parameter, a complex number, that can vary.  Being able to vary a parameter increases our chances of finding an interesting Julia sets for some value of the parameter.  

What do we mean by 'interesting'?  Essentially that the iterative procedure behaves in a somewhat chaotic way.  If the iterative procedure's behaviour at each point is easily predicted for a particular function by behaviour of nearby points, then the Julia set for that function is not very crinkly, and rather uninteresting.


===A Mandelbrot set is an Atlas to the Related Julia sets===

If we vary the parameter in our rational function we can produce a kind of 'map' of values that lead to interesting Julia sets.  Values of the complex parameter correspond to points in the plane.  The set of points that lead to interesting Julia sets gives us some information about the structure of the Julia sets for the parameter value at each point. Such a set is called a Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set can be regarded as an atlas of the Julia sets.

The difference between the Mandelbrot set for the family and &quot;its&quot; Julia sets, is that the structure of the Mandelbrot set varies from locality to locality, while a Julia set is self-similar: the different localities are transformations of each other.

Sometimes you will prefer the more complex picture of the varying structure of the Mandelbrot set.  Sometimes you will prefer the pure structure of the Julia set.  Sometimes you will draw the Julia set because the drawing of the Mandelbrot set is slow for certain functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The police powers of detention and arrest are some of the most important powers available to a peace officer in their investigation of criminal activity. It is also some of the most invasive powers upon a person's liberty. This is a classic issue of procedural law that circumscribes the peace officers authority in these matters.

These chapters cover not only the powers of police to detain or arrest, but also the right a person has when the police engage in such conduct and remedies for breaches of those rights.

:I noticed you contributed to [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Arrest and Detention]]. I was wondering what happens after the police arrest and charge you? 

:I think they first lock you up in the police jail.

:Then what? Do you get to go see a judge in like 24 hours or something? --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 09:40, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

==[[Canadian Criminal Law]]==

Hi, when you changed the sub page &quot;Sentencing by offence&quot; to be a redirect to the main page (i.e., to redirect to Canadian Criminal Law itself) I assumed you were trying to in effect move all the pages that sat below &quot;Sentencing by offence&quot; to sit directly below the main page in the hierarchy. For example, what was &quot;Canadian Criminal Law/Sentencing by offence/Theft-related offences&quot; should move to &quot;Canadian Criminal Law/Theft-related offences&quot;. As a consequence I started to move the sub-pages down a level and tidy up all the redirects. I guess I started this as the structure was awkward having sub pages to a redirect page. Now looking at the book again I'm not sure if this is what you were trying to achieve! So, I've stopped for now. If you let me know what structure you'd like I can restore / delete the various pages and redirects to get it right.

== Question ==
Feel free to disregard but since you are editing a book on the issue of the law, even if not a lawyer or having other knowledge beyond an insight on what you are contributing (that is all we can hope). Can you spare some time and look into the discussion on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals#Request feature: Author namespace]] and express there your opinion on the validity of the copyright statements and disclaimers and your view if they should be given some extra protection from edit corruption and even well intentioned but wrongly placed information. Thanks any insight will be appreciated.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:25, 22 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

Some &quot;street&quot; names for ampetamines are uppers, ups, speed, black beauties, and wake ups. Amphetamines can be inhaled, injected, or most comonly swallowed. Effects on the body are high energy and feelings of well being.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the HLA assembler? ==

In the current version of this Wikibook the ''HLA assembler'' has not been introduced before its use on this page:

: ''HLA Comments. The HLA assembler also has the ability ...''

It is defined later in the book, in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/HLA_Syntax X86_Assembly/HLA Syntax]:

: &quot;HLA accepts assembly written using a high-level format, and 
converts the code into another format (MASM or GAS, 
usually). Another assembler (MASM or GAS) will then assemble 
the instructions into machine code.&quot;

Wikipedia page for HLA: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Level_Assembly High Level Assembler]. 
Note, however, there is some confusion about whether that page is about the language or the tool.

What would be the appropriate action? Adding a forward reference?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chemical equilibrium''' is when the concentrations of the products and the reactants in a reaction are in balance; there is no net exchange as the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the backward reaction. A [[w:Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]] is achieved when there is a lack of change in a system as inputs and outputs remain in balance. In a dynamic equilibrium, chemicals are reacting rapidly at the molecular scale, while their concentrations remain constant on the macroscopic scale. Compounds which are in a dynamic chemical equilibrium are studied and described using the concepts of chemical equilibrium.

==Equilibrium Law==
The equilibrium law states that the concentrations of the products multiplied together, divided by the concentration of the reactants multiplied together, equal an equilibrium constant (''K''). The equilibrium constant is a number which depends on the reaction and the temperature of the reaction mixture when equilibrium is attained.

The letter ''K'' is reserved as the symbol for the equilibrium constant. A specific type of the equilibrium constant can be notated with a subscript:
*&lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; = concentration is in molarities
*&lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; = partial pressures of gases represent reactant and product amounts
*&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; = solubility product
*&lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; = acid ionization constant
*&lt;math&gt;K_b&lt;/math&gt; = base ionization constant
*&lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt; = formation constant

The specific equilibrium law depends on the equilibrium reaction under study. A general equilibrium reaction can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha A + \beta B \rightleftharpoons \sigma S + \tau T&lt;/math&gt; 

The general equilibrium law for the above reaction is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{\{S\}^\sigma \{T\}^\tau } {\{A\}^\alpha \{B\}^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Compounds in a liquid or solid state ''should not'' be included in the equilibrium law because they have a constant concentration during a reaction. For example for the reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium law is:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{CO_2\} } {\{CH_4\} \{O_2\}^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

Aqueous solutions and gases are included in the equilibrium law. For the below reaction:

:&lt;math&gt; NH_3(g) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium law is:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{NH_4^+\} \{OH^-\} } {\{NH_3\} }&lt;/math&gt;

==Finding the Value of the Equilibrium Constant==
In the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; H_2(g) + Cl_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2HCl(g)&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium law is:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{HCl\}^2} {\{H_2\} \{Cl_2\} }&lt;/math&gt;

The most direct method for finding the value of the equilibrium constant &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; is by measuring the concentration of each of the reactants and products, and plugging in their values in the equilibrium law. For example, if the concentration at equilibrium for the above reaction are determined as &lt;math&gt;\{H_2\} = 1.0*10^{-8}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\{Cl_2\} = 3.4*10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;\{HCl\} = 0.802&lt;/math&gt;, they can be plugged into the equilibrium law to solve for &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{HCl\}^2 } {\{H_2\} \{Cl_2\} }&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{\{0.802\}^2 } {\{1.0*10^{-8}\} \{3.4*10^{-6}\} }&lt;/math&gt;

After plugging in the concentrations, do the appropriate arithmetic to find the value of &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;K_c = 1.89*10^{13}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Uses of the Equilibrium Law==
The value of the equilibrium constant connotes the extent to which, in a chemical reaction, reactants are converted into products. Thus, from the equilibrium constant ''K'', one can infer the composition of an equilibrium mixture. If the equilibrium constant is very large (i.e. above &lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt;), the amount of products present at equilibrium is greater than the amount of reactants, which means that the reaction goes to completion. If ''K'' equals 1, the amount of products present at equilibrium is the same as the amount of reactants. When ''K'' is very small (i.e. below &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;), the amount of products formed is extremely small; no visible reaction takes place.

===Spontaneous Reactions===
A '''spontaneous reaction''' is a reaction that will proceed without any outside energy or driving force. A spontaneous reaction has an equilibrium constant greater than 1. A reaction will be '''nonspontaneous''' if the equilibrium constant is less than 1. 

===The Reaction Quotient===
The '''reaction quotient''' (''Q'') is a value that can be obtained by plugging in the values of the required concentrations
into the equilibrium law. The equilibrium constant is the value &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; when the reaction is at equilibrium.
If the chemicals in the reaction are not at equilibrium, then the value obtained by the equilibrium law is called the
reaction quotient. ''Q'' has the same form as the equilibrium law, except &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by ''Q''. 
Four properties may be derived from this definition of the reaction quotient, ''Q'':
*If ''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction is at equilibrium.
*If ''Q'' does not change with respect to time, the reaction is at equilibrium and thus, ''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;.
*If ''Q'' &lt; &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction will move to the right (the forward direction) in order to reach equilibrium.
*If ''Q'' &gt; &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction will move to the left (the reverse direction) in order to reach equilibrium.

1. Which conic section forms the basis of vertical curves?

2. A section of a roadway goes up a 6% incline and includes no horizontal curves. Point A, which lies along this incline, has a station marker. Using a wheel measure, you measure the distance along the centerline from point A to the next PVC and find it is 880 meters. If point A is at Station 0+700, what is the station of the PVC?

3. Identify 4 criteria used to set the minimum length of a sag vertical curve (4 points), place them in order from most to least important (1 point):

4. An equal tangent sag vertical curve joins a –0.5 % grade with a +3.0% grade. Assume H=0.6, headlights are aimed upward at an angle of 1 degree

If the PVI of the grades is at metric station 10+100 and has an elevation of 300 meters, using the headlight criterion determine the station elevation of the PVC and PVT for a design speed of 100 km/hr and a coefficient of friction of 0.30. Draw a diagram with the values of your solution.

5. A crest vertical curve on a 2-way, 2-lane road is designed for 100 km/hr. The grades are 1.6% and – 1.4%. If the tangents intersect at metric station 2 + 000.00 (where 2 represents 2 km and 000.00 is 0 meters) and at an elevation of 100 meters above sea level, determine the stopping sight distance, the length of the curve, and the stations and elevations for the Beginning and End of the Vertical Curve. Assume h1 = 1.1 m and h2 = 0.15 m, perception reaction time is 2.5 seconds, f=0.30.

Draw a diagram with the values of your solution.

6. An equal tangent sag vertical curve joins a -2.5% grade with a +3.0% grade. Assume H=0.67, headlights are aimed upward at an angle of 1 degree. If the PVI of the grades is at metric station 5+750 and has an elevation of 0 meters, using the headlight criterion determine the station elevation of the PVC and PVT for a design speed of 120 km/hr and a coefficient of friction of 0.31. Draw a diagram with the values of your solution.

7. You have been asked to design an equal-tangent vertical curve to connect grades of the +1.0% and -2.0%. The design speed is 113km/h. Assume a value of 3.4 m*s-2 for deceleration rate, a value of 2.5s for reaction time, and a value of 9.807m*s for gravitational constant.

A. Calculate the Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) if we assume vehicles travel at the design speed.

B. If we take this SSD as the required minimum Sight Distance, determine the minimum length of curve. (According to AASHTO, we assume a driver eye height, H1, of 1.08m and a roadway object height, H2, of 0.6m).

1. Why might maximum superelevation be higher in South Texas than in Northern Minnesota?

2. Which conic section forms the basis of horizontal curves?

3. When a vehicle is traveling around a horizontal curve, it is subject to two forces. What are these forces, and how do they operate on the vehicle (draw a clear diagram illustrating the forces).

4. An existing horizontal curve has a radius of 100 meters, which restricts the maximum speed on this section of road. Highway officials want a maximum design speed of 150 km/hr.

Assume the coefficient of side friction is 0.15 and rate of superelevation on both the original and rebuilt sections is 0.06.

Compute the existing speed and find the new radius of curvature.

5. A flat horizontal curve on a 2-lane highway is designed with a 609.600 m radius, the curve has a tangent length of 121.920 m and the PI is at station 3+139.440

1. Determine the maximum grade an empty tractor-trailer with a mass of 10000 kg can climb at a sustained speed of 75 km/h.

The frontal area (A) of the truck is 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the drag coefficient = 1.00 and the available power is 280 kW, ρ=1.2 kg*m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, g = 9.81 m*sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;


2. What is the maximum grade a bicycle can climb at a sustained speed of 12 km/h assuming the following:

* Rho = density of air (1.20 kg*m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* g = 9.81 m*sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Mass (with bicyclist) = 100 kg
* Nominal Power = 1 kW
* Frontal Area (A) = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Drag Coefficient = 0.5
* Available power = 100 percent of nominal power

* Fr = 0.020 W


3. Bicyclists get tired. Assume the bicyclist slowly loses power (and thus velocity) going up the hill of the grade you just determined in question 2 above. If available power drops continuously from 100% to 0% over the course of the hour, to the nearest kilometer, how far does the bicyclist travel? (Use appropriate approximations.)

1. Define the following terms

A. Signal phase 
Answers: A signal phase is the signal combinations in a signal controller that controls a group of traffic movement off and on.
B. Signal cycle
Answers: The loop time for a specific traffic phase. The time length between the starting of the phase to it apears again.
C. Max-out
Answers: the maximum flow of the approach
D. Gap-out 
Answers: the flow of approach accounting for the time of green light period
E. Lost time 
Answers:
sources of &quot;lost time&quot; at a signalized intersection are: Start-up lost time, clearance lost time and the yield the pedestrians.



2. A pretimed signal controls a four-way intersection with no turning permitted and zero lost time. The EB and WB traffic volumes are 900 and 800veh/h, and the two movements share the same effective green and effective red portions of cycles. The NB and SB directions also share cycle times, with volumes of 300 and 250 veh/h, respectively. If the saturation flow of all approaches is 1800veh/h, the cycle length is 75 seconds, and D/D/1 queuing applies, determine the effective red and green times that must be allocated to each directions combination (N-S, E-W) to minimize the total vehicle delay and compute the total delay per cycle.

3 AADT (Average Annual Daily Traffic) data on a single intersection between an arterial street (East-West) and a minor street (North-South) has been collected for the current year. Approximate saturation flow rates and collected traffic volumes are given in the table below.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Approach !! Volume (veh/hr) !! Saturation Flow (veh/hr)
|-
| North Bound (NB) || 380 || 1200
|-
| South Bound (SB) || 295 || 1200
|-
| East Bound Left Turn (EBLT) || 260 || 1800
|-
| East Bound (EB) || 1160 || 3000
|-
| West Bound Left Turn (WBLT) || 250 || 1800
|-
| West Bound (WB) || 1050 || 3000
|}

Based on the traffic demand forecast, it is expected demand for the EB and WB directions (including left turn traffic) will increase by 10% each in the next year, and that for the NB and SB directions by 5% each, while the saturated flow rates remain unchanged. The traffic demand has changed so significantly that, as a city traffic engineer, you are asked to develop a new signal design at this intersection for the NEXT YEAR. 

A. The design is required by the city to be a three-phase cycle with leading left turn and no overlap. Draw a sketch of the intersection with arrows indicating the directions of traffic to illustrate your design.

B. The signal at this intersection is traffic-actuated, but you are going to work out a pre-timed signal design in your proposal. Describe the differences between a pre-time signal and a traffic-actuated signal. Under which circumstance a pre-timed signal design can be used for a traffic-actuated signal?

C. You are also asked to develop an alternative design for this intersection because the city received complaints of too much travel delay at this intersection. Based on the calculated cycle length, how are you going to develop this plan?

1. The upstream traffic flow on a road with two lanes in the relevant direction is q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 1800 veh/hr with freeflow speed of v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=90 km/hr. As the result of a crash, one lane is blocked and flow is reduced to q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 900 veh/hr. The density in the queue is k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 70 veh/km. The value of time is $10/hour/vehicle

A. What is the shockwave speed (v&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;)?

B. If this continues for 1 hour, before the lane is cleared, how many vehicles long will the queue be?

C. How much did this crash cost society in terms of delay (travel time in excess of freeflow travel time)?

D. If a freeway service patrol (tow truck service) could clear the crash in 30 minutes instead of an hour, how much should society be willing to pay for that service?

E. If a variable message sign placed 2 km upstream of the crash site instantly (at the moment of the crash) advises travelers about a diversion to a frontage road 1 km upstream of the crash site, how valuable is the freeway service patrol (how much should society be willing to pay under these circumstances)? 

2. A fixed-time ramp meter with unlimited storage space can serve 1 vehicle every 5 seconds. Vehicles approach the back of the ramp queue at 80 km/hr at a rate of 1 vehicle every 4 seconds. The density in the queue is 275 veh/km.

A. What is the wave speed?

B. What is the rate at which the queue grows, in units of vehicles per hour (q)?

1. Deterministic Queueing

A. Draw a typical queuing input-output diagram (Newell Curve) (for one lane) consistent with observed data on a freeway bottleneck with an uncongested capacity of 1800 vehicles per hour per lane and an arrival rate that starts at 1600 vehicles per hour for 15 minutes, rises to 2000 vehicles per hour for 30 minutes, and drops back to 1600 vehicles per hour for the final 15 minutes.

B. Show how to compute delay on the graph. 

C. Show the delay for the 500th vehicle

D. How many vehicles are in the congested region at time the 500th vehicle enters the congested region.

E. How many vehicles are in the congested region at the time the 500th vehicle leaves the front of the queue.


2. You are asked to model a freeway ramp meter with one lane of SOV traffic, which waits at the meter, and an HOV bypass lane that has no delay. Assume vehicles arrive with a random Poisson distribution, and the service rate (the rate at which the light turns green) is stochastic (it is determined by freeway conditions, which from the point of view of travelers on the ramp is random, with a negative exponential distribution). In the peak hour, 800 vehicles arrive at the ramp, of which 100 are high occupancy vehicles with 2 passengers each. The traffic light is timed to turn green on average once every 4 seconds, and is only green long enough to let one vehicle through. Assume the ramp can hold as many vehicles as want to use it.

A. Determine the percent of time the ramp is empty, not empty

B. How much time will each HOV user save?

C. How much time does each SOV user save because the HOV users don’t wait in the queue?

D. Determine the average queue length

E. How often does the queue exceed 15 cars?


3. For the M\/D\/1 queuing model, 

A. What is the arrival distribution?

B. What is the departure distribution?

C. How many servers are there?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The process of determining the appropriate sentence includes the enumerating of aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence and offender. The three broad categories of factors to consider consist of personal circumstances, circumstances of the offence, and circumstances of the proceedings.

As discussed in the Chapter on [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Purpose and Principles of Sentencing|Purpose and Principles of Sentencing]], section 718.2(a) provides that &quot;a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender&quot;.

==Personal circumstances==
===Criminal Record===
A criminal record will be an aggravating factor.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Squires, 2012 NLCA 20, (a criminal record &quot;will be viewed as an aggravating factor leading to a more serious punishment rather than as a factor that tends to limit or lessen punishment.&quot;) &lt;/ref&gt;

A criminal record can show that the offender is a &quot;scofflaw&quot; or is not rehabilitated or &quot;learned from past mistakes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Barrett, 2012 NLCA 46, at para 35 (a “criminal record is often quite relevant on sentencing in that it may show the offender to be a scofflaw, or lead to an inference that he or she has not been rehabilitated or otherwise learned from past mistakes.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

A criminal record can only be considered where the offender had one ''at the time of'' the index offence (this is known as the Coke Rule).&lt;ref&gt;
R v Andrade,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbca/doc/2010/2010nbca62/2010nbca62.html 2010 NBCA 62]&lt;br&gt;
see also R. v. Garcia and Silva, [1970] 1 O.R. 821 at 823, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 124 (C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when a judge sentences for a convicted offence, the judge may take into consideration other criminal acts, and in a limited fashion, such as offences admitted in an agreed statement facts or pending charges.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Garcia and Silva, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 124 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
see also R. v. Edwards [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbx6 2001 CanLII 24105] (ON CA), (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is largely codified in s. 725:
{{quotation|
'''Other offences'''&lt;br&gt;
725. (1) In determining the sentence, a court
:(a) shall consider, if it is possible and appropriate to do so, any other offences of which the offender was found guilty by the same court, and shall determine the sentence to be imposed for each of those offences;
:(b) shall consider, if the Attorney General and the offender consent, any outstanding charges against the offender to which the offender consents to plead guilty and pleads guilty, if the court has jurisdiction to try those charges, and shall determine the sentence to be imposed for each charge unless the court is of the opinion that a separate prosecution for the other offence is necessary in the public interest;
:(b.1) shall consider any outstanding charges against the offender, unless the court is of the opinion that a separate prosecution for one or more of the other offences is necessary in the public interest, subject to the following conditions:
::(i) the Attorney General and the offender consent,
::(ii) the court has jurisdiction to try each charge,
::(iii) each charge has been described in open court,
::(iv) the offender has agreed with the facts asserted in the description of each charge, and
::(v) the offender has acknowledged having committed the offence described in each charge; and
:(c) may consider any facts forming part of the circumstances of the offence that could constitute the basis for a separate charge.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Attorney General’s consent'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.1) For the purpose of paragraphs (1)(b) and (b.1), the Attorney General shall take the public interest into account before consenting.
&lt;P&gt;
'''No further proceedings'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The court shall, on the information or indictment, note
:(a) any outstanding charges considered in determining the sentence under paragraph (1)(b.1), and
:(b) any facts considered in determining the sentence under paragraph (1)(c),&lt;br&gt;
and no further proceedings may be taken with respect to any offence described in those charges or disclosed by those facts unless the conviction for the offence of which the offender has been found guilty is set aside or quashed on appeal.

R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 725; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 158, c. 1 (4th Supp.), s. 18(F); 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 5, s. 31. | [http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec725 CCC]}}

An offence committed while on parole is an aggravating factor. By contrast the added consequences of parole revocation should not be mitigating.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lavallee, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pz1b 2006 ABCA 324] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Age ===
Age is relevant to sentencing as a mitigating factor. A youthful person is seen as having a greater chance of reforming and maturing over time. The courts in certain cases recognize young adults as sometimes foolish, inexperienced, and immature. This diminishes their level of responsibility and moral blameworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;eg see R. v. Kunzig, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpg46 2011 MBPC 81] at 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the principle of restraint is a prominent factor for young offenders.&lt;ref&gt; See: R. v. Demeter and Whitmore (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 379 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Employment===
In general, a good work history is mitigating as it indicates a prior good character.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Johnston,   [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2011/2011nlca56/2011nlca56.html 2011 NLCA 56] at para 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The offender's &quot;opportunity for employment&quot; is an important factor to determine if there is a &quot;reasonable prospect for rehabilitation&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hunt, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpvck#par19 2012 NLCA 5 at 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Effect on Employment and Status===
Loss of professional or social status is not generally a mitigating factor nor is the ability to do a particular job well a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Ambrose, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rqs 2000 ABCA 264] at para. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been said that the &quot;ruin and humiliation&quot; brought upon the accused and his family as well as the loss of professional status can provide denunciation and deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bunn, [http://canlii.ca/t/527l 2000 SCC 9] (CanLII), [2000] 1 SCR 183 at para. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Degree of remorse and attitude===
Remorse is a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Anderson [http://canlii.ca/t/2327s 1992 CanLII 6002] (BC C.A.), (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 523, at p. 535-536, 16 B.C.A.C. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Remorse is demonstrated by the acceptance of responsibility through word or action as well as demonstrated insight into the offender's actions. A lack of remorse, however, does not make for an aggravating factor, but simply does not allow for the mitigating effect of remorse.&lt;ref&gt; See LaForme J.A. in R. v. Kakekagamick, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p52k 2006 CanLII 28549] (ON C.A.), [2006] 81 O.R. (3d) 664, 211 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (C.A.), at para. 73, &quot;[his] failure to accept responsibility for his actions weighs against affording him significant consideration by way of mitigation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts should have &quot;restraint...for persons who spontaneously acknowledge their culpability, have genuine remorse and seek voluntarily to make reparations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Arcand (2011), 499 A.R. 1 (Alta. C.A.) at para 293&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility generally cannot be taken as an aggravating factor, but rather can only be taken as an absence of mitigating factors.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Proulx, [http://canlii.ca/t/527b 2000 SCC 5], [2000] 1 SCR 61 &lt;br&gt;
R v Williams, [2007] OJ No. 1604, [http://canlii.ca/t/1r934 2007 CanLII 13949] (ON SC) at para 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hawkins, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fdkz 2011 NSCA 7] at para. 31 to 34
see also: R v Henry 2002 NSCA 33 at para. 21&lt;br&gt; R v Zeek, 2004 BCCA 42&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Only in exceptional circumstances can the lack of remorse be taken as aggravating.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Hawkins, 2011 NSCA 7 at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Addiction and Substance Abuse===
Substance abuse, by itself, is not ordinarily a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ayorech, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqjzl 2012 ABCA 82] at 10&lt;/ref&gt;
Nor is a history of addiction a mitigating factor to sentence. However, it can suggest a lower level of moral culpability and otherwise good character but for the addiction. It is also helpful for the court to know about to determine whether rehabilitation is a possibility when crafting an appropriate sentence.

Gambling addiction is not generally a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Holmes [http://canlii.ca/t/5s4c 1999 ABCA 228]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Mental Health===
Mental health can be a mitigating factor to sentence even where it is not so severe to remove criminal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Peters [http://canlii.ca/t/1nc5q 2000 NFCA 55], (2000), 194 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 184 (NLCA), (“the mental illness of an offender will often be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing even though it is not of the sort that would establish a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, can be a mitigating factor even when there is no a direct causal connection between the offence and the illness. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ayorech, [2012] A.J. No. 236, at para. 10 (“mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia, can significantly mitigate a sentence, even if the evidence does not disclose that the mental illness was the direct cause of the offence or that it was carried out during a period of delusions, hallucinations, or such.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is also true where the offender was not suffering from delusions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;R v Resler, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrdq 2011 ABCA 167]&lt;br&gt;R v Ayorech, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqjzl 2012 ABCA 82]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sufficient that the illness contributed in some way to the offence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Belcourt, [http://canlii.ca/t/2d2hg 2010 ABCA 319] &lt;/ref&gt; However, the offender's mental health condition is not a factor in sentencing where there is no connection at all between the offence and the condition.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Shahnawaz, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbgv 2000 CanLII 16973], (2000), 149 CCC 97 (Ont.CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment in the community is generally preferred over incarceration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Lundrigan, [2012] NJ No 231 (NLCA) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is less so for serious offences.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. J.M., [2008] N.J. No. 262 (P.C.) &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Taylor, [2012] N.J. No. 251 (P.C.))&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at times mental illness will be considered an aggravating factor that will increase sentence where it is necessary to protect the public from a dangerous persons who has committed a dangerous offence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Lockyer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nc5p 2000 NLCA 59] [2000] NJ No 306 NLCA&lt;/ref&gt;
Mental illness reduces the importance of denunciation and deterrence and increases the importance of treatment. This includes situations where rehabilitation or cure is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;R v Hiltermann, [1993] AJ No 609 (CA) at paras 4-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental illness is often considered a basis to order treatment and supervision over punishment.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Valiquette 1990 CanLII 3048 (QC CA), (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (QCCA) at 331 (“most people understand that the mentally ill require treatment and supervision, not punishment”)&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental illness diminishes the offender’s degree of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;
Ayorech [http://canlii.ca/t/fqjzl 2012 ABCA 82] at 12&lt;br&gt;
Resler [http://canlii.ca/t/flrdq 2011 ABCA 167] at 9-10, 16&lt;br&gt; 
Belcourt [http://canlii.ca/t/2d2hg 2010 ABCA 319]  at 7-8&lt;br&gt; 
R v Muldoon, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pzrv 2006 ABCA 321] at 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

It will also attenuate the relative importance of deterrence and denunication.&lt;REf&gt;
R v Tremblay, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p97b 2006 ABCA 252] at para 7 &lt;Br&gt;
R v Resler, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrdq 2011 ABCA 167] at para 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

An Offenders mental illness can make a jail sentence more severe.&lt;ref&gt;Ayorech at 13  (“Ayorech’s mental disorders have left him vulnerable, such that Dr. Santana opined that he ‘was ill equipped to survive in the prison system.’&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished intellectual capacity however is not a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;
R v H.(M.J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1jjnk 2004 SKCA 171]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive deficit from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) result in limited restraints as well as appreciation of the immorality of their actions. This reduces the impact on deterrence and denunciation and increases the mitigation on sentence.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Ramsay [http://canlii.ca/t/fsl7t 2012 ABCA 257] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Cultural background===
Cultural and customary differences cannot be considered mitigating where it involves offences of violence or offences of a sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tapia (1990) (Ont.CA)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Brown [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6kf 1992 CanLII 2829] (AB CA)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Sympathy and compassion===
The court may allow for a degree of leniency for sympathetic or compassionate offenders.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Voutsis (1989), 47 CCC 451 (Sask. CA)&lt;/ref&gt; This will occasionally be done where the accused can show that his &quot;health is so precarious&quot; that the offender may not survive if they are incarcerated. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Michel 1996, 133 WAC 237 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply poor health or age is not usually a reason on its own.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Shah, [http://canlii.ca/t/1dcv9 1994 CanLII 1290] (1994), 94 CCC 45 (BCCA)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Maczynski (1997), 120 CCC 221, [http://canlii.ca/t/1dzbw 1997 CanLII 2491]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. FDM (1995), 29 WBC 148 (AltaCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not however a factor to consider the risk of harm to an individual while in custody.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Campbell (1978), NSCA&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Effect on Immigration===

Section 64 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states:
{{quotation|
64(1) '''No appeal for inadmissibility'''&lt;br&gt;
No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality.
&lt;P&gt;
64(2) '''Serious criminality'''&lt;br&gt;
For the purpose of subsection (1), serious criminality must be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least two years.
| [http://canlii.ca/t/7vwq IRPA]
}}

The risk of deportation can be a factor to consider sentencing. &lt;ref&gt;
R v Hamilton [http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9 2004 CanLII 5549] (ON CA), (2004), 72 OR (3d) 1 at para 156, 186 CCC (3d) 129 (CA)[http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9#par156 para 159]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Barkza,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2011/2011abca273/2011abca273.html 2011 ABCA 273]&lt;br&gt;
R v Dhura , 2011 ABCA 165 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2011/2011abca165/2011abca165.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Koc, [http://canlii.ca/t/1x3vx 2008 NLTD 97] [2008] N.J. No. 161 (N.L.S.C.T.D.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It must be weighed and considered with all other factors and circumstances of the case.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. B.R.C., [2010] O.J. No. 3571 (Ont. C.A.) at 6&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Melo (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 510 at p. 516
&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should not bring the sentence out of the appropriate range.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Morgan, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nt/ntca/doc/2008/2008nwtca12/2008nwtca12.html 2008 NWTCA 12]&lt;br&gt;
R v Belenky, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2010/2010abca98/2010abca98.html 2010 ABCA 98] at para. 20: (&quot;the collateral consequence of deportation can be given at most very limited weight. It cannot by itself remove a sentence from what would otherwise be the appropriate range. At most it can serve to move the sentence a small amount, nothing more.&quot;) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact on the ability to get a VISA to places like the US may influence the court to consider an absolute discharge over a conditional discharge due to the treatment of probation to immigration.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Dzabic, [http://canlii.ca/t/218bd 2008 CanLII 53860] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of an offender's immigration status on the likelihood of day parole is not a factor in sentence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Razmara, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpkgt 2012 ONCA 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Aboriginal background===
See [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Aboriginal Principles and Factors]]

{{reflist|2}}

==Circumstances of the Offence==

===Degree of Planning===
A greater degree of planning increases the moral culpability of the offender. Where the offence involved significant preparatory work it suggests that the offender is of bad character due to time on the commission of an offence. The court is more likely to conclude the person is a &quot;career criminal&quot;.

Closely related to this is the degree of sophistication of the offence. An offender with a great deal of intelligence and drive is more culpable due to the ability to have insight into their conduct including the harm that would result from it.

===Duration of the Offence===
The duration of the offence is a useful measure of the offender's culpability. An offence that is ongoing for a period of time requires that the accused continuously decided to continue in a criminal endeavour. As they continue to decided to commit the offence their responsibility for the outcome increases.

Related to this, it is a factor to consider whether the offender stopped the offence by their own accord due to a decision to cease criminal activity or whether they merely stopped because they have achieved their goal or were caught in the act.

===Age of the Offence===
Most often seen in the context of historical sexual assault offences, the “antiquity of the offence is not usually a mitigating feature”
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. R. (A.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1npk9 1994 CanLII 4524] (MB CA), [1994] 4 W.W.R. 620 (Man. C.A.), &lt;/ref&gt; However, “the offender may be entitled to a somewhat reduced sentence if he has led an exemplary life during the intervening years and demonstrates genuine remorse.  Such circumstances would obviate the need for individual deterrence and time for rehabilitation.”&lt;ref&gt;R v RA [http://canlii.ca/t/1npk9 1994 CanLII 4524] at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Role in Offence===
The accused's role in the offence will influence the penalty. Typically the greater and more culpable a role the accused played, the greater the penalty. This is particularly the case where the party has less autonomy, control, or awareness of the circumstances. 

A &quot;look out&quot; or &quot;driver&quot; may be seen as less serious than those who participated in the offence itself.

===Breach of Trust===
Where an offender was able to commit an offence by taking advantage of their position of trust, this factor will be treated as aggravating.

Where there is a breach of the public's trust it will be treated as aggravating beyond private breach of trust.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gill, [http://canlii.ca/t/5bql 2003 BCCA 208]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Lecourt [http://canlii.ca/t/1lp59 2005 QCCA 845]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Harm or Risk of Harm on Victim===
Consideration of the harm or risk of harm to a victim includes consideration of the extent of violence used.

A vulnerable victim will typically be treated as an aggravating factor. A child victim or person with physical or mental disabilities will be considered particularly aggravating.

===Victim Under 18===
Section 718.01 requires that &quot;[w]hen a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.&quot;  

In relation to s.718.01, the Alberta Court of Appeal has stated that it &quot;has always been the position of this court in dealing with crimes against defenseless children that a strong response was warranted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v Nickle, 2012 ABCA 158 (CanLII) at para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Public abhorrence of type of crime===
The public's abhorrence of the type of crime is a factor that enhances the penalties in sentence. Through the principle of denunciation, the courts have an obligation to express the abhorrence of the public of a particular offence such a offences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. W.H.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1x3wq 1994 CanLII 7583] (NS SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevalence of this type of crime in the community ===

===Degree of cooperation with Police===

===State Misconduct===
A sentence may “be reduced in light of state misconduct even when the incidents complained of do not rise to the level of a Charter breach.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2010/2010scc6/2010scc6.html#par53]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

====Police Misconduct====
Police misconduct during an investigation can play a factor in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pigeon [http://canlii.ca/t/1d9hn 1992 CanLII 869] (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; 
This includes having a mitigating factor where an accused's Charter rights have been breached.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, conduct amounting to basic violation of a procedural right under the charter will not usually result in a reduction where the breach does not invoke s. 24(1) of the Charter. &lt;ref&gt;
eg. R. v. Charanek, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpcnj 2011 ABPC 374] &lt;/ref&gt;

In exceptional cases, the charges may be stayed.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2010/2010onca471/2010onca471.html 2010 ONCA 471]
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Use of Force by Peace Officers'''&lt;br&gt;

Idem&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a person is required or authorized by law to execute a process or to carry out a sentence, that person or any person who assists him is, if that person acts in good faith, justified in executing the process or in carrying out the sentence notwithstanding that the process or sentence is defective or that it was issued or imposed without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.
&lt;P&gt;
When not protected&lt;BR&gt;
(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.
&lt;P&gt;
When protected&lt;br&gt;
(4) A peace officer, and every person lawfully assisting the peace officer, is justified in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to a person to be arrested, if
:(a) the peace officer is proceeding lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, the person to be arrested;
:(b) the offence for which the person is to be arrested is one for which that person may be arrested without warrant;
:(c) the person to be arrested takes flight to avoid arrest;
:(d) the peace officer or other person using the force believes on reasonable grounds that the force is necessary for the purpose of protecting the peace officer, the person lawfully assisting the peace officer or any other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm; and
:(e) the flight cannot be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 25; 1994, c. 12, s. 1.
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec25]
}}

Where a peace officer uses force that is not covered by s.25, a possible violation of the accused’s section 7 Charter rights arises.&lt;reF&gt;Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that “everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a violation of the “security of the person” in the context of a criminal prosecution where there is “state interference with bodily integrity and serious state-imposed psychological stress”&lt;ref&gt;R v Morgentaler, [1988] 1 SCR 30, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftjt 1988 CanLII 90] &lt;/ref&gt;

Peace officers are expected to use force to effect an arrest or prevent flight from custody. This power is constrained by proportionality, necessity, and reasonableness.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6] at 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of force under s.25(3) is determined on a subjective and objective basis.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier v Greave, [2001] OJ No. 634 (ONSC) at 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Police should not be judged on a standard of perfection. It should be expected that they will be reacting quickly in emergency situations.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6] at 35&lt;/ref&gt; 

R. v. Markowska, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jhvq 2004 ONCJ 332] -- police executed search warrant of massage parlour with weapons drawn. court found this to be egregious and unjustified.

===Uncharged Criminal Conduct===
Offenders are only sentenced “in respect of crimes for which they have been specifically charged and of which they have been validly convicted.”&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Larche, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xv 2006 SCC 56], [2006] 2 S.C.R. 762&lt;/ref&gt;


Prior uncharged conduct cannot be used as an aggravating factor, however, can be relevant to sentencing as it shows character and background.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. B.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/20swc 2008 ONCA 645] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, under section [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec725 725(1)(d)], &quot;In determining the sentence, a court ... (c) may consider any facts forming part of the circumstances of the offence that could constitute the basis for a separate charge.&quot;

An offender cannot be punished for unproven acts.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 368 SCR 2&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Lees, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tx81 1979 CanLII 43] (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 749 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Circumstances of the Proceedings==
=== Guilty Plea ===
A guilty plea is a mitigating factor in a number of respects. It is evidence of remorse &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cardiner (1982) 68 CCC 477 (SCC)&lt;br&gt; 
Wisniewski, (1975) 29 CRNS 342 (Ont.)&lt;/ref&gt;, it saves the justice system resources, and it excuses victims from the stress of having to testify. The offender is not entitled to a sentence reduction simply for pleading guilty but rather it is within the discretion of the judge to account for a guilty plea in sentencing.
 
A lack of guilty plea is not an aggravating factor. However, related to a lack of a guilty plea, if the accused was convicted after trial where testimony of the accused was determined to be false, the judge may consider that as aggravating.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Vickers (1998), (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The amount of credit given for a guilty plea it not fixed as it can mitigate in several different ways. It has been suggested however that it can often lead to a reduction of sentence by one-third.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Conlon, 2011 ABPC 259
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Bail conditions===
Strict bail conditions are not treated as equivalent to pre-trial detention, and so remand credit is not applicable for strict bail conditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Panday, [http://canlii.ca/t/1svfg 2007 ONCA 598]&lt;/ref&gt; The court may consider the bail conditions that the offender up to the date of sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Downes, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2006/2006canlii3957/2006canlii3957.html 2006 CanLII 3957] (ON CA) at 23&lt;/ref&gt; If the individual was under house arrest conditions for bail, this may be accounted as a reason to reduce the sentence as the house arrest may have a punitive element to it.  This is a discretionary, however, and will usually needed to be justified by showing that the offender's circumstances were particularly tough beyond the average person.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Knockwood  [http://canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2009/2009nsca98/2009nsca98.html 2009 NSCA 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictive bail conditions should be treated flexibly. The amount of credit, if any, is in the discretion of the trial judge to determine.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Downes, [2006] O.J. No. 555 (C.A.) at para. 36 (“a trial judge faced with an offender who has spent time on bail under house arrest should adopt a flexible approach, . . . the amount of credit and the manner in which it is to be taken into account as a mitigating factor is a matter for the trial judge.”) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario, the following guidelines were suggested in R v Downes 2006 CanLII 3957 (ONCA)&lt;ref&gt;
R v Downes, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mkm6 2006 CanLII 3957] (ONCA) at para 37; R v Ijam, [http://canlii.ca/t/1svv8 2007 ONCA 597] at 63&lt;/ref&gt;:
::*Time spent on stringent pre-sentence bail conditions, especially house arrest, is a relevant mitigating factor.
::*As such, the trial judge must consider the time spent on bail under house arrest in determining the length of sentence.
::*The failure of the trial judge to explain why time spent on bail under house arrest has not been taken into account is an error in principle.
::*The amount of credit to be given for time spent on bail under house arrest is within the discretion of the trial judge and there is no formula that the judge is required to apply.
::*The amount of credit will depend upon a number of factors including, the length of time spent on bail under house arrest; the stringency of the conditions; the impact on the offender’s liberty; the ability of the offender to carry on normal relationships, employment and activity.
::*Where the offender asks the trial judge to take pre-sentence bail conditions into account, the offender should supply the judge with information as to the impact of the conditions.  If there is a dispute as to the impact of the conditions, the onus is on the offender to establish those facts on a balance of probabilities in accordance with s. 724(3) of the Criminal Code.


{{reflist|2}}

===Delay===
Delay between the date of the offence and sentence is not reason for mitigation. If the delay is due to flight of the accused from the jurisdiction he is not entitled to any benefit from the passage of time. &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Jansons,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/yk/ykca/doc/2008/2008ykca15/2008ykca15.html 2008 YKCA 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dated offences, such as historical [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Sexual Assault|sexual assault]], do not warrant a significant reduction on penalty simply due to the time that has passed since the offence as the magnitude of the offence and degree of culpability remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Archibald [http://canlii.ca/t/frv7l 2012 ABCA 202] (CanLII) at para. 13
&lt;/ref&gt;

On serious offences, the passage of time between the offence and sentence does not reduce the need for denunciation or deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Partridge, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m6lq 2005 NSCA 159] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors in delay to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Critton, [2002] O.J. No. 2594 (ONSC) per Hill, J at para. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
# the effect of delay on sentencing is a case‑specific inquiry
# deliberate acts to evade detection by the authorities, whether flight or contribution to delayed complaint tend to weigh against assigning mitigating impact to the fact of delay
# reform and rehabilitation during the intervening period tend to eliminate the prospect of recidivism and to nullify the need for specific deterrence to be reflected in the court's disposition
# certain very serious crimes require sentences with measures of general deterrence and denunciation regardless of the offender's lengthy crime‑free existence subsequent to the crime(s)
# objectively speaking, taking into account delay, the court's disposition should not be seen as a reward or benefit eliminating or depreciating the concept of proportionate punishment.

===Pre-trial custody===

{{quotation|
719.&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Determination of sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
:(3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.
&lt;p&gt;
:(3.1) Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the person was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8).
&lt;p&gt;'''Reasons'''
:(3.2) The court shall give reasons for any credit granted and shall cause those reasons to be stated in the record.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec719 CCC]
}}

Section 719(3.1) consists of amendments from 2010 where the practice of giving 2:1 credits was significantly limited. Certain judges have given 1.5:1 credit where warranted for loss of remission.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnson,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2011/2011oncj77/2011oncj77.html 2011 ONCJ 77]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Dann,  [http://canlii.org/en/ns/nspc/doc/2011/2011nspc22/2011nspc22.html 2011 NSPC 22]
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The judge cannot deny pre-trial custody credit to a sentence simply because of the nature his record.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Crawford,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2010/2010abca290/2010abca290.html 2010 ABCA 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Civil Liability===

Where the offender is likely to face substantial civil liability and he is not otherwise impecunious, then this should be a factor in sentence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Stone, [http://canlii.ca/t/4z2g 2001 BCCA 728] at 32-35&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sadler, [http://canlii.ca/t/25j6c 2009 BCCA 386] at 23-29&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Prohibited factors==
It is generally considered improper to consider factors such as:
* comments of the public or media
* past acquittal or pardons
* conduct of defence counsel
* character of the victim or other parties
* risk of harm while incarcerated

      <text xml:space="preserve">The case begins with the initial contact with the client. Either by phone or in person, the client will wish to have representation regarding an outstanding criminal matter.

The initial period is where the lawyer must attempt to gain as much information about the circumstances as possible. The lawyer will wish to first learn the name and location of the client, the charges laid, the name of the arresting officer, and the date and location that the charges will be heard.

== Establishing the solicitor-client relationship ==

During the initial meeting, the lawyer should explain the meaning of solicitor-client privilege, and how the contents of the meeting are private and cannot be revealed by the lawyer, even if he is brought before a judge to testify. The lawyer may only reveal contents of the meeting with the permission of the client.

=== Controlling Ground Rules ===
It must be made clear that the lawyer controls the proceedings and ''not'' the client. Many junior lawyers make the mistake of differing too many aspects of the case to the client. The lawyer is not a mouthpiece for the client. The lawyer has the exclusive choice of which witnesses to call except in the case of the Defendant testifying.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brown (CA 2055, Vancouver Registry, October 18, 1984), Nemetz C.J.B.C. and Craig J.A. agreeing : &quot;An accused person does not have the right to dictate to his counsel as to how the case for the defence is to be presented.  The exception to this rule is that the accused has the right to testify and cannot be prevented from testifying by his counsel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The key decisions of the client are the choice of plea, the election of court, and the choice to testify in their own defence. The lawyer may only provide advice with respect to each decision, but cannot make the decision for the client.

=== General Advice and Instructions ===
The lawyer in most cases should advise the client the following:
* not to discuss the case with anyone as they may questioned and the information given could be used against them in trial
* not to attempt to contact potential crown witnesses as it may come out at trial and may result in further criminal charges for interfering with justice system participants
* obtain the names and contact information of potential witnesses that may be useful for the defence's case

== Summary of the case ==

=== Client's background ===

The lawyer should obtain basic background information, including:
# age
# marital status
# living arrangement
# education
# occupation
# work history
# physical and mental health history
# addiction and counselling history
# criminal record

=== Charges ===
It is important to identify the charges that have been laid against the client. Once known, the lawyer should determine the factual elements that need to be proven by the Crown attorney to make out the offence.

=== Disclosure ===
The lawyer should review the disclosure before meeting to discuss the client's case. The client may be provided with a copy for their review prior to obtaining an outline of events from them. 

It is particularly important to review any statement made by the client to the police.

=== Summary of events ===

From a defence lawyer's perspective, it is important to get the client's version of events as soon as possible. The client will be in the best position to provide a full summary earlier on in the proceedings than they will at a later point in the proceedings. This can be done by way of client interview in the office. The lawyer may generate a statement by taking notes or dictating summary of the interview or by recording the whole interview for transcription. 

Where the client is sophisticated enough and the resources of firm is limited, it may be beneficial to have the client write out the incident on their own. 

In all circumstances, the lawyer must be mindful that if the client or witness will be using the statement to refresh their memory in court, the document may need to be authenticated, and the other side will be entitled to review it and cross-examine on it. As such, it is often better to have a third party record the statement, and that the circumstances of the creation of the statement be carefully noted.

=== Possible penalties ===
At some early stage it is essential to be clear to the client what are the possible penalties for the charges. This would likely include notifying the client of the maximum penalties (including possible crown election), but most importantly the ''likley'' penalties involved. 

This can be a difficult issue to handle. Many clients want assurances on particular outcomes, especially if there is a prospect of the client going to jail. However, it is always hazardous to guarantee an outcome.

==Choice of Trial (Judge or Jury)==
The choice of mode of trial is critical for defence counsel and will have a significant effect on how the trial is performed. There is no hard and fast rules to when to chose a judge and jury trial. 

Factors that are often considered are as follows:
* the accused's presentation
* whether the accused will testify
* whether the trial relies on technical and legal arguments
* whether there is a strong emotional appeal for the defence
* whether the case is potentially inflammatory or distasteful
* whether the crown witnesses have a strong emotional appeal
* the strength and complexity of the defence's case
* the strength and complexity of the crown's case
* who the judge is
* who the opposing counsel is

A bit too Wikipedia-ish. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:25, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
:&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''&lt;/s&gt; That's because it was transwikied from Wikipedia ([[Transwiki:Peak flow meter]]).  Just needs some work. Better to have poorly formatted information than none at all. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:21, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
::But that Medical Equipment book doesn't even exist. It contains only [[Transwiki:Automated external defibrillator]] and this page. Does that make it qualify for deletion? If there is a book about asthma though it could be moved there.

&lt;s&gt;:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' it was Transwikied for a reason. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 13:13, 15 May 2010 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
::There are actually quite a few pages in the Transwiki namespace that had been requested years ago but were never used.

::: There is one section in our version of the page that was deemed out of scope at WP. See [[w:Talk:Peak_flow_meter#Usage section]]. In a way this situation is very similar to the &quot;History of Edmeston&quot; above (except that there is less content and much less duplicated content). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 13:45, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

{{comment}} I came across this page when I did my big sweep of all pages to find books that lacked alphabetical tags.  It is still on a list on my user page with some other pages that appear to be part of books, but the books do not exist.  The page still exists on wikipedia, the reason it was transwikied here all those years ago was to preserve the section on usage.  This section has never re-appeared on wikipedia.  In the current case this is really about a paragraph, and maybe doesn't represent a lot of work? I don't know.  I only mention it because this idea might apply to other transwikied pages.  They may contain sections/information that was later taken out of the wikipedia page, even though the corresponding wikipedia pages have sinced continued to develop to much better encyclopedia articles. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:56, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
:I personally would not want Wikibooks to become a repository for content Wikipedia doesn't want, even if it's not textbook material. That's why I haven't been handling most of the &quot;copy to wikibooks&quot; tagged articles at Wikipedia, as they seem to be tagged in the sense of &quot;let's push this over to Wikibooks&quot;, similar to sweeping dirt under the rug. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:41, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
::To Duplode: Yes it violates [[:w:WP:INDISCRIMINATE]], as well as some others in [[:w:WP:NOT]]. However, does that mean it has to come to Wikibooks? Like Adrignola said, doing so is like (oh well, I'll use a Chinese phrase) sweeping your snow to your neighbour's house. That's not good at all; in fact, I doubt if those who tagged for Wikibooks transwiki articles know the project scope of WB. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 00:13, 16 May 2010 (UTC)
::: I'd argue the violation at WP was more specific, namely [[w:WP:NOTMANUAL]]. It costs nothing to note that [[w:WP:NOTTEXTBOOK]] points to the same policy item, and that [[WB:WIW]] does include manuals in project scope. That observation being made, I must concede I did not consider the point that, ideally, editors should only request WP&gt;&gt;WB transferences if they have some plan on what to do with the imported pages. As the chances of a reasonable book/manual/guide on &quot;Medical Equipment&quot; blossoming out of this single section are indeed very small, ''maybe'' the dirt/rug and snow/frontyard considerations provide grounds for deletion in this case. Straying a bit away from the immediate subject, however, this line of reasoning leads me to another thought: should we apply the same principles next time any of us casually suggests a Transwiki to Wikiversity as a RfD outcome? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 02:07, 16 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: I don't mind starting automated RfD on pages that are moved from Wikipedia, that in themselves seem not to be  fit to be a stub for future evolution here (it would provide some more visibility to that content). Wikipedia should preserve valid content, as we do, when we move content that seems to be in line with the scope of other projects (like Wikiversity). It is up to the destination project to see if the content is usable or not at the destination.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:35, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' Not an exact copy of the original material, valid project regarding WIW definition. I would like a reference to the original source material at Wikisource to be added (and vice versa).&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:38, 16 May 2010 (UTC)
::Might make me sound stupid, but what do you mean by 'I would like a reference to the original source material at Wikisource to be added'? Also, if this is kept, it should be moved, as there is no medical equipment book.

{{del}} After some thought I have decided that the page that is written is not suitable as neither a book nor a manual.  The page was transwikied here in order to save the information about its useage, but the information given on this page is known to anyone familiar with the device, and can readily be found by a google search.  Given the existing page on wikipedia, it would be easier to write a better quality page from a fresh transwiki, plus a few sentences.  Provided of course at some point there is a book on medical equipment, and this device falls under its scope.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:57, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

Switched my position to [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' after considering the arguments posted here and the fact that this single page is probably not a valid or useful stub to &quot;Medical Equipment&quot; --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 16:49, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose and Objectives==

It is often said that the purpose of the direct examination is to hear from the witness, while the purpose of the cross examination is to hear from the lawyer. That is, a lawyer should never cross examine with a view to learning information, but rather have the witness confirm information that is already known by the lawyer. That is why the main cross-examiner's tool is the leading question. The open question seeks facts while the closed question provides facts.

To enumerate it briefly, the purpose of cross examine is to:
# attack the witnesses' credibility and reliability, 
# bring out evidence that is helpful to the case and 
# bring out evidence that is harmful to the opponent's case.

This is accomplished by canvasing issues such as:
# Capacity to observe, recollect and recall
# Reliability
# Character
# Bias

In Munkman, The Technique of Advocacy (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1986), three techniques of cross-examination are outlined:
# confrontation: confront the witness with facts that they cannot deny which assist your case, such as inconsistencies in the witnesses statements
# probing: carefully exploring the details of their story to find flaws;
# insinuation: bringing out a different version of the evidence-in-chief by bringing up facts and possibilities

The key to a good cross examination involves knowledge of your theory of the case and the evidence, control of the witnesses, and control of oneself.

==Preparation==
Every book discussing cross-examination focuses on the need for thorough preparation. 

First, the most essential step of preparation is knowing the case inside-and-out. This would mean knowing what each witness has said in the past, such as prior statements, and having a good understanding of what they may say in court.

Second, the advocate must have a mastery of the parties theory of the case. It is the touchstone that should guide all the questions and should be the reference anytime the proceedings go off track or something unexpected occurs.

===Review evidence===
Investigate the central witnesses for the following:

# criminal record
# report of prior immoral acts
# other signs of bad character or reputation
# is the testimony potentially inconsistent with prior statements
# are there reasons for bias or prejudice against the accused
# does the witness have a relationship with an adverse party?
# is there a motive to falsify their testimony?
# are there physical/mental disabilities that may affect their testimony?
# other documents or witnesses that may contradict their testimony?
# are any facts likely improbable due to other known facts?


===Cross examination outline===
As part of the preparation of a Trial Book, you should be preparing an outline of your cross-examination. An examiner should always have a written-out list of goals for the examination, and how those goals can be reached. But the advocate should ''never'' be reading the questions to the witness.



===During direct examination===
By the time the direct examination of the witness is occurring you should have already prepared your cross-examination. The frequent practice is to use the time to record direct the direct examination. This is useful in that you can cite directly from testimony during argument and can have a written record of the actual evidence.

There is some who view that writing out the direct evidence is counter-productive. Rather, you should only take notes on points for your cross-examination. It is suggested that you have it recorded by someone else. This, however, is not always practical to  counsel who are conducting the trial on their own. However, a well-prepared trial will unlikely lead to new information coming from the witness's direct evidence. 

This time, instead, should be used to assess the witness. The witness should be observed for how they react to pressure; verbal and physical cues suggesting the truth. Keep an eye on the judge's reaction to the witness as well. This should be used to determine the approach in cross-examination.

Consider any statements that deviate from prioer statements as well as any assumptions or misstatements.

==Tools of Examination==

===Looping===
A looping question is one where a useful fact is repeated within multiple questions. In each iteration, new information is sought. This technique is intended to create emphasis on particular facts through repetition.

===Impeachment===

==Types of Witnesses==

===Honest Witness===
Ironically, the honest witness can be the most undesirable witness for cross-examination. That is, because none of the regular methods of showing biases or cognitive errors will work. 

This type of witness is generally trying to be helpful. The simpler approach would be a constructive cross which is aimed at get out as many useful positive facts out from the witness as possible. 

A destructive cross is more difficult. The most effective approach is to attempt to have the witness honestly admit to deficits in their observations. An honest witness is readily prepared to admit to any risks of error or lack of knowledge they may have had.

===Forgetful Witness===

When a witness states that they &quot;don't recall&quot;, consider whether it was something that they should have been remembered and taken note of. In the cross, establish that the fact forgotten is one that was ''important'' to remember inferring that they are not reliable due to their failure to remember.

===Evasive Witness===

===Argumentative Witness===

===Ignorant or Stubborn Witness=== 
These witnesses are those who have come to their own conclusions with limited facts. They are highly confident in their position and will not budge from it. They are not necessarily lying or biased, but rather have strong personal animus against any challenges to their beliefs.

The approach to the cross of these witnesses is to attack the basis of their conclusions. By picking out the elements that make up their conclusion, eventually they will be put into a position of defending unsupported grounds. Often this involves simply going through all their observations that they had, as well as what they did not know at the time, that lead them to their conclusion.

===Biased Witnesses===
Biased witnesses are those who have some interest in the outcomes of the trial. They may be an accused, a victim, have a close connection to one of them, or they may have some external interests that are met by not giving a fair and careful recitation of their recollection.

The most obvious approach is to bring out these biases to show the trier of fact the motive the witness has to not give full and frank evidence.

===Lying Witness===
A destructive cross can be highly effective against a lying witness. 

These witnesses will invent a story that best supports their desired outcome. They will attempt to craft a story that matches as much of the evidence beyond dispute as possible. Invariably they cannot craft a story to cover all this evidence and consequently there will be basis of impeachment within the evidence. Where they are successful in covering all undisputable evidence they are often left in a position where their story has been stretched to fit the other facts to a point of losing much of the logic and reasonableness of their story.

===Child Witness===

===Police Officers===
Police officers are professional testifiers and so their evidence will almost always be well organized. They will usually give a lot of information without much prompting from the prosecution and are not shaken or confused easily. 

Due to their skill in giving evidence to enhance the prosecutions' case, it is often best to focus on what they did not observe or what they observed but did not take notes on.

'''Adding new facts to the case'''&lt;br&gt;
Officer's will often give testimony to essential facts that was not in any of the disclosure notes or reports.  Counsel should attempt to restrict the testimony back to what was written out. When questioning on this, the officer will often dismiss this omission by saying that the notes were not intended to include everything but were only a &quot;summary&quot;. 

The problem with this is that it could permit officers add additional evidence whenever they want including on redirect where cross-examination may not be possible.

Respond to this by questioning the officer on the importance of having the questions as complete and accurate as possible.

'''Changing facts of the case'''&lt;br&gt;
When the officer changes or deviates from the story, this change must be attacked for backpedaling. The inference to be drawn it that the officer realized that there was damaging information in the report and so was attempting to undo it. An ethical prosecutor should be equally disapproving of this change but this is not always the case.

'''Dodging questions'''&lt;br&gt;
If the officer answers that they &quot;can't speculate&quot; to a question of what they would have done if &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; happened, you must correct him. He is not speculating if he is talking about what he would have done. It is only speculation if it concerns what someone ''else'' would have done in the circumstances. Instead, ask him what he has done on prior occasions that were similar to the circumstances proposed.

===Mentally Ill===


===Informers and Accomplices===

==General Techniques==
A key skill in cross-examination is listening. There are frequently used statements made by witnesses that can often be used to the examiner's advantage and should be attacked when heard.

'''Attack speculation'''&lt;br&gt;
A witness may hedge their statements by stating &quot;it seems&quot;, &quot;I think&quot;, &quot;I suppose&quot;, &quot;I guess&quot;. This can be brought out as speculation which is reduces the weight of the evidence or renders it inadmissible.

'''Attack probabilities'''&lt;br&gt;
A witness will often state that something is &quot;possible&quot; rather than probable to any specific degree. This can be favourable or undesirable depending on the matter referred to. Lock them into greater certainty if you want more of a commitment or else leave it if you intend to argue that the statement should be given little weight.

'''Attack Use of absolutism'''&lt;br&gt;
When a witness says &quot;always&quot; and &quot;never&quot; consider whether they are overselling their position. When a biased witness or expert witness uses this language they can be made to show the witness is an advocate for the other side. 

'''Evading the Question'''&lt;br&gt;
Often the witness will not answer the question and argue with the question or discuss something else. Do not argue with them or else you will lose control of the witness. Re-direct the witness to the question by stating &quot;That means yes?&quot; or &quot;That means no?&quot;

'''Empty Cross-examinations'''&lt;br&gt;
There is the rare time where there is nothing to ask of a particular witness and for optics to the client or the jury it would be harmful to the case to not ask the witness anything. In such situations, questions can cover a number of issues

# who approached them to be a witness 
# who did he talk to about their evidence (when, where, with who)
# made any prior statements (notes, written statments, etc)
# preparation for testifying (read over documents, prior statements, transcripts)
# being paid to attend
# is familiar with any of the parties or witnesses
# any benefit in the outcome of the case
# subpoenaed or came on their own

==Do's and Don't of Cross Examination==

'''Do'''&lt;br&gt;
# phrase the question to elicit one piece of information at a time 
# Do phrase your questions as short as possible
# Do keep your language simple

'''Don't'''&lt;br&gt;
# Don't ask questions you don't know the answer to
# Don't cross on trivial matters that the judge likely is not interested in
# Don't ask questions that covers the direct evidence
# don't argue with the witness
# don't allow the witness to explain themselves
# ask a witness why another witness is lying (R. v. Ellard (2003), 173 CCC 28 (BCCA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2003/2003bcca68/2003bcca68.html])

|long description=Bsoft is a collection of programs and a platform for development of software for image and molecular processing in structural biology. Problems in structural biology are approached with a highly modular design, allowing fast development of new algorithms without the burden of issues such as file I/O. It provides an easily accessible interface, a resource that can be and has been used in other packages. Several workflows such as for single particle analysis and tomography are supported with parameter exchange as well as the ability to do distributed processing across heterogeneous clusters of computers. Several tools are available for modeling structures as atomic coordinates or larger scale models for the interpretation of large molecular complexes such as viruses and sub-cellular organelles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, before we start this book, let's give you a taste of how cool and weird bugs are. Let's start with these...

* Exploding termites are appropriately named &amp;mdash; when they sense attackers, they guard their territory and splatter them with their insides.
* Fairyflies are the smallest insects in the world &amp;mdash; just 0.02 centimetres &amp;mdash; that's as small as the tip of a needle!  And besides being so tiny, they insert their eggs into eggs of other insects, by using their sting.  So they're not even flies, but a kind of wasp.
* When it feels attacked, one kind of South African cockroach stands on its head and hisses.
* One kind of caterpillar, the Polyphemus moth caterpillar, can eat over 86,000 times its weight before turning into a moth.
* Scuttle flies can eat shoe polish and paint.
* If you weighed all the insects in the world, they'd be heavier than all other animals put together.

Now it's time to delve deeper into the weird world of barmy bugs and other irksome insects. Have fun!

==Reply to email==
Thanks for the welcome !   Hey I am having a problem with the correct tagging of images for my wikibook.  There were flagged as &quot;You've uploaded a derivative work&quot; message. The image was showing how-to installation of an Open Source Application (we developed) using Open Source Software called Palo by Jedox (downloadable for free).   Image was screen shot showing steps how to download and correctly install on user's computer.  Can You Help ??

:I will do my best.  The feeling is (I think) that since you were not the one to design the interface, buttons, etc then images of the software are actually derived from the the work of the programmers.  Though screen shots of free software are allowed.  When uploading a file at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Upload commons]  choose the sixth bullet &quot;It is a free software screenshot&quot;.  On the next page choose &quot;GNU General Public License (GPL)&quot;, I am trusting wikipedia to get the license correct on this.  This should get the correct tag put on the image.  Once you upload one file and see what the correct tag looks like you can copy it to the &quot;edit this page&quot; just as you can here and copy the code and copy it to the other images you've uploaded.  Updating appropriately of course.  But the people at commons might be more helpful than I. You can try asking at their [[Commons:Village pump|Village pump]].

Problems in structural biology are approached with a highly modular design, allowing fast development of new algorithms without the burden of issues such as file I/O. It provides an easily accessible interface, a resource that can be and has been used in other packages. Several workflows such as for single particle analysis and tomography are supported with parameter exchange as well as the ability to do distributed processing across heterogeneous clusters of computers. Several tools are available for modeling structures as atomic coordinates or larger scale models for the interpretation of large molecular complexes such as viruses and sub-cellular organelles.

|long description=EMAN2 is a software suite for scientific image processing, with a particular focus on TEM and single particle analysis. New tools are being added to support other specialties such as IHRSR (helical processing in real-space), RCT (random conical tilt) and single particle cryoET. It is a complete refactoring of the original EMAN suite. EMAN2 has a tiered strucutre with an easy to use workflow interface at the top, followed by high-level command line programs, low level command line programs, Python scripting support and core C++ libraries. All user programs including the GUIs are written in Python, so they may be customized or modified without even downloading the (freely available) source. The GUI includes widgets for 3-D display (isosurface, volume rendering and slices), single 2-D images, multiple 2-D images, 2-D plots and 3-D plots. The core library consists of several hundred image processing routines, as well as objects for conversion between orientation conventions and various data formats. It is a fully modular system, meaning newly added algorithms (for example a new filter, or a new 3-D reconstruction routine) automatically and immediately appear in all GUI's and command-line programs.

|long description=A suite of scientific image processing tools aimed primarily at single particle reconstruction. This is a technique for determining the 3-D structure of a molecule or macromolecular assembly from thousands to hundreds of thousands of noisy images of individual molecules, generally collected on a transmission electron microscope. EMAN's focus is on providing state of the art single particle reconstruction methods automated to the greatest extent possible. The goal is to permit even novice users to be able to reconstruct macromolecular structures with high veracity and at high resolution. It also has a variety of tools for more generic image processing, useful for electron tomography, 2-D crystallography and helical reconstructions. EMAN consists of a ~100,000 line C++ library with bindings to the popular Python programming language. It offers literally hundreds of different scientific image processing algorithms including Fourier processing, real-space filters, 3-D reconstruction, projection, etc. In EMAN2, all user-level programs, including GUI programs, are written in Python, permitting the advanced user to easily customize aspects of the package. EMAN is funded by the [http://www.nigms.nih.gov/ NIGMS] through grant R01GM080139.

Originally developed for VAX/VMS it has been modified, expanded, and ported several times.   We first ported the package to Linux in 2006, using the Portland Group compilers.  Subsequently we rewrote portions of the fortran code which were not supported by GNU fortran (g77) and now the package compiles and runs with gcc/g77. This has allowed us to support extra modern platforms.  The re-christened Burnham-Brandeis Helical Package will now run on 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X (Intel) and even Windows running Cygwin. At the same time, when porting to Linux, we took the opportunity to replace the main GUI  portions of the package with updated programs.  We had spent some time modifying the Tcl/Tk-based GUI programs Tkir (image viewer) and Tkll (layerline viewer) from SUPRIM to support a plugin architecture, where we could write new plugins to add functionality without further modifications to the core code-base.   The first, tkinterp, provides an interface in Tkir for selecting layerlines, replacing the old interp program.  The second, brandeisll, is a Tkll plugin to provide support for displaying the Burnham-Brandeis Helical Package &quot;interp&quot; layerline and bessel-function format. We've also included as part of the package, the AVID software for analyzing the variance within the helix.

|long description=RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN, pronounce rely-on) is a stand-alone computer program that employs an empirical Bayesian approach to refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). It is developed in the group of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Briefly, the ill-posed problem of 3D-reconstruction is regularised by incorporating prior knowledge: the fact that macromolecular structures are smooth, i.e. they have limited power in the Fourier domain. In the corresponding Bayesian framework, many parameters of a statistical model are learned from the data, which leads to objective and high-quality results without the need for user expertise.

From a tilt series of 2D electron micrographs taken at many tilt angles with respect to the electron beam, this program can then perform auto-align and quickly render those data into a lucid 3D model, which allows you to perform object rotating for viewing. In addition, EM3D also provides analysis tools for quantify structural information from the models, including their moments, proximity relationships, and spatial reliability.  And all of these functions can be executed with a very intuited graphic user interface. EM3D is available free-of-charge Mac OS X for PowerPC or Intel, and Windows. EM3D was developed in the laboratory of Dr. U. J. McMahan, Professor of Neurobiology and of Structural Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine and continues to be developed at the Dept. of Biology, Texas A&amp;M University.

Elaborate data acquisition schemes with autotuning functions minimize exposure of the specimen to the electron beam and sophisticated image analysis routines retrieve a maximum of information from noisy data sets. ‘TOM software toolbox’ integrates established algorithms and new concepts tailored to the special needs of low dose ET. It provides a user-friendly unified platform for all processing steps: acquisition, alignment, reconstruction, and analysis. Designed as a collection of computational procedures it is a complete software solution within a highly flexible framework. TOM represents a new way of working with the electron microscope and can serve as the basis for future high-throughput applications.

{{EM software tool
|name=UCSF Tomography
|website=http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/em/EMNEW2/tomography_page.html
|long description=UCSF Tomography is an integrated software suite that provides full automation from target finding, sequential tomographic data collection, to real-time reconstruction for both single and dual axes as well as automated acquisition of random conical data sets. This software was implemented based upon a novel approach in which the compustage tilting is modeled as geometric rotation. The spatial movement of the sample as a result of stage tilting can be predicted based upon previously collected tomographic images. Therefore, there is no need to collect tracking and focusing images during the entire tomographic data collection. A significant dose saving can thus be achieved and is critical in collecting cryo tilt series. Real-time reconstruction is achieved by calculating a weighted back-projection on a small Linux cluster (five dual-processor computer nodes) concurrently with the UCSF tomography data collection running on the microscope’s computer, and using the fiducial-marker free alignment data generated during the data collection process. The real-time reconstructed 3D volume provides users with immediate feedback to fully asses all aspects of the experiment ranging from sample choice, ice thickness, experimental parameters to the quality of specimen preparation. To facilitate dual-axis tomographic data collection, a hierarchical scheme for target finding and relocation after specimen rotation was developed and integrated with the predictive data collection and real-time reconstruction, allowing full automation from target finding to data collection and to reconstruction  of 3D volumes with little user intervention. An on-site scheme was developed for random conical data collection where tracking and focusing are performed at the same location as the final conical tilt images. Lower magnifications combined with short exposure are used to substantially reduce dose and to allow larger tilt steps. The system also includes a feature for montaging untilted images to ensure that all of the particles in the tilted image may be used in the reconstruction.

MASDET offers several subroutines for the main mass analysis steps, namely image display and selection of regions of interest (ROI), mass evaluation and data analysis. Two program-modes constitute the core procedures for mass determination: (i) the program-mode AREA determines the mass-per-area of sheet-like structures (e.g., protein S-layers, thin organic and inorganic films) and the mass-per-box for globular structures (e.g., single macromolecules, globular assemblies, organic/inorganic nanoparticles), and (ii) the program-mode FILAMENT determines the mass-per-length for filamentous structures (e.g., intermediate filaments, DNA-protein complexes, tobacco mosaic virus, nanowires) in individual ROIs. The statistical analysis of the mass data in individual ROIs contains graphical data display (histograms and XY-plots) and allows up to 10 Gaussian curves to be fitted. The dark-field micrographs can also be recalculated to a mass-thickness profile and/or mass-thickness map using data from Monte Carlo simulations.

== Resolution Estimation ==

{{EM software tool
|name=FSC
|website=http://imagescience.de/fsc/
|long description=Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation of two 3D volumes. The three-dimensional Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) measures the normalised cross correlation coefficient between two 3D volumes over corresponding shells in Fourier space, i.e., as a function of spatial frequency. The (modified) 3-sigma criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise. The 1/2-bit information threshold criteria express where we have already collected a sufficient amount of data in the final 3D reconstruction to allow a direct structural interpretation at that resolution level. The 1/2-bit curve is calibrated to approximately yield resolution values comparable to resolution values in use in X-ray crystallography (FOM).

The method does not rely on the availability of the original image data or the calculation of several structures from different parts of the data that are needed for the commonly used Fourier Shell Correlation criterion. Instead, the correlation between neighboring Fourier pixels is calculated and used to distinguish signal from noise.

|long description=ADP_EM is an ultra fast multiresolution fitting tool of atomic structures into low/medium resolution EM maps which has been specially designed to support high throughput coverage. The method uses spherical harmonics to effectively speed up the rotational scan. It can be considered as a practical step-down of the Fast Rotational Matching (FRM) described elsewhere in Kovacs et al. 2003. Please, download the program and test by yourself the efficiency and robustness reached with this new approach.

|long description=The purpose of coloRNA is the following: if we have two versions of an RNA structure (given as pdb files), differing as a consequence of conformational changes, and given the secondary structure, then the program is able to determine the distances between corresponding residues and heat-map them onto the secondary structure.  That is, very mobile/flexible residues show up in red, moderate ones in yellow and green, very stable ones in blue. So it is possible, with the aid of the program, to determine which parts of the secondary structure are responsible for the mobility of the 3D structure.

The resource offers Java-based 3D viewers which can be accessed from EMDataBank atlas pages.   Atlas pages of interest can be found using EMSEARCH  (http://www.emdatabank.org/search.html).

AstexViewer, a molecular graphics program originally developed to display crystallographic data was recently re-released under an open source license and has been adapted  for display of EM maps and associated PDB coordinate models.  A compact map format is used to improve web download speed and minimize memory requirements (very large maps are down-sampled).  Current capabilities include ability to control map contour level, opacity, color, solid vs. mesh surface rendering, and concurrent display of one or more PDB coordinate entries.

|long description=OpenStructure is a software development platform tailored to the implementation of novel computational structural biology and molecular modeling methods. OpenStructure has been designed to handle and manipulate a wide range of data types as required in the field of integrative modeling, where data originating from a variety of experimental techniques are used to guide the model building process. The toolkit allows the development of sophisticated stand-alone applications, but also offers interfaces to flexibly incorporate external software, where appropriate, without the need to re-implement existing functionalities. At the top level, OpenStructure features a graphical user interface with components for rendering of biological macromolecules, density maps, image stacks, widgets for sequence analysis and graphical scene setup, and an integrated Python shell. While the graphical interface is conveniently used without prior knowledge of the underlying layers, the GUI maintains a tight integration with the scripting functionality. Any object that is visualized on the screen can be accessed at the Python level. Likewise, it is possible to create and manipulate graphical objects from within a script. This setup allows the combination of human-based and automatic data analysis, and freely customizing the graphical interface itself.

== [[Adventist Adventurer Awards]] ==

Hello:
I'm new to wikibooks and lost.... I just start a new book for Adventurer Program which is for children 4-9 years old. This is a family oriented program provide it for the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
I may need a lot of help so, you will see me around here a lot.
Thanks &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Adalvis|Adalvis]] ([[User talk:Adalvis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adalvis|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:You may be interested in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] as well.  [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] is a large contributor to that book. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:33, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

== Links to external sites - a guideline suggestion ==

As a new wikibookian, I surveyed the general recommendations for editors before trying my hand at contributing to the book I'm currently studying with (namely, [[Haskell]]). While doing so I saw the recommendation that, since books should be as useful in printed form as they are online, links to external sites should be used with discretion. While that guideline surely makes a lot of sense, external links are often used exactly in the same way as references to printed material are in conventional books - and for printed books no one questions the value of having such references as long as title, author and other relevant data are clearly stated so that readers can actually find said material. So, instead of just clamping down on external links, wouldn't it be better to have a guideline encouraging editors to make better use of the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags? That is, instead of doing

: Check the [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html Standard Prelude specification] for reference on these default Haskell functions.

we might instead use

: Check the Standard Prelude specification &lt;ref&gt;Available at http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html&lt;/ref&gt; for reference on these default Haskell functions.

: &lt;references/&gt;

And now readers with a printed copy can just enter the web address in a browser and find the Prelude specification, just as they would do in a library with a conventional book reference. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 15:08, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

PS.: Of course that shouldn't be an excuse for not making books as self-contained as possible, and so references should ideally be restricted to topics that are either out of the book scope or can't be easily integrated to the book for one reason or another. Thus, the &quot;discretion&quot; part still applies, except that now in a better defined sense. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 15:17, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

: My impression is that this project has historically been tried to keep it light on guidelines and policies. I personally would think it was even better would be if the module referred to the  [http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-98-Language-Libraries-Revised/dp/0521826144 hard copy], on the off chance the website ceased existing.  (Which in the case of haskell.org is not very likely).  In general as long as people &quot;think before they link&quot;, I don't think we need a separate guideline about linking pages. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:29, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I understand the concerns about instruction creep (and why you wouldn't want thousands of WB: pages like in Wikipedia). I didn't think about a separate, brand new guideline, but rather an extra sentence in the existing guideline (such as &quot;If you really must add a link to an external site, consider doing so in a way that would be useful to people reading a printed version of the book, such as in a footnote&quot;). By the way, in the Haskell example I feel the web reference is at least as important as the book one - while the site arguably has the disadvantage of being a more &quot;volatile&quot; reference, finding or buying the book could be orders of magnitude more difficult - particularly if we are aiming at a wide international audience. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:27, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
:::It's a bit of a moot point.  The &quot;Download as PDF&quot; tool already converts links to footnotes. See [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Amphibians]] as an example (section 9 has a link).  If you render this chapter as a PDF, it will indeed convert the link to a footnote which looks exactly like what you are asking users to do. Nice. :-) --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:43, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: That's &quot;super cool&quot;! I did not know that. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:51, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: I agree, that's a great feature :-) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 19:41, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
== Request for review ==

L.S.

Over the past few weeks I've put quite some work into [[Bourne Shell Scripting]]. I'd love to have someone with editor or reviewer rights do a review. I'm not an editor yet, plus I don't think I should review my own work. So if anybody could/would....

Thanks in advance! -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 18:01, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

== Good practices on module merging and book restructuring ==

Hi all,

A project to reorganize and cleanup the beginner modules of the Haskell Wikibook is being kickstarted. The current proposal for doing that would call for a major restructuring operation, with many modules being spliced beyond recognition and then having their sections shuffled and reassembled in wildly different orders (you can get an idea of the scale of the changes looking at the crude brainstorming we're doing at [[Haskell/List of topics]]). I would like to start experimental work on the reorganization ASAP, but after reading the recommendations in [[Help:Pages#Merging|Help:Merging_pages]] I got a bit confused on how to proceed. My key concerns are: 

* Exactly how much do I need to worry with things like history merges and such? 
* What would be the cleanest way to build a wholly new module from fragments extracted from, say, three different existing modules?

Thanks, [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 01:21, 14 May 2010 (UTC)
:If you take pages and fully merge them into a new one, add {{tl|now merged}} to the former with the latter as a parameter to that template.  That's only if the source pages will be merged under the destination with the old location no longer used.  If the sources will remain, then linking the pages in the edit summary will suffice for attribution.  If you are breaking up a page, do it so at least some portion of the original page remains as part of the final state of the book, so the edit summaries for the new pages you make can link to a page that will continue to exist with its edit history, for attribution.  That last situation is often used when breaking a single-page 'book' into an actual book with multiple pages.  If your merging/splitting gets really complex you may wish to use permanent links in the summaries rather than wikilinks, to be very specific about which revision was pulled from. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:26, 14 May 2010 (UTC)
:: I just took care of a simpler case of page splitting that could be done without much headache.

== Broken boxes ==

Back from a short while away, I noticed that a number of {{tl|mbox}}es are broken, seemingly after an import of a bunch of WP style boxes. I neither know the rationale for this move or how urgent it was, nor am I interested in questioning how other contributors choose to spend their time. I am, however, a bit surprised that the move didn't go smoothly. Could whoever started this please clean up after themselves? It also seems as though the new template doesn't have as many options (e.g. the &lt;code&gt;type=growth&lt;/code&gt;). Making the new ones backwards compatible should solve this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:28, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[Template:Mbox]] does have backwards compatibility added to it.  Both the older &quot;msg&quot; paramater and the newer &quot;text&quot; parameter both work.  User warnings on talk pages using &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;warning&quot; work just fine alongside the &quot;delete&quot; option (see [[Template:Tmbox/core]]).  I am sorry the box on [[Japanese]] was not corrected. I went through and corrected every template using Mbox; calling Mbox directly it blended in with [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Mbox|the other pages]] that showed up solely because they had a template using Mbox which I had already gone through to ensure that nothing was broken. With the above backwards compatibility added, the only cases I can think of where something would have been broken would be where a custom image was specified; and as I mentioned I went through all the templates using Mbox to correct for the difference in the syntax for specifying that image.  I tried hard to make sure things went smooothly to allow for {{tl|ambox}}, {{tl|tmbox}}, {{tl|imbox}}, {{tl|cmbox}}, {{tl|ombox}}, or {{tl|fmbox}} to be called based on a multipurpose-template-using-Mbox's namespace location.  Again, I am sorry the direct call to Mbox on [[Japanese]] was missed, but I feel it's the exception. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:22, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
== Silly question about +editor ==

When I get editor status (within a few more days, I believe) will my previous edits get automatically sighted or someone (me or another editor) would have to sight them before they get through FlaggedRevs? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 22:05, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

:They won't be automatically sighted.

== Wikibooks and the British Museum? ==

Hi all, &lt;br&gt;
As some of you may be aware, next month I'll be going &quot;in-house&quot; at the British Museum in London as their volunteer &quot;Wikipedian in residence&quot; (more info [http://www.wittylama.com/2010/03/the-british-museum-and-me/ here]). Simply put, the idea is for me to spend a month there trying to work out ways that the two communities can build a productive and mutually beneficial/trusting relationship. Although I know the title is &quot;wikipedian&quot; I wanted to make sure that Wikibookians knew I didn't want to limit the scope of the activities to just that project. In fact, I think Wikibooks is possibly the single most important project for long-term [[m:GLAM|GLAM]]-Wikimedia relations. To that end, I wanted to ask if anyone here had any current projects that they think my internal access to the British Museum might be of help with - please contact me (en.wp is easiest). Equally, if anyone wanted to investigate creating a British Museum-specific wikibook (e.g. a guided tour for kids in the WikiJuniour collections?) I'm sure we can get something going there too. Let me know if you've got any ideas! All the best, &lt;br&gt; 
[[User:Witty lama|Witty lama]] ([[User talk:Witty lama|talk]]) 23:27, 9 May 2010 (UTC)
:I've read about this British Museum thingy on the Wikipedia signpost. I know nothing about the British Museum, but in my opinion it might be rather difficult to make a Wikijunior book about the British Museum, since Wikibooks is mostly about textbooks, not guidebooks. So very few editors will be able to help out. By the way, Wikijunior is somewhat inactive nowadays. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:01, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
::(Re WJ:  Progress on Wikijunior these days is mostly at a slow pace, though if that's what you meant I don't see why you'd bother to remark on it.  The word &quot;inactive&quot; comes across to me as considerably stronger than &quot;abandoned&quot; and in the vicinity of &quot;deprecated&quot;.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:31, 10 May 2010 (UTC))
:::Activity has been slow in many places, I don't think wikijunior is unique in this respect.  I think the british museum collaboration could very useful for the [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations]] book.  Or maybe even some of the non wikijunior books.  I think perhaps Witty lama's idea could be used to create a book on &quot;History as seen through the British Museum&quot;.  It is possible to imagine such a book would teach some real history and not be just a guide. 
::: If some editor is interested in some topic that the british museum might have some specialized knowledge about... (e.g. &quot;Cookie Recipies from Ancient Greece&quot;, I managed to find one as a kid for a school project, and they were delicious. Who know you could use cloves in cookies?) I strongly encourage that editor to get in touch Witty lama, and find out what resources this partnership brings.  It might just lead to a nice chat with some expert about some module, but already that is quite useful. Sadly I am not sure how to make use of it in my work. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:23, 10 May 2010 (UTC)

:::I'd only characterize the activity on Wikijunior as reflective of activity as a whole on Wikibooks; when things slow on the site as a whole, things slow on Wikijunior, and vice versa.  [[:File:English Wikibooks Edits.png]] shows the trend.  The peak was in July 2006; we've never broken even 90% of that since and from mid-2009 on it's been below 50% of that peak.  The history has been dramatically volatile, with huge swings in participation, the most recent being a 90% to 50% of peak in the aforementioned mid-2009. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:32, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
::::I think we've become a little too focused on the WikiJunior thing. That was just an example and I'm quite happy to pursue other options if anyone has any suggestions.

== Book review? ==

As I haven't seen any such process on WB before, I would like to propose a process (possibly a new reading room) similar to a Wikiepdia peer review (not to be confused with a Wikinews one) so that people can put their books to that page and let the community comment on it. Then, if the comments are positive, or if there are only a few things left to be desired and someone (usu. a regular of that book) does it, then put it up to the featured book nominations page. It doesn't have to be compulsory, though. Currently the only place to do this is on this page, though it would probably be a little annoying to clog this place up with books that need comments on no particular aspect, just general comments.

== Trans-wiki collaboration ==

I started [[w:Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Trans-wiki_collaboration|a discussion at en.wikpedia]] about how cross-pollination between projects could be beneficial to Wikibooks and the other Wikimedia projects, and it seems to be gaining momentum. The basic idea is that if we often need volunteers for maintenance and improvement of our book collection and there are many talented editors next door we should have better mechanisms for inviting them to contribute. Please share your thoughts on the ideas being discussed - in both threads if possible. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 15:54, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

:Interesting.  We have had WikiProjects here for getting like-minded people together on a topic.  It shouldn't be surprising that I haven't seen any activity on them for as long as I can remember and would personally consider them all defunct at this point.  [[Chess]] and [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Chess|WikiProject Chess]] and [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Chess]] may have collaborated in the past or at least would be a good example of a potential partnership.  Those concerned about flooding the project with Wikipedians will have to get past that as it's mostly individuals working on their particular books of choice right now; any coordinated effort will look like a &quot;flood&quot;.  I don't buy the cross-wiki watchlists excuse and feel it's just a case of being spoiled with everything happening at Wikipedia.  I have long been used to having to visit Meta, Commons, and Wikiversity to check my watchlists.  I'm glad you've proposed this, regardless of the outcome.  It's always seemed to me that Wikipedia and Wikibooks are closest to each other content-wise.  I think editors at Wikipedia would also find the more relaxed atmosphere of Wikibooks and the ability to write rather than debate over a couple sentences refreshing. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:50, 11 May 2010 (UTC)
::As Wikipedian, I think this is great; however, the name is horrible. As Confucius said, if the name is not correct, the words will not ring true.

Grammatically, too. Besides, I'm already a Wikipedian and I'm a current member of WikiProject Hong Kong, WikiProject Hong Kong Transport and WikiProject Wikipedia Awards.

: The key idea is to have, in our case, wikipedians becoming wikibookians as well and contributing to books in their area of interest. With this kind of collaboration, this sort of cross-linking you suggest could certainly be part of the process, although it seems to me that (in ideal circumstances) the more natural way of cross-linking would be in the opposite direction (Wikipedia &gt;&gt; Wikibooks), since in theory Wikibooks would be (among other things) a place for exploring subjects in more depth than what is possible in Wikipedia. By the way, since you mentioned Linear Algebra, Thenub314 has just started an interesting [[w:Wikipedia_talk:WPM#Call_to_Arms_for_Wikipedia.27s_sister_projects|discussion at WikiProject Mathematics]] involving collaboration in this very same subject.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 19:36, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

== A practical question on dealing with merge suggestions ==

Suppose that, on browsing [[:Category:Books to be merged]], I find some tagged book for which I believe the proposed merge is flat out inadequate - say, due to the involved pages dealing with clearly distinct subjects. There are no comments about the merge on the talk page or edit summaries and the book was not edited since ages ago. In such situations, should I just remove the merge template as I see fit (providing an explanation on the edit summary) or doing it unilaterally would be improper? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 07:08, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:The simpler solution would be to make your comment objecting to it, wait 7 days for opposition and if none materializes remove the tags. This will avoid rehashing the issue and provide a basis to start the process over in a more productive way even in stalled projects, with luck it may also attract interested people to the projects.

There is a message on top of simple books that the books will be merged here. What is the naming convention for those books and is there an extra namespace for them? Also, when will they be merged (if they haven't? But if it is the website won't even be there any more...)

:::This [[Wikijunior:Biology]] book is nice.  Perhaps we should revive the project!  Correct me if I am wrong, but my idea is that once the books are here they will no longer be considered simple english.  Instead they will developed as usual wikibooks. And the placement (such as the current book went into wikijunior) will be made on a book by book basis depending on content. (Since from my vague understanding of the project it was only supposed to be the english that was simple, not necessarily the content.)

Some of them are really good, although kids may not understand them... The language is simple, but the content doesn't have to be. Perhaps we could open something similar to Wikijunior, say, WikiSimple? Then we can house all the simple english books here. Also, as this project has higher traffic, those books have a higher chance of getting developed... Also, could [[Simple:Abacus]] be imported to Wikijunior too?

== DDC/LOC Classifications ==

It was mentioned in an IRC chat a while ago and I thought I'd put it out there: are the [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal]] and [[Wikibooks:LOC Classification|Library of Congress]] classification systems necessary?  Are they a relic of the time when bookshelves were all there was and a dynamic listing of books by subject had not yet been accomplished through the subject pages?  It would seem as though that is the case, with the DDC root page created in December 2004 and the LOC created in February 2006, predating the creation of [[Subject:Books by subject]] in September 2007.  Do readers actually use these systems for finding books?  Dewey Decimal is a system to arrange &quot;books on library shelves in a specific and repeatable order that makes it easy to find any book and return it to its proper place&quot;, and is used in most public libraries, with the LOC system in use at research and academic libraries (in the US). They don't seem like they have a practical purpose in an electronic medium.  

[[:Category:Dewey/300|DDC 300 - Social Sciences/Education]] and [[:Category:Library of Congress/H|LOC H - Social Sciences]] would seem to be covered by [[Subject:Social sciences]] and its sub-subjects, for instance.  DDC has a mere ten categories to house all the books; LOC has four categories for history but lumps philosophy, psychology, and religion together.  So they would also seem to be inferior with regards to collecting together books on similar subjects in a manner useful to readers.  Given that most people don't have the numbers/letters of each committed to memory, they also add overhead and difficulty in filing new books. Do we have a good reason for retaining them? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:51, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

: I know which LOC numbers are relevant to my work, but no others.  I think they should go, but I don't actually have any idea how people look up books here.  To be fair, when I use these types of numbers in a library, I first look up the book/subject find the section, look around that section.

== List of prerequisites - how to implement? ==

Hello!

I have a question about templates / categories / backlinks.

Namely, for the Haskell wikibook, I would like to add a list of &quot;prerequisites&quot; to each chapter, something like this: &quot;To understand this chapter, you need to know: Basic Haskell, Lazy evaluation&quot;. This short message should be created by a template, for example

&lt;pre&gt;{{prerequisites| Basic Haskell | Lazy evaluation}}&lt;/pre&gt;

So, the template arguments should be turned into links to a page that lists all topics in the Haskell wikibook that may appear as prerequisites.

Dually, each chapter covers one or more topics: &quot;This chapter explains: Lazy evaluation&quot;. By doing so, the chapter is automatically included on the list of pages also covering this topic.

How can I do this? Each prerequisite could be a category, but I want to list both the topics and the pages that cover them on a single page. Are there any other mechanisms for collecting backlinks?

-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 08:35, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

: Check out {{tlx|prerequisite}}. It only allows for a single link, but if you want to create a template that allows for more, I suggest you don't pass them as separate arguments, but rather all together like so:
&lt;pre&gt;{{prerequisites|
* [[link one]]
* [[link two]]}}&lt;/pre&gt;
: for simplicity.
: The way I understand you and as far as I know, categories are the only way for you to collect those pages. In fact, they sound precisely like what you're looking for. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:30, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks for your help, the template is indeed what I'm looking for; [[:Category:Calculus/Prerequisite]] is a compelling example. In my case, the prerequisites won't be whole books, just subsets of the Haskell wikibook, of course.
::What I also want to do, however, is to present multiple of these categories on one and the same page with custom formatting, like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
    Topic &quot;Lazy Evaluation&quot; is prerequisite to
        * [[Haskell/Infinite Lists]]
    Topic &quot;Basic Haskell&quot; is prerequisite to
        * [[Haskell/More about lists]]
        * [[Haskell/Understanding Monads]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
::Is there a way to transclude multiple category pages and apply custom formatting to the page listings? I.e. I don't want the default alphabetical listing of the pages in a category, and I want to show multiple categories on a single page. Of course, I could list the corresponding pages by hand, but this would kinda defeat the purpose.

== PDF version on Commons... HELP! ==

I've been working on the [[Bourne Shell Scripting]] book recently and today I uploaded a PDF version to commons (File:WikiBooks en Bourne Shell Scripting 20100509.pdf). Put the same categories on there as on the main page of the book (UNIX and Scripting languages). And placed the book in the PDF Wikibooks category on Commons.

In addition I put the PDF version template in the table of contents on the book's main page (locally on wikibooks, obviously). Then I put the name of the PDF file from Commons in the template as a link. Plus some file size info.

But the only result is that I get the &quot;vaporware&quot; text in the template on the book page. Can somebody please take a look and tell me where I went off the track?

Thanks! -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 14:25, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:From the information in the PDF version template, it looks like you can specify the file name and the file you made seems to be where it should be [[:File:WikiBooks en Bourne Shell Scripting 20100509.pdf]]. Perhaps the PDF version template is not working as expected! All the other books I have seen with PDF versions actually use the same file name and book name, so you could try uploading with file name &quot;Bourne Shell Scripting.pdf&quot;.

:::Alright, I'll recreate the file on Commons with a new name. But I agree with the Lecturer in Recent Runes (;-)): this feels very much like a bug in the templating system. Or at least between the templating system and the cross-domain linking setup. The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, simply put, should support linking to Commons resources just like the rest of MediaWiki does.

::Wouldn't see why -- it's a PDF version of the book, not the other way around. Plus it's both on WikiMedia systems.

::Either way, the template is still not working, even when falling back to the default of having the file have the same name as the page.

After more digging into the issue above, I think I've found the problem: the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template includes an ifexist that looks for the existence of a File:XXX.pdf resource. This doesn't work across sites. To check for resources on commons, it is necessary to use the Media namespace as in Media:XXX.pdf .

I've created a copy of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[Template:PDF version Temp]]. As far as I can tell, this works well for both local and remote resources (see my user page, [[User:BenTels]]). If there are no objections, I would like to propose making the change in the original template.

== Enclosing Programming Code in Box ==

Earlier Python code used to be boxed but now it isn't see for example how the Code looks here: [[How_to_Think_Like_a_Computer_Scientist:_Learning_with_Python_2nd_Edition/Solutions]]

Now if you add the following in your user space [[User:33rogers/monobook.css]] like how I have done, the page mentioned above (after deleting cookies etc.) looks much better.

Therefore I suggest the following changes be made global in Wikibooks:

From http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi#Method_1.2C_CSS_file 

Method 1, CSS file
:''This method requires [[rev:52346|r52346]] or higher of this extension.''

Add to [[MediaWiki:Geshi.css]], [[MediaWiki:Monobook.css]] or [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
div.mw-geshi {
  padding: 1em; 
  margin: 1em 0; 
  border: 1px dashed #2f6fab;
}&lt;/pre&gt;

This will give all GeSHi output (except for &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;) a dashed border almost identical to &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; in monobook/main.css

: I do prefer the code to be placed in a box or otherwise separated from the text.  In a textbook setting, it's very nice to be able to separate the code from the text and make it stand out.  Different textbooks do that in different ways, but they all do seem to do it.  Having the code flow straight into the text is confusing, especially if the text is quoting part of the code (which is a nice thing to do).  I just did a quick thumb through of several programming textbooks in my office - some set the code off with horizontal lines, others in shaded boxes, and others still try to stuff the code into the margines (yuck!)  The point is - they set it off with more than just a font change.  I think boxes are fine for this. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:54, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

: Interesting to read this... the [[Haskell]] book I'm working on is in a curious situation because it has conflicting styles for code blocks. As you can see [[Haskell/More_about_lists|in this module]], some parts use non-highlighted plain text boxes while others use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags that provide highlighting but no boxes, and a very different font size as well. Any means of combining boxes and highlighting in an uniform, transparent way would be greatly useful. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 20:04, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
: P.S.: the &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; attribute mentioned above would be all that it would take to disable boxing in a particular code block if for some reason I don't like the result? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 20:11, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
::All code enclosed in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; will have a box around it.

Then delete cache and re-login to view the changes. The reason for conflicting styles in code blocks in the module you referred to is because they are not all enclosed using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (which has the benefit of Syntax highlighting/coloring). --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 08:29, 13 May 2010 (UTC)
::: But I am confused what the fuss is about, what is the difficulty with just enclosing source code in a box when we want to.  We could do something like this:
{{TextBox|
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
function y=f(x)
y=x.^2;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}
:::I am no expert on these types of templates, but I believe you can do cool things like make a box off to the right that the text &quot;flows around&quot;, etc.  I have not edited many of the programming texts here, but would changing the setting cause a box inside a box when people had already done things like this?

::::: Excellent point.  I suppose I am advocating a path of least resistance type of philosophy, we can add boxes where we like them now.  Is it really necessary to change some default setting which ''may'' affect books in a negative ways. My example would be a pages that have lots of single line source tags.  For example, [[LaTeX/Document_Structure#Sectioning_Commands]] would not look as nice.  Even worse the book consistently uses boxes for for terminal output.  For readers it is clear that information in boxes means terminal output, colored type writer face font means LaTeX code.  If we make this change, everything would be in boxes.  Maybe that is ok, maybe it is not.  I don't mean to pass judgment, just pointing out that we may be undoing lots of work (and creating some new work) for editors that we don't realize.  Back when we first started using this extension, it would clearly be a case of 6 of one, half dozen of the other.  But now people have been making their books appear as they like them under the current standard.  I don't see anything as broken, so I am not sure why we would take a risk (perhaps a very small one) of creating lots of work for some one.

Of course that's not a good example (because all it would take to disable the boxes would be adding &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; to a single template), but there may be books &lt;s&gt;using inline &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags&lt;/s&gt; that would demand some effort to have the boxes disabled.

== ePub format printable books? ==

Today I tried to add an ePub version of [[Bourne Shell Scripting]], with a template and so on (analogy to PDF version). This attempt hit the wall when I realized that you cannot upload epub files to Commons. This is a shame since ePub seems to be the most popular format for e-readers. Is there any chance that it will be possible to add ePub versions in the future? -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 16:54, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

I've posed a policy question on this subject on [[commons:Commons talk:Project_scope#Allowing_ePub_files_on_commons]]. -- [[User:BenTels|BenTels]] ([[User talk:BenTels|talk]]) 12:03, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

: You should probably try to make a policy change on commons. As an alternative you can request to upload the content here but I should point you some facts and why I wouldn't support the request (I wouldn't oppose it also).
: Most people aren't aware of the format ([[w:EPUB|ePub]], I wasn't and the rational is similar). I support open formats and specifications, but for them to be of any usefulness people must not fragment the &quot;market&quot;, there are already other supported free and open formats (PDF), that have a higher level of implementation, supporting only one format has also maintainability advantages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:25, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::I agree that Commons is the place to put ePubs, especially since that's also where the PDFs are supposed to go. And indeed, I've posted a question in commons about changing the policy (see link above). Since you agree that is the correct place I would appreciate your support for my request on commons to allow ePub uploads.

::: As I said above I don't object nor do I see it as beneficial to support more formats. Being free and open-source conversion tools should exist. Consider the work and resources required to host duplicated content, on the other hand the need to host PDFs is also diminished today. The primary reason I see to keep the PDFs is not primarely for distribution but to preserve static snapshots of &quot;near completion&quot; wikibooks, for example to have a single version of the work used in a class.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:08, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

== Adding &quot;For Further Reading&quot; bibliographies ==

This is related to the discussion regarding whether and how to use external links in Wikibooks. I would like to see &quot;For Further Reading&quot; bibliographies, including both primary and secondary sources, added to the end of each Wikibook.  Authors of traditional textbooks almost always include such information and I find it extremely valuable, particularly when doing independent study without the guidance of a professor.  While a student might be able to find additional information by using an Internet search engine or looking through an on-line book selling site, it would be helpful to have some guidance regarding what materials are reliable and useful, according to the judgment of the Wiki community. Is bibliographic information available somewhere else on WikiMedia and I am missing it?  Any reason not to include it in the Wikibooks?
ederieux[[User:Ederieux|Ederieux]] ([[User talk:Ederieux|talk]]) 22:34, 20 May 2010 (UTC)5/20/2010
: A list of books for further reading would be a fine addition.  I am sure some books here already have this in some form. I think the best materials to include in the &quot;For Further Reading&quot; sections would be more advanced textbooks assuming such exist.  I am not sure what you mean by asking if bibliographic information is available on wikimedia.  There is not any central repository of possible references, but I am not sure if this is what you were asking. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:47, 20 May 2010 (UTC)
:: There is no rule against adding such bibliographies. Books may or may not add them. (Wikijunior Small Numbers probably won't include them, for instance.) It's up to book contributors to decide.

: It should be up to the book community to decide what to add/keep. As a user and contributor I don't particular like to have lists added at the end of every page of a book in a separated section. I rather prefer the direct insertion of relevant links in the text itself (easier to maintain and promotes relevance), this is a bit different from an wikipedian article. Another optimization would be moving the list of references to Wikipedia, failing to have very specific need, then reference other Wikibooks (specific to that topic) or a Wikipedia article. It all depends of what and why the reference is being added. This of course doesn't remove the ability of adding such references to a distinct section of the book, provide the info to the book editors and even rewrite the needed information so the reference is no longer needed... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:21, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

== Understanding FlaggedRevs... ==

I'm just looking for confirmation that I understood FlaggedRevs properly. The key point about the stable version system is that it is optional and only activated when some editor explicitly reviews it for the first time. For that reason, the only pages we should worry about their most recent edit not being shown to anonymous users are the ones listed in [[Special:OldReviewedPages]], which does ''not'' include any unreviewed pages. Correct? --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 23:57, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Information ==

In Wikibooks such as [[General Chemistry]], is it allowed, or even preferred that exercises are available? It would feel much more like a textbook and would prove more useful than just a load of information. Also, when creating a Wikibook, can we treat it like a course (e.g. can I make an AP Physics book, which if one reads it and does the practice problems, one will be fit to take the AP exam)?--[[User:Charcoal|Charcoal]] ([[User talk:Charcoal|talk]]) 04:37, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:Exercises would certainly be welcome, and we do have quite a few books aimed at specific exams. As for the point Kayau raised, the main difference between a &quot;textbook wiki&quot; and a &quot;course wiki&quot; (and thus between Wikibooks and Wikiversity) is the extent of real-time interaction of the readers/students, with both other readers/students and authors/educators. I am quite certain that both of your ideas do not cross the line of project scope.
:P.S.: Nice to see people interested in General Chemistry. That book definitely needs more love and attention (and hard work in reorganization, which is why I haven't found courage to touch it yet...). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 18:26, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

== Featured Book removals ==

{{Resolved}}
I would like to suggest that nominators of Featured Book Removal (delisting) must notify Original Contributors in their talk pages, that the book is being considered as such.

I would make it easier if WikiBooks has a generic template for this purpose (to be placed in User Talk space).

When you place a notice on their talk pages, they will be emailed (I think it is default in preferences).

This will have a 2 fold effect:

1. Users who may have abandoned contributing to WikiBooks may return, which will increase the number of overall contributors on WikiBooks.

2. There will be proper notification in place, in case they would like to fix the issues brought in Featured Book Delisting nomination.

:::This [[Wikijunior:Biology]] book is nice.  Perhaps we should revive the project!  Correct me if I am wrong, but my idea is that once the books are here they will no longer be considered simple english.  Instead they will developed as usual wikibooks. And the placement (such as the current book went into wikijunior) will be made on a book by book basis depending on content. (Since from my vague understanding of the project it was only supposed to be the english that was simple, not necessarily the content.) I would have helped out the first time but I never was away the project existed, I was probably job hunting. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:14, 22 May 2010 (UTC)
::::Wow, it's a great idea to import Biology here, Swift. It's probably the first time that a Wikibooks has ever started a book that is finished from the, well, start! :D I wonder if importing the rest of the books to Wikijunior would make sense. Some of them are really good, although kids may not understand them... The language is simple, but the content doesn't have to be. Perhaps we could open something similar to Wikijunior, say, WikiSimple? Then we can house all the simple english books here. Also, as this project has higher traffic, those books have a higher chance of getting developed... Also, could [[:Simple:Abacus]] be imported to Wikijunior too? I think it is appropriate for children, though it's not quite complete yet.

: I think there is room for the various views of where to take the Simple English Wikibooks content. I personally believe it's ''largely'' (but not necessarily entirely) belongs in Wikijunior and therefore should be put into that namespace. Others argued that the content was too complicated for Wikijunior and should be continued in the main namespace. In that case, it can be renamed as something like &quot;Simple English &lt;name of book&gt;&quot; or the intended audience otherwise made clear.

Hi, 

Previously when using the source tags, the result was free from the preformatting tags broken blue border;  now it appears for that setting.   See the examples on the page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text Preformatted Text].

:You can add &lt;tt&gt;enclose=&quot;none&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; within the source tags to remove the pre formatting.

== Main Page ==

I am looking for feedback and opinions as to whether [[Main Page/Draft]] would be a suitable replacement for the current main page.  It retains roughly the same layout, but uses {{tl|Robox}} for appearance.  The preset theme options for that template were chosen to approximate the same colors that are present on the current main page.  The exception is the welcome box, which uses a custom theme I created to match the Wikibooks logo.  The other boxes are open to suggestions as to what theme they should use.  Additionally, the icons in the upper-right are also optional.

A change has been made to the way the subjects are shown, with the top-level subjects listed dynamically.  An new addition, the display of a featured recipe, has been added.  This randomly displays subpages of [[Main Page/Recipe]].  Five have been done so far for the purposes of this request for comments.  

The underlying code of the display of the featured books has been changed.  Before, new goodbook templates had to be added in a balanced fashion to one of eighteen sections, and those sections were getting filled up to as much as six books each.  When they get too large it would require modifying the code at {{tl|Main Page featured books}}, which is not easy for everyone to do.  Apparently books were also listed twice, which is something that wasn't obvious to me when I added two newly-featured books.  And each section had a specific set of 5-6 books that would always show up together.  This new version at [[Main Page/Featured]] has a fully randomized selection of five books for the box, so the same set of books will not show up twice.  Additionally, adding a new featured book is as simple as adding it to a list and updating the total number.  And the code is far easier should a layout change need to be made to shorten the right-hand column.

Overall I don't think it's too drastically different, but I want to put it out there before doing all the featured recipes and especially before actually making changes to the main page.  So, thoughts? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:24, 20 April 2010 (UTC)

: Could the blue of the welcome box's heading cause some problems for the color blind and the elderly? The blue of the heading and the blue of the link seem to clash. I figured at some point if we were going to redesign the main page might as well simplify the layout a bit and take advantage of [[Using Wikibooks]]. [{{fullurl:Main Page/test|oldid=1561346}} Main Page/test] is something I did awhile back with simple in mind. The featured list could be reduced to one row with a randomly selected book, recipe, and children's book respectively using the same basic trick you are using. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:54, 20 April 2010 (UTC)
:{{support}} I like this.  I also like dl's suggestions, and do note that there are a few bugs to work out.  The image of the recipe is covering the text in my browser (firefox) with its current settings anyhow (not full screen, but prolly 900 pixels wide). I don't think the headings would present a problem to the color-blind, as they mostly have trouble distinguishing between red and green, not between shades of blue.  I have no idea how it might affect the elderly though.  I don't object to this or some other color scheme.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:50, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

:I agree with Darklama that the headings of the boxes should have a stronger contrast. I just saw the same featured book (Lucid Dreaming) twice on the draft of the main page. I think this is worse than having the sets of featured books. (I never noticed that there are sets; but everyone immediately notices when a book appears twice.) For the recipe [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:B%C3%A1nh_M%C3%AC Bánh mì] the image covers some of the text with Firefox on MacOS X. I would argue that the cookbook is not important enough to justify this box.

:: Everything above is linked from the sidebar as well, with the cookbook, Wikijunior, other languages, and the help page all linked from the welcome box.  As the cookbook has 3,600 pages to Wikijunior's 1,000 ([[Special:ValidationStatistics|citation]]), I'd say the cookbook is arguably more significant in terms of content.  Additionally, Wikijunior books that are featured are already represented in the featured books box.  The cookbook has featured recipes that make it easy to populate the box with content seen by the community to be of quality. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:33, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

:: In general I like it, I agree that you could use more contrast in the heading of the welcome box.  I have not noticed any problems with recipe images.

:::The help portal and community portal need to be refreshed in my opinion; I leave it up to the community to decide (if possible) what should go in that box.  I tweaked the size of the icon in that cookbook box to make it smaller; the text shouldn't sneak in behind the image any longer.  I also adjusted the color of the welcome box heading.  As for the duplicate randoms, well, I tried using different seeds and salts in {{tl|Rand}}.  You roll a pair of dice often enough and you'll get doubles.  To get them to change, you may have to purge the page (tab addition available in the gadgets page of your preferences).

:::::: The 18 sets are probably an attempt to emulate the 5-6 featured books shuffled in every possible combination.

----
Following Darklama's suggestions, the featured content from the main space, the Cookbook, and Wikijunior have been put into one row at the bottom of [[Main Page/Draft]].  Currently the only featured book you'll see is [[Chess]] as sample content, as the layout will require a minor tweak to [[Template:Goodbook]] if/when it goes live (code is commented out but present already in that template).  There are five featured recipes in rotation at this time there and I'd add more if this layout is adopted.  All the Wikijunior featured books are represented.  The layout has been simplified as well and Darklama was helpful in steering me in the direction he had in mind with earlier comments.  This should address all the concerns above.  Some formatting may be warranted to the current draft, however, and I welcome comments and/or tweaks so that this can be decided upon one way or another and not left in the air. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:43, 29 April 2010 (UTC)
: My thoughts in random order because I am short on time... On the first line I think Categories should be part of the &quot;Contents&quot;, and it would be nice to let people know that the book the book being displayed is a featured book, a featured Wikijunior book, and a featured recipe form the cookbook.  Sometimes the alignment of the pictures/text feels a little sloppy, since the pictures are of different sizes.  Just gives a very jagged feel. And while I don't mind simplicity, our logo next to welcome to Wikibooks would be nice. Over all I liked the previous version better, this is just a bit too minimalistic for me.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:58, 29 April 2010 (UTC)

:The navigation at the top does have a link titled &quot;Questions&quot; and points to the [[Wikibooks:Reading room]].  Potentially a link to the portal could be added with a different link title to the top bar, but it seems as though much of what's covered on the community portal can be discovered through the other links in the bar.

== Q&amp;A pages and the role of namespaces ==

This topic is a fork of the discussions at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion#Talk:The_World_of_Peer-to-Peer_.28P2P.29.2FQ.26A|the RfD of Talk:The_World_of_Peer-to-Peer_(P2P)/Q&amp;A]]. I will start by presenting my current opinion on the issues, also building on the pertinent comments by Pi zero, Swift, Panic and others in the RfD.

The first issue to be addressed is whether general-purpose helpdesks are a good idea for Wikibooks. My answer for that would be no - even if there is no need to take draconian measures against books with general Q&amp;A sections I believe the practice should not be encouraged. Problems with such kinds of helpdesks include, in order of relevance:
* Distracting readers and editors from the main goal of the project (writing internally-coherent textbooks). If people see Wikibooks as a place to get answers for random questions it becomes all too easy for them, for instance, to feel like adding extra information or modules to cover an specific question without caring about the overall structure of the book.
* Dedicating efforts to tasks that would be better performed in a sister project with more adequate infrastructure (Wikipedia reference desk, Wikiversity...)
* The tendency of many books to be abandoned, leaving their Q&amp;A pages unwatched and therefore pointless (note that I'm not stating that ''every'' book/Q&amp;A page has such a fate, but just pointing out a common situation).

Even if an &quot;anything goes&quot; Q&amp;A page is not really a good idea, though, a more restricted type of Q&amp;A can indeed prove useful to book writers. It seems safe to say that a &quot;suggestion box&quot; page is not objectionable. A Q&amp;A page could be made to work pretty much like a suggestion box, only that the suggestions are not made explicitly but implied in the readers' questions. All that it takes for making such a Q&amp;A is restricting the scope of the page, by telling readers something like &quot;If, during your study, you have doubts that the book couldn't answer please post your question at the Q&amp;A page&quot;. By such a token, questions like &quot;Who was the creator of Python?&quot; (a real example from the Python Q&amp;A) would not be acceptable, while &quot;I analysed that example on module xxx a thousand times but I still can't understand how do you...&quot; would certainly be appropriate. Naturally, the difference is way too subtle to become something that could be enforced by policy, so the best we would be able to do in that respect is to provide some lightweight guidelines to contributors and then, if necessary, discuss specific situations case-by-case and with no hurry.

The first obvious objection to the sort of Q&amp;A pages described above was raised by Sigma 7 in the original Python Q&amp;A RfD - namely, that we already have the Talk: pages of each module that purpose. There are quite a few reasons why contributors would favour a centralized Q&amp;A page, or at least having them within a separate hierarchy of pages:

* Centralizing questions, so that it becomes easier for the main contributors to monitor and to other readers to provide feedback.
* Encouraging readers to ask. I think most people, and newbies in particular, would instinctively believe the likelihood of getting an answer after adding a question to the talk page of a deeply-nested module to be quite low.
* Providing a place for questions that span through several modules, or refer to some omission in the book.
* Separating reader doubts about content from editorial discussions about the book (which is the natural role of Talk: pages).

All these reasons make it worthy to give freedom to book writers on how to organize their Q&amp;A/reader feedback pages, which is pretty much the point Swift is insisting on all along.

Finally, there is the more practical issue of whether suggestion boxes, Q&amp;As and such resources belong to Talk: or to the main namespace. Panic believes such pages are more like Talk: pages, as they are meant to be a space for discussing the book. From a book structure point of view that position certainly makes sense, and matches quite well the considerations about not distracting readers from the main goal of Wikibooks. On the other hand, Pi zero and Swift raised the objection that Q&amp;A pages would need their own discussion pages, which also makes sense. 

The fact that seemingly conflicting objections are valid indicates that there ''should'' be a better third way. Quoting Panic, &quot;The way we still use talkpages as if we are in Wikipedia is a software limitation and often a habit&quot;. One way of describing this &quot;software limitation&quot; would be as the absence of an alternative namespace, which is neither part of the main namespace nor just a discussion page. From that point comes the following wild suggestion: maybe we could have a new [[mw:Manual:Using_custom_namespaces|custom namespace]] called &quot;Questions&quot; (or some better name) for acceptable Q&amp;A-like pages. That would make us able to:
* Clearly separate Q&amp;As from the main course of the book;
* Provide clear recommendations (not black-or-white policy, though) on usage of the new namespace;
* Create, if need be, independent hierarchies of sub pages for Q&amp;As with minimal hassle;
* Having talk pages for Q&amp;As;
Maybe that would be a over-complicated solution for a problem which, frankly, isn't even that big, or there would be technical difficulties. Still, I believe such possibilities are at least worthy considering - lest we accommodate ourselves and act as if we were in a mere extension of Wikipedia...

: My opinion on the subject is based on active observation and participation on some Q&amp;A pages. This can sometimes prove erroneous like on the C Programming Q&amp;A page that I thought was being well maintained but the person working to provide help there, on the recent RfD stated that he felt that the page wasn't of value. This puts the discussion of the value of having Q&amp;A pages in a 2 distinct POVs.
: Some fell that a Q&amp;A pages shouldn't exist at all (globally on the project), disregarding the pros and cons argumentation, I don't think that banning the pages in a policy would gather consensus and therefore it seems a futile discussion, on the other hand a guideline establishing some requirements and obligations for maintain such pages would clarify and reduce the need for wasting time discussing the deletion of such pages in RfDs. Just to be clear. Polices are enforcible and guidelines can have justified exceptions. My position on the subject is simpler, and avoid the need for writing rules down. I will not object the deletion of such pages if they aren't wanted/defended and have posts replied to by the active book community (people working consistently on that project) nor will I bring up for RfD those pages as I see them even if out of the talk namespace as simple talk pages, unless I'm working on that project I consider it outside of my right to reformat.
: As for the purpose of Q&amp;A pages I think Duplode above covers most of the rationals but I certain there are other advantages on having that centralization. The validity of that structure is similar to the reason why we have several Reading room subsections...
: The other divergent position and one that I have discussed many time before, relates to my quotation above is that the Wikimedia software has greater limitations in handling our type of project. The subject that if we keep them where do we put them. This in part relates to a political/legal position, on regarding all pages as interchanging modules, to what I don't agree in general terms (but see as a valid POV laking a clear statement from the governing body), the closest Wikimedia project to us is Wikisource not Wikipedia, talk pages shouldn't be spread across individual book pages but centralized for easy participation. Creating a new namespace in this situation would aggregate this type of talk page together but would remove the connection they should maintain to each book, so I wouldn't see it as an improvement. The same goes to supporting having them on the book's namespace, it will not only dilute the usefulness of the talk namespace but also the book's namespace, polluting the categorization of the pages. Q&amp;A pages should never be considered part of a book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:59, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::&lt;small&gt;('''the next post is a reply to Thenub314 here from the previous discussion''' on the Wikibooks:Requests for deletion thread so things are kept together)&lt;/small&gt;
:: Having the talk page annexed to the Q&amp;A doesn't seem beneficial at all, the main purpose is to discuss the book not the Q&amp;A section, people should move any discussions outside of the book scope into the user space, it is even evident by the level of activity of most Q&amp;A pages that the necessity isn't pressing (most posts that need the talk pages are in general of topic and should be in the main book's talk (if no other are indicated). Swift comments could well be made to me directly. I don't know but I presume that he knows I am mostly working there alone and that I was the creator of the project and that page. In any case a specific direction is given on that page (regrading the posts) and in the main talk page of that book asking people to use another forum.

:::I particularly don't like having [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FGeneral&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1800045&amp;oldid=1800043 my comments deleted]! Especially when I return to modify them and find they are gone.  (I even get mildly cross at having my spelling corrected outside of an actual book module.)  I was about to say that I felt I should quickly make a comment to add some context to what Panic had said.  Let me add some slightly different context to what Panic is replying to: My comments at the RfD are about a specific module, and not so appropriate for this discussion.  At least I am very clear about the fact those comments are not the ones ''I'' find relevant to this conversation.
:::That being said, let me make a general comment, because just leaving a complaint may get it deleted.  Be warned I haven't read the thread fully or taken time to digest it.  About Q&amp;A pages: I think it should be left up to the book contributors to decide if they are appropriate or not.  As far as general help pages go, I do feel the reference desk is out of place at wikipedia, but now more or less belongs there.  See my recent comments at wikipedia for a more accurate description.  The only very mild reservation about Q&amp;A pages is having the editorial staff to support them.  The same comment goes for discussion pages in general, even if all the comments are concentrated on the main page it would not help.  Zero people watching the pages of a book at the time a comment is made means no one will answer, and many books are not tended too.  This doesn't mean I think we should get rid of discussion pages or Q&amp;A pages, it is a wiki, and this is part of life on a wiki.  It is just something to think about when adding them to a book.  I certainly don't mind some unofficial guidance for editors to remind them that someone may not always be around to support such a page.  Any official policy would go ''much'' to far. Basically I feel that similar structures (Q&amp;A's, FAQ's etc.) exist in &quot;dead tree books&quot;, and I don't see why they couldn't be part of this project.  I don't think that any book that were strictly a FAQ would be useful as a textbook, but a good text book could include such a page as an appendix.  
::: Depending on the implementation of a Q&amp;A page, I would or wouldn't consider it part of the text.  If it is linked to from one of the main space pages of the book I think that there is a very serious possibility that readers will treat it as a part of the book.  It is my experience that when I give informal Q&amp;A sessions for the courses I teach most students don't turn up with questions, but rather hope to listen to the questions other people have and the answers I give.  My evaluations reflect that this is seen as part of the course and not as something informal to help them out, regardless of how I advertise it.  I see little harm putting it in the main space, and it benefits the page by giving the page its own place for discussion.
::: I think that creating a separate namespace for Q&amp;A pages is not worth the effort. Centralized discussions have their ups and downs.  An example of one problem is point of entry.  When I was adding some images to [[Calculus/Volume]] book, I remember discovering it has a ridiculously high rank on google.  It was probably number 5 on a search for &quot;Volume&quot; (thankfully this is no longer true).  Presumably the first entry point of some person may not be the main page of the book where one could see an explanation of where to leave comments. So what to do?  Well one could certainly redirect all discussion pages to a central Q&amp;A page, then when ever someone left a comment it would end up in one centralized place.  Unfortunately, if the last comment at [[Talk:Calculus/Volume]] I wouldn't know what to do with it.  It correctly pointed out an error in one equation, but wasn't overly clear about which equation it was referring too.  I myself am not entirely sure if I would categorize that comment as editorial or as content related.  If this comment were left in a centralized page it would not be so useful because I wouldn't be able to tell which equations the user was talking about. A second idea would be to add another tab to every page for Q&amp;A... not a good idea.  Or we could include a description on every talk page about how to leave a good comment, and the right place to leave it.  But I suspect we will find ourselves in an RTFM situation. I do see some benefit between separating discussions like &quot;this is how we should plan to organize the book&quot; and &quot;there is mistake in this content&quot; but I am not sure Q&amp;A pages would do this so well.

Textbooks can take on a FAQs form or have a FAQs Appendix. I think clarity on the intent is a good idea. I think whether or not people want to answer questions should be up to them. Wikipedia uses the talk pages of articles for maintenance and organizational purposes as well as for discussions. I think Wikibooks would do well to follow by example by using the talk namespace of books for maintenance and organizational purposes. I think pages of a book should consist of only what the target audience is expected to learn or know. A person interested in only reading a book probably doesn't care about any reorganization efforts, but probably does care about how this might effect the current stability and reliability of what they are reading. If a Q&amp;A page is intended to be used as some form of writer/reader interaction than I think it should be in the talk namespace. If a Q&amp;A is intended to be useful part of the book's content than of course it should be in the content namespace. I don't understand why there is such a big deal over this. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:12, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

:I am against any custom namespace created for the sole purpose of asking questions. They will simply produce tons of extra pages that we don't really need. As for whether to put Q&amp;As into talk pages or modules, I would prefer the former but I think it is up to the book contributors to decide. RfDing Q&amp;As would also be made easier without a custom namespace.

*My view is this: that [[w:Wikipedia:Reference desk]] is the proper place for asking questions not related to a particular chapter of the book. For one, you have volunteers willing to answer questions at [[w:Wikipedia:Reference desk]]. If the question is regarding some sections of the book, it would be more appropriate for the reader to bring that up in the talk space, of the chapter (modules as they are called). This will allow for improvement, in the modules, by the original contributors. Now take for example, at [[Python Programming/Q&amp;A]], undeleted by Swift, is it appropriate for questions like such? 
*Therefore Q&amp;A pages should be deleted. And creation of FAQ pages should be only be created when there is an answer for a particular question.

::A specific remedy like this can't possibly to appropriate to the circumstances of every book that has a Q&amp;A.  General discussion can work out general principles, and perhaps some techniques that ''might'' work in various situations; but deciding exactly what should be done in each particular book needs to be worked out with careful consideration of each individual book.  The implementation phase of such a program should not be expected to go quickly, as any such thing done quickly will mess up individual books.  If a general discussion produces anything, the most useful form for such a product would be a ''guideline'', which individual books would then act on in their own time.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:39, 27 May 2010 (UTC)
== Suggestions for [[Na'vi]] ==

[moving from featured book nominations]

the WP article on [[Na'vi]] has been moved here as a book. I've done some work to make it self contained, and it is stable for the moment. Would any of you who are interested mind looking it over, with an eye to what work it would need to be featured? Currently we're missing some grammatical data, simply because no-one but the author of the language knows what it is. I anticipate that the missing info will be forthcoming over the next couple months, and when it is, I'd like to be able to nominate for featured status.

:I have read over some of the books pages randomly.  My only comment is that it is occasionally still very much like reading a (extremely well written) wikipedia article. To me it seems to be more recording the facts about the language, then trying to teach the reader to learn it.  No simple examples, no translate this simple sentence.  It does explain itself fairly well, describing what different concepts are before illustrating them in this language.  I have very little experience with language texts, so I am not sure I can offer much in the way of constructive criticism.  It seems well structured, well referenced, fairly complete.  I can't think of any criteria for a featured book that it is lacking.  But I personally might have trouble learning from it.

== Quantum physics ==

The answer and solution to the question about finding the frequency of an electron with a velocity of 30000m/s is wrong.

The solution states that the frequency of the de Broglie wave for the electron is given by the kinetic energy of the elecron divided by the Planck constant. This is wrong! It is the total energy of the electron (given by E=mc2) divided by the h. Also, v=freq x wavelength refers to the phase velocity of the wave .

this is given by (mc2/h)(h/mv), where v is the group velocity of the electron = 30000m/s.
So, phase velocity - 3 x 10(12) m/s.

using f= phase velocity/wavelength = 3 x 10(12)/2.4 x 10(-8) = 1.25 x 10(20) Hz.

This agrees with f=E/h = mc2/h = 1.25 x 10(20)Hz

It takes place 25 years after the original ''I Spy'' weekly TV series featuring Bill Cosby as Alexander Scott and Robert Culp as Kelly Robinson. In the original series, Scott and Robinson were the secret agents, but in this one, Scott’s daughter Nicole and Robinson’s son Ben are the agents. The young agents are sent to Vienna to protect a defecting Russian scientist and his wife, but their fathers follow them there to make sure they don’t get hurt. 

Even though this is a post-cold war movie, the main globalization theme is the cold war spy business. It is about the battle to control access to sensitive information and technology which supposedly threatens national security. So it involves the CIA, the KGB, China, and some Russians. 

The Russian couple come to Vienna from Hungary in a Russian-made hydrofoil that is owned by a Slovakian shipping company. Even today, a Slovak company runs a hydrofoil shuttle service up and down the Danube between Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest, Hungary. 

Other locations that the movie uses to suggest the multinational or international, if not global involvement of Vienna include places like: the Vienna International Airport (VIE), and the UNO City / Vienna International Center which is shown in the background as the young agents drive into town.  

The original ''I Spy'' series which ran from 1965 to 1968 was a tongue-in-cheek adventure comedy. It was the first ever TV drama series with an African-American in a leading role. It was the first television series to be filmed mainly at international locations such as Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Greece and Morocco. It was the first to use the buddy genre in which both men were equal, not one superior to the other. This reunion movie tries to capture the same playful banter between the Cosby and Culp characters. 

The movie depicts Vienna as an historic place, a romantic and cosmopolitan place attracting tourists from around the world. There are several extended travelogue-like sequences: one through central Vienna, several chase scenes, that go through the Hofburg / the Imperial Hapsburg Palace which was capital of the Holy Roman Empire for centuries, and Franziskanerkirche (the Franciscan Church dating from the 1600s). 

The U.S. producers of ''I Spy Returns'' secured the cooperation of the City of Vienna, and financial support from the Vienna Film Financing Fund. They worked with two German- Austrian production companies, FILM-LINE GmbH and Neue Studio Film GmbH so most of the technical and production crew were local to Vienna.  

What is the global significance or impact of this movie today?

The movie shows international tensions, conflicts and distrust continuing even after the end of the Cold War. We can ask whether these post-cold war conflicts truly continue, or are depictions that perpetuate an obsolete stereotype or fear of the Russians or the Chinese?

There is reference to Saddam Hussein in this movie, long before the U.S. made its case to invade Iraq in 2003. 

With screening and security checks at all airports today, it is anachronistic to see someone pull out a pistol inside a gate area at the Vienna airport or any airport for that matter. 

As a light comedy from the mid-90s, the depiction of global issues in this movie is probably not historically or factually based, but rather a literary device based on the stereotypes of Vienna’s image and unexamined beliefs about the post-cold-war international spy business.

== Merge proposal ==

At least in its current form this chapter should be merged to the previous one, as there is very little non-redundant contents. Another option would be expanding it with more examples, but in that case it would probably be more useful to shift its focus to Law of Cosines and Law of Sines instead of just right triangles. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 00:03, 27 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.

** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

Hi, I have rejected your recent edit to the above page because I didn't know why you removed the references and links from that page.  Please try to include an ''edit summary'' in future,especially if you are removing text or references from a page.

If you haven't read it already, please see our [[WB:DP|deletion policy]]. [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:34, 1 June 2010 (UTC)}}

== About your book ==

As you are the author, you may not feel that the book should be deleted, but consider looking at the introduction alone.

===Your introduction===
'''I have been watching people spend hours and hours of their life, waisted on countless &quot;self-help&quot; books. They think that to better themselves they can read what another person thinks they should do with their life and all their issues will be solved.''' - obvious original research, and bad spelling. '''This person is probably you, and thats alright, you are at least taking the first step to solving the problem by reading my book.''' - missing apostrophe, and down there you said you aren't the only author (which is always true), and you're speaking of these in first person?

Who Are These People?
and why is he qualified to tell me who I am, or what I should do?!

The beauty of this book being moved to a wiki format writing, it will allow many people just like you to take part and be significant parts of the writing process. This means that someone who is like you, can share how they help themselves. Below is a list of current authors of this book.

Travis &quot;TeamColtra&quot; McCrea
'''My name is Travis McCrea, I am not typically a writer, and do not enjoy writing like other writers do. I am a college student enrolled to become a Public Administrator and Political Scientist. I like to write in a way that makes people think, and admittedly laugh. I will never tell you what you should do, or who you are, however, I am going to simply suggest ways as so you do not have to buy a self help book again.

I do not have a psychology degree, but I always seem to understand the emotions and feelings of others, and I can describe the way they feel back to them in a way they better understand. This will be the main effect of this book. Its not about what we can do to change who you are, its about opening up who you are so you can become more successful in your day to day life.'''

While I am not opposed to writing self-introduction of authors on Wikibooks, reading this passage alone reveals a lot.
*  'I like to write in a way that makes people think, and admittedly laugh.' Wikibooks does not accept inappropriate humour.
* 'I do not have a psychology degree, but I always seem to understand the emotions and feelings of others, and I can describe the way they feel back to them in a way they better understand. This will be the main effect of this book. Its not about what we can do to change who you are, its about opening up who you are so you can become more successful in your day to day life.' Wikbooks does not accept original research. This suggests that this book will contain loads of it.
* There was a run-on sentence.

What Can They Possibly Do For Me?
Why does they care what I do?

'''Unlike the writers of these preachy self-help books that you typically read, we don't really care for the profit, and am writing this 100% selfishly. When we walk though book stores, we get annoyed at all the books telling people how to live their lives, what they need to do to become better people, how they can win an argument whenever they want. They are often deceitful (I promise you that you will not win an argument EVERY TIME you try), they are silly, and they pray on peoples fears of being socially awkward, or their hungers to be the best.

Here is the secret to this entire book we will say it now, and put it in a bold faced type font so that if you are just thumbing through the book you start out knowing the secret: You already know what it takes to be the best you can be. Now there are guides and books to help you enhance these strengths, and marginalize the weaknesses, so we will give you a hand in that department if you still feel like you need a boost of confidence every now and then.''' - Wikibooks does not accept biased things, and this does not sound very neutral to me.

===A final bit of advice===
Have you heard of the website, [wikia.com Wikia]? If I were you, I would start my own wiki, called, say, anti-self-help-books wiki (though that might be a teensy weensy bit too long), and copy everything here to there. The policy of Wikia is not as strict, as Wikia, unlike Wikibooks, is commercial. That's why I think you're much better off at Wikia than at Wikibooks. To tell you the truth, the book has little chance of remaining in Wikibooks.

| Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &lt;nowiki&gt; ~~~~ &lt;/nowiki&gt;
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

| Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &lt;nowiki&gt; ~~~~ &lt;/nowiki&gt;
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.

** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

== 'e' and net ==

The word ''that'' in ''He hopes that his team will win'' is not a pronoun. It's a complementiser, a connecting word that heads an embedded clause and indicates its relation to the main clause. (It's in the same class as ''if'' and ''whether''.)

''That'' is a pronoun only if you use it along the lines of ''I can see that'', as a stand-alone object. Unless it's the same for Klingon, the way it's presented here is a bit confusing. (And wrong.)</text>

{{recipesummary|Spanish recipes|2 to 3|15 to 20 minutes|1}}

The '''''tortilla canaria''''' (Spanish for Canary Islands omelet) originated in Spain's Canary Islands, an island chain to the southwest of Spain and off the western coast of Africa. 

Canary Islands cuisine fuses Spanish cooking traditions with those of Africa, Latin America and the Guanche people who were original inhabitants of the Canaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vitamin A==

Fat-soluble vitamin originally isolated from fish-liver oils. It was first synthesized in 1947 as a complex molecule made of 20 carbon atoms and containing an alcohol group. The chemical was named retinol. 

====Sources====
Vitamin A is found in two sources: plants and animals.  Vitamin A that comes from animals is called preformed vitamin A.  It is absorbed in the body in the form of retinol.  Sources include liver, whole milk, and fortified foods.  Vitamin A from plants is called provitamin A carotenoid, that also can be made into retinol in the body.  The most common provitamin A cartenoids found in foods is beta-carotene, found in carrots.  The Recommended Dietary Allowance for males older than 19 is 900 mcg/day.  Females of the same age should consume higher than 700 mcg/day.  

===Dietary sources===
Retinol, together with some of its derivatives, is naturally provided by foods of animal origin, is readymade and ready for use as an active vitamin by the body. 

Natural sources : a) Retinol is found in liver, fish liver oils (cod, flounder, halibut), egg yolk, fat from dairy products ; b) b-carotene and other carotenoids with pro-vitamin A function (only a few carotenoids have such property) are present in: tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, green vegetables (spinach, broccoli, lettuce and other leafy vegetables for salads) ; apricots, mangoes, melons, pumpkins. - Toxicity : No toxicity is known for b-carotene (it can occasionally give a yellowish colour to the skin).

===Metabolism===
On the other hand, vegetable sources including fruits and proper vegetables, can provide precursors of vitamin A in the form of longer molecular chains of potential pro-vitamins belonging to the  carotenoid pigments, that can be enzymatically split and converted into active vitamin A in the linings of the small intestine. The best known form of pro-vitamin A is β-carotene, a deep-coloured pigment present in yellow, orange or red fruits and other vegetable structures. Each molecule of β-carotene can be converted into two molecules of active vitamin.  Any excess of vitamin A obtained from food is stored in the liver.  Vitamin A  used for therapeutic purposes is usually made up of 14 different isomers all of which should be present in the preparation. 
===Functions===
Vitamin  A is necessary for vision, in particular vision in dim light and night vision, where isomers of retinol are directly involved. Moreover, it protects the cells from  free-radical damage ; helps bone and teeth formation (the making of dentin requires vitamin A) ; promotes the health of skin, gums, all body linings and mucosae and stimulates them to fight infections. This vitamin is also necessary to reproduction, in particular to the production of sperm and to the development of the foetus. A considerable body of research has stressed the importance of vitamin A as modulator of the  immune function, where an important acid from retinol (retinoic acid) is specially involved. Actually, a correlation has been found in humans between the level of this vitamin and the immune response at a cellular level. Serious vitamin A deficiency is still the main cause of children death in the developing countries. 

===Recommended amounts=== 
(adults) : 900 to 1400 μg (micrograms) per day. Modern scientific unit is RE - Retinol Equivalent : 1 RE = 1μg of retinol = 6 μg of b-carotene. As to the still widely used International Unit (IU), stands the following equivalence: 1 RE = 3.3 IU  As to retinol, it is recommended  not to exceed 25.000 RE per day over prolonged periods  (3.000 RE in children). Never exceed 500.000 RE in a single dose (20.000 RE in children). In pregnancy : do not exceed 3.000 RE per day.

=====Vitamin A Deficiency=====
Vitamin A deficiency is a common problem around the world but not very problematic here in the US.  This deficiency is a result of a deficiency of zinc in the body because zinc is what makes the body have the ability to move its Vitamin A stores from the liver to the body tissues.  Blindness is the result of a severe lack of Vitamin A in one’s diet.  Vitamin A deficiency also diminishes the body’s ability to fight infections.

'''Vitamin D''' is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids, the two major physiologically relevant forms of which are vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or both. Vitamin D is produced in the skin of vertebrates after exposure to ultraviolet B light, and occurs naturally in a small range of foods. In some countries staples such as milk, flour and margarine are artificially fortified with vitamin D, and it is also available as a supplement in pill form.&lt;ref name=&quot;IoM250&quot;&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride (1997) Access date: 2010-04-14
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309063507&amp;page=250]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcidiol. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, either in the kidneys or by monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, defending the body against microbial invaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&amp;Hewison2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Adams |first1= JS|last2= Hewison|first2= M|last3= |first3= |title= Update in vitamin D|journal= J Clin Endocrinol Metab|year= 2010|month= Feb|volume= 95|issue= 2|pages= 471–8|pmid= 20133466|doi= 10.1210/jc.2009-1773 |pmc= 2840860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When synthesized in the kidneys, calcitriol circulates as a hormone, regulating, among other things, the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream, promoting the healthy mineralization, growth and remodeling of bone, and the prevention of hypocalcemic tetany. Vitamin D insufficiency can result in thin, brittle, or misshapen bones, while sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, and, together with calcium, helps to protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D also modulates neuromuscular function, reduces inflammation, and influences the action of many genes that regulate the cell proliferation|proliferation, cell differentiation|differentiation and apoptosis of cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin D|publisher=National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Spplements|accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several forms (vitamers) of vitamin D have been discovered (see table). The two major forms are vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ergocalciferol, and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or cholecalciferol. These are known collectively as '''calciferol'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary'', under Vitamin (Table of Vitamins)&lt;/ref&gt; Ergocalciferol|Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was chemically characterized in 1932. In 1936 the chemical structure of Cholecalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was established and resulted from the ultraviolet|ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitamind.ucr.edu/history.html History of Vitamin D] University of California, Riverside, Vitamin D Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemically, the various forms of vitamin D are secosteroids; i.e., steroids in which one of the bonds in the steroid rings is broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;River&quot;&gt;[http://vitamind.ucr.edu/about.html About Vitamin D] Including Sections: History, Nutrition, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Diseases. University of California Riverside&lt;/ref&gt; The structural difference between vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is in their side chains. The side chain of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains a double bond between carbons 22 and 23, and a methyl group on carbon 24.

Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (made from ergosterol) is produced by invertebrates, fungus and plants in response to UV irradiation; it is not produced by vertebrates. Little is known about the biologic function of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in nonvertebrate species. Because ergosterol can more efficiently absorb the ultraviolet radiation that can damage DNA, RNA and protein it has been suggested that ergosterol serves as a sunscreening system that protects organisms from damaging high energy ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holick_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14985208 |year=2004 |last1=Holick |first1=MF |title=Vitamin D: importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=362–71 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is made in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol reacts with UVB ultraviolet light at wavelengths between 270–300&amp;nbsp;nm, with peak synthesis occurring between 295-297&amp;nbsp;nm.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These wavelengths are present in sunlight when the UV index is greater than 3. At this solar elevation, which occurs daily within the tropics, daily during the spring and summer seasons in temperate regions, and almost never within the arctic circles, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be made in the skin.  Depending on the concentration of UVB rays and the minutes of exposure, an equilibrium can develop in the skin, and vitamin D degrades as fast as it is generated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
=== Production in the skin ===
[[File:Skinlayers.png|thumb|The epidermal strata of the skin. Production is greatest in the stratum basale (colored red in the illustration) and stratum spinosum (colored orange).]]

The skin consists of two primary layers: the inner layer called the dermis, composed largely of connective tissue, and the outer, thinner epidermis (skin)|epidermis. The epidermis consists of five ''strata''; from outer to inner they are: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.

Cholecalciferol is produced photochemically in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol; 7-dehydrocholesterol is produced in relatively large quantities in the skin of most vertebrate animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12514284 |year=2003 |last1=Crissey |first1=SD |last2=Ange |first2=KD |last3=Jacobsen |first3=KL |last4=Slifka |first4=KA |last5=Bowen |first5=PE |last6=Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis |first6=M |last7=Langman |first7=CB |last8=Sadler |first8=W |last9=Kahn |first9=S |title=Serum concentrations of lipids, vitamin d metabolites, retinol, retinyl esters, tocopherols and selected carotenoids in twelve captive wild felid species at four zoos |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=160–6 |journal=The Journal of nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naked mole rat appears to be naturally cholecalciferol deficient as serum 25-OH vitamin D levels are undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8384476 |year=1993 |last1=Yahav |first1=S |last2=Buffenstein |first2=R |title=Cholecalciferol supplementation alters gut function and improves digestibility in an underground inhabitant, the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), when fed on a carrot diet |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=233–41 |journal=The British journal of nutrition |doi=10.1079/BJN19930025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, the naked mole rat is resistant to aging, maintains healthy vascular function&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17468332 |year=2007 |last1=Csiszar |first1=A |last2=Labinskyy |first2=N |last3=Orosz |first3=Z |last4=Xiangmin |first4=Z |last5=Buffenstein |first5=R |last6=Ungvari |first6=Z |title=Vascular aging in the longest-living rodent, the naked mole rat |volume=293 |issue=2 |pages=H919–27 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.01287.2006 |journal=American journal of physiology.

In some animals, the presence of fur or feathers blocks the UV rays from reaching the skin. In birds and fur-bearing mammals, vitamin D is generated from the oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the fur and obtained orally during grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sam D. |last1=Stout |first2=Sabrina C. |last2=Agarwal |last3=Stout |first3=Samuel D. |title=Bone loss and osteoporosis: an anthropological perspective |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=0-306-47767-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, it was established that when 7-Dehydrocholesterol|7-dehydrocholesterol is irradiated with light, a form of a fat-soluble vitamin is produced. Alfred Fabian Hess showed that &quot;light equals vitamin D&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 UNRAVELING THE ENIGMA OF VITAMIN D] U.S. National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus|Adolf Windaus, at the University of Göttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928, for his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1928/windaus-bio.html |title=Windaus biography at |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1959-06-09 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s he clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D.

Human cultures can play a big role in determining sun exposure in their Vitamin D level.

| Whether it is made in the skin or ingested, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (cholecalciferol) is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or calcidiol) by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase produced by hepatocytes. This hydroxylation reaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires NADPH, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; yet it is not a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Once made the product is stored in the hepatocytes until it is needed and then can be released into the plasma where it will be bound to an α-globulin.
25-hydroxycholecalciferol is then transported to the proximal tubules of the kidneys where it can be hydroxylated by one of two enzymes to different forms of vitamin D, one of which is active vitamin D (1,25-OH D) and another which is inactive vitamin D (24,25-OH D). The enzyme 1α-hydroxylase which is activated by parathyroid hormone (and additionally by low calcium or phosphate) forms the main biologically active vitamin D hormone with a C1 hydroxylation forming 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as calcitriol). A separate enzyme hydroxylates the C24 atom forming 24R,25(OH)2D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; when 1α-hydroxylase is not active, this inactivates the molecule from any biological activity.
Calcitriol is represented below right (hydroxylated Carbon 1 is on the lower ring at right, hydroxylated Carbon 25 is at the upper right end).

=== Mechanism of action ===

Following the final converting step in the kidney, calcitriol (the physiologically active form of vitamin D) is released into the circulation. By binding to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), a carrier protein in the blood plasma|plasma, calcitriol is transported to various target organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;River&quot; /&gt;

Calcitriol mediates its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is principally located in the Cell nucleus|nuclei of target cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;River&quot; /&gt; The binding of calcitriol to the VDR allows the VDR to act as a transcription factor that modulates the gene expression of transport proteins (such as TRPV6 and calbindin), which are involved in calcium absorption in the intestine.

The vitamin D receptor belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of steroid hormone receptor|steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, and VDRs are expressed by cells in most organ (biology)|organs, including the brain, heart, skin, gonads, prostate, and breast. VDR activation in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland cells leads to the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and to the maintenance of bone content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15585788 |year=2004 |last1=Holick |first1=MF |title=Sunlight and vitamin D for bone health and prevention of autoimmune diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular disease |volume=80 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1678S–88S |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VDR is known to be involved in cell proliferation and cellular differentiation|differentiation. Vitamin D also #Role in immunomodulation|affects the immune system, and VDRs are expressed in several white blood cells, including monocytes and activated T cell|T and B cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDR&quot;&gt;[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/vit_0265.shtml Vitamin D] The Physicians Desk Reference. 2006 Thompson Healthcare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from VDR activation, various alternative mechanisms of action are known. An important one of these is its role as a natural inhibitor of signal transduction by hedgehog signaling pathway|hedgehog (a hormone involved in morphogenesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16895439 |year=2006 |last1=Bijlsma |first1=MF |last2=Spek |first2=CA |last3=Zivkovic |first3=D |last4=Van De Water |first4=S |last5=Rezaee |first5=F |last6=Peppelenbosch |first6=MP |title=Repression of smoothened by patched-dependent (pro-)vitamin D3 secretion |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e232 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040232 |pmc=1502141 |journal=PLoS biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/713649_3 |title=Hedgehog signaling and Vitamin D |publisher=Medscape.com |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition ==

Vitamin D is naturally produced by the human body when exposed to direct sunlight. In many countries, such foods as milk, yogurt, margarine, Cooking oil|oil spreads, breakfast cereal, pastries, and bread are food fortification|fortified with vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nowson&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12149085 |year=2002 |last1=Nowson |first1=CA |last2=Margerison |first2=C |title=Vitamin D intake and vitamin D status of Australians |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=149–52 |journal=The Medical journal of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, for example, fortified milk typically provides 100&amp;nbsp;IU per cup (1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg), or a quarter of the estimated adequate intake for adults over age 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holick2&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.uvadvantage.org/portals/0/pres/ |title=The Vitamin D Pandemic and its Health Consequences |last1=Holick |first1=Michael |month=May |year=2007 |conference=34th European Symposium on Calcified Tissues |location=Copenhagen |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States (U.S.), typical diets provide about 100 IU/day.

A study by Semira Manaseki-Holland, M. Zulf Mughal, Zulfiqar Bhutta and
M. Qasem Shams showed that in developing countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, 
China, And Syria children are low on Vitamin D. This is due to lack of fish, eggs , and liver in their diet and a general lack of access to diverse foods.  &lt;ref&gt;Manaseki-Holland, S. et al., 2008.

=== Mortality ===

Using information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey a group of researchers concluded that having low levels of vitamin D (&lt;17.8&amp;nbsp;ng/ml) was independently associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Melamed ML, Michos ED, Post W, Astor B |title=25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk of mortality in the general population |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=168 |issue=15 |pages=1629–37 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18695076 |pmc=2677029 |doi=10.1001/archinte.168.15.1629}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study evaluated whether low serum vitamin D levels were associated with all-cause mortality, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among 13,331 diverse American adults who were 20 years or older. Vitamin D levels of these participants were collected over a 6-year period (from 1988 through 1994), and individuals were passively followed for mortality through the year 2000. Shortening of leukocyte telomeres is a marker of aging. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) predicts the development of aging-related disease, and length of these telomeres decreases with each cell division and with increased inflammation (more common in the elderly). Vitamin D can inhibit proinflammatory overeaction and slow the turnover of leukocytes, longer leukocyte telomere length is achieved by the body maintaining the optimal vitamin D concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richards JB, Valdes AM, Gardner JP, ''et al.'' |title=Higher serum vitamin D concentrations are associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in women |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=1420–5 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17991655 |pmc=2196219 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/86/5/1420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equality and other comparisons ==

In the last chapter, we saw how to use the equals sign to define variables and functions in Haskell. The following code

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r = 5
&lt;/source&gt;

causes occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; to be replaced by &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; in all places where it makes sense to do so according to the scope of the definition. Similarly,

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = x + 3
&lt;/source&gt;

causes occurrences of &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; followed by a number (which is taken as &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;'s argument) to be replaced by that number plus three.

In mathematics, however, the equals sign is also used in a subtly different and equally important way. For instance, consider this simple problem:

{{HaskellExample|Solve the following equation:|&lt;math&gt;x+3=5&lt;/math&gt;}}

When we look at a problem like this one, our immediate concern is not the ability to represent the value &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt;, or vice-versa. Instead, we read the &lt;math&gt;x+3=5&lt;/math&gt; equation as a ''proposition'', which says that some number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gives 5 as result when added to 3. Solving the equation means finding which, if any, values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; make that proposition true. In this example, we can use elementary algebra to determine that &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. 2 is the number we need to substitute to make the equation true, giving &lt;math&gt;2+3=5&lt;/math&gt;.

Comparing values to see if they are equal is also useful in programming. Haskell allows us to write such tests in a natural way that looks just like an equation. Since the equals sign is already used for defining things, we use a ''double'' equals sign, &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; instead. To see that at work, you can start GHCi and enter the proposition we wrote above like this:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 + 3 == 5
True
}}

GHCi returns &quot;True&quot; because &lt;math&gt;2 + 3&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 5. What if we use an equation that is not true?

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 7 + 3 == 5
False
}}

Nice and coherent. The next step is to use our own functions in these tests. Let us try it with the function &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; we mentioned at the start of the module:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; let f x = x + 3
Prelude&gt; f 2 == 5
True
}}

Just as expected, since &lt;tt&gt;f 2&lt;/tt&gt; is just &lt;tt&gt;2 + 3&lt;/tt&gt;.

In addition to tests for equality, we can just as easily compare two numerical values to see which one is larger. Haskell provides a number of tests including: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; (less than), &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (greater than), &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (less than or equal to) and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;  (greater than or equal to), which work just like &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; (equal to). For a simple application, we could use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; alongside the &lt;tt&gt;area&lt;/tt&gt; function from the previous module to see whether a circle of a certain radius would have an area smaller than some value.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r^2
Prelude&gt; area 5 &lt; 50
False
}}

== Boolean values ==

Now we know that GHCi can tell us whether some arithmetical propositions are true or false. That's all fine and dandy, but how could that help us to write programs? And what is actually going on when GHCi &quot;answers&quot; such &quot;questions&quot;?

To understand what is happening, consider a different but related issue. If we enter an arithmetical expression in GHCi the expression gets ''evaluated'', and the resulting numerical value is displayed on the screen:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 + 2
4
}}

If we replace the arithmetical expression with an equality comparison, something similar seems to happen:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 == 2
True
}}

But ''what'' is that &quot;True&quot; that gets displayed? It certainly does not look like a number. We can think of it as something that tells us about the veracity of the proposition &lt;tt&gt;2 == 2&lt;/tt&gt;. From that point of view, it makes sense to regard it as a ''value'' – except that instead of representing some kind of count, quantity, etc. it stands for the truth of a proposition. Such values are called '''truth values''', or '''boolean values'''&lt;ref&gt;The term is a tribute to the mathematician and philosopher [[w:George Boole|George Boole]].&lt;/ref&gt;. Naturally, there are only two possible boolean values – &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== An introduction to types ===

When we say &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; are values, we are not just making an analogy. Boolean values have the same status as numerical values in Haskell, and indeed you can manipulate them just as well. One trivial example would be equality tests on truth values:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; True == True
True
Prelude&gt; True == False
False
}}

&lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; is indeed equal to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; is not equal to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt;. Now, quickly: can you answer whether &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; is equal to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;?

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 == True

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Num Bool)
      arising from the literal `2' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
    In the first argument of `(==)', namely `2'
    In the expression: 2 == True
    In the definition of `it': it = 2 == True
}}

The correct answer is you ''can't'', because the question just does not make sense. It is impossible to compare a number with something that is not a number, or a boolean with something that is not a boolean. Haskell incorporates that notion, and the ugly error message we got is, in essence, stating exactly that. Ignoring all of the obfuscating clutter (which we will get to understand eventually), that message says that there was a number (&lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;) on the left side of the &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;, and so some kind of number was expected on the right side; however, a boolean value (&lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;) is not a number, and so the equality test exploded into flames.

Thus, the general concept is that values have '''types''', and these types define what we can or cannot do with the values. In this case, for instance, &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; is a value of type &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, as is &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; (as for the &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, while there is a well-defined concept of number in Haskell the situation is slightly more complicated, so we will defer the explanation for a little while). Types are a very powerful tool because they provide a way to regulate the behaviour of values with rules which ''make sense'', making it easier to write programs that work correctly. We will come back to the topic of types many times as they are very important to Haskell.

== Infix operators ==

What we have seen so far leads us to the conclusion that an equality test like &lt;tt&gt;2 == 2&lt;/tt&gt; is an expression just like &lt;tt&gt;2 + 2&lt;/tt&gt;, and that it also evaluates to a value in pretty much the same way. That fact is actually given a passing mention on the ugly error message we got on the previous example:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
    In the expression: 2 == True
}}

Therefore, when we type &lt;tt&gt;2 == 2&lt;/tt&gt; in the prompt and GHCi &quot;answers&quot; &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; it is just evaluating an expression. But there is a deeper truth involved in this process. A hint is provided by the very same error message: 

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
     In the first argument of `(==)', namely `2'
}}

GHCi called &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; the first ''argument'' of &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt;. In the previous module, we used ''argument'' to describe the values we feed a function with so that it evaluates to a result. It turns out that &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; is just a function, which takes two arguments, namely the left side and the right side of the equality test. The only special thing about it is the syntax: Haskell allows two-argument functions with names composed only of non-alphanumeric characters to be used as ''infix operators'', that is, placed between their arguments. The only caveat is that if you wish to use such a function in the &quot;standard&quot; way (writing the function name before the arguments, as a ''prefix operator'') the function name must be enclosed in parentheses. So the following expressions are completely equivalent:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 + 9 == 13
True
Prelude&gt; (==) (4 + 9) 13
True
}}

This makes it clear how &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; is a function with two arguments just like &lt;tt&gt;areaRect&lt;/tt&gt; from the previous module. What's more, the same considerations apply to the other ''relational operators'' we mentioned (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;) and to the arithmetical operators (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) – all of them are just functions. This generality is an illustration of one of the strengths of Haskell: it is a language with very few &quot;special cases&quot;, which helps to keep things simple. In general, we can say that all tangible things in Haskell are either values or functions.&lt;ref&gt;In case you found this statement bold, know that we will go even further in due course.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boolean operations ==

To see both truth values and infix operators in action, let's consider the boolean operations which manipulate truth values as in logic propositions. Haskell provides us three basic functions for that purpose:

* &lt;tt&gt;(&amp;&amp;)&lt;/tt&gt; performs the ''and'' operation. Given two boolean values, it evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; if both the first and the second are &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;, and to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; (3 &lt; 8) &amp;&amp; (False == False)
True
Prelude&gt; (&amp;&amp;) (6 &lt;= 5) (1 == 1) 
False
}}

* &lt;tt&gt;(||)&lt;/tt&gt; performs the ''or'' operation. Given two boolean values, it evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; if either the first or the second are &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; (or if both are true), and to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; (2 + 2 == 5) {{!!}} (2 &gt; 0)
True
Prelude&gt; ({{!!}}) (18 == 17) (9 &gt;= 11)
False
}}

* &lt;tt&gt;not&lt;/tt&gt; performs the negation of a boolean value; that is, it converts &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; and vice-versa.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; not (5 * 2 == 10)
False
}}

Another relational operator is ''not equal to''. It is already provided by Haskell as the &lt;tt&gt;(/=)&lt;/tt&gt; function, but if we were to implement it ourselves, a natural way would be:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x /= y = not (x == y)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that it is perfectly legal syntax to write operators infix, even when defining them. Completely new operators can also be created out of ASCII symbols (which means mostly the common symbols used on a keyboard).

== Guards ==

Now we have explored what is really happening with boolean operators, but we've done little more than testing one-line expressions here. We still don't know how this can be used to make real programs. We will tackle this issue by introducing ''guards'', a feature that relies on boolean values and allows us to write more interesting functions.

Let us implement the absolute value function. The absolute value of a number is the number with its sign discarded&lt;ref&gt;Technically, that just covers how to get the absolute value of a ''real'' number, but let's ignore this detail for now.&lt;/ref&gt;; so if the number is negative (that is, smaller than zero) the sign is inverted; otherwise it remains unchanged. We could write the definition as:

&lt;math&gt;|x| = \begin{cases} x, &amp; \mbox{if }  x \ge 0  \\ -x,  &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; 

Here, the actual expression to be used for calculating &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; depends on a set of propositions made about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is true, then we use the first expression, but if &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is the case, then we use the second expression instead. We need a way to express this decision process in Haskell. Using guards, the implementation could look like this:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;tt&gt;abs&lt;/tt&gt; is also provided by Haskell, so in a real-world situation you don't need to worry about providing an implementation yourself.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{HaskellExample|1=The abs function.|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
abs x
    | x &lt; 0     = 0 - x
    | otherwise = x
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Remarkably, the above code is about as readable as the corresponding mathematical definition. Let us dissect the components of the definition:

* We start just like a normal function definition, providing a name for the function, &lt;tt&gt;abs&lt;/tt&gt;, and saying it will take a single parameter, which we will name &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;.

* Instead of just following with the &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; and the right-hand side of the definition, we entered a line break, and, following it, the two alternatives, placed in separate lines.&lt;ref&gt;We ''could'' have joined the lines and written everything in a single line, but in this case it would be a lot less readable.&lt;/ref&gt; These alternatives are the ''guards'' proper. Note that the whitespace is not just for aesthetic reasons; it is necessary for the code to be parsed correctly.

* Each of the guards begins with a pipe character, &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;. After the pipe, we put an expression which evaluates to a boolean (also called a boolean condition or a ''predicate''), which is followed by the rest of the definition – the equals sign and the right-hand side which should be used if the predicate evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;.

* The &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; case is used when none of the preceding predicates evaluate to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt;. In this case, if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is not smaller than zero, it must be greater than or equal to zero, so the final predicate could have just as easily been &lt;tt&gt;x &gt;= 0&lt;/tt&gt;; but &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; works just as well.

{{body note |There is no syntactical magic behind &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt;. It is defined alongside the default variables and functions of Haskell as simply

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;otherwise = True&lt;/source&gt;

This definition makes ''otherwise'' a catch-all guard. As evaluation of the guard predicates is sequential, the &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; predicate will only be reached if none of the other ones evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; (so make sure you always place ''otherwise'' as the last guard!). In general, it is a good idea to always provide an &lt;tt&gt;otherwise&lt;/tt&gt; guard, because a rather ugly runtime error will be produced if none of the predicates is true for some input. 
}}

{{body note |You might be wondering why we wrote &lt;tt&gt;0 - x&lt;/tt&gt; and not simply &lt;tt&gt;-x&lt;/tt&gt; to denote the sign inversion. Truth is, we could have written the first guard as

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;    | x &lt; 0    = -x &lt;/source&gt;

and it would have worked just as well. The only issue is that this way of expressing sign inversion is actually one of the few &quot;special cases&quot; in Haskell, in that in this case the &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; is ''not'' a function that takes one argument and evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;0 - x&lt;/tt&gt;, but just a syntactical abbreviation. While very handy, this shortcut occasionally conflicts with the usage of &lt;tt&gt;(-)&lt;/tt&gt; as an actual function (the subtraction operator), which is a potential source of annoyance (for example, try writing three minus negative-four without using any parentheses for grouping). Here, we wrote &lt;tt&gt;0 - x&lt;/tt&gt; explicitly so that we could take the opportunity to point out this issue.
}}

=== &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; and Guards ===

&lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses are particularly handy when used with guards. For instance, consider a function which computes the number of (real) solutions for a [[w:Quadratic equation|quadratic equation]], &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;!-- I don't like this example, but still couldn't think of anything more meaningful with only bare numbers. Suggestions are welcome... --&gt;

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
numOfSolutions a b c
    | disc &gt; 0  = 2
    | disc == 0 = 1
    | otherwise = 0
        where
        disc = b^2 - 4*a*c
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;where&lt;/tt&gt; definition is within the scope of all of the guards, sparing us from repeating the expression for &lt;tt&gt;disc&lt;/tt&gt;.

Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (folic acid and folate inclusive) is essential nutrient|essential to numerous physiology|bodily functions ranging from nucleotide biosynthesis to the methylation|remethylation of homocysteine. The human body needs folate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in biological reactions involving folate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Weinstein SJ et al Null Association Between Prostate Cancer and Serum Folate, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and Homocysteine Vol 12 pg 1271-1272 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, &amp; Prevention November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially important during periods of rapid cell division and cell growth|growth. Both children and adults require folic acid to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Folate. | publisher = Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health | url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/folate.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folate and folic acid derive their names from the Latin word ''Wiktionary:folium|folium'' (which means &quot;leaf&quot;).  Leafy vegetables are a principal source, although in Western diets fortified cereals and bread may be a larger dietary source.

&lt;!-- the following paragraph should be re-written --&gt;
A lack of diet (nutrition)|dietary folic acid leads to folate deficiency (FD).  This can result in many health problems, most notably neural tube defects in developing embryos. Low folate can also lead to homocysteine accumulation as a result of one carbon metabolism mechanism methylation being impaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; DNA synthesis and repair are impaired and this could lead to cancer development.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Supplementation in patients with ischaemic heart disease may however lead to increased rates of cancer and all-cause mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;jama.ama-assn.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ebbing M, Bønaa KH, Nygård O, ''et al.''|title=Cancer incidence and mortality after treatment with folic acid and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=JAMA|year=2009|volume=302|issue=19|pages=2119&amp;ndash;26|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1622|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/302/19/2119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 opinion article in the New York Times &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/opinion/03kristof.html New York Times World's Healthiest Foods]&lt;/ref&gt; named micronutrients, especially folic acid, the &quot;world's most luscious food&quot; since absence of folic acid and a handful of other micronutrients causes otherwise-preventable deformities and diseases, especially in fetal development. Adding folic acid and micronutrients to the food supply of developing countries would have a greater impact than any other single action in improving world health.

==Dietary reference intake==
Because of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) system was established. 1 DFE is defined as 1 μg (microgram) of dietary folate, or 0.6 μg of folic acid supplement.

==Folate in foods and other sources==
Certain foods are very high in folate:
*Leafy vegetables such as spinach, asparagus, turnip|turnip greens,
*Legumes such as dried or fresh beans, peas and lentils
*Liver (food)|Liver and liver products also contain high amounts of folate.
*baker's yeast,
*fortified grain products (pasta, cereal, bread), Some breakfast cereals (ready-to-eat and others) are fortified with 25% to 100% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for folic acid.
*sunflower seeds

Moderate amounts:

*certain fruits (orange juice, canned pineapple juice, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, grapefruit juice, banana, raspberry, grapefruit, strawberry) and vegetables (beets, corn, tomato juice, vegetable juice,  broccoli, brussels sprouts,  romaine lettuce, bok choy),&lt;ref name=&quot;eatrightontario.ca&quot;&gt;http://www.eatrightontario.ca/en/ViewDocument.aspx?id=109&lt;/ref&gt; beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/cienciaesaude/ultimas-noticias/estado/2010/03/29/cerveja-tem-vitamina-que-combate-anemia-revela-pesquisa.jhtm]&lt;/ref&gt;

J Am Coll Nutr 24, 266-274.&lt;/ref&gt;. Because of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) system was established. 1 DFE is defined as 1 μg of dietary folate, or 0.6 μg of folic acid supplement. This is reduced to 0.5 μg of folic acid if the supplement is taken on an empty stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Suitor CW &amp; Bailey LB (2000) Dietary folate equivalents: interpretation and application.

Folic acid naturally found in food is susceptible to high heat, UV, and is soluble in water.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyondveg.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-2e.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is heat labile in acidic environments and may also be subject to oxidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyondveg.com&quot;/&gt;

Some meal replacement products do not meet the folate requirements as specified by the RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanillas M, Moya Chimenti E, González Candela C, Loria Kohen V, Dassen C, Lajo T. Nutr Hosp. 2009 Sep-Oct;24(5):535-42. Usefulness of meal replacement: analysis of the principal meal replacement products commercialised in Spain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to biologically active derivatives==

All the biological functions of folic acid are performed by tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives. Their biological availability to the body depends upon dihydrofolate reductase action in the liver. This action is unusually slow in humans being less than 2% of that in rats. Moreover, in contrast to rats, an almost 5-fold variation in the activity of this enzyme exists between humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;/&gt; Due to this low activity it has been suggested that this limits the conversion of folic acid into its biologically active forms &quot;when folic acid is consumed at levels higher than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (1 mg/d for adults).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;/&gt;

==History==
In the 1920s scientists believed that folate deficiency and anemia were the same condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;&gt;Lanska DJ. Handb Clin Neurol. 2009;95:445-76. Chapter 30 Historical aspects of the major neurological vitamin deficiency disorders: the water-soluble B vitamins.&lt;/ref&gt; A key observation by researcher Lucy Wills in 1931 led to the identification of folate as the nutrient needed to prevent anemia during pregnancy. Dr. Wills demonstrated that anemia could be reversed with brewer's yeast. Folate was identified as the corrective substance in brewer's yeast in the late 1930s and was first isolated in and extracted from spinach leaves by Mitchell and others in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mitchell HK, Snell EE, Williams RJ |title=The concentration of &quot;folic acid&quot; |journal=J Am Chem Soc. |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=2284 |year=1941 |doi=10.1021/ja01853a512 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01853a512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Stokstad isolated the pure crystalline form in 1943, and was able to determine its chemical structure while working at the Lederle Laboratories of the American Cyanamid Company&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffbrand AV 2001&quot;&gt;Hoffbrand AV &amp; Weir DG (2001) The history of folic acid. Br J Haematol 113, 579-589.&lt;/ref&gt;. This historical research project, of obtaining folic acid in a pure crystalline form in 1945, was done by the team called the &quot;folic acid boys,&quot; under the supervision and guidance of Director of Research Dr. Yellapragada Subbarao, at the Lederley Lab, Pearl River, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Angier RB, Boothe JH, Hutchings BL, Mowat JH, Semb J, Stokstad EL, Subbarow Y, Waller CW, Cosulich DB, Fahrenbach MJ, Hultquist ME, Kuh E, Northey EH, Seeger DR, Sickels JP &amp; Smith JM, Jr.helped the process of research(1945) Synthesis of a Compound Identical with the L. Casei Factor Isolated from Liver. Science 102, 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; This research subsequently led to the synthesis of the antifolate Aminopterin, the first ever anti-cancer drug, the clinical proof of its efficacy was proven by Dr. S. Farber in 1948. In the 1950s and 1960s scientists began to discover the biochemical mechanisms of action for folate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;/&gt; In 1960 experts first linked folate deficiency to neural tube defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;/&gt; In the late 1990s US scientists realized that despite folate being available in foods and in supplements, there was still a challenge for people to meet their daily folate requirements, and that is when the US implemented the folate fortification program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanska&quot;/&gt;

==Biological roles==
Image:Folat.svg|thumb|A diagram of the chemical structure of folate.
=== DNA and cell division ===
Folate is necessary for the production and maintenance of new cell (biology)|cells, for DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis, and for preventing changes to DNA and thus preventing cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kamen B | title=Folate and antifolate pharmacology | journal=Seminars in oncology | volume=24 | issue=5 Suppl 18 | year=1997 | pages=S18–30–9 | pmid=9420019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially important during periods of rapid cell division and growth such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate is needed to carry one carbon groups for methylation reactions and nucleic acid synthesis (most notably thymine, but also purine bases).&lt;ref&gt;figueiredo et al 2009 Folic Acid and Risk or Prostate Cancer: Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting hematopoietic cells and neoplasms the most because of rapid cell division. RNA transcription, and subsequent protein synthesis, are less affected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as opposed to DNA synthesis where a new genomic copy must be created). Since folate deficiency limits cell division, erythropoiesis, production of red blood cells is hindered and leads to megaloblastic anemia which is characterized by large immature red blood cells. This pathology results from persistently thwarted attempts at normal DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell division, and produces abnormally large red cells called megaloblasts (and hypersegmented neutrophils) with abundant cytoplasm capable of RNA and protein synthesis, but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin. Some of these large cells, although immature (reticulocytes), are released early from the marrow in an attempt to compensate for the anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith C, Lieberman M, Marks DB, Marks AD |title=Marks' essential medical biochemistry |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9340-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both adults and children need folate to make normal red and white blood cells and prevent anemia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Zittoun J | title=Anemias due to disorder of folate, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;12&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and transcobalamin metabolism | journal=La Revue du praticien | volume=43 | issue=11 | year=1993 | pages=1358–63 | pmid=8235383}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiency of folate in pregnant women has been implicated in neural tube defects (NTD); therefore, many developed countries have implemented mandatory folic acid fortification in cereals, etc. It must be noted that NTD's occur early in pregnancy (first month) therefore women must have abundant folate upon conception. Folate is required to make red blood cells and white blood cells and folate deficiency may lead to anemia which further leads to fatigue (medical)|fatigue and weakness and inability to concentrate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthfiles/hfile68g.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biochemistry of DNA base and amino acid production ===

Image:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|Right|Metabolism of folic acid to produce methyl-vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;

In the form of a series of tetrahydrofolate (THF) compounds, folate derivatives are substrate (biochemistry)|substrates in a number of single-carbon-transfer reactions, and also are involved in the synthesis of dTMP (2′-deoxythymidine-5′-phosphate) from dUMP (2′-deoxyuridine-5′-phosphate). It is a substrate for an important reaction that involves vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and it is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, and so required for all dividing cells.&lt;ref&gt;Goh YI &amp; Koren G (2008) Folic acid in pregnancy and fetal outcomes. J Obstet Gynaecol 28, 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pathway leading to the formation of tetrahydrofolate (FH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) begins when folate (F) is redox|reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) (FH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is then reduced to THF. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyses the last step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.expasy.org/enzyme/1.5.1.3 EC 1.5.1.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the form of NADPH is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis.

Methylene-THF (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed from THF by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Methyl tetrahydrofolate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. It is important to note that Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the only acceptor of methyl-THF. There is also only one acceptor for methyl-B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; which is homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by homocysteine methyltransferase. This is important because a defect in homocysteine methyltransferase or a deficiency of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; can lead to a methyl-trap of THF and a subsequent deficiency&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffbrand AV 2001&quot;/&gt;. Thus, a deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; can generate a large pool of methyl-THF that is unable to undergo reactions and will mimic folate deficiency. Another form of THF, formyl-THF or folinic acid) results from oxidation of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Finally, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.

In other words:
: folate → dihydrofolate → tetrahydrofolate ↔ methylene-THF → methyl-THF

==== Overview of drugs that interfere with folate reactions ====
A number of drugs interfere with the biosynthesis of folic acid and THF. Among them are the :Category:Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors|dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim, pyrimethamine and methotrexate; the Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides (competitive inhibitors of 4-aminobenzoic acid in the reactions of dihydropteroate synthetase).

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988–91) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–96 CSFII) indicated that most adults did not consume adequate folate.&lt;!--

==Health issues==
===Human reproduction===&lt;!--linked from &quot;fertility&quot;-section in this article--&gt;
Folic acid is an important nutrient for women who may become Pregnancy|pregnant, because a woman's blood levels of folate fall during pregnancy due to an increased maternal RBC synthesis in the first half of the pregnancy and fetal demands in the second half.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr&quot;/&gt; The first four weeks of pregnancy (when most women do not even realize they are pregnant) require folic acid for proper development of the brain, skull, and spinal cord.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatrightontario.ca&quot;/&gt; Serious birth defects like neural tube defects are less likely to occur when women take 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg of folic acid daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatrightontario.ca&quot;/&gt; Adequate folate intake during the preconception period, the time right before and just after a woman becomes pregnant, helps protect against a number of congenital malformations including neural tube defects (which are the most notable birth defects that occur from folate deficiency).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_21&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shaw GM, Schaffer D, Velie EM, Morland K, Harris JA|title=Periconceptional vitamin use, dietary folate, and the occurrence of neural tube defects|journal=Epidemiology|volume=6|issue=3|year=1995|pages=219–226|pmid=7619926|doi=10.1097/00001648-199505000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or take supplements in addition to eating folate-rich foods to reduce the risk of some serious birth defects.

A survey of folic acid use in primigravid women.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking 400 micrograms of synthetic folic acid daily from fortified foods and/or supplements has been suggested. The RDA for folate equivalents for pregnant women is 600-800 micrograms, twice the normal RDA of 400 micrograms for women who are not pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/health_recomm.htm Health Professionals Recommendations, Folic Acid, NCBDDD, CDC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published by Milunski et al. has indicated that women who took folic acid supplements during the course of pregnancy can dramatically reduce the prevalence of infant neural tube defects by 3.9 times.  The prevalence had dropped from 3.5 to 0.9 defects per 1000 births.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/eks/Milunsky1989.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the recommended folic acid intake for women planning for pregnancy is 400 micrograms per day, the mechanisms and reasons why folic acid prevents birth defects is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steegers-Theunissen&quot;&gt;Steegers-Theunissen RP et al., PLoS One. 2009 Nov 16;4(11):e7845. Periconceptional maternal folic acid use of 400 microg per day is related to increased methylation of the IGF2 gene in the very young child.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene is differentially methylated and these changes in IGF2 result in improved intrauterine growth and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steegers-Theunissen&quot;/&gt;

Folate deficiency during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm delivery, infant low birth weight, and fetal growth retardation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Folic acid: influence on the outcome of pregnancy, Scholl TO et al, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol. 71, No. 5, 1295S-1303s, May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Folate deficiency in the mother increases homocysteine level in the blood which may lead to spontaneous abortion and pregnancy complications such as placental abruption and preeclampsia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Recently studies have been conducted to test the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but evidence so far has been weak.&lt;ref&gt;Milne E et al., Maternal folate and other vitamin supplementation during pregnancy and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the offspring.

Folic acid may also reduce chromosomal defects in sperm to some extent, which may be relevant for men considering to father a child.&lt;ref name=Youngetal&gt;[http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/DietNutrition/tb/8825 Medical News: Extra Folate for Men May Reduce Birth Defects - in Primary Care, Diet &amp; Nutrition from MedPage Today]; citing S.S.

===Heart disease===
An estimated 13,500 deaths occur annually due to folate deficiency's effect on coronary artery disease and the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke has been reduced by 15% since folate fortification regulations were enforced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/N3401.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Adequate concentrations of folate, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, or vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; may decrease the circulating level of homocysteine, an amino acid normally found in blood. There is evidence that an elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_30&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Refsum H, Ueland PM, Nygard O, Vollset SE | title=Homocysteine and cardiovascular disease | journal=Annual Review of Medicine | volume=49 | issue=1 | year=1998 | pages=31–62 | pmid=9509248 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may damage coronary arteries or make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_36&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Malinow MR | title=Plasma homocyst(e)ine and arterial occlusive diseases: A mini-review | journal=Clinical Chemistry | volume=41 | issue=1 | year=1995 | pages=173–6  | pmid=7813076}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is currently no evidence available to suggest that lowering homocysteine with vitamins will reduce risk of heart disease. The NORVIT trial suggests that folic acid supplementation may do more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rxpgnews.com/research/cardiology/myocardialinfarction/article_2298.shtml NORVIT Trial- High dose B vitamins do not lower stroke or MI risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

However a 2005 study found that 5&amp;nbsp;mg of folate daily over a three-week period reduced pulse pressure by 4.7 mmHg compared with a placebo, and concluded that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams C, Kingwell BA, Burke K, McPherson J, Dart AM |title=Folic acid supplementation for 3 wk reduces pulse pressure and large artery stiffness independent of MTHFR genotype |journal=Am J Clin Nutr. |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=26–31 |date=1 July 2005|pmid=16002796 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/82/1/26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Folic acid is a safe and effective supplement that targets large artery stiffness and may prevent isolated systolic hypertension.

Also, as a result of new research, &quot;heart experts&quot; at Johns Hopkins Medical Center reported in March 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080327092140.htm Brief, high doses of folate blunt damage from heart attack]&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of therapeutic folate, although they cautioned that it is premature for people to begin to self-medicate by taking high doses of folic acid.&quot;

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a predictor of cardiovascular disease and hypertension among children and folic acid is a safe and effective supplement because it reduces serum homocysteine levels as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, thus preventing cardiovascular disease in children.&lt;ref&gt;Papandreou D et al Int J Food Sci Nutr. 2009 Nov 26.Homocysteine lowering with folic acid supplements in children: Effects on blood pressure.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stroke===
Folic acid appears to reduce the risk of stroke. The reviews indicate only that in some individuals the risk of stroke appears to be reduced, but a definite recommendation regarding supplementation beyond the current recommended daily allowance has not been established for stroke prevention.&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6709101.stm Folic acid 'reduces stroke risks'] 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Observed stroke reduction is consistent with the reduction in pulse pressure produced by folate supplementation of 5&amp;nbsp;mg per day, since hypertension is a key risk factor for stroke. Folic supplements are inexpensive and relatively safe to use and that is why stroke or hyperhomocysteinemia patients are encouraged to consume daily B vitamins including folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Terwecoren A, Steen E, Benoit D, Boon P, Hemelsoet D.

===Cancer===
Folate deficiency decreases intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which inhibits cytosine methylation in DNA, activates proto-oncogenes, induces malignant transformations, causes DNA precursor imbalances, misincorporates uracil into DNA, and promotes chromosome breakage; all of these mechanisms increase the risk of prostate cancer development.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie SJ, Folic acid deficiency and cancer: mechanisms of DNA instability, British Medical Bulletin 55:578-592 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigations have proposed that good levels of folic acid may be related to lower risk of esophageal, stomach, and ovarian cancer, but benefices of folic acid against cancer may depend on when it is taken and on individual conditions.  In addition folic acid may not be helpful, and could even be damaging, in people who already are suffering from cancer or from a precancerous condition.

The cancer drug methotrexate is designed to inhibit the metabolism of folic acid.  Folic acid may interact unexpectedly with the cancer drug fluorouracil.  The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/folic-acid_d00241_xeloda_d04311.html &quot;folic-acid and Xeloda Interactions&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The low dihydrofolate reductase activity in the liver of humans compared to other animals and so the low conversion of folic acid into its active derivatives might be due to the control of this enzyme by transcription factors such as E2F-1 involved in cell proliferation. It has been suggested that &quot;the low level of DHFR, and the other proteins under the control of E2F-1, in humans may have evolved to hinder the development of cancer. If this is the case, other animals with slow tissue turnover rates, possibly related to long life span, might also have low DHFR activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;/&gt;

Although the relationship between folate and prostate cancer is not yet clear, there has been suicide gene studies that show a target vector for folate to prostate and nasopharyngeal cancer cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/cgt/journal/v12/n10/pdf/7700844a.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Growth of tumor cells are significantly inhibited when a folate-linked nanoparticle is injected intratumorally.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;/&gt; The mechanism might be due to the interference of transfection and communication failures of intracellular gap junctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;/&gt;

A Finnish study consisting of 29,133 older male smokers resulted in the observation that prostate cancer risk had no relationship with serum folate levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Antifolates===
Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_2&quot;/&gt; Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. The antifolate methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form of THF from the inactive dihydrofolate (DHF). Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_46&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rubio IT, Cao Y, Hutchins LF, Westbrook KC, Klimberg VS | title=Effect of glutamine on methotrexate efficacy and toxicity | journal=Annals of Surgery | volume=227 | issue=5 | year=1998 | pages=772–8 | pmid=9605669 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199805000-00018 | pmc=1191365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_47&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wolff JE, Hauch H, Kuhl J, Egeler RM, Jurgens H | title=Dexamethasone increases hepatotoxicity of MTX in children with brain tumors | journal=Anticancer Research | volume=18 | issue=4B | year=1998 | pages=2895–9 | pmid=9713483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_48&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kepka L, De Lassence A, Ribrag V, Gachot B, Blot F, Theodore C, Bonnay M, Korenbaum C, Nitenberg G | title=Successful rescue in a patient with high dose methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity and acute renal failure | journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma | volume=29 | issue=1-2 | year=1998 | pages=205–9 | pmid=9638991 | doi = 10.3109/10428199809058397}}&lt;/ref&gt;
producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. Also, bone marrow depression (inducing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), acute renal and hepatic failure have been reported.

Folinic acid, under the drug name leucovorin, is a form of folate (formyl-THF) that can help &quot;rescue&quot; or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_49&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Branda RF, Nigels E, Lafayette AR, Hacker M. | title=Nutritional folate status influences the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in rats | journal=Blood | volume=92 | issue=7 | year=1998 | pages=2471–6 | pmid=9746787}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Folinic acid is ''not'' the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_50&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Shiroky JB | title=The use of folates concomitantly with low-dose pulse methotrexate | journal=Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America | volume=23 | issue=4 | year=1997 | pages=969–80 | pmid=9361164 | doi=10.1016/S0889-857X(05)70369-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_51&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Keshava C, Keshava N, Whong WZ, Nath J, Ong TM | title=Inhibition of methotrexate-induced chromosomal damage by folinic acid in V79 cells | journal=Mutation Research | volume=397 | issue=2 | year=1998 | pages=221–8 | pmid=9541646}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. The supplement of folinic acid in patients undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give non rapidly dividing cells enough folate to maintain normal cell functions. The amount of folate given will be depleted by rapidly dividing cells (cancer) very fast and so will not negate the effects of methotrexate.
Low dose methotrexate is used to treat a wide variety of non-cancerous diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus erythematosus|lupus, scleroderma, psoriasis, asthma, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, polymyositis, and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_52&quot;&gt;Morgan SL, Baggott JE {{Section:Chapter reference after author|Year=1995|Title=Folate antagonists in nonneoplastic disease: proposed mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity|Editor=Bailey LB| Book=Folate in Health and Disease|Pages=405–33|Publisher=New York: Marcel Dekker|isbn=0-8247-9280-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Low doses of methotrexate can deplete folate stores and cause side effects that are similar to folate deficiency. Both high folate diets and supplemental folic acid may help reduce the toxic side effects of low dose methotrexate without decreasing its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_53&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan SL, Baggott JE, Alarcon GS | title=Methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis: folate supplementation should always be given | journal=BioDrugs | volume=8 | issue=1 | year=1997 | pages=164–75}} [http://www.adisonline.info/reprints.asp Click here to request reprint from publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_54&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan SL, Baggott JE, Lee JY, Alarcon GS | title=Folic acid supplementation prevents deficient blood folate levels and hyperhomocysteinemia during longterm, low dose methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: Implications for cardiovascular disease prevention | journal=Journal of Rheumatology | volume=25 | issue=3 | year=1998 | pages=441–6 | pmid=9517760}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anyone taking low dose methotrexate for the health problems listed above should consult with a physician about the need for a folic acid supplement.

While the role in folate as a cancer treatment is well established its long term effectiveness is diminished by cellular response. In response to decreased THF the cell begins to transcribe more DHF reductase, the enzyme that reduces DHF to THF. Because methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of DHF reductase increased concentrations of DHF reductase can overcome the drugs inhibition.

===Obesity===
Folic acid increases lipolysis in adipocytes and may have a role in the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Lam TY, Seto SW, Au AL, Poon CC, Li RW, Lam HY, Lau WS, Chan SW, Ngai SM, Leung GP, Lee SM, Tsui SK, Kwan YW.

In a 3-year trial on 818 people over the age of 50, short-term memory, mental agility, and verbal fluency were all found to be better among people who took 800 micrograms of folic acid daily, twice the current RDA, than those who took placebo.

===Schizophrenia===
Folate deficiency may increase the risk of schizophrenia because by increasing homocysteine levels folate also increases interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels and these two cytokines are involved in the development of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;García-Miss MD, Pérez-Mutul J, López-Canul B, Solís-Rodríguez F, Puga-Machado L, Oxté-Cabrera A, Gurubel-Maldonado J, Arankowsky-Sandoval G.

Folate, homocysteine, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alfa levels, but not the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism, are risk factors for schizophrenia.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact mechanisms involved in the development of schizophrenia are not entirely clear but may have something to do with DNA methylation and one carbon metabolism and these are the precise roles of folate in the body and that is why folate deficiency has been linked to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs MO, Bellon A, Mainguy G, Jay TM, Frieling H.

===Fertility===
Folate is necessary for fertility in both men and women. In men, it contributes to spermatogenesis. In women, on the other hand, it contributes to oocyte maturation, implantation, placentation, in addition to the general effects of #Human reproduction|folic acid and pregnancy. Therefore, it is necessary  to receive sufficient amounts through the diet, in order to avoid subfertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ebisch IM, Thomas CM, Peters WH, Braat DD, Steegers-Theunissen RP |title=The importance of folate, zinc and antioxidants in the pathogenesis and prevention of subfertility |journal=Hum Reprod Update |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=163–74 |year=2007 |pmid=17099205 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dml054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macular degeneration===
A substudy of the Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study published in 2009 reports that use of a nutritional supplement that contains folic acid, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin decreased the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration by 34%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christen WG, Glynn RJ, Chew EY, Albert CM, JoAnn E.

===Bone health===
It has been hypothesized that folate deficiency can lead to elevated homocysteine levels which in turn lead to an increased risk of bone fractures, osteoporosis, and reduction in BMD but research studies so far show controversial results.&lt;ref&gt;Halıloglu B, Aksungar FB, Ilter E, Peker H, Akın FT, Ozekıcı U.

===Menopause===
Folic acid supplements help relieve hot flushes in postmenopausal women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaweesh S p 29&quot;/&gt; Just like in estrogen hormone replacement therapy, folic acid interacts with neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, serotonin) in the brain to reduce hot flushes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaweesh S p 29&quot;/&gt;

Folate deficiency is linked to anemia causing Plasmodium falciparum malaria in areas such as Colombia where malaria has reached endemic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Caicedo O et al, Acta Trop. 2009 Nov 18., Relation between Vitamin B12 and Folate Status, and Hemoglobin Concentration and Parasitemia during Acute Malaria Infections in Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bone loss in Parkinson's disease (PD)===
Folate lowers homocysteine (Hcy) levels which in turn prevents bone loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients taking levodopa (a psychoactive drug taken to treat Parkinson's disease).&lt;ref&gt;Lee SH, Kim MJ, Kim BJ, Kim SR, Chun S, Ryu JS, Kim GS, Lee MC, Koh JM, Chung SJ.

===Folic acid supplements and masking of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency===
There has been concern about the interaction between Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and folic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid_10466189&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Scott JM | title=Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; | journal=Proc Nutr Soc. | volume=2 | issue=58 | year=1999 May| pages=441–8 | pmid=10466189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folic acid supplements can correct the anemia associated with vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Unfortunately, folic acid will not correct changes in the nervous system that result from vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is not treated. Therefore, intake of supplemental folic acid should not exceed 1000 Kilogram|micrograms (1000&amp;nbsp;µg = 1&amp;nbsp;mg) per day to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. In fact, to date the evidence that such masking actually occurs is scarce, and there is no evidence that folic acid fortification in Canada or the U.S. has increased the prevalence of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency or its consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid_12791626&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mills JL, Von Kohorn I, Conley MR, Zeller JA, Cox C, Williamson RE, Dufour DR | title=Low vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations in patients without anemia: the effect of folic acid fortification of grain | journal=Am J Clin Nutr. | volume=6 | issue=77 | year=2003 June| pages=1474–7 | pmid=12791626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one recent study has demonstrated that high folic or folate levels, when combined with low B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels, are associated with significant cognitive impairment among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris MS, Jacques PF, Rosenberg IH, Selhub J |title=Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; status in relation to anemia, macrocytosis, and cognitive impairment in older Americans in the age of folic acid fortification |journal=Am J Clin Nutr. |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=193–200 |date=1 January 2007|pmid=17209196 |pmc=1828842 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17209196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, it is important for older adults to be aware of the relationship between folic acid and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, because they are at greater risk of having a vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Patients 50 years of age or older should ask their physicians to check their vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; status before taking a supplement that contains folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1856060.stm | work=BBC News | title=Folic acid 'heart boost for elderly' | date=6 March 2002 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health risk of too much folic acid===
The risk of toxicity from folic acid is low because folate is a water soluble vitamin and is regularly removed from the body through urine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_55&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hathcock JN. | title=Vitamins and minerals: efficacy and safety | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume=66 | issue=2 | year=1997 | pages=427–37 | pmid=9250127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Institute of Medicine has established a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for folate of 1&amp;nbsp;mg for adult men and women, and a UL of 800&amp;nbsp;µg for pregnant and lactating (breast-feeding) women less than 18 years of age. Supplemental folic acid should not exceed the UL to prevent folic acid from masking symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_29&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Baggott JE, Morgan SL, HaT, Vaughn WH, Hine RJ | title=Inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs | journal=Biochemical Journal | volume=282 | issue=Pt 1 | year=1992 | pages=197–202 | pmid=1540135 | pmc=1130907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore it is important not to consume quantities over the recommended DRI.

===Iron-Folic acid supplementation risk for children===
Some studies show that iron-folic acid supplementation in children under 5 may result in increased mortality due to malaria; this has prompted the World Health Organization to alter their iron-folic acid supplementation policies for children in malaria prone areas such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pasricha S, Shet A, Sachdev HP, Shet AS |title=Risks of routine iron and folic acid supplementation for young children |journal=Indian Pediatrics |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=857–66 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19887691 |url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct2009/857.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discovery of the link between insufficient folic acid and neural tube defects (NTDs), governments and health organizations worldwide have made recommendations concerning folic acid ''dietary supplement|supplementation'' for women intending to become Pregnancy|pregnant.

This has led to the introduction in many countries of ''fortification'', where folic acid is added to flour with the intention of everyone benefiting from the associated rise in blood folate levels. This is controversial, with issues having been raised concerning individual liberty {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, and the masking effect of folate fortification on pernicious anaemia (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency). However, several western countries now fortify their flour, along with a number of Middle Eastern countries and Indonesia. Mongolia and a number of Soviet Union|ex-Soviet republics are amongst those having widespread voluntary fortification; about five more countries (including Morocco, the first African country) have agreed but not yet implemented fortification. To date, no European Union|EU country has yet mandated fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Russell A |title=The UK campaign on folic acid and flour fortification |journal=Cerebrospinal Fluid Res. |volume=3 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S33 |year=2006 |doi=10.1186/1743-8454-3-S1-S33 |pmc=1716791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folates can be produced by engineering Lactococcus lactis strains using a rodent depletion-repletion bioassay and the bioavailabilities of these folates are comparable with commercial folic acid currently being used for food fortification.&lt;ref&gt;Leblanc JG et al, Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats. Nutrition. 2009 Nov 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These engineered folates can potentially help alleviate the effects of folate deficiency in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Leblanc JG et al, Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats. Nutrition. 2009 Nov 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Hematologic studies show an improvement in megaloblastic anemia after the addition of L. lactis strains; this again suggests that lactic acid bacteria can potentially reverse some of the harm done by folate deficiency by acting as an essential, bioavailable vitamin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leblanc JG, Sybesma W, Starrenburg M, ''et al.'' |title=Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats |journal=Nutrition |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19931414 |doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of fortification and plasma folate and homocysteine levels===
A study has shown that folate fortification will substantially increase in folate status, particularly for the elderly.  In the study group, the subjects who did not use vitamin supplements has increased folate concentrations of 4.6&amp;nbsp;ng/mL to 10.0&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (11 to 23 nmol/L) (P&lt;0.001) from the base-line visit to the follow-up visit.  The prevalence of low folate concentrations (&lt;3&amp;nbsp;ng/mL [7 nmol/L]) decreased from 22.0% to 1.7% (P&lt; 0.001). The mean total homocysteine concentration has decreased from a value of 10.1 µmol/L to 9.4 µmol/L during this period (P&lt;0.001), while the prevalence of high homocysteine concentrations (&gt;13 µmol/L) has been reduced from 18.7% to 9.8% (P&lt;0.001). To further clarify the study methods, there were no statistically significant changes in concentrations of folate or homocysteine for the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques PF, Selhub J, Bostom AG, Wilson PW, Rosenberg IH |title=The effect of folic acid fortification on plasma folate and total homocysteine concentrations |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=340 |issue=19 |pages=1449–54 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10320382 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199905133401901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
There has been previous debate in Australia regarding the inclusion of folic acid in products such as bread and flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Bread-fortification-not-justified/2006/07/29/1153816426688.html|title=Bread fortification 'not justified'|date=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia and New Zealand have jointly agreed to fortification though the Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Australia will fortify all flour from 18 September 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news | coauthors = NZPA | title = Bread to be fortified with folic acid | publisher = NZ Herald | date = 2007-06-22  | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=294&amp;objectid=10447345 | accessdate = 2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the food standard covers both Australia and New Zealand, an Australian government official has stated it is up to New Zealand to decide whether to implement it in New Zealand, and they will watch with interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/2593949/Bread-additive-call-up-to-NZ|title=Bread additive call 'up to NZ' |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The requirement is 0.135&amp;nbsp;mg of folate per 100g of bread.

===Canada===
In 2003, a Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, research group published findings showing that the fortification of flour with folic acid in Canada has resulted in a dramatic decrease in neuroblastoma, an early and very dangerous cancer in young children.&lt;ref&gt;French AE, Grant R, Weitzman S, Ray JG, Vermeulen MJ, Sung L, Greenberg M, Gideon Koren|Koren G.  Folic acid food fortification is associated with a decline in neuroblastoma. Clin Pharmacol Ther 2003; 74: 288-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, further evidence from McGill University showed a 6.2% decrease per year in the birth prevalence of severe congenital heart defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Prevelance of severe congenital heart disease after folic acid fortification of grain products: time trend analysis in Quebec, Canada|journal=Brit Med J|volume=338|issue=7705|pages=1261|doi=10.1136/bmj.b1673|ionescu=Ittu R, Marelli AJ, Mackie AS, Pilote L|last1=Ionescu-Ittu|first1=R.|last2=Marelli|first2=A.

Folic acid used in fortified foods is a synthetic form called pteroylmonoglutamate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, A. D., Kim, Y. I., &amp; Refsum, H. |title= Is folic acid good for everyone? American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2008 |issue= 87|volume=3 |page= 517}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in its oxidized state and contains only one conjugated glutamate residue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt; Folic acid therefore enters via a different carrier system than naturally occurring folate and this may have different effects on folate binding proteins and its transporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulrich&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ulrich C.M. and Potter, J.D. |title= Folate supplementation: Too much of a good thing?|year=2006 |url= http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/15/2/189|pmid= 16492904|doi= 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0054|volume= 15|issue= 2|pages= 189–93|journal= Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology|doi_brokendate= 2010-01-08|accessdate= 11/12/2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folic acid has a higher bioavailability than natural folates and are rapidly absorbed across the intestine&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt;, therefore it is important to consider the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) when calculating your intake. Natural occurring folate is equal to 1 DFE, however 0.6&amp;nbsp;µg of folic acid is equal to 1 DFE.

Folic acid food fortification became mandatory in Canada in 1998, with the fortification of 150&amp;nbsp;µg of folic acid per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of enriched flour and uncooked cereal grains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mason J. B., Dickstein, A., Jacques, P. F., Haggarty, P., Selhub, J., Dallal, G., et al. |title= A temporal association between folic acid fortification and an increase in colorectal cancer rates may be illuminating important biological principles: A hypothesis. Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers &amp; Prevention |year=2007 |issue= 16|volume=7 |page= 1325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of fortification was to decrease the risk of neural tube defects in newborns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot;/&gt; It is important to fortify grains because it is a widely eaten food and the neural tube closes in the first four weeks of gestation, often before many women even know they are pregnant.
Canada's fortification program has been successful with a decrease of neural tube defects by 19% since its introduction.&lt;ref name =&quot;Quinlivan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Quinlivan, E. P., &amp; Gregory III, J. F. |title= Effect of food fortification on folic acid intake in the united states. |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |year=2003 |issue=77 |volume=1 |page= 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 7 province study from 1993 to 2002 showed a reduction of 46% in the overall rate of neural tube defects after folic acid fortification was introduced in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;&gt;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca&lt;/ref&gt;
The fortification program was estimated to raise a person’s folic acid intake level by 70–130&amp;nbsp;µg/day, however an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinlivan&quot; /&gt; This could be from the fact that many foods are over fortified by 160–175% the predicted value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinlivan&quot; /&gt; In addition, much of the elder population take supplements which adds 400&amp;nbsp;µg to their daily folic acid intake. This is a concern because 70-80% of the population have detectable levels of unmetabolized folic acid in their blood and high intakes can accelerate the growth of preneoplasmic lesions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chustecka&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |name= Chustecka, Z.|title= Folic-acid fortification of flour and increased rates of colon cancer|year=2009 Retrieved 11/09, 2009 | url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/591111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still unknown the amount of folic acid supplementation that might cause harm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot; /&gt;. However, if Canada is going to continue fortifying the food supply they may want to consider decreasing the amount in foods and supplements from 400&amp;nbsp;µg to 100 or 50&amp;nbsp;µg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chustecka&quot; /&gt;

====Folic acid supplementation promotion in Canada====
According to a Canadian survey, 58% of women said they took a folic acid containing multivitamin or a folic acid supplement as early as three months before becoming pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; Women in higher income households and with more years of school education are using more folic acid supplements before pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; Women with planned pregnancies and who are over the age of 25 are more likely to use folic acid supplements.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; Canadian public health efforts are focused on promoting awareness of the importance of folic acid supplementation for all women of childbearing age and decreasing socio-economic inequalities by providing practical folic acid support to vulnerable groups of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc-sc.gc.ca&quot;/&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand was going to fortify bread (excluding organic and unleavened varieties) from 18 September 2009 but has opted to wait until more research is done.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ Herald&quot;/&gt;

The Association of Bakers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Work Starts on Wilkinson’s Mass Medication Plan | publisher = Association Of Bakers | date = 2009-07-08 | url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0907/S00210.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = NZ should push pause on folic fortification | publisher = Green Party| date = 2009-07-09 | url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0907/S00132.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; have opposed mandatory fortification, describing it as &quot;mass medication&quot;.

There has been previous debate in the United Kingdom regarding the inclusion of folic acid in products such as bread and flour.&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/601909.stm 'Put folic acid in bread'] 2000-01-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States Public Health Service recommends an extra 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day, which can be taken as a pill. However, many researchers believe that supplementation in this way can never work effectively enough since about half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned and not all women will comply with the recommendation. Approximately 53% of the US population uses dietary supplements and 35% uses dietary supplements containing folic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;&gt;Bailey RL et al Am J Clin Nutr. 2009 Nov 18. Total folate and folic acid intake from foods and dietary supplements in the United States: 2003-2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Men consume more folate (in dietary folate equivalents) than women and non-Hispanic whites have higher folate intakes than Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt; Twenty nine percent of black women have inadequate intakes of folate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt; The age group consuming the most folate and folic acid is the &gt;50 group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt; Only 5% of the population exceeds the Tolerable Upper Intake Level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey RL 2006&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Malinow MR, Duell PB, Hess DL, Anderson PH, Kruger WD, Phillipson BE, Gluckman RA, Block PC, Upson BM | title=Reduction of plasma homocyst(e)ine levels by breakfast cereal fortified with folic acid in patients with coronary heart disease | journal= New England Journal of Medicine | volume=338 | issue=15 | year=1998 | pages=1009–15 | pmid=9535664 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199804093381501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Daly S, Mills JL, Molloy AM, Conley M, Lee YJ, Kirke PN, Weir DG, Scott JM | title=Minimum effective dose of folic acid for food fortification to prevent neural-tube defects | journal=Lancet | volume=350 | issue=9092 | year=1997 | pages=1666–9 | pmid=9400511 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)07247-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the Australian press claimed that U.S. regulations requiring fortification of grain products were being interpreted as disallowing fortification in non-grain products, specifically Vegemite (an Australian yeast extract containing folate). The FDA later said the report was inaccurate, and no ban or other action was being taken against Vegemite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20641599-1702,00.html|title=US denies Vegemite ban|date=25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the folic acid fortification program, fortified foods have become a major source of folic acid in the American diet. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia used data from 23 birth defect registries that cover about half of United States births, and extrapolated their findings to the rest of the country.  These data indicate that since the addition of folic acid in grain-based foods as mandated by the FDA, the rate of neural tube defects dropped by 25% in the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldref_57&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title=Spina bifida and anencephaly before and after folic acid mandate--United States, 1995-1996 and 1999-2000 | journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume=53 | issue=17 | year=2004 | pages=362&amp;ndash;5 | pmid=15129193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results of folic acid fortification on the rate of neural tube defects in Canada have also been positive, showing a 46% reduction in prevalence of NTDs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=De Wals P, Tairou F, Van Allen MI, Uh SH, Lowry RB, Sibbald B, Evans JA, Van den Hof MC, Zimmer P, Crowley M, Fernandez B, Lee NS &amp;amp; Niyonsenga T|year=2007|title=Reduction in neural-tube defects after folic acid fortification in Canada|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=357|pages=135&amp;ndash;142| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067103}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magnitude of reduction was proportional to the prefortification rate of NTDs, essentially removing geographical variations in rates of NTDs seen in Canada before fortification.

When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the folic acid fortification regulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100&amp;nbsp;µg/d.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choumenkovitch SF 2798&quot;&gt;Choumenkovitch SF et al, Folic Acid Intake from Fortification in United States Exceeds Predictions, The American Society for Nutritional Sciences J.

*''Title:'' A Phase I/II Dose Intensification Study using Three Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy and Concurrent Chemotherapy for Patients with Inoperable, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
*''Objective:'' 
**1) For the Phase I portion of the study, the primary objective is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy, in terms of Gy per fraction, that can be delivered using three-dimensional conformal radiation treatment (3D-CRT) concurrently with Taxol and carboplatin chemotherapy.
**2) For the Phase II portion of the study, the primary objective is to estimate the percentage of patients that survive at least 12 months.
*''[http://rtog.org/members/protocols/L0117/0117.pdf Protocol]:''
**Concurrent weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 2) x 7 weeks

**Total lung V20 must be &amp;le; 30%, mean esophageal dose &amp;le; 34 Gy, esophageal V55 &amp;le; 30 Gy
*''Treatment Details:''
**No elective nodal irradiation
**Prescription dose at ICRU reference point.  The 93% isodose line must cover the entire PTV.
**Dose calculated without heterogeneity corrections
*''Enrollment Target:'' 73 patients maximum
*''Activation:'' July 13, 2001
*''Closed:'' November 27, 2007
*''Conclusion:''
**Phase I: '''2010''' PMID 20457350 '''A phase I/II radiation dose escalation study with concurrent chemotherapy for patients with inoperable stages I to III non-small-cell lung cancer: phase I results of RTOG 0117.''' (Bradley JD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 74 Gy/37 fractions (2.0 Gy per fraction) using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy. This dose level in the Phase II portion has been well tolerated, with low rates of acute and late lung toxicities. 
*''Publications:''

(Bradley JD, J Clin Oncol. 2010) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: The median survival time and OS rate at 12 months for this regimen are encouraging. These results serve as projection expectations for the high-dose radiation arms of the current RTOG 0617 phase III intergroup trial.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==

The preliminary inquiry justice derives all of its authority from Part XVIII of the Code. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (S.C.C.) &lt;/ref&gt;



{{reflist|2}}
===Purpose===

The purpose of the preliminary inquiry is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to set the matter down for trial before a Justice of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O’Connor (1995), 191 N.R. 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 134 (&quot;The primary function of the preliminary inquiry...is undoubtedly to ascertain that the Crown has sufficient evidence to commit the accused to trial&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hynes (D.W.) (2001), 278 N.R. 299 (SCC) at para. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;
In practice the Inquiry is used to test the strength of the Crown’s case.

Its purpose is also &quot;to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process.&quot; 
&lt;ref&gt;
Skogman v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpfg 1984 CanLII 22] (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 93 at p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an &quot;expeditious charge-screening mechanism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v. Hynes 2001 SCC 82 (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the amendments in 2005, it has also been used as a venue for discovery.&lt;ref&gt;
Skogman v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpfg 1984 CanLII 22] (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 93 at p. 105
(&quot;the preliminary hearing has become a forum where the accused is afforded an opportunity to discover and to appreciate the case to be made against him at trial where the requisite evidence is found to be present&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
See R. v. Kasook, [http://canlii.ca/t/5btq 2000 NWTSC 33] at para. 25&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry judge has a general power to regulate the inquiry process under s. 537. The judge may require counsel to define the issues for which evidence will be called (see s.536.3), and may further limit the scope of the inquiry under section 536.5 and 549.

{{reflist|2}}

==Procedure==

A Preliminary Inquiry can only be available for indictable offences. A hearing will be scheduled in any one of the following situations:
* the accused elects trial by judge alone or judge and jury (s. 536(2), (4))
* the accused is charged with an offence under s. 469 (e.g. murder, treason, etc)
* the accused refuses to make an election (s. 565)
* the judge exercises discretion in ordering the matter be prosecuted by indictment (s 555(1))
* the attorney general orders a trial by judge and jury (s. 568)

On the election the judge must endorse the information to show the election and who made the election. (s. 536(4.1))

Where there are more than one accused, if one person elects to have a preliminary inquiry the remainder are deemed to have made the same election. (s. 536(4.2), 567)

The time limit is set by the rules of the Court pursuant to [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec482 s. 482 and 482.1]

{{reflist|2}}

===Setting of Preliminary Inquiry===
Under s. 536, at sometime before the setting of a preliminary inquiry date, the judge must read the accused his election address:
{{cquote|
You have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury, or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?
}}


===Statement of Issues===
Under s. 536.3, where an accused elects to have a preliminary inquiry, counsel must provide the court and the other party with a statement that identifies the issues that the evidence should cover and a list of the witnesses expected to provide the evidence:
{{quotation|
'''Statement of issues and witnesses'''&lt;Br&gt;
536.3  If a request for a preliminary inquiry is made, the prosecutor or, if the request was made by the accused, counsel for the accused shall, within the period fixed by rules of court made under section 482 or 482.1 or, if there are no such rules, by the justice, provide the court and the other party with a statement that identifies
:(a) the issues on which the requesting party wants evidence to be given at the inquiry; and
:(b) the witnesses that the requesting party wants to hear at the inquiry.
&lt;P&gt;
2002, c. 13, s. 27; 2011, c. 16, s. 3(F).
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec536.3 CCC]
}}

{{reflist|2}}


===Publication Bans===

There are several publication bans available for preliminary inquires:
* complainant's identity (s. 486.4(1) and (2), 486.4(3) [mandatory]; s. 486.4(1), 486.5(1))
* accused's confessions (s. 542) [mandatory]
* evidence of preliminary inquiry (s. 539)
* witnesse's identity (s. 486.5(1))
* justice system participant's identity (s. 486.2(5))

See more: [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Pre-Trial Matters/Public and Media Restrictions]]

===Crown Evidence===

The Crown has unfettered discretion on whom they wish to call as witnesses. A judge has no authority to direct the Crown to call witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brass (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 206 (Sask. Q.B.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Defence Evidence===
Under s. 541(2), once the Crown has closed its case at the preliminary inquiry, the presiding judge must ask the accused whether he wishes to testify on his own behalf. The address to the accused is as follows:
{{cquote|
Do you wish to say anything in answer to these charges or to any other charges which might have arisen from the evidence led by the prosecution? You are not obliged to say anything, but whatever you do say may be given in evidence against you at your trial. You should not make any confession or admission of guilt because of any promise or threat made to you but if you do make any statement it may be given in evidence against you at your trial in spite of the promise or threat.
}}

Anything the accused says can be taken down and used as evidence.(s. 541(2))

The accused is entitled to call any witnesses he wishes (s. 541(4)). The judge should be sure to inquire whether the accused is calling any other witnesses.(s.541(3)

The judge must inquire into whether a self-represented accused has any witnesses to call as evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. LeBlanc, 2009 NBCA 84, 250 C.C.C. (3d) 29&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Burden of proof==

The test for a preliminary inquiry is the same as a motion for non-suit or directed verdict.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Arcuri per McLachlin&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Evidence==
The justice presiding the inquiry will received evidence including that evidence &quot;that would not otherwise be admissible but that the justice considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances of the case, including a statement that is made by a witness in writing or otherwise recorded.&quot; (s.540 (7)) Anytime evidence is put forward under s.540(7) there must be reasonable notice to the other parites of &quot;the intention to tender it, together with a copy of the statement&quot;. (s. 540(8))

The crown may adduce evidence of an admission or confession by the accused “that by law is admissible” against him. ([http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec542 s. 542(1)])

Under s. 548(1), the Court must decide whether any admissible evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a guilty verdict.
&lt;ref&gt;
See
R. v. Arcuri, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc54/2001scc54.html 2001 SCC 54]&lt;br&gt; 
United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 SCR 1067 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1976/1976canlii8/1976canlii8.html 1976 CanLII 8] &lt;br&gt;
Mezzo v. R., [1986] 1 S.C.R 802 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1986/1986canlii16/1986canlii16.html 1986 CanLII 16] &lt;br&gt;
Dubois v. The Queen, [1986] 1 SCR 366 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1986/1986canlii60/1986canlii60.html 1986 CanLII 60] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Charemski, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii819/1998canlii819.html 1998 CanLII 819] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Monteleone, [1987] 2 SCR 154 [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/scc/doc/1987/1987canlii16/1987canlii16.html#par154 1987 CanLII 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where direct evidence on each element of an offence is presented, the court must order the accused to stand trial on the charge. Exculpatory evidence will not result in a discharge of the charges.

Where circumstantial evidence is presented, the court engages in &quot;limited weighing&quot; of all the evidence, to determine whether a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a guilty verdict.
This involves considering the reasonableness of the inferences drawn from the evidence.

The judge may not exclude evidence at the inquiry due to any constitutional violations.&lt;Ref&gt;
See, R. v. R. (L.),  1995 CanLII 8928 (ON CA), (1995), 28 C.R.R. (2d) 173 at p. 183, per Arbour J.A.&lt;br&gt; 
also R. v. Mills 1986 CanLII 17 (SCC), (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Seaboyer 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (S.C.C.), at paras. 28, 32&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge does not have the authority to compel the Crown to provide particulars or disclosure to the defence or compel the production of Third Party Records. Further, the judge cannot order a stay proceedings for abuse of process.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359,  (S.C.C.), at paras. 33 and 38&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Chew , [1968] 2 C.C.C. 127 , [1968] 1 O.R. 97, 1967 CLB 46 (Ont. C.A.)
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 , 206 D.L.R. (4th) 483, 51 W.C.B. (2d) 453, 2001 CLB 68 (S.C.C.), at para. 33
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge however may exclude a statement of the accused as involuntary.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hynes (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (S.C.C.), at paras. 32 and 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}
===Admissions or Confessions===
Confessions, admissions or statements of the accused are admissible under the same test to be applied at trial.&lt;ref&gt;
See, R. v. Pickett (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 297 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 303, per Jessup J.A.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the crown must advance some evidence that the statement was made and to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was voluntary.&lt;REf&gt;
For example, R. v. Mulligan (1955), 111 C.C.C. 173 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 176-7, per MacKay J.A.&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Pickett, Pickett (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 297 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 302, per Jessup J.A.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Defence evidence===
Where the accused is unrepresented, under s. 541(2), the judge must warn the accused before he calls any defence evidence. The suggested warning consists of the following:
{{cquote|
“Do you wish to say anything in answer to these charges or to any other charges which might have arisen from the evidence led by the prosecution? You are not obliged to say anything, but whatever you do say may be given in evidence against you at your trial. You should not make any confession or admission of guilt because of any promise or threat made to you but if you do make any statement it may be given in evidence against you at your trial in spite of the promise or threat.”
}}
{{reflist|2}}

==Decision to Commit==
After hearing evidence and argument the court must make a ruling on whether to commit the accused to stand trial for the charges alleged.

Where the evidence is not sufficient to commit the matter to trial the Judge may discharge the accused of the charges alleged:

{{quotation|
'''Order to stand trial or discharge'''&lt;br&gt;
548. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice, he shall
:(a) if in his opinion there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction, order the accused to stand trial; or
:(b) discharge the accused, if in his opinion on the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec548 CCC]
}}

{{reflist|2}}

==Consent to Committal==
At any time before the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry the accused may consent to committal.

{{Quotation|
'''Order to stand trial at any stage of inquiry with consent'''&lt;br&gt;
549. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the justice may, at any stage of a preliminary inquiry, with the consent of the accused and the prosecutor, order the accused to stand trial in the court having criminal jurisdiction, without taking or recording any evidence or further evidence.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Limited preliminary inquiry'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.1) If the prosecutor and the accused agree under section 536.5 to limit the scope of a preliminary inquiry to specific issues, the justice, without recording evidence on any other issues, may order the accused to stand trial in the court having criminal jurisdiction.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Procedure'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) If an accused is ordered to stand trial under this section, the justice shall endorse on the information a statement of the consent of the accused and the prosecutor, and the accused shall after that be dealt with in all respects as if ordered to stand trial under section 548.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 549; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 101; 2002, c. 13, s. 30.

==Bail==

After a judge orders a person to stand trial, he may also review any detention orders or conditions of release. (s. 523(2)(b))

      <comment>/* Superior Court */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
&quot;Jurisdiction&quot; refers to the legal authority or power of the court over the subject matter, time and location, the persons connected to the proceeding. &lt;ref&gt;Reference re Judicature Act (1988), 46 CCC 203 NBCA at p. 218; R. v. Gray (1991), 68 CCC 193 (Ont.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdiction is intimately tied with the state based on a geographic region or territory. This is known as the &quot;principle of territoriality&quot;. From this two forms of jurisdiction arise. The was discussed in R v Hape 2007 SCC 26 at 59: 
:''...The principle of territoriality extends to two related bases for jurisdiction, the objective territorial principle and the subjective territorial principle.  According to the objective territorial principle, a state may claim jurisdiction over a criminal act that commences or occurs outside the state if it is completed, or if a constituent element takes place, within the state, thus connecting the event to the territory of the state through a sufficiently strong link:  Brownlie, at p. 299.  See also Libman, at pp. 212-13.  Subjective territoriality refers to the exercise of jurisdiction over an act that occurs or has begun within a state’s territory even though it has consequences in another state.''

This requirement is further modified by the principle of comity which says that where two or more states “have legal claim to a jurisdiction” then a state should only claim jurisidciton where ther is a “real and substantial” connection with the event.

The matter of jurisdiction can be broken down into several components:
# jurisdiction over persons
# jurisdiction over subject matters
# jurisdiction over period of time

Behind this division, is a court which itself has imposed limitations.

==Jurisdiction of Courts==

===Superior Court===
A Superior Court has &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; that is derived from s. 96 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. This is also referred to as “original and plenary jurisdiction”. This means that the Superior Court has jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters unless expressly removed by statute.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Bloedel v. Simpson Ltd, [1995] SCR 725&lt;/ref&gt; However, the “core powers” of the superior court cannot be removed by statute without violating s.96 of the Constitution Act 1867.&lt;ref&gt; See McMillan Bloedel v Simpson Ltd. [1995] 4 SCR 725&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 468 of the Criminal Code, provides authority over indictable offences unless the Province of the particular Superior Court lacks a real and substantial connection to the offence itself. This &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; also provides power to control the judicial process and to remedy unfairness.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 SCR 262; R. v. Pilarinos (2001) 158 CCC 1 (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Provincial and Appellate Court===
A Provincial or Territorial Court has jurisdiction derived by statute alone.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Doyle, [1977] 1 SCR 597; R. v. SJL (2002), 163 CCC (3d) 560 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; This authory generally allows judges sitting in any part of the province. However, the limit does not cover offences that have no real and substantial connection with the jurisdiction of the provincial court judge.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Doyle [1977] 1 SCR 597&lt;br R v JLS 2002 163 CCC (3d) 560 (BCCA) at 23&lt;/ref&gt;

A provincial court has “authority to control the court’s process” as well others authorities derived by necessary implication. However, the authority must be exercised “according to the rules of reason and justice”&lt;ref&gt; eg. see R v Price 2010 NBCA&lt;/ref&gt;

An appellate court only has jurisdiction that is provide to it by statute and so can only hear appeals permitted under statute.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Kevork (1985), 21 CCC (3d) 369&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Jurisdiction over persons==

===Adults===
The Courts have jurisdiction over an accused by virtue of their presence in court.&lt;ref&gt;s.470(a); R. v. Gordon (1980), 55 CCC (2d) 197 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; The accused is required to be present for all indictable matters. It is because the accused must be a part of all matters of &quot;vital interest&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Vezina; Cote [1986] 1 SCR 2&lt;/ref&gt; The accused must be present at trial so as to hear the case against them. 

For Summary matters the court may proceed without the presence of the accused except if liable for more than 6 months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s. 800(2) and 802.1&lt;/ref&gt; This would include trial matters by way of an ''ex parte'' motion.&lt;ref&gt;s. 803(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Designations of counsel'''&lt;br&gt;
As stated, the Courts have jurisdiction over an accused present in court. The accused may appoint counsel to represent them for any proceedings under the Criminal Code by filing a designation of counsel pursuant to s. 650.01(1). &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Golyanik (2003), 173 CCC 307 (SCJ); R. v. C(JJ) (2003), 12 AtlaLR 191; R. v. L(GY) 2009 84 WCB 341 (SCJ)&lt;/ref&gt; Where a designation has been properly filed with the Court the accused does not need to be present for certain court appearances except for when oral evidence is being heard.&lt;ref&gt;s. 650.01(3)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; As such the Court will not lose jurisdiction over the accused due to his or her absence.&lt;ref&gt;For indictable offences, the Court will only have jurisdiction over the accused where they are present in court for an appearance. Otherwise, the charge will be a nullity and voidable&lt;/ref&gt; A valid designation must contain the name and address of the counsel, as well as set out the charge(s) and date(s) of alleged offences or any particulars identifying the matters, and it must be signed by the accused and designated counsel.&lt;ref&gt;s. 650.01(2)&lt;bR&gt;
R. v. Butler, 2010 NSSC 284 - rejected designation for no listed charges
&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Specific Persons===
The Crown is generally immune from prosecutions for executive conduct unless statute otherwise directs.&lt;ref&gt; see s. 17 of Interpretation Act&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Youths===
A court cannot have jurisdiction over any person under the age of 12.&lt;Ref&gt;see s.13 of the Criminal Code&lt;/ref&gt; This date is set as of the date of the offence. &lt;reF&gt; see s. 16 YCJA nad  R v McDonald 1985 ONCA 21 CCC 330&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Jurisdiction over subject matter==


Section 553 is procedural in nature and does not usurp the jurisdiction of superior court on matters that have properly been brought before it.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Manitopyes, 2012 SKQB 141 at 69&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sexual Assault-based Offences==

It is not always necessary that the Crown call a toxicologist or any other type of forensic expert to prove that the complainant was drugged using a date-rape drug.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Fleming 2007 ONCA 808&lt;/ref&gt;

For sexual offences (s. 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 212, 271, 272 or 273), section 274 prohibits the need for any corroboration of evidence. However, it remains a useful practice to consider further corroboratoin where applicable.&lt;ref&gt;
F.H. v. McDougall, [http://canlii.ca/t/20xm8 2008 SCC 53], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41 at para. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''RTOG 97-04 ([[Radiation Oncology/Pancreas|PANCREAS]])''' 
:[[Radiation Oncology/Pancreas/RTOG Pancreas|RTOG Pancreas Trials]]
* ''Title:'' A Phase III Study of Pre and Post Chemoradiation 5-FU vs. Pre and Post Chemoradiation Gemcitabine for Postoperative Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
* ''Objectives:'' 
** 1) To determine whether 5-FU based chemoradiation preceded and followed by gemcitabine improves the overall survival, local-regional and distant disease control, and/or disease-free survival as compared to 5-FU based chemoradiation preceded and followed by 5-FU in the postoperative adjuvant treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.
** 2) To compare the acute and late toxicities between 5-FU chemoradiation preceded and followed by gemcitabine and 5-FU chemoradiation preceded and followed by 5-FU.
** 3) To prospectively evaluate the ability of post-resectional CA19-9 to predict survival among adjuvantly treated patients who have undergone a potentially curative resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
* ''[http://rtog.org/members/protocols/97-04/97-04.pdf Protocol]:''

* ''Conclusion:''
** '''2008''' PMID 18319412 '''Fluorouracil vs gemcitabine chemotherapy before and after fluorouracil-based chemoradiation following resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a randomized controlled trial.''' (Regine WF, JAMA. 2008) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: The addition of gemcitabine to adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemoradiation was associated with a survival benefit for patients with resected pancreatic cancer, although this improvement was not statistically significant. 

* ''Publications:''
** '''2009''' '''Correlation of cytidine deaminase single nucleotide polymorphism and toxicity from gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer from RTOG 9704.''' (Farrell J, [Abstract] American Society of Clinical Oncology 2009 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, 15-17 January 2009, San Francisco, CA. A-115, 2009.)
** '''2009''' PMID 18992248 '''Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 levels predict response to gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer.''' (Farrell JJ, Gastroenterology. 2009)
** '''2009''' '''Single institutional experience with oral capecitabine (Cap) in adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer: Gemcitabine (G) followed by Cap/RT followed by G''' (Piperdi B, [Abstract] American Society of Clinical Oncology 2009 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, 15-17 January 2009, San Francisco, CA. A-229, 2009.)
** '''2008''' PMID 19029412 '''Postresection CA 19-9 predicts overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with adjuvant chemoradiation: a prospective validation by RTOG 9704.''' (Berger AC, J Clin Oncol. 2008) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: To our knowledge, this is the first phase III trial to perform prospective analysis of CA 19-9 levels in patients treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. It definitively confirms the prognostic importance of postresectional CA 19-9 levels after surgery with curative intent in patients with pancreatic cancer.
** '''2006''' [http://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016%2806%2902611-3/fulltext Abstract] '''RTOG 9704: radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) review and survival.''' (Abrams RA, [Abstract] Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 66 (3 Suppl 1): A-39, S22, 2006.) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;: This is the first phase III adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to require XRT QA review. In this study Pts whose XRT did not adhere to protocol specified XRT parameters experienced inferior S. These results suggest that in this context failure to adhere to XRT protocol guidelines compromises S. NPI and S did not correlate in this study. XRT QA compliance appears to be an important parameter in adjuvant pancreatic cancer trials and should be regarded as such for future trials.

The term &quot;steal&quot; is defined in s. 2 as meaning &quot;to commit theft&quot;. While &quot;committing theft&quot; is defined in s. 322:
{{quotation|
'''Theft'''&lt;br&gt;
322. (1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent
:(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;
:(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;
:(c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or
:(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.&lt;br&gt;

'''Time when theft completed'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A person commits theft when, with intent to steal anything, he moves it or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to become movable.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Secrecy'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) A taking or conversion of anything may be fraudulent notwithstanding that it is effected without secrecy or attempt at concealment.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Purpose of taking'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) For the purposes of this Act, the question whether anything that is converted is taken for the purpose of conversion, or whether it is, at the time it is converted, in the lawful possession of the person who converts it is not material.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 283.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec322 CCC]

==Violence or Threat of Violence: 343 (a)==
The violence is made out by an unlawful assault. However, to make out robbery the assault must be for a specific intent.

The violence or threats of violence must be ''for the purpose of'' taking whatever that is stolen and so it requires that the violence or threats be before or contemporaneous to the theft.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Newell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qlq9 2007 NLCA 9] (CanLII) at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jean, [http://canlii.ca/t/fttg4 2012 BCCA 448] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If however the property was &quot;stolen clandestinely&quot; or &quot;surreptitious[ly]&quot;, then the presence of violence or threats of violence to enable escape will not make out a robbery.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Downer (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 532, Martin J.A. at para. 14 (&quot;If property was stolen clandestinely, violence or threats of violence to enable the thief to escape, or to prevent the re-taking by the owner of what had been stolen, did not have the effect of escalating larceny into robbery&quot;) see also para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Purse-snatching will not make out a robbery where the item was taken before the victim had a chance to resist.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Picard (1976) 39 CCC (2d) 57 &lt;/ref&gt;

The violence can be used against a target other than the victim being robbed.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Newell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qlq9 2007 NLCA 9] &lt;/ref&gt;

An utterance threatening force will be sufficient to make out the violence element of the offence. There is no need to measure the degree of violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lecky (2001), 157 CCC (3d) 351&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduct alleging to be implicit in its violence or threat of violence is determined by whether a reasonable person would have felt or apprehended that violence was conveyed or threatened in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. MacCormack (2009), 241 CCC (3d) 516, [http://canlii.ca/t/2289j 2009 ONCA 72] (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sayers, (1983) 8 CCC (3d) 572 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Pelletier, (1992) 71 CCC (3d) 438
&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing a note requesting money to a bank teller can be sufficient to make out a threat of violence.&lt;reF&gt; R. v. Katrensky (1975), 24 CCC (2d)350&lt;/ref&gt;

A threat of violence need not be overt. A display of a knife while hooded and a demand for money is an implied threat of violence. &lt;Ref&gt;R v Griffin 2011 NSCA 103; R. v. Douglas, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsbpx 2012 MBQB 197] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Holding a person down to prevent resistance constitutes violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Trudel (1984), 12 CCC (3d) 342&lt;/ref&gt;

What constitutes a threat comes from the case law of the charge of uttering threats under s.264. If the utterance meets the criteria, it is irrelevant whether the victim appreciated the threatening nature of the utterance.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Carons (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 19 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; To put it another way, the effect of the threat on the prospective victim is of no consequence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v. Nabis [1974] 18 C.C.C. (2d) 144 &lt;/reF&gt;

&quot;Extort&quot; is defined in the shorter Oxford English Dictionary in part as, &quot;To wrest from a reluctant person by force, violence, torture, intimidation&quot;.

{{reflist|2}}

==Stealing with Personal Violence: 343 (b)==
&quot;violence&quot; in this section means more than a technical assault.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lew (1978), 30 CCC (2d) 140 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt; It is determined using a subjective/objective test.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bourassa (2004), 189 CCC (3d) 438, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j0x4 2004 NSCA 127] (NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Assault with Intent to Steal: 343 (c)==

Assault has the same meaning as s. 266. This includes technical assaults&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Lew (1978), 40 CCC (2d) 140&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no need to prove that a theft actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Allison (1983), 33 C.R. (3d) 333 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Weapon'''&lt;br&gt;
Under s. 343(d) the &quot;weapon&quot; must be either (1) an actual firearm; (2) an imitation firearm; or (3) an offensive weapon. Simply using one's hand to imitate a firearm is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Delage (2001) 154 CCC (3d) 85 (Que CA), [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/2001/2001canlii12656/2001canlii12656.html 2001 CanLII 2656]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armed'''&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Armed&quot; must be the actual possession of a weapon. This does not include simulating possession of a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sloan (1974), 19 CCC (2d) 190 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gouchie (1976), 33 CCC (2d) 120&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==As Opposed to Theft==
Given that robbery is a form of theft, there can be cases where the proximity and connection between theft and violence is limited. A theft where there is violence after the completion of the theft can be treated as distinct from robbery.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Newell, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2007/2007nlca9/2007nlca9.html 2007 NLCA 9]
&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction is most seen in robbery under s. 343(a) which requires violence or threats to &quot;overcome resistance to stealing&quot;. Where the threats are made after the completion of the theft, such as after a shoplifter leaves a store and is followed by staff, threats or violence may be found as only for the purpose of escape and not the purpose of preventing stealing which is already complete by this point.&lt;ref&gt;
see R v Daughma, [1989] O.J. No. 1765 - in this case, threats occurred outside of store after accused steals a bottle of wine.
c.f. R v Morgan, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvrn1 2013 ABCA 26] (CanLII) - offender pointed a gun at guard in the parking lot while offender was getting into his car. Judge found it was a robbery&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Dangerous Offenders and Long-Term Offenders==
Robbery is classified as a &quot;serious personal injury offence&quot; (s. 752) where there is violence or threats of violence involved.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lebar  [http://canlii.ca/t/28wdc 2010 ONCA 220]&lt;Br&gt;
R v Griffin [http://canlii.ca/t/fnwsk 2011 NSCA 103] - court found threat of violence and SPIO where offender wore a disguise and tapped a knife on the counter while asking for money&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Included Offences==
The following have been found to be included offences:
* Assault&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Luckett (1981) 20 CR (3d) 393 (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Horsefall, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1990/1990canlii1039/1990canlii1039.html 1990 CanLII 1039 (BC C.A.)]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theft&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Boisvert (1991) 68 CCC (3d) 478, [http://canlii.ca/t/1pg0m 1991 CanLII 3039] (Que CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Defence Election */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Crown Election==
The election process is a &quot;means by which the criminal law provides the Attorney General with sufficient flexibility to take the specific circumstances of each case into account and ensure that, in each case, the interests of justice are served.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Century 21 Ramos Realty Inc. and Ramos, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p77d 1987 CanLII 171] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has the power of election on hybrid criminal offences. A hybrid offence is an offence defined in the Criminal Code as having both summary and indictable classes of punishment. Hybrid offences are deemed to be indictable until the Crown elects to proceed summarily.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Marr, [http://canlii.ca/t/1l8fs 2005 NSCA 73] at para. 20; R. v. Dudley [http://canlii.ca/t/272k3 2009 SCC 58] at para. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

No offences with maximum penalty of 14 years or life are hybrid offences.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Canadian_Criminal_Sentencing/Offences/Offences_by_Penalty|List of Offences by Penalty]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The power to elect is at the discretion of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Smythe [http://canlii.ca/t/1twrk 1971 SCR 680]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceedings on summary offences must commence within six months of the incident date. ([http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec786 s. 786(2)]) That is, unless the Crown and Defence agree.&lt;ref&gt;s. 786(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is acceptable practice to elect indictable in order to allow the prosecution to proceed, such as where the 6 month time limit has expired, and then re-elect summarily with consent.&lt;ref&gt;Burke (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 163 (NLCA) &lt;/ref&gt; 
The judge cannot interfere by refusing to allow re-election.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Linton (1994) 90 CCC 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid offences are deemed to be indictable &quot;unless and until the Crown elects to proceed summarily&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Dudley 2009 SCC 58 para. 21 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc58/2009scc58.html]; see also R. v. Paul-Marr, 2005 NSCA 3 at para 20; see also s.34 of the Interpretation Act&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a proceedings progresses to its conclusion without the Crown having made no election on a hybrid offence and the charge was within 6 months of the incident, the Crown is deemed to have elected to proceed by &quot;summary conviction&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mitchell, [http://canlii.ca/t/6h2k 1997 CanLII 6321] (ON CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marcotullio (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 478 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. W. (W.W.) (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 214 (Man. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, where the accused elects mode of trial even though the Crown failed to make an election, the trial will be deemed indictable.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mitchell (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (Ont. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a matter is part of the discretionary core functions of the Attorney General is a question of law.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nixon, 2009 ABCA 289 at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6 month limitation under s. 786 does not count from the beginning of the offence where it spans several days. An offence spanning a timeframe will be valid for the entire span as long as the end date is within the 6 month limit.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nadir, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v6mp 2004 CanLII 59965] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence Election==
Unless the Code provides otherwise, where an accused is charged with an indictable offence or a hybrid offence which was elected to proceed indictably, the accused has the right of electing the mode of trial under s. 536(2).

The defence election consist of trial by the following methods:
# trial by a provincial court judge;
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge and jury, with a preliminary inquiry
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge alone, with a preliminary inquiry
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge and jury, without a preliminary inquiry
# trial by a superior court judge with a judge alone, without a preliminary inquiry

The Court is required to read the &quot;election address&quot; unless it is waived by the accused. The address is set out in s. 536:

{{quotation|
s.536...&lt;p&gt;
'''Election before justice in certain cases'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) If an accused is before a justice charged with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed in section 469, and the offence is not one over which a provincial court judge has absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice shall, after the information has been read to the accused, put the accused to an election in the following words:
:You have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you do not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a court composed of a judge and jury or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?
}}

The right of election is not available for indictable offences that are either &quot;absolute jurisdiction&quot; offences or &quot;exclusive jurisdiction offences&quot;.

Under s. 471, a person charged with an indictable offence is presumed to be be tried by a judge and jury unless they consent to otherwise.

An election to provincial court under s. 536(3) requires that the judge endorse the information showing the election and direct the matter before a provincial court judge for the purpose of taking a plea.

==Absolute and Exclusive Jurisdiction==

Under [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec553 s. 553], the Provincial Court has jurisdiction that is &quot;absolute and does not depend on the consent of the accused where the accused is charged in an information&quot; with several classes of offences. These are classified as &quot;absolute jurisdiction&quot; offences.

Under section 469, courts of criminal jurisdiction, being provincial courts, have judisdiction over all indictable offences except for those listed in the following table.

==Re-election==

The relevant provisions state as follows:
{{quotation|
'''Right to Re-elect'''&lt;Br&gt;
561 (2) An accused who elects to be tried by a provincial court judge or who does not request a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) may, not later than 14 days before the day first appointed for the trial, re-elect as of right another mode of trial, and may do so after that time with the written consent of the prosecutor.
&lt;P&gt;
(4) idem — Where an accused wishes to re-elect under subsection (2), the accused shall give notice in writing that he wishes to re-elect together with the written consent of the prosecutor, where that consent is required, to the provincial court judge before whom the accused appeared and pleaded or to a clerk of the court.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec561 CCC]
}}

After the initial election, the Defence may change the mode of trial by re-electing under s. 561. The Defence is permitted to elect from provincial court to Superior Court judge alone or judge and jury (s.561(2)). This will only be possible without consent of the Prosecution when it is within the 14 day time limit.

There is a discretion with the provincial court judge to allow re-election during a trial to allow the accused to re-elect without the Crown's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Re Diamonti (1981), 61 CCC (2d) 483 (BCSC); R v Jonkers (1991) unreported (BCPC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused may only re-elect once, after which they have no further discretion of election.&lt;ref&gt;R v Ishmail, (1981) 6 WCB 148 (BSCS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much nicer than the micro-controllers.

Intel didn't support Vtune on Linux well when they spun Xscale off to Marvell, but TI used a completely different (non-infringing?) trace and profile architecture on the OMAP. Why these important commercial tools are so hard to obtain decent support for is confusing, but the Microsoft-Linux tension probably had something to do with it. Apparently you can use addr2line(1) with http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Profiling_with_DSS on the OMAP. Presumably if you profile your code on an OMAP, that will help you optimize it on whatever non-TI system you are targeting, as long as the cache geometries are sufficiently similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a quick reference page of sample functions that work with dates and times.

== Method ==
We will provide a sample list of XQuery expressions and their results.

=== Current Date ===
This function returns the current date on the system that is executing the XQuery in W3C XML Schema date format:
   current-date()
Result:
   2010-05-28-05:00

Note that the &quot;-05:00&quot; is the offset from GMT of the server.

=== Current Time ===
   current-time()
Result:
   07:02:11.616-05:00

=== Current Date and Time ===
   current-dateTime()
Result
   2010-05-28T06:59:05.526-05:00

Note that default the letter 'T&quot; seperates the date and the time.  The results after the decimal point are the number of milliseconds.

=== One Week Ago ===
   xs:date(current-dateTime()) - xs:dayTimeDuration('P7D')
Result:
   2010-05-21-05:00

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Coordinates|Next=Polar coordinate system}}

The rectangular coordinate system, or Cartesian coordinate system, is a systematic way of locating objects. It was invented by a mathematician called Descartes. It is similar, though not exactly the same as, the coordinate systems in geography or computer literacy.

==Basic concept==
[[File:Cartesian plane.svg|right|300px|thumb|A summary of basic Cartesian plane-related terms]]
A rectangular coordinate plane, or Cartesian plane, is made of two axes, the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis is the horizontal axis, while the y-axis is the vertical one. The point of intersection of these two axes is called the origin, and is always named ''O''. On the x-axis and y-axis is the scale, which is very similar to those in statistical diagrams, only there are negative numbers. In fact, they look like number lines, one horizontal and one vertical, with the '0' points overlapping.

We can locate a point in the coordinate system with an ordered pair. An ordered pair is made of two numbers: the reading of the two axes. We put the x reading first, then the y, like this: (x, y). The coordinate plane is divided into four parts: the first quadrant (quadrant I), the second quadrant (quadrant II), the third quadrant (quadrant III) and the fourth quadrant (quadrant IV). The position of the four quadrants can be found on the figure on the right. A point can lie on any of these quadrants, the x-axis, the y-axis or the origin. We can find out some basic properties of the ordered pair just by looking at the position of the point.
* Quadrant I: (''x'', ''y'')
* Quadrant II: (''-y'', ''y'')
* Quadrant III: (''-x'', ''-y'')
* Quadrant IV: (''x'', ''-y'')
* The x-axis: (''x or -x'', 0)
* The y-axis: (0, ''y or -y'')
* The origin: (1, 1)

When determining the ordered pair of a point, remember that the scale may not necessarily be one-to-one. That means the numbers don't have to go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. They can also go 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or even 5, 10, 15, 20.

If you are absolutely sure that two points form a horizontal of vertical line, the definition of horizontal being parallel to the x-axis and the definition of vertical being parallel to the y-axis, you can find the one or both of the coordinates of one point with reference to another, without the help of the scale. For example, if ''P'' (3, 4) is on the same vertical line as ''Q'' (3, ''y''), then ''y'' = 4.

==Determining length and area==
[[File:Cartesian plane problem.svg|right|300px]]
We will introduce the next part with a complex problem (see the figure on the right).&lt;br/&gt;
Given:
*''XD''//''YE''
Find:
*The length of ''QP''
*The sum of all shaded areas
*The coordinates of ''I'' if ''F'': (-2, -3)

It looks a bit complicated at first, so let us start from the line on the first quadrant, ''QP'', which appears to be rather easy. We will work out all the unknowns if we can as well as solve the first bulleted goal. First, let's take a look at the coordinates of ''P''. They are (1, 2). As ''P'' and ''Q'' lie on the same horizontal line, their ''y''-coordinate must be the same. Therefore, the coordinates of ''Q'' must be (3, 2). In other words, ''z'' = 2. To find the length of PQ, all we need to do is to find the difference between their ''x''-coordinates; in this case, 3 - 1 = 2 units. Therefore, ''QP'' = 2 units. In mathematical representation, that would be:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } P = 2\\
\therefore z = 2 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ PQ &amp;= 3 - 1\\
&amp;=2 \text{ units} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Good! Now that we have solved the first goal, let's move on to the little triangle on the second quadrant. Again, we'll work out all the unknowns. First, let's look at the ''x''-coordinate of ''C''. we already know that ''z'' = 2, so ''-z'' must be -2, and so is the ''x''-coordinate of ''C''. What about the ''y''-coordinate? we know that B and C lie on the same horizontal line, so their ''y''-coordinates must be the same. Therefore, the ''y''-coordinate of ''C'' must be 1 also, and ''y'' = 1. The ''x''-coordinate of ''B'', called ''x'', is also missing. As A and B are on the same vertical line, their ''x''-coordinate must be the same. So, we can deduce that ''x'' = -4. In mathematical expressions:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The }\ x \text{-coordinate of }\ C  &amp;= -z \\
&amp;= 1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } B = 1\\
\therefore y = 1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } x \text{-coordinate of } A = -4\\
\therefore x = -4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Next, we will find out the area of the triangle, ''ABC''. This is going to prove to be very helpful when finding the total area of the shaded regions. Before we do that, we must find out the height and base of the triangle. Do you still remember the formula for the area of triangles? It is height times base over two. Let's choose ''BC'' as the base of the triangle. As AB and BC are perpendicular to each other, ''AB'' can be the height. As ''BC'' is horizontal, the length of ''BC'' is the difference between the ''x''-coordinates of ''B'' and ''C''. That would be -4 and -1, so the length of ''BC'' is  [(-1)-(-4)] units = 3 units. With ''AB'' the situation is opposite. Since AB is a vertical line, we should find the difference between their ''y''-coordinates instead. In this case, that would be (3-1) units = 2 units. Therefore, the area if triangle ''ABC'' is  (3-2) sq. units = 1 sq. unit. Let's see what that is in mathematical expressions.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ BC  &amp;= x - (-z) \text{ units} \\
&amp;= [(-1)-(-4)] \text{ units}\\
&amp;= 3 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ AB  &amp;= 3 - 1 \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 2 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of }\ \triangle ABC  &amp;= \frac{BC \times AB}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= \frac{3 \times 2}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 3 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Now we only have to figure out the area of the figure in the two bottom quadrants. The figure is shaped like a trapezium with a triangle stuck to its side and a hole in the middle. Using the knowledge we learnt previously, you should be able to figure out that ''a'' = -4 and ''b'' = -6. Note that we already know the value of ''-z'' from above, which is -2. Now we have to find the areas of the trapezium, the triangle, and the squared hole. Let's figure out the triangle first. Draw an imaginary line from ''Z'' perpendicular to ''XY'', and name it ''R''.  The coordinates of ''R'' are (-4, -5) with reference to points ''X'' and ''Z''. The lengths of ''RZ'' and ''XY'' should be 1 and 4 respectively, so the area of triangle ''XYZ'' is surely 2 sq. units. The details are presented below in mathematical expressions.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } x \text{-coordinate of } X = -4\\
\therefore a = -4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } Y = -6\\
\therefore b = -6 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } D = -z \\
= -2 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ ZR  &amp;= (-5) - (-4) \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 1 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ XY  &amp;= (-2) - (-6) \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 4 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of }\ \triangle XYZ &amp;= \frac{ZR \times XY}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= \frac{1 \times 4}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 2 \text{ sq.  units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Now we have to find the area of the right-angled trapezium. Do you still remember the formula for the area of a trapezium? It is the sum of the parallel lines times the height, over two. We need to find the length of the parallel lines and height in order to find the area. We already know the height ''XY''. The lengths of ''XD'' and ''YE'' are 9 and 8 respectively, so the area of the trapezium is 34 sq. units. The details are below.


&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ XD  &amp;= (-4) - 5 \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 9 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The length of }\ YE  &amp;= (-4) - 4 \text{ units} \\
&amp;= 4 \text{ units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of trapezium}\ XYDE &amp;= \frac{(XD+YE) \times XY}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= \frac{(9+4) \times 4}{2} \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 26 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Our next step is to find the area of the square. The formula for the square is the length of one side squared, so the area of square ''FGHI'' is ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;= 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; units = 4 units.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The area of square}\ FGHI &amp;= FI^2 \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= z^2 \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 2^2 \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 4 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The last part of point two is figuring out the total shaded area using the skills we learnt from previous chapters such as [[../Plane shapes|plane shapes]]. The first job is finding the total area of the figure in the third and fourth quadrants. The shaded area of the third and fourth quadrants = The area of pentagon XZYED - The area of square FGHI = The area of triangle XYZ + The area of trapezium XYDE - The area of square FGHI = (2+26-4) sq. units = 24 sq. units. Next, we add that to the area of triangle ABC, which gives us (24+3) sq. units = 11 sq. units. The mathematical expressions are shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp;\text{The shaded area in quadrants III and IV }\\
&amp;= \text{Area of } \triangle XYZ \text{ sq. units} + \text{Area of trapezium } XZYED - \text{Area of square } FGHI \\
&amp;= (2+26-4) \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 24 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{The sum of all shaded areas } &amp;= (24+3) \text{ sq. units} \\
&amp;= 27 \text{ sq. units}  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Since we have finished two goals already, it is time to find the third one. The third goal requires a technique that is the other way around the ones we used above. You may have noticed that the third goal is different from the others in that it requires the coordinates to be found, not a measure. Remember that the only coordinate we know from the question is those of point ''F''. Also recall that all four sides of a square are the same. Since we can find the length of a segment given the coordinates of its endpoints, we can find the coordinates of the endpoints with the length of a segment.

So, how exactly do we do it? The coordinates of ''F'' are (-2, -3). We can find the ''y''-coordinate of ''I'' which, we have learnt is the same as ''F'''s. Therefore, the ''y''-coordinate is -3. But what about the ''x''-coordinate? Since we know that ''FI'' = ''z'' = 2 units, we can work out that the ''x''-coordinate of ''I'' is [(-2)+2)] units = 4 units. Remember that the position of the endpoint whose coordinate we are finding relative to the endpoint whose coordinate we already know is significant. If ''I'' were on the right of F, not on the left of it, its ''x''-coordinate would be [(-2)-2)] units = -4 units. If ''I'' were above or below ''F'', their ''x''-cooridinates would be the same, and the ''y''-coordinate of ''I'' would be [(-3)-2)] units = -5 units (below) or [(-3)+2)] units = -1 unit (above).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } F = -3\\
\therefore \text{The } y \text{-coordinate of } I = -3 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \because FI = z\\
= 2 \text{ units} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \therefore \text{The } x \text{-coordinate of } I = [(-2)+2)] \\
&amp;= 4 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

That's it! Not only have we learnt how to figure out the length and area of shapes and coordinates of points in a rectangular coordinate plane, but we have also seen an important example of how area is calculated.</text>

In the coordinate system we have discussed last chapter, the rectangular/Cartesian coordinate system, the origin is only used to determine how the coordinates are numbered. However, there is another coordinate system where the origin is the very heart and sole of the system. It is called the polar coordinate system. In this chapter, we will discuss the polar coordinate system, and compare it to the rectangular coordinate system.

== Basic concepts ==
[[File:Polar concept introduction.svg|250px|right]]
On the right is a typical polar coordinate plane. Nothing is italicised in the diagram because of technical difficulties. The point on the centre is the pole, and is the 'origin' of the polar coordinate system. ''OX'' is called the polar axis. ''OP'' is the radius vector of ''P'' and is usualy represented by a lowercase ''r''.

== Determining length and area ==

== Comparing the two coordinate systems ==

This page deals with methods which are available for most estimation commands. This can be useful for all kind of regression models. 

== Formulas ==

Most estimation commands use a formula interface. The outcome is left of the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; and the covariates are on the right.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
y ~ x1 + x2
&lt;/source&gt;

It is easy to include multinomial variable as predictive variables in a model. If the variable is not already a factor, one just need to use the &lt;code&gt;as.factor()&lt;/code&gt; function. This will create a set of dummy variables. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
y ~ as.factor(x)
&lt;/source&gt;

For instance, we can use the Star data in the '''Ecdat''' package : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(&quot;Ecdat&quot;)
data(Star)
summary(lm(tmathssk ~ as.factor(classk), data = Star))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;I()&lt;/code&gt; takes arguments &quot;as is&quot;. For instance, if you want to include in your equation a modified variable such as a squarred term or the addition of two variables, you may use &lt;code&gt;I()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
lm(y ~ x1 + I(x1^2) + x2)
lm(y ~ I(x1 + x2))
lm(I(y-100) ~ I(x1-100) + I(x2 - 100))
&lt;/source&gt;

It is easy to include interaction between variables by using &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; adds all interaction terms whereas &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; adds interaction terms and individual terms.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
lm(y~x1:x2) # interaction term only
lm(y~x1*x2) # interaction and individual terms
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to generate polynomials using the &lt;code&gt;poly()&lt;/tt&gt; function with option &lt;code&gt;raw = TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 3, raw = TRUE))
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also an advanced formula interface which is useful for instrumental variables models and mixed models. For instance &lt;code&gt;ivreg()&lt;/code&gt; ('''AER''') uses this advanced formulas interface. The instrumental variables are entered after the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. See the [[R_Programming/Linear_Models#Instrumental_Variables|Instrumental Variables]] section if you want to learn more.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(&quot;AER&quot;)
ivreg(y ~ x | z)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Output ==

In addition to the &lt;code&gt;summary()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; functions which display the output for most estimation commands, some authors have developed simplified output functions. One of them is the &lt;code&gt;display()&lt;/code&gt; function in the '''arm''' package. Another one is the &lt;code&gt;coefplot()&lt;/code&gt; in the '''arm''' package which displays the coefficients with confidence intervals in a plot. According to the standards defined by Nathaniel Beck&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Beck &quot;Making regression and related output more helpful to users&quot; The Political Methodologist 2010 http://politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/2576/beck_tpm_edited.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, Jeff Gill developped &lt;code&gt;graph.summary()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Gill &lt;code&gt;graph.summary()&lt;/code&gt; http://artsci.wustl.edu/~jgill/Models/graph.summary.s&lt;/ref&gt;. This command does not show useless auxiliary statistics.

== Delta Method ==

* If you want to know the standard error of a transformation of one of your parameter, you need to use the '''delta method'''
* &lt;code&gt;deltamethod()&lt;/code&gt; in the '''msm''' package&lt;ref name = &quot;ucla&quot;&gt;See the example on the UCLA Statistics webpage : http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/deltamethod.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;delta.method()&lt;/code&gt; in the '''alr3''' package.
* &lt;code&gt;deltaMethod&lt;/code&gt; in the '''car''' package.

== Zelig : the pseudo-bootstrap method ==

'''Zelig'''&lt;ref&gt;  Kosuke Imai, Gary King and Olivia Lau (2009). Zelig: Everyone's Statistical Software. R package version 3.4-5.
  http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Zelig&lt;/ref&gt; is a postestimation package which simulates in the distribution of the estimated parameters and computes the quantities of interest such as marginal effects or predicted probabilities. This is especially useful for non-linear models. '''Zelig''' comes with a set of ''vignettes'' which explain how to deal with each kind of model. 
There are three commands. 
* &lt;code&gt;zelig()&lt;/code&gt; estimates the model and draws from the distribution of estimated parameters. 
* &lt;code&gt;setx()&lt;/code&gt; fixes the values of explanatory variables.
* &lt;code&gt;sim()&lt;/code&gt; computes the quantities of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Dietary Fiber===
Eating the right amount of dietary fiber a day can help manage a person's weight as well as the prevention of obesity. According to the article written by Linda Boeckner and Karen Schledewitz, &quot;soluble and insoluble fibers make up the two basic categories of dietary fiber. Insoluble fibers – cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin – are not soluble in water. Foods that contain insoluble fibers are wheat bran, whole grain products and vegetables. Insoluble fibers are responsible for increased stool bulk and help to regulate bowel movements.&quot; With that said, fibers can do great progression for the human body. However, eating too much fiber can cause a strain on the human body therefore it is important to watch the intake of fiber. There are many side effects that can be caused by consuming too much fiber such as an unbalanced diet, or inadequate liquids that can result to pain. The best way to see if fiber is meeting needs, going to see a nutritionist is recommended. Everyone's needs are different based on their age, sex and activity level. A great resource to visit is www.mypyramid.gov, this gives an insight on what foods will help provide a balanced diet such as fruits, vegetables and grains. {{Citation

===From the Harvard school of public health:===

==Introduction==
Fiber refers to carbohydrates that can't be digested. it is present in all plants that are eaten for food, (fruits, begetables, grains, and legumes.)There are a number of ways to categorize fiber. One way is from its source of origin, for example, fiber from grains is referred to cereal fiber. Another way is how easily the fiber dissolves in water. Soluble fiber partially dissolves, and insoluble fiver does not dissolve. 

Currently its recommended that children and adults consume at least 20 grams of dietary fiber per day from food. The more calories you eat each day, the more fiber you need; teens and men may require upwards of 30 to 35 grams per day or more. Unfortunately, the average American eats only 15 grams of dietary fiber a day. 

Fiber appears to reduce the risk of developing various conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation. 

==Fiber and Colon Cancer==
For a long time, Americans have been told to consume a high-fiber diet to lower the risk of colon cancer—mainly on the basis of results from relatively small studies. More recently, larger and better-designed studies have largely failed to show a link between fiber and colon cancer. One example is a Harvard study that followed over 80,000 female nurses for 16 years—found that dietary fiber was not strongly associated with a reduced risk for either colon cancer or polyps (a precursor to colon cancer). 

==Fiber and Heart Disease==
In the United States, coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death for both men and women. This disease is characterized by a buildup of cholesterol-filled plaque in the coronary arteries which are the arteries that feed the heart. This causes them to become hard and narrow, a process referred to as atherosclerosis. Total blockage of a coronary artery produces a heart attack.

High intake of dietary fiber has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease in a number of large studies that followed people for many years. (3) In a Harvard study of over 40,000 male health professionals, researchers found that a high total dietary fiber intake was linked to a 40 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease, compared to a low fiber intake. (4) Cereal fiber, which is found in grains, seemed particularly beneficial. A related Harvard study of female nurses produced quite similar findings. (5)

Fiber intake has also been linked with the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of factors that increases the chances of developing heart disease and diabetes. These factors include high blood pressure, high insulin levels, excess weight (especially around the abdomen), high levels of triglycerides, the body's main fat-carrying particle, and low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. Several studies suggest that higher intake of cereal fiber and whole grains may somehow ward off this increasingly common syndrome. (6,7)  
 
==Sources of Soluble &amp; Insoluble Fiber== 

Soluble Fiber: Oatmeal, oatbran; Nuts and seeds; Legumes; Beans; Dried peas; Lentils; Apples; Pears; Strawberries; Blueberries 
 
Insoluble Fiber: Whole wheat bread; Barley; Couscous; Brown rice; Bulgur; Whole grain breakfast cereals; Wheat bran; Seeds; Carrots; Cucumbers; Zucchini; Celery; Tomatoes 
 
The Harvard studies of male health professionals and female nurses both found that a diet high in cereal fiber was linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Other studies, such as the Black Women's Health Study (8) and the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition–Potsdam, have found similar results. 

When it comes to factors that increase the risk of developing diabetes, a diet low in cereal fiber and rich in high-glycemic-index foods (which cause big spikes in blood sugar) seems particularly bad. Both Harvard studies—of nurses and of male health professionals—found that this sort of diet more than doubled the risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to a diet high in cereal fiber and low in high-glycemic-index foods. (9-11)

A recent meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21 percent less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week. (12) Another meta-analysis of several large studies, including more than 700,000 men and women, found that eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21 percent. (13) So to protect against heart disease and diabetes, perhaps the best advice is to choose whole grain, high-fiber foods at most meals.

==Fiber and water intake==
 
The fiber in wheat bran and oat bran seems to be more effective than similar amounts of fiber from fruits and vegetables. Experts recommend increasing fiber intake gradually rather than suddenly. As fiber intake is increased, the intake of beverages should also be increased, since fiber absorbs water.  

==Recommendations for Fiber==
Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet, and you should get a least 20 grams a day, more is better. The best sources are whole grain foods, fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts.  Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juices. Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole grain products. Choose whole grain cereals for breakfast. Snack on raw vegetables instead of chips, crackers, or chocolate bars. Substitute legumes for meat two to three times per week in chili and soups.

==dietary fiber and diabetes==
A high dietary fiver intake is recommended by most diabetes and nutritional associations. &quot;It is accepted that viscous and gel-forming properties of soluble DF inhibit macronutrient absorption, reduce postprandial glucose response, and beneficially influence certain blood lipids. Colonic fermentation of naturally available high fiber foods can also be mainly attributed to soluble DF, whereas no difference between soluble and insoluble DF consumption on the regulation of body weight has been observed. However, in prospective cohort studies, it is primarily insoluble cereal DF and whole grains, and not soluble DF, that is consistently associated with reduced diabetes risk, suggesting that further, unknown mechanisms are likely to be involved. Recent research indicates that DF consumption contributes to a number of unexpected metabolic effects independent from changes in body weight, which include improvement of insulin sensitivity, modulation of the secretion of certain gut hormones, and effects on various metabolic and inflammatory markers that are associated with the metabolic syndrome.

==Health benefits and practical aspects of high-fiber diets==
Over the past 20 years dietary fiber has emerged as a leading dietary factor in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. High fiber intakes are associated with lower serum cholesterol concentrations, lower risk of coronary heart disease, reduced blood pressure, enhanced weight control, better glycemic control, reduced risk of certain forms of cancer, and improved gastrointestinal function. Dietary fiber can be categorized into water-soluble and water-insoluble components. Dried beans, oat products, and certain fruits and vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber. Most plant foods are good sources of insoluble fiber and wheat bran is a concentrated form of insoluble fiber. Current guidelines advise a doubling of dietary fiber intake for Americans. Inclusion of ample servings of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and dried beans and peas will help individuals meet these guidelines. 

http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/59/5/1242S

Insoluble fiber binds water, making stools softer and bulkier. Therefore, fiber, especially that found in whole grain products, is helpful in the treatment and prevention of constipation, hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. Diverticula are pouches of the intestinal wall that can become inflamed and painful. In the past, a low-fiber diet was prescribed for this condition. It is now known that a high-fiber diet gives better results once the inflammation has subsided.
Low blood cholesterol levels (below 200 mg/dl.) have been associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. The body eliminates cholesterol through the excretion of bile acids. Water-soluble fiber binds bile acids, suggesting that a high-fiber diet may result in an increased excretion of cholesterol. Some types of fiber, however, appear to have a greater effect than others. The fiber found in rolled oats is more effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels than the fiber found in wheat. Pectin has a similar effect in that it, too, can lower the amount of cholesterol in the blood.Other claims for fiber are less well founded. Dietary fiber may help reduce the risk of some cancers, especially colon cancer. This idea is based on information that insoluble fiber increases the rate at which wastes are removed from the body. This means the body may have less exposure to toxic substances produced during digestion. However, more recent studies have not confirmed the protective effects of fiber in developing colon cancer. A diet high in animal fat and protein also may play a role in the development of colon cancer.

High-fiber diets may be useful for people who wish to lose weight. Fiber itself has no calories, yet provides a &quot;full&quot; feeling because of its water-absorbing ability. For example, an apple is more filling than a half cup of apple juice that contains about the same calories. Foods high in fiber often require more chewing, so a person is unable to eat a large number of calories in a short amount of time.

==Foods high in dietary fiber==
Soluble: beans, oat bran, fruits, and vegetables.
Insoluble: whole grains, vegetables and beans.

Dietary fiber is found only in plant foods: fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains. Meat, milk and eggs do not contain fiber. The form of food may or may not affect its fiber content. Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables contain just as much fiber as raw ones. Other types of processing, though, may reduce fiber content. Drying and crushing, for example, destroy the water-holding qualities of fiber.

The removal of seeds, peels or hulls also reduces fiber content. Whole tomatoes have more fiber than peeled tomatoes, which have more than tomato juice. Likewise, whole wheat bread contains more fiber than white bread. Table 2 lists the dietary fiber content of some common foods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The methods in this section are for solving numerically equations of the form  ''f''(x) = 0  that cannot be solved analytically, or are too difficult to solve analytically. 

==Change of sign methods==
===Introduction===
If we have a continuous function ''f''(''x''), and two ''x'' values ''a'' and ''b'', then provided ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') have opposite signs, we know that the interval [''a'', ''b''] contains a root of the equation ''f''(''x'') = 0 (somewhere between ''a'' and ''b'' must be a value where ''f''(''x'') = 0).

Graphically, if the curve y = ''f''(''x'') is above the ''x''-axis at one point and below it at another, it must have crossed the ''x''-axis somewhere in between. Therefore, a root of ''f''(''x'') = 0 lies somewhere in between the two points. 

Change of sign methods use this information to progressively shrink an interval containing a change of sign, in order to find a root. 

Note that: 
* The function must be continuous within the interval for the above to hold true
* There may be more than one root in the interval. For example, ''f''(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-''x'', solving ''f''(''x'')=0 . The interval [-2, 2] has a change of sign and contains three roots: x=-1,x=0,x=1
* Repeated roots do not cause a change of sign. For example, solving ''f''(''x'')=0 where ''f''(''x'')=(''x'' -1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . ''f''(''x'') will evaluate as positive at the endpoints of any interval, yet there is a repeated root at ''x''=1.

===Bisection===
Bisection is a change of sign method. It requires an initial interval containing a change of sign. On each step (called an '''iteration'''), the bisection method involves doing the following:
# Bisect (divide into 2 equal parts) an interval in which a root is known to lie, hence giving two new intervals.
# Evaluate the function at the endpoints of the two new intervals.
# A change of sign indicates (provided the function is continuous) that there is a root in that interval. Hence deduce that a root lies in the interval which has a change of sign of the evaluation of the function between its endpoints.
# Take the interval containing a root as your new starting interval in the next iteration.


Given an interval [''a'', ''b''], let ''x'' be the new estimate of the root. 

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a+b}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The function is then evaluated at ''a'', ''b'' and ''x'', and the interval containing a sign change - either [''a'', ''x''] or [''x'', ''b''] - is selected as the new interval. 

[graph, example]

====Advantages====
* Bisection always converges - it will always find a root in the given starting interval.
* It carries a definite statement of the bounds in which the result must lie. Numerical work is of much more value if you know how accurate the answer you obtain is.
* It has a fixed rate of convergence - the interval halves in size on each iteration. Under certain conditions, other methods may converge more slowly.

====Disadvantages====
* It requires a starting interval containing a change of sign. Therefore it cannot find repeated roots. 
* It has a fixed rate of convergence, which can be much slower than other methods, requiring more iterations to find the root to a given degree of precision. 


===False position===
False position expands on bisection by using information about the value of the function at the endpoints to make a more intelligent estimate of the root. If the value of ''f''(''x'') at one endpoint is closer to zero than at the other endpoint, then you would expect the root to lie closer to that endpoint. In many cases, this will lead to faster convergence on the root than bisection, which always estimates that the root is directly in the middle of the interval. 

The procedure is nearly exactly the same as bisection. However, given an interval [''a'',''b''], the new estimate of the root, ''x'', is instead:

&lt;math&gt; x = \frac {af(b) - bf(a)} {f(b) - f(a)} &lt;/math&gt;


This can be seen as just a weighted average of ''a'' and ''b'', with the weightings being the value of ''f''(''x'') at the other endpoint. This is because we want the endpoint with a smaller ''f''(''x'') to have a larger weight, so that the estimate is closer to it. We therefore use the larger value of ''f''(''x'') as the weighting for the endpoint which produces a smaller ''f''(''x'').

The false position method is equivalent to constructing a line through the points on the curve at ''x''=''a'' and ''x''=''b'', and using the intersection of this line with the ''x''-axis as the new estimate. 

[graph, example, advantages, disadvantages]

([[w:False_position_method]])

==Other methods==

===Iterative method notation===
''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' means the value of ''x'' after ''r'' iterations. For example, the initial estimate of the root would be ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the estimate obtained by performing one iteration of the method on this would be ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. 

We write down iterative methods in the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; (the next estimate of the root) in terms of ''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the current estimate of the root). For example, the fixed point iteration method is:

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+1} = g(x_r) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If the new estimate is calculated from the previous two estimates, as in the case of the secant method, the new estimate of the root will be ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, written in terms of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Secant===
This is similar in some ways to the false position method. It uses the co-ordinates of the previous two points on the curve to approximate the curve by a straight line. Like the false position method, it uses the place where this line crosses the axis as the new estimate of the root.

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+2} = \frac { x_rf(x_{r+1}) - x_{r+1}f(x_r) } { f(x_{r+1}) - f(x_r) } &lt;/math&gt;

[graph, example, advantages, disadvantages]

===Newton-Raphson===
The Newton-Raphson method is based on obtaining a new estimate of the root on each iteration by approximating ''f'' by its tangent and finding where this tangent crosses the ''x''-axis.

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+1} = x_r - \frac{f(x_r)}{f'(x_r)} &lt;/math&gt;

[graph, example, advantages, disadvantages]

===Fixed point iteration===
In this method, the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; is rearranged into the form ''x'' = g(''x''). We then take an initial estimate of ''x'' as the starting value, and calculate a new estimate using g(''x'').

&lt;math&gt; x_{r+1} = g(x_r) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If this method converges, then provided g is continuous it will converge to a '''fixed point''' of ''g'' (where the input is the same as the output, giving ''x'' = ''g''(''x'') ). This value of ''x'' will also satisfy ''f''(''x'') = 0, hence giving a root of the equation. 

Fixed point iteration will not always converge. There are infinitely many rearrangements of ''f''(''x'') = 0 into ''x'' = ''g''(''x''). Some rearrangements will only converge given a starting value very close to the root, and some will not converge at all. In all cases, it is the gradient of ''g'' that influences whether convergence occurs. Convergence will occur (given a suitable starting value), if when near the root: 

&lt;math&gt; -1 &lt; g'(x) &lt; 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''g''&amp;#039; is the gradient of ''g''. Convergence will be fastest when ''g''&amp;#039;(''x'') is close to 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Historical Issues: Vienna, Austria ==


In Linz, Austria the oldest tradition of &quot;Torte&quot; or cake can be traced to a black currant latice work detailed creation in the year 1696.  The &quot;Linzertorte&quot; as it is known today is still produced using much of the original recipe and 80,000 tortes are produced each year for Austrians and people all over the world.  A history of fine torte production has followed over the years in Austria and this art form has become an intertwined aspect of Viennese culture.

In 1832 in Vienna, a talented sixteen year old apprentice chef named Franz Sacher created a very special chocolate cake.  The legendary story began when Prince Metternich requested a mememorable creation be prepared for some important visitors; that day the head chef was home sick and the order became the young Sacher's first culinary test and proved to be his enduring legacy.  The Original Sacher Torte was created and established a long line of rivals and imitators that can still be found to this day in many of Vienna's finest ''kaffeehauser''(coffee houses).

It is important to realize Vienna's claim of being the &quot;coffee house capital of the world&quot;.  A strong tradition of coffee houses created an environment where people both local and visitors could meet, share ideas, and leisurely discuss the events of the day.  The coffee houses status in Vienna would become central to its culture and tradition with the cornerstone of each fine coffee house being its freshly baked cakes.  The analogy of Vienna's coffee house and fine cakes would be similar to the tradition of baseball and apple pie in the USA.

These classic tortes overtime became highly regarded works of art and intense rivalries developed as to who could create the finest work of art.  Today, the Original [[Sacher Torte]] is one of the most recognized cakes in the world and even helped establish the five star Hotel Sacher Wein founded in 1876 by Franz Sacher's son, Eduard Sacher.  The Original Sacher Torte is still made almost entirely by hand using Franz Sacher's recipe and is a closely guarded secret.  More than 360,000 cakes a year are made in Vienna by its 41 employees, many of which are shipped all over the world allowing a &quot;taste of Vienna&quot; to be delivered to many far away places.  The most popular destinations for its cakes are Germany, Italy, France, The USA, and many countries in Asia.  The Original Sacher Torte is a combination of two layers of soft and light chocolate cake separated by apricot jam and coated with a chocolate icing, often accompanied with unsweetened whipped cream.

The tradition of Grand Hotels having their own signature cake continued with the creation of the &quot;Imperial Torte&quot; to celebrate the opening of the Hotel Imperial during the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna.  The cake was designed to impress the Emperor Francis Joseph I and the square shaped chocolate torte is still produced today.  Other Vienesse classic cakes include a Sacher Torte made by Demel confectionery which up until the early 1960's had fought a legal battle over the name rights of the cake.  The &quot;Esterhazy Torte&quot; can trace its legacy back to the days of the ruling Hungarian family of the same name and is still produced in many of Vienna's coffee houses.

The issue of the &quot;torte wars&quot; and the competition to create a memorable cake is significant when you consider how coffee houses and their cakes have become an integral part of Viennese culture.  When the question is asked, how much of this culture has shaped the world?  Consider how many coffee houses (although somewhat less refined) are there in the US today.  It would be difficult to walk more than a few blocks in most major US cities without walking past some type of American style coffee house selling freshly baked goods with gourmet coffee.  Bookstore/coffee houses often provide the same type of environment, a place to relax, meet friends or family, and talk about important issues in peoples lives.  Many Americans officially start their day with a visit to the local coffee house and the number of new franchises being established shows the trend in America has embraced part of this export of Viennese culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not 100% sure that I've understood the following sentences:
* An algebraic equation can have at most as many positive roots as the number of changes of sign in &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* An algebraic equation can have at most as many negative roots as the number of changes of sign in &lt;math&gt;f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the first statements as an example - in the simple case of: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; changes it sign &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; times while it has &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; positive solution (which are identical). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Matanbz|Matanbz]] ([[User talk:Matanbz|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Matanbz|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:I believe these comments are meant to apply to coefficients of the polynomials.  In the example you give &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2-2x+1&lt;/math&gt; so the coefficients are 1,-2, and 1 and so there are there are two changes in sign. I think this is generally known as [[w:Descartes' rule of signs|Descartes' rule of signs]], which gives slightly more info, but the extra information is not so relevant here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Apfelmus' outline: Calculating with Truth ==

Numbers are not the only thing we can calculate with. In the following, we are going to calculate with ''truth'' (also called ''boolean'') values.

* Introduction to Types, &lt;code&gt;2 == False&lt;/code&gt; is ill-typed.

* Pattern Matching
* Infix operators?

  True  || x = True
  False || y = y

* Defining more functions: Guards

 abs x
     | x &lt;= 0    = 0 - x
     | otherwise = x

=== Duplode's comment ===

In my attempt to write this page I took some liberties with Apfelmus' outline. One particularly important change was the omission of definitions for &lt;tt&gt;(||)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;(&amp;&amp;)&lt;/tt&gt;. I feel that introducing pattern matching on the top of all the other things discussed on this very early module might not work as well as we would like. Furthermore, it won't be intuitive to a newbie that pattern matching with pseudo-literal values like &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt; is the same thing as pattern matching with, say, &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;tt&gt;; so it may be better to defer this explanation a little. One possible place for that would be the discussion on piece-wise definitions, if it is going to remain within Basics (I assume we will need to do so, since it is a prerequisite for Recursion at the very least). And finally, comments, criticism and bold rearrangements are always welcome :) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 07:46, 29 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Intermediate Accounting''' is a course of study in financial accounting.  In traditional universities it is often a two-semester course required of students majoring in accounting.  While the title could be applied to managerial accounting, the title in use is most commonly applied to the courses and textbooks in the financial accounting area, and financial accounting is the topic of this wikibook.

The scope of the course is broad:  to cover, in considerable detail, the accounting concepts, policies, and practices involving most types of accounting assets, liabilities, and equities.  The purpose is to describe options in prevailing practice and to give adequate preparation to accountants for treatment of most usual cases.  There will be specialized topics that are not covered.  Practices that are not Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP) are not the focus of this work, but may be covered in order to illustrate basic ideas.  Some other practices have become discredited and are no longer GAAP, and some other practices are arguably better treatments than current GAAP.

Prerequisites are:
*a basic understanding of financial accounting concepts, including debits and credits.  Perhaps helpful is this [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Financial_Accounting Financial Accounting introductory course at Wikiversity]

==Note on Writing and Sources==
The material in this textbook is meant to be written entirely from scratch, and not to copy wording or general form from any source, except where quotes explicitly noted by quotation marks and corresponding footnote references are to be provided.  Where material is quoted from another source, only short quotes consistent with copyright restrictions are to be included.

For a textbook, less specific attribution of material is ethically or legally required than for writing that purports to be original and to make new research contributions.  This is a textbook and is meant to be non-original, and kept simple, although we also hope to provide really good explanations of material.  Excessive footnoting would get in the way of learning, and the material is generally standard.  Experienced teachers of accounting who have perspective about multiple textbook approaches can usually present material in their own words, and also can understand when, in one source, original ideas or idiosyncratic language is being used which would require specific attribution, if mentioned here.  Current students may not have the same perspective to know when they're restating original ideas or wording that should be attributed.  Please take care, and give explicit attribution when in doubt.  This is a collective work.  Please note that it is easy for later editors to reword materials and remove footnotes where credit is not really due.  But it is hard for others, later, to identify the actual specific source for a given original phrasing or idea.  So again, please be conservative and note specific sources when in doubt.

In broad terms, the source for material in this textbook is the corpus of material taught by many teachers and many textbooks, and which comprise the usual content of Intermediate Accounting courses taught in the United States.  More specifically, the following textbooks have been consulted and serve as general background sources:

==Introduction on liabilities==
Liabilities are obligations.  For U.S. GAAP accounting, liabilities are broadly defined as being 
#probable future sacrifices of economic benefits
#that arise from present obligations
#that result from past transactions

Note while most liabilities involve known amounts of obligations to be paid in cash on specific dates, the definition is open to many other obligations where amounts and timing are not certain.

===Current vs. long-term liabilities===
Current liabilities are often loosely defined as liabilities that must be paid within one year.  For firms having [[w:operating cycles]] longer than one year, current liabilities are defined as those which must be paid during that longer period.  The more correct definition, however, is that current liabilities are liabilities that will by settled by current assets or by the creation of other current liabilities.

Typical short term liabilities include accounts payable, short-term notes payable, commercial paper, and trade notes payable.

For example, consider what happens in the last year of a long term note, when the full face amount of the bond will become payable.  Technically, it would appear the full amount due within one year is a current liability.  However, if a new note is in process, and various terms are met, it is allowable to classify the full value as being a long term note.  It will be replaced by a new long term note.  If the full amount will be fully paid off by cash or by creating new short-term liabilities such as a new short-term note, then the full amount is to be recorded as a current liability.

Other long-term term obligations that can be classified as current are those that are callable by the creditor. When a debt becomes callable in the upcoming year (or operating cycle, if longer), the debt is required to be classified as current, even if it is not expected to be called. Debt should also be classified as current if the creditor has the right to demand payment because of an existing violation of a provision of a debt agreement. Situations in which debt is not yet callable but will be callable within the year if a violation is not corrected within a specified grace period are current, unless it's probable that the violation will be collected or waived.

The classification of liabilities as either current or long-term is important because it helps investors and creditors assess the relative risk of a business's liabilities.

== Refinancing Short-Term Liabilities ==
The purpose of refinancing short term liabilities is to remove the expectation of using working capital during the ensuing fiscal year. This improves important financial ratios, such as the current ratio, making the organization more financially appealing.

Current Ratio - Current Assets/Current Liabilties

'''Conditions for Long-Term Refinancing'''

Certain conditions must be met for an organization to refinance on a long-term basis. According to FASB codification 470-10-45-14 and SFAS No. 6 (under the old system), a short-term liability can be excluded from current liabilities if:

(i) The entity intends to refinance the obligation on a long term basis.

and(ii)The intent to refinance the short-term obligation on a long-term basis is supported by an
ability to consummate the refinancing.


'''When Short-Term Liabilities intended for Refinancing are Repaid Early '''

Often an entity expresses intent to refinance short-term liabilities with long-term debt, but it ends up repaying the obligation before the issuance of the long-term debt. According to FASB codification 470-10-45-15 or SFAS No. 6, the short-term liability remains current, even if the funds used to repay are replenished by the long-term debt.

== Questions ==

     1. Which of the following liabilities should not be classified as current?
           a. accounts payable
           b. short-term notes payable
           c. short-term commercial paper that is expected to be refinanced with a long-term bond
           d. long-term debt that is callable within a year


     2. True/False: A long-term note payable that has become callable within a year increases the current ratio.

        Book Bonanza is a publishing company with the following financial obligations:
           -Accounts payable of $50,000
           -Long-term notes payable of $100,000 in which half of them become callable within the year
           -A long-term loan of $200,000 in which Book Bonanza is in violation of a debt agreement provision
            It is probable that it will be corrected within the grace period
           -$25,000 of short-term commercial paper that will be refinanced with a long-term loan 

     3. Calculate the total current liabilities

     4. Calculate the total non-current liabilities

     5. Pizza fountain has $50,000 in short-term commercial paper that is intends to refinance with a long term 
        loan of $300,000 in Dec. 2009. Pizza Fountain repaid half of commercial paper with excess cash in Oct.
        2009. $25,000 of the loan replenished working capital, $25,000 was used to repay the commercial paper,
        and $250,000 was used to purchase equipment. Calculate total current and non-current liabilities 
        related to these transactions.


'''Answers'''

     1. c
     2. false
     3. $100,000
     4. $275,000
     5. current- $25,000 non-current- $275,000

==Promissory notes==
===Credit Lines===
Short-term loans offered by a bank based by a prearranged line of credit.  Compensating balances are sometimes required to be on deposit with the lending bank and is usually calculated as a percentage of the line of credit.

==Bonds payable==
Accounting for bonds involves recording, at issue, both the nominal or face value of bonds issued, and also the amount of cash proceeds actually yielded by their sale.  The difference between these is recorded as a premium on bonds (when bond proceeds are higher than face value of bonds) or as a discount on bonds (when proceeds are lower than face value).  The difference arises because the bonds can only be sold for what investors are willing to pay.  Only rarely will the effective interest rate equal the stated interest rate (and then there will be no premium or discount).  When investors pay less than the face value of bonds, they are effectively demanding an &quot;effective interest rate&quot; that is higher than the stated interest rate.  When they pay more than face value, they are accepting an effective interest rate lower than the stated rate.

In subsequent periods, over the term of the bond, the premium or discount is &quot;amortized&quot; down towards zero.  The main principle applied is that interest expense is recorded in each period as the product of the book value of the bond times the effective interest rate.

===Amortization table===
An amortization table is useful to prepare upfront, and can be entirely determined using the terms of the bond contract and the purchase price of the bond (or equivalently in the proceeds yielded from its sale).  The nominal interest rate is stated in the bond contract;  the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return that is implicit in the cash flows (upfront yield of bond proceeds, vs. future nominal interest payments and payment of the face value of the bond at maturity).  The internal rate of return can be found by trial and error, or it can easily be calculated in software such as Excel spreadsheet software's Internal Rate of Return formula.

For a 2,000,000 face value 10 year bond with 10% annual interest, with interest paid semiannually, sold at a premium, yielding $2,080,000, the amortization table is as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
              Cash           Effective        Amortization of       Balance
              payments       interest         premium               outstanding
  Period                                                           (or carrying value)
    0
    1
    2
    3    
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Straightline variation===
When the results will not be materially different, it is allowable to use a straight-line approach to amortize the premium or discount, and accordingly to set what is the interest expense that is recorded.  The accounting principle involved is that of [[w:Materiality (auditing)|materiality]].

The corresponding amortization table for the same bond, but now using 
&lt;pre&gt;
              Cash           Effective        Amortization of       Balance
              payments       interest         premium               outstanding
  Period                                                           (or carrying value)
    0                                                               2,080,000
    1          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,076,000
    2          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,072,000
    3          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,068,000

   ...           ...           ...              ...                    ...

   20          100,000       96,000            4,000                2,000,000
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: where effective interest rate is more different from stated interest rate (or, equivalently, where bond proceeds are significantly different from face value of the bond), the effective interest rate method provides a materially better analysis.

===Debt issue costs===
A small complication is needed to treat the various administrative costs of a bond issuance, which reduce its overall yield of proceeds for the firm.  For exammple, consider a bond issue where $60,000 of printing, legal, and other administrative costs are incurred, where the face value is $10,000,000 bond, and total proceeds collected are $10,020,000.

Under U.S. GAAP accounting, oddly, the debt issue costs of $40,000 are recorded as an asset.  The overall cash proceeds received is not reported as that, but rather the cash collected less the debt issue cost is reported as increasing the firm's cash account.

&lt;pre&gt;
   Debt issue costs         $60,000
   Cash                  $9,960,000
      Bond payable                    $10,000,000
      Premium on bond                      20,000
&lt;/pre&gt;

In future periods, the debt issue cost is expensed off over the period of the bond.  For example, with straigthline amortization over 10 years, each year would show:
&lt;pre&gt;
   Debt issue expense         $6,000
      Debt issue cost                     $6,000

   Interest expense         $x-2,000
      Premium on bond         $2,000
      Interest payable                        $x
&lt;/pre&gt;

Under IFRS accounting, the accounting is done more naturally.  However, if the same straightline methods are used, the totals expensed each year are the same.

==Accounts payable==
Most purchases made for services or supplies are made on open accounts.  The obligations that arise from these purchases are known as accounts payable.  Purchases made on open account generally have a short-term payment period, are non-interest bearing, and are reported at face-value (time value of money is ignored).  Unlike most other payables, the only formal agreement between companies related to purchases on account is the purchase invoice.

==Trade Notes Payable==
Trade notes issued for merchandise purchases that are not made on open account.  Unlike accounts payable, trade notes are characterized by longer terms and written promissory notes.

==Unearned revenue==

==Advance collections==

===Refundable Deposits===
When deposits are collected in advance from customers and expected to be returned at a future date, a liability for the deposit must be created.  A debit is made to cash, with a credit to the corresponding liability account.  When the deposit is returned, the entry is reversed.  If any part of the deposit is forfeited, the forfeited amount is credited to revenue.  If the deposit was made on, for example, a piece of equipment that was rented and not returned, along with the credit to revenue upon forfeiture, a second entry would be made to account for the decrease in inventory and cost of goods sold. 

Self-Study Question: 
Happy Productions, Inc. rents chairs to the public for parties and special events.  Upon rental, they require a $10 deposit per chair, which is twice of Happy Production’s cost to purchase the chairs.  Deposits are forfeited if the chairs are not returned at the end of the rental period.  A recent customer rented 50 chairs, but only returned 90% of the chairs at the end of the rental period.  What is the amount of revenue that Happy would recognize at the end of the rental agreement?  What would be the amount of Happy’s reduction to inventory?
Answer: 
Revenue-$50
Inventory-$25

===Advances from customers===
Advances are payments from customers before goods are delivered or services rendered, for example magazine subscriptions.  The funds collected in advance will be applied to the purchase price, and are considered liabilities until the earnings process is complete.

==Provisions for warranties==

==Taxes==
:''For expanded treatment, see [[Intermediate Accounting/Accounting for Income Taxes]]''
In many countries, accounting for tax purposes is the same as accounting for financial reporting.  However, the purposes of tax laws often diverge from the purposes of GAAP financial reporting.  For example, a tax law may allow for accelerated depreciation of new capital equipment, which makes firms' new purchases less expensive in real terms.  This is one way to implement a nation's economic policy of promoting new investment and perhaps full employment.  Extremely accelerated depreciation goes against the matching principle in accounting, however.  By the matching principle, the costs of use of the equipment should be matched to the time periods in which the benefits of use are enjoyed.

In the United States, specifically, accounting for income taxes is complicated by differences between GAAP accounting for financial reporting versus tax accounting for U.S. IRS tax forms.  

===Permanent differences===
There are &quot;permanent differences&quot; which are relatively easy to account for.  For example, a firm may invest in a tax-free municipal bond, and its total GAAP earnings would reflect interest income that is deductible from the firm's taxable income reported on its tax returns.  If the firm's GAAP tax expense is computed simplistically as the firm's GAAP earnings times its marginal income rate, that would yield an incorrect, higher value for its tax expense.  The firm's actual income tax rate is lower.

===Temporary differences===
The temporary differences are more complicated to account for.  They give rise to &quot;deferred tax liabilities&quot; and &quot;deferred tax assets&quot;.  These are accounts needed to track the timing differences between recognition of expenses and revenues for GAAP books vs. for tax books, for events that have already occured.  Most firms of any size have multiple&quot; specific differences which need to be tracked.  There are four general types:

1.) &quot;GAAP-first revenues&quot; is a shorthand term (coined here, not a widely used term) which describes cases where firms' GAAP accounting recognizes revenues before those revenues appear in taxable income.  Installment sales is a prime example.  Under GAAP accounting, the revenue associated with a sale of land or property is recorded when a firm contract is reached and the new owner takes possession of the property.  So all the earnings related to a sale of land that will be paid for by installments over several years, may be recognized at the time of sale.  But by U.S. IRS tax accounting, the revenue is not recognized until it is collected.

2.) &quot;Tax return-first revenues&quot; is a shorthand term (coined here) for cases where firms' taxable income shows revenues that are not yet recognized in GAAP accounting.  The IRS counts as taxable income the advance collections of rent and other advance collections.  Under GAAP accounting those collections are recorded first as unearned revenues, which are only recognized as revenues when the service or product are delivered.

3.) &quot;GAAP-first expenses&quot; include estimated expenses, such as bad debt expense which is recognized along with setting up a general allowance for bad debts (a.k.a. an allowance for uncollectible receivables).  Tax accounting does not recognize bad debts until the specific customer accounts are written off.

4.) &quot;Tax return-first expenses&quot; include MACRS accelerated depreciation.


===Categorization as short- vs. long-term liabilities===
On the GAAP balance sheet, balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities conceivably could be reported in four places: under Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Long-term Assets, and Long-term Liabilities.  GAAP allows, however, for short-term DTA to be offset by short-term DTL, and the same for longterm DTA and DTL, so the balance sheet in fact shows just one DTA or DTL in the current section, reported at net, and shows similarly just one net position in the long-term section.

==Pensions==

There are two types of pension plans, the defined contribution plan and the defined benefit plan. 

===defined contribution pension plan===

The defined contribution pension plan promises fixed annual contributions to a pension fund by the employer. The employee chooses where funds are invested. The retirement benefit is determined by the amount accumulated in the pension account upon retirement (Spiceland).

===defined benefit pension plan===

The defined benefit pension plan promises fixed retirement benefits “defined” by a pension formula. The pension is normally based on the employees’ years of service and annual compensation. The employer is responsible for paying promised benefits (Spiceland).

==Contingent liabilities==
Provisions for court decisions

'''To learn about contingent liabilities we will first explore disclosure notes found on recent 10K filings from three well known corporations. We will then learn the Accounting Standards Codification and SFAS references regarding contingent liabilities. Next, we will learn why the corporations recorded their contingencies as they did as it relates to the Accounting Standards Codification. Finally, we will further explore contingent liabilities by working through some various problems. Various references are used from an Intermediate Accounting Textbook (Spiceland, David, James Sepe, Mark Nelson, and Lawrence Tomassini. Intermediate Accounting. Fifth Edition. Volume Two. New York, NY: Mc-Graw-Hill/Irwin, 2009. Pages 665-697. Print.)'''

'''1. Verizon Communications Inc; December 31, 2009; Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies''' 
		“Several state and federal regulatory proceedings may require our telephone operations to pay penalties or to refund to customers a portion of the revenues collected in the current and prior periods. There are also various legal actions pending to which we are a party and claims which, if asserted, may lead to other legal actions. We have established reserves for specific liabilities in connection with regulatory and legal actions, including environmental matters that we currently deem to be probable and estimable. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of pending regulatory and legal matters in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below, will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.”

“During 2003, under a government-approved plan, remediation commenced at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, New York that processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. Remediation beyond original expectations proved to be necessary and a reassessment of the anticipated remediation costs was conducted. A reassessment of costs related to remediation efforts at several other former facilities was also undertaken. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the Hicksville site into the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. This may result in the ACE performing some or all of the remediation effort for the Hicksville site with a corresponding decrease in costs to Verizon. To the extent that the ACE assumes responsibility for remedial work at the Hicksville site, an adjustment to a reserve previously established for the remediation may be made. Adjustments to the reserve may also be made based upon actual conditions discovered during the remediation at this or any other site requiring remediation.”

		The above contingencies are related to litigation claims against Verizon Communications. The first two sentences, “Several state and federal regulatory proceedings may require our telephone operations to pay penalties or to refund to customers a portion of the revenues collected in the current and prior periods,” are related to claims the organizations in this industry find throughout their course of business. The second portion of this contingency relates to various legal actions pending. These items are not accrued because these are either litigation claims or the likelihood is not probable and the amount cannot reasonably be estimated. From chapter 13 (Spiceland, David, James Sepe, Mark Nelson, and Lawrence Tomassini. Intermediate Accounting. Fifth Edition. Volume Two. New York, NY: Mc-Graw-Hill/Irwin, 2009. Pages 665-697. Print.), “A loss contingency is accrued only if a loss is probable and the amount can reasonably be estimated.” Later in chapter 13 we learn, “the majority of medium and large corporations annually report loss contingencies due to litigation. In practice, accrual of a loss from pending or ongoing litigation is rare.” With this in mind, we know that the events stated in the contingency notes form Verizon should not be accrued and listed only as a disclosure note. 

'''2. Dell Inc; January 29, 2010; Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies'''

Legal Matters — Dell is involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including matters involving consumer, antitrust, tax, intellectual property, and other issues on a global basis. While Dell does not expect that the ultimate outcomes in these proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the results and timing of the ultimate resolutions of these various proceedings are inherently unpredictable. Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or collectively, could have a material effect on Dell’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, will depend on a number of variables, including the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses, amounts paid in settlement, damages or other remedies or consequences. Dell accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. Dell reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and Dell’s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in Dell’s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. 
The following is a discussion of Dell’s significant on-going legal matters and other proceedings: Investigations and Related Litigation — In August 2005, the SEC initiated an inquiry into certain of Dell’s accounting and financial reporting matters and requested that Dell provide certain documents. The SEC expanded that inquiry in June 2006 and entered a formal order of investigation in October 2006. In August 2006, because of potential issues identified in the course of responding to the SEC’s requests for information, Dell’s Audit Committee, on the recommendation of management and in consultation with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Dell’s independent registered public accounting firm, initiated an independent investigation, which was completed in the third quarter of Fiscal 2008. Although the Audit Committee investigation has been completed, the SEC investigation is ongoing. Dell continues to cooperate with the SEC investigation. Dell and the SEC staff have had preliminary discussions about a potential settlement of the matter. Thus far, an agreement has not been reached. Dell believes that any resolution would likely include monetary penalties, which cannot be quantified at this time, and other relief within the SEC’s authority. Discussions with the SEC staff are ongoing, and no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, including the terms and conditions of any settlement. Dell and several of its current and former directors and officers were named as parties to the following outstanding securities and shareholder derivative lawsuits all arising out of the same events and facts. 
		
— Four putative securities class actions filed between September 13, 2006, and January 31, 2007, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, against Dell and certain of its current and former officers were consolidated as In re Dell Securities Litigation, and a lead plaintiff was appointed by the court. The lead plaintiff asserted claims under sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on alleged false and misleading disclosures or omissions regarding Dell’s financial statements, governmental investigations, internal controls, known battery problems and business model, and based on insiders’ sales of Dell securities. This action also included Dell’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as a defendant. On October 6, 2008, the court dismissed all of the plaintiff’s claims with prejudice and without leave to amend. On November 3, 2008, the plaintiff appealed the dismissal of Dell and the officer defendants to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was fully briefed, and oral argument on the appeal was heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 1, 2009. On November 20, 2009, the parties to the appeal entered into a written settlement agreement whereby Dell would pay $40 million to the proposed class and the plaintiff would dismiss the pending litigation. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the district court on December 21, 2009. The settlement is subject to certain conditions, including opt-outs from the proposed class not exceeding a specified percentage and final approval by the district court. Until these conditions to the settlement have been satisfied, there can be no assurance that the settlement will become final. If the settlement does not become final, Dell will continue its defense of the appeal before the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, as of January 29, 2010, Dell has not accrued a liability for these class actions. 
 		
—In addition, seven shareholder derivative lawsuits filed between September 29, 2006, and January 22, 2007, in three separate jurisdictions were consolidated as In re Dell Derivative Litigation into three actions. One of those consolidated actions was pending in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, but was dismissed without prejudice by an order filed October 9, 2007. The second consolidated shareholder derivative action was pending in Delaware Chancery Court. On October 16, 2008, the Delaware court granted the parties’ stipulation to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ claims in the Delaware lawsuit without prejudice. The third consolidated shareholder derivative action was pending in state district court in Williamson County, Texas. These shareholder derivative lawsuits named various current and former officers and directors as defendants and Dell as a nominal defendant and asserted various claims derivatively on behalf of Dell under state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties. On September 11, 2009, Dell entered into an agreement to settle the derivative suit pending in state district court in Williamson County, Texas, and the previously reported shareholder demand letter dated November 12, 2008, asserting allegations similar to those made in these lawsuits. The settlement received final approval by the court on December 15, 2009. The settlement required Dell to initiate and maintain certain corporate governance changes and provided for the payment of approximately $1.75 million in fees to the plaintiffs’ counsel. 

Ironically, on July 22, 2010 this information came from Washington, D.C.:(http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-131.htm)
SEC Charges Dell and Senior Executives with Disclosure and Accounting Fraud
Company to Pay $100 Million Penalty, Michael Dell to Pay $4 Million Penalty
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-131
Washington, D.C., July 22, 2010 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Dell Inc. with failing to disclose material information to investors and using fraudulent accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses.

The first paragraph titled, “Legal Matter,” explains the policies Dell employs regarding the various legal matters that it finds throughout the course of their business. As we move further into the disclosure note we find a specific legal matter that Dell is currently involved in. In August of 2005, the SEC initiated a concern regarding some of Dell’s accounting and financial reporting. This matter started an internal investigation between internal Dell auditors and an independent auditing firm. This investigation was completed in 2008. At the time of this disclosure there was still an ongoing SEC investigation and is sitting in the court system pending a final approval for a possible settlement amount to be paid. The second bullet within this case is regarding Dell Derivative Litigation, which was divided into three separate actions. The first two actions were dismissed without prejudice. The third action was settled and approved by the courts. This settlement required Dell to initiate and maintain certain corporate governance changes and pay $1.75 million in fees to the plaintiff’s council. This final action should be accrued because, as Dell put it, “the liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.” 

The initial investigation spurred by the SEC is not accrued because it is not settled and the penalty amount is not known. Also, as discussed in Intermediate Accounting (Spiceland, David, James Sepe, Mark Nelson, and Lawrence Tomassini. Intermediate Accounting. Fifth Edition. Volume Two. New York, NY: Mc-Graw-Hill/Irwin, 2009. Pages 665-697. Print.) textbook, if an amount was to be accrued before the case is settled in court, this accrual “would be welcome ammunition for the opposing legal counsel.” 

'''3. Best Buy Co. Inc. February 27, 2010; 13. Contingencies and Commitments'''
Contingencies 
“In December 2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned, Jasmen Holloway, et al. v. Best Buy Co., Inc., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin with respect to our employment policies and practices. The action seeks an end to discriminatory policies and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. At February 27, 2010, no accrual had been established as it was not possible to estimate the possible loss or range of loss because this matter had not advanced to a stage where we could make any such estimate. A class certification hearing was held in June 2009, and we await the Court's decision. We believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend this action vigorously. 
We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.”
The initial paragraph is explaining a pending class action lawsuit against Best Buy on the basis on employment discrimination. This situation has not been accrued because it is a pending lawsuit; therefore Best Buy cannot determine if it is neither probable nor the amount of money to be paid out. Also, again, pending court matters are not accrued until a court decision has been determined and finalized. 

'''FASB Accounting Standards Codification:'''
	The above examples of contingencies from Verizon, Dell, and Best Buy demonstrate litigation claims. These organizations list the general policies the organization employs to handle these situations and also gives specific information regarding specific cases it is currently dealing with. FASB Accounting Standards Codification provides us with the below guidance when dealing with such contingencies (information below to SFAS No. 5 is from FASB Accounting Standards Codification):

(Code: 450 Contingencies: 20 Loss Contingencies: 25 Recognition) Provides general rules when dealing loss contingencies.
'''General Rule'''
'''25-1'''When a loss contingency exists, the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. As indicated in the definition of contingency, the term loss is used for convenience to include many charges against income that are commonly referred to as expenses and others that are commonly referred to as losses. The Contingencies Topic uses the terms probable, reasonably possible, and remote to identify three areas within that range. 
'''25-2''' An estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met: 
•	a.  Information available before the financial statements are issued or are available to be 
issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25) indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements. Date of the financial statements means the end of the most recent accounting period for which financial statements are being presented. It is implicit in this condition that it must be probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss. 
•	b.  The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
The purpose of those conditions is to require accrual of losses when they are reasonably estimable and relate to the current or a prior period. Paragraphs 450-20-55-1 through 55-17 and Examples 1–2 (see paragraphs 450-20-55-18 through 55-35) illustrate the application of the conditions. As discussed in paragraph 450-20-50-5, disclosure is preferable to accrual when a reasonable estimate of loss cannot be made. Further, even losses that are reasonably estimable shall not be accrued if it is not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of an entity's financial statements because those losses relate to a future period rather than the current or a prior period. Attribution of a loss to events or activities of the current or prior periods is an element of asset impairment or liability incurrence.

(Code: 450 Contingencies: 20 Loss contingencies: 55 Implementation Guidance and Illustrations) Deals specifically with litigation and provides an example with the appropriate footnote. 

'''&gt; &gt;Litigation, Claims, and Assessments'''
'''55-10'''The following factors should be considered in determining whether accrual and/or disclosure is required with respect to pending or threatened litigation and actual or possible claims and assessments: 
•	a.  The period in which the underlying cause (that is, the cause for action) of the pending or threatened litigation or of the actual or possible claim or assessment occurred 
•	b.  The degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome 
•	c.  The ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. 
Examples 1 through 2 (see paragraphs 450-20-55-18 through 55-35) illustrate the consideration of these factors in determining whether to accrue or disclose litigation. 

'''55-18''' An entity may be litigating a dispute with another party. In preparation for the trial, it may determine that, based on recent developments involving one aspect of the litigation, it is probable that it will have to pay $2 million to settle the litigation. Another aspect of the litigation may, however, be open to considerable interpretation, and depending on the interpretation by the court the entity may have to pay an additional $8 million over and above the $2 million. 
'''55-19''' In that case, paragraph 450-20-25-2 requires accrual of the $2 million if that is considered a reasonable estimate of the loss. 
'''55-20''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the accrual,and depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the $2 million that was accrued. 
'''55-21''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the additional exposure to loss if there is a reasonable possibility that the additional amounts will be paid. 

'''&gt; &gt; Example 2: Multiple Case Litigation Example'''
'''55-22''' The following Cases illustrate application of the accrual and disclosure requirements in the following stages of litigation: a.  The trial is complete but the damages are undetermined (Case A). 
	    b.  The trial is incomplete but an unfavorable outcome is probable (Case B). 
	    c.  The trial is incomplete and unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible (Case C). 
	    d.  There is a range of loss and one amount is a better estimate than any other (Case D). 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt; Case A: Trial Is Complete but Damages Are Undetermined''' 
'''55-23''' An entity is involved in litigation at the close of its fiscal year and information available indicates that an unfavorable outcome is probable. Subsequently, after a trial on the issues, a verdict unfavorable to the entity is handed down, but the amount of damages remains unresolved at the time the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25). Although the entity is unable to estimate the exact amount of loss, its reasonable estimate at the time is that the judgment will be for not less than $3 million or more than $9 million. No amount in that range appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount. 
'''55-24''' In this Case, paragraph 450-20-30-1 requires accrual of the $3 million (the minimum of the range) at the close of the fiscal year. 
'''55-25''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and, depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the amount of the accrual. 
'''55-26''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the exposure to an additional amount of loss of up to $6 million. 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt;Case B: Trial Is Incomplete but Unfavorable Outcome Is Probable'''
'''55-27''' Assume the same facts as in Case A, except it is probable that a verdict will be unfavorable and the trial has not been completed before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25). In that situation, the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) would be met because information available to the entity indicates that an unfavorable verdict is probable. An assessment that the range of loss is between $3 million and $9 million would meet the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(b). 
'''55-28''' In this Case, if no single amount in that range is a better estimate than any other amount, paragraph 450-20-30-1 requires accrual of $3 million (the minimum of the range) at the close of the fiscal year. 
'''55-29''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and, depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the amount of the accrual. 
'''55-30''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the exposure to an additional amount of loss of up to $6 million. 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt;Case C: Trial Is Incomplete and Unfavorable Outcome Is Reasonably Possible'''
'''55-31''' Assume the same facts as in Case B, except the entity had assessed the verdict differently (for example, that an unfavorable verdict was not probable but was only reasonably possible). The condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) would not have been met and no amount of loss would be accrued. Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and any amount of loss that is reasonably possible. 

'''&gt; &gt; &gt;Case D: Range of Loss and One Amount Is a Better Estimate than Any Other'''
'''55-32''' Assume that in Case A and Case B the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) has been met and a reasonable estimate of loss is a range between $3 million and $9 million but a loss of $4 million is a better estimate than any other amount in that range. 
'''55-33''' In this Case, paragraph 450-20-30-1 requires accrual of $4 million. 
'''55-34''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-1 through 50-2 require disclosure of the nature of the contingency and, depending on the circumstances, may require disclosure of the amount of the accrual. 
'''55-35''' Paragraphs 450-20-50-3 through 50-8 require disclosure of the exposure to an additional amount of loss of up to $5 million. 

'''&gt; &gt;Example 3: Illustrative Disclosure'''
'''55-36''' Entity A is the defendant in litigation involving a major competitor claiming patent infringement (Entity B). The suit claims damages of $200 million. Discovery has been completed, and Entity A is engaged in settlement discussions with the plaintiff. Entity A has made an offer of $5 million to settle the case, which offer was rejected by the plaintiff; the plaintiff has made an offer of $35 million to settle the case, which offer was rejected by Entity A. Based on the expressed willingness of the plaintiff to settle the case along with information revealed during discovery and the likely cost and risk to both sides of litigating, Entity A believes that it is probable the case will not come to trial. Accordingly, Entity A has determined that it is probable that it has some liability. Entity A's reasonable estimate of this liability is a range between $10 million and $35 million, with no amount within that range a better estimate than any other amount; accordingly, $10 million was accrued. 
'''55-37''' Entity A provides the following disclosure in accordance with Section 450-20-50. 
•On March 15, 19X1, Entity B filed a suit against the company claiming patent infringement. While the company believes it has meritorious defenses against the suit, the ultimate resolution of the matter, which is expected to occur within one year, could result in a loss of up to $25 million in excess of the amount accrued. 

'''SFAS No. 5''' (Found in the text on page 672)
“If the failure to disclose the possible loss would cause the financial statements to be misleading, the situation should be described in a disclosure note, including the effect of the possible loss on key accounting numbers affected.” (“‘Accounting for Contingencies’, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (Stamford, Conn.: FASB, 1975), par. 11.
~As stated by SFAS No. 5, disclosure notes allow an organization to communicate a possible change or future affect in relation to past situation where the outcome is still pending. This allows investors and/or creditors to be aware of what the internal organization is aware without accruing the possible outcome. 

'''Relating Accounting Standards Codification to our three corporate examples:'''
'''Verizon Communications Inc.''' The Hicksville matter seems to align with “Case A” (450:20:55:23) which reads: Case A: Trial Is Complete but Damages Are Undetermined
'''55-23''' An entity is involved in litigation at the close of its fiscal year and information available indicates that an unfavorable outcome is probable. Subsequently, after a trial on the issues, a verdict unfavorable to the entity is handed down, but the amount of damages remains unresolved at the time the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25). Although the entity is unable to estimate the exact amount of loss, its reasonable estimate at the time is that the judgment will be for not less than $3 million or more than $9 million. No amount in that range appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount. 
I decided this situation is most like Case A because of the following information that was provided in the disclosure note: “To the extent that the ACE assumes responsibility for remedial work at the Hicksville site, an adjustment to a reserve previously established for the remediation may be made. Adjustments to the reserve may also be made based upon actual conditions discovered during the remediation at this or any other site requiring remediation.” This statement implies that the decision has been made that Verizon is liable for the damages; however, the amount of total damages will be decided as cleanup continues. Assuming this is the case Verizon Communications recorded this incident correctly and no accrual is needed. 

'''Dell Inc.'''
	Dell’s situation is similar to Verizon’s in that nothing has been settled. The court has not made a decision on this matter; however, we do have a settlement amount that has not been finalized. I was thinking this could be Case A because there is an amount discussed. However, Case A implies that the case is settled but there is not a set amount to be paid. With this in mind Dell falls into Case B as an unfavorable outcome is probable, a disclosure note is needed because the amount cannot be determined at the time of the financial statements. If we are considering the 2010 financial statements an accrual would be required because the case is finalized with a bill of $100 million to Dell. 
	
'''Best Buy Co. Inc'''. 
	The discrimination in employment suit is going to be a Case C because we cannot determine much of anything at this point regarding the probability or the amount. However, this is a pending case so we need a disclosure note as Best Buy has done. 

'''Questions:'''

1. Referring to the Dell case and more particularly the recent news from July 22, 2010, what would change on the 2010 financial statements? (Provide needed journal entries and/or disclosure notes).

2. Read the disclosure note below. This contingency seems probable and the amount seems to have a reasonable estimate, why does Dell not accrue the contingency? “On November 20, 2009, the parties to the appeal entered into a written settlement agreement whereby Dell would pay $40 million to the proposed class and the plaintiff would dismiss the pending litigation. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the district court on December 21, 2009, (Dell financial statements 2009)”

3. For the following example record the required journal entry and/or disclosure not. Explain your reasoning by citing the Accounting Standards Codification above.

During the fiscal year 2009, XYZ Corporation is facing a class action lawsuit because a trinket they designed, manufactured, and sold malfunctioned and caused bodily harm to customers. Towards the end of the fiscal year the court handed down an unfavorable verdict against XYZ Corporation. The total amount of the damages has not been resolved at the time of the financial statement issuance. XYZ Corporation, though does not have an exact amount, reasonably estimates damages to be between 10 and 15 million dollars. 

4. Working off the same situation for XYZ Corporation as in question 3. Before the financial statements are released we have an update for the total damages. The corporation has found that $12 million is the best estimate of total damages (though not known for sure). How does this change our journal entry and/or disclosure note?

5. In an unsettled court case why would you not accrue an anticipated loss even if it is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated?

6. ABC Corp is charged with a pending lawsuit. The amount nor the probability of damages is known. How should ABC Corp disclose this information to investors and creditors?

7. Why, if an expense has not accrued, is it important to tell investors or creditors about future obligations that might occur?

'''Answers'''

1. Loss-litigation(Debt).........................$100 Million Liability-litigation(Credit)...............................$100 Million
A disclosure note is also appropriate explaining the cause of the loss, ongoing litigation, and the recent court decision.

2. Dell would not accrue this contingency because it is still not finalized. As we realized in 2010, this $40 Million turned into $100 Million.

3.Loss Contingency-Litigation(Debt)..................$10 Million Liability(Credit)............................................$10 Million
Reference Case A (55-23) above as it states that a case where the trial is complete but damages are undetermined we would record an accrual for $10 million, the minimum in the range.

4. Loss Contingency-Litigation.............$12 Million Liability-Litigation.................................$12 Million
In questions 3 and 4, refer to Case A (55-23) where additional disclosure would be required for the potential range of the loss. 

5. In an unsettled court case we would not accrue an anticipated loss because, as stated earlier, the fact that the corporation accrued this amount can be used as evidence for the other side in the court room. When it comes to a jury decision, a corporation already anticipating a loss makes it easier for the jury to issue damages to the corporation. 

6. On July 3rd, 2008 ABC Corp was served with a lawsuit regarding the waste they left on a previous site. On February 27, 2009 no accrual has been established because it is not possible to estimate the possiblity of loss nor the amount of loss. This lawsuit is not at a point where we could make an estimate. (This case is very similar to the Best Buy case above). 

7. It is important to provide full-disclosure in all financial reporting, as explained in SFAS No. 5. SFAS No. 5 explains, &quot;“If the failure to disclose the possible loss would cause the financial statements to be misleading, the situation should be described in a disclosure note, including the effect of the possible loss on key accounting numbers affected.”

==Leases==
'''Leases'''
A lease is a contractual arrangement by which a ''lessor/owner'' provides a ''lessee/user'' the right to use an asset for a specified period of time. In return, the lessee agrees to make periodic cash payments during the term of the lease. An apartment lease is a typical rental agreement referred to as an ''operating lease'' in which the fundamental rights and responsibilities of ownership are retained by the lessor. ''Capital leases''(Direct financing or sales-type leases to the lessor) are contracts that are formulated outwardly as leases, but in reality are installment purchases/sales.
Typically,
&lt;u&gt;Lessee&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Capital 
&lt;u&gt;Lessor&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Direct Financing Lease
or Sales-type lease
Leasing sometimes is used as a means of off-balance-sheet financing. Operational, tax, and financial market incentives often make leasing an attractive alternative to purchasing.

&lt;big&gt;Lease Classification&lt;/big&gt;
'''Capital Leases''': A lessee should classify a lease transaction as a capital lease if it includes a noncancelable lease term and one or more of the four criteria listed are met. Otherwise, it is an operating lease.
1. The agreement specifies that ownership of the asset transfers to the lessee.
2. The agreement contains a bargain purchase option.
3. The noncancelable lease term is equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset.
4. The present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset.

A '''Bargain purchase option (BPO)''' is a provision in the lease contract that gives the lessee the option of purchasing the leased property at a bargain price. This is defined as a price sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property that the exercise of the option appears reasonably assured at the inception of the lease.

'''Expected economic life''': If an asset is leased for most of its useful life, then most of the benefits and responsibilities of ownership are transferred to the lessee. 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset is threshold point for this purpose.

'''Bargain renewal options''' gives the lessee the option to renew the lease at a bargain rate. That is, the rental payment is sufficiently lower than the expected fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable that exercise of the option appears reasonably assured.  

'''Minimum lease payments''': If the lease payments required by a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease equivalent to an installment purchase. It is considered to exist when the present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease.
&lt;big&gt;Additional Lessor Conditions&lt;/big&gt;
1. The collectibility of the lease payments must be reasonably predictable.
2. If any costs to the lessor have yet to be incurred, they are reasonably predictable. (Performance by the lessor is substantially complete.)

'''Operating Lease'''
If a lease does not met any of the criteria for a capital lease it is considered to be more in the nature of a rental agreement and is referred to as an ''operating lease''. In an operating lease, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis unless another systematic method more clearly reflects the benefits of the asset's use. So, if rental payments are uneven-for instance, if rent increases are scheduled-the total scheduled payments ordinarily would be expensed equally over the lease term.
&lt;u&gt;Advance Payments&lt;/u&gt;
Often lease agreements call for advance payments to be made at the inception of the lease that represent prepaid rent. For instance, it is common for a lessee to pay a bonus in return for negotiating more favorable lease terms. Such payments are recorded as prepaid rent and allocated( normally on a straight-line basis ) to rent expense/rent revenue over the lease term. Sometimes advance payments include security deposits that are refundable at the expiration of the lease or prepayments of the last period's rent. Rent payments may be scheduled to increase periodically over the lease term. The total rent over the term of the lease is allocated to individual periods on a straight-line basis. As a result, the temporarily unpaid portion of rent expense must be credited to deferred rent expense payable until later in the lease term when rent payments exceed rent expense.

On January 1, 2010, Doogin Wagon, Inc., a computer services firm, leased a printer from ElernZac Corporation. The lease agreement specifies four annual payments of $100,000 beginning January 1, 2010, the inception of the lease, and at each January 1 thereafter through 2013. The useful life of the printer is estimated to be eight years. Before deciding to lease, Doogin Wagon considered purchasing the printer for its cash price of $625,000. If funds were borrowed to buy the copier, the interest rate would have been 10%.
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
5. How should this lease be classified?

'''ANSWER''':
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
''NO''

2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
''NO''

3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
''4 years &lt; 75% of 8 years''
''4 years &lt; 6 years''
''NO''

4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
''$100,000 x 3.48685 (Table 6, n=4, i=10%)= $348,685''
''$348,685 &lt; 90% of $625,000''=''$348,685 &lt; $562,500''

5. How should this lease be classified?
''Since none of the four classification criteria is met, this is an operating lease.''

==Stock options and other share-based compensation==
===Stock options===
Current U.S. GAAP accounting allows and requires that the award of stock options be expensed over the period of employee vesting, and that the total amount to be expensed must equal a valid estimate, upfront, of the value given away.  Using various model-based approaches to estimating the value, as of award date, is acceptable.
  
===Cliff vesting===
Often stock options are issued using graded vesting, also known as &quot;cliff vesting&quot;.  When multiple tranches are issued at the same time, i.e. a stock option package is issued in which an employee vests portions at a time, various accounting approaches for averaging are allowed by U.S. GAAP.  Simplest, conceptually, is to treat each tranche as a separate stock option.  More complicated, in a way, is to value the entire package of stock options at a per-option value based on a weighted average of option lives, and then to straightline that.  This usually yields a higher option value (and higher total compensation cost to be recognized), than the average of the individual options.  But it also can significantly slow the recognition.

For example, p.1078 Spiceland v.6 example, involving package of options that vest 20%, 30%, 50% in three successive years.

However, straight-line approach is not allowed if the amount expensed lags behind the amount vested.  Obviously the accounting should recognize cumulative expense at least as high as cumulative amount vested.  If vesting pattern was front-loaded, i.e. vest 50%, 30%, 20%, then the straightline expensing would not be adequate to stay up with vesting pattern.

Open question:  Would U.S. GAAP accounting allow for applying the vested amounts, when the cumulative vested would be higher than cumulative expense under straight-line method?  (To be examined by considering ASC).</text>

The lyrics to &quot;Danny Boy&quot; were written by the English lawyer and lyricist [[w:Frederick Weatherly|Frederick Weatherly]] in 1910. Although the lyrics were originally written for a different tune, Weatherly modified them to fit &quot;[[w:Londonderry Air|Londonderry Air]]&quot; in 1913 when his sister-in-law in America sent him a copy.

Da ''Danny Boy'' i.d.R. sehr langsam vorgetragen wird, besteht relativ viel Spielraum zum Arrangieren der Begleitakkorde. Hier werden nur die wesentlichen verwendet, die natürlich sehr effektvoll durch melodieangepasste Zwischenakkorde ergänzt werden können.

=Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack=
White's 6. g4 begins the Keres Attack, a sharp and important line in the Scheveningen Variation. 

Black's previous move, 5...e6, boxes in his light squared bishop and relinquishes control over the g4 square. Now, White advances his g pawn with the idea of following with 7. g5, pushing black's f knight back and winning more space on the kingside. Note that against the Sicilian, White often opens up a kingside pawn storm, such as in the English Attack, and 6. g4 furthers that goal well.

Black's most common response, therefore, is 6...h6, preventing the g pawn from advancing. Other responses, such as 6...Nc6, do not discourage the g pawn push, and are therefore usually followed by 7. g5 Nd7. Now black's kingside knight has been pushed back into a much more passive position and white's pawns are dangerously close to black's kingside, if black chooses to castle there. After 6...h6 Black should certainly not proceed to castle kingside quickly against this line. 

Attempting to counterattack with 6...e5 is easily met by 7.Bb5+ Bd7 8.Bxd7+ Qxd7 9.Nb3. White has traded off light squared bishops, and is preparing to set up the standard English Attack. Note that this is one reason that many Scheveningen players use a [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...a6/6._Be3/6...e6|Najdorf move order first]] and transpose to the Scheveningen. In this case, the presence of the a6 pawn discourages Bb5+, and lines here in which white plays g4 are referred to as the Perenyi Attack rather than the Keres Attack.

=Introduction=

It is evident that the framework of information laid out by Advanced Structural Analysis is complex and vast.  Therefore, the clarity of the book's structure is vital to its writers and readers.  Some fundamental guidelines are outlined in the [[/Strategy/]] section whereas the precise architecture is illustrated in the [[/Map/]] section.

      <text xml:space="preserve"># [[#High Level|High Level]]
# [[#Low Level|Low Level]]

=High Level=

Advanced Structural Analysis contains two main sections: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Advanced_Structural_Analysis/Part_I_-_Theory Part I - Theory] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Advanced_Structural_Analysis/Part_II_-_Application Part II - Application].  The idea is that Part I - Theory provides the foundation for the analysis described in Part II - Application.  Ideally, all the reasoning described in Part II - Application should stem from and refer to statements in Part I - Theory.

Furthermore, the global structure should, if possible, comply with the following concepts:

* &quot;All-encompassing&quot; - all matters related to structural analysis should be covered as thoroughly as possible 
* Non-repetitive - a non-redundant layout where efforts are focused and not repeated 
* Stringent - the topics should be organized in a logical sequence where the foundation for each section is established previous sections
* Categorized - natural groupings of content
* Transparent - the branch-like architecture should be intuitively understood and easy to browse
* Concise - a minimal amount of excessive material
* Maintainable - an untangled structure where things can be added without major structural changes

=Low Level=

==Part I - Theory==

Specific principles, key-points and recommendations should be highlighted like the following example:

 &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac {F}{A} &lt;/math&gt;

==Part II - Application==

=Scheveningen Variation, Keres Attack=
White's 6. g4 begins the Keres Attack, a sharp and important line in the Scheveningen Variation. Black's 6...h6 is the standard continuation, preventing an advance to g5 which would force the f6 knight to retreat.

Now White has a number of options. These include advancing anyway with [[/7. g5|g5]] and exchanging pawns or continuing the pawn storm with [[/7. h4|h4]], [[/7. h3|h3]] or [[/7. f3|f3]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Old VarFun section on where ==

So far we have seen two sorts of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in the examples: a variable, which stores some value of our choice, and a parameter of a function (say, &lt;code&gt;area r&lt;/code&gt;). But what would happen if we use both at the same time? Say I type something in like this (don't type it in yet):

 Prelude&gt; let r = 0
 Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r ^ 2
 Prelude&gt; area 5

What do you think that should happen here? Will &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; work as expected or are we in for an unpleasant surprise? Think about an answer, then test it, see if it was what you expected and then follow on with the text...


(...)


 
=== Scope and parameters ===

:'''Warning: this section contains spoilers to the previous &quot;exercise&quot;'''

Fortunately, the following fragment of code does not contain any unpleasant surprises:

 Prelude&gt; let r = 0
 Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r ^ 2
 Prelude&gt; area 5
 78.53981633974483

An unpleasant surprise here would have been getting the value 0 because of the &lt;code&gt;let r = 0&lt;/code&gt; definition getting in the way. That does not happen because when you defined r the second time is that you are talking about a ''different'' r. This is something that happens in real life as well. How many people do you know that have the name John? What's interesting about people named John is that most of the time, you can talk about &quot;John&quot; to your friends, and depending on the context, your friends will know which John you are referring to. Programming has something similar to context, called '''[[Wikipedia:Scope (programming)|scope]]'''. We won't explain the technicalities behind scope (at least not now), but Haskell's lexical scope is the magic that lets us define two different r and always get the right one back depending on context.

Thanks to scope, the value of a parameter is strictly what you pass in when you call the function. Informally, we could say the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;let r = 0&lt;/code&gt; is not the same &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; as the one inside our defined function &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; - the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; overrides the other &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;; you can think of it as Haskell picking the most specific version of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; there is. If you have many friends all named John, you go with the one which just makes more sense and is specific to the context; similarly, what value of r we get depends on the scope.

=== where clauses ===

''Readers: don't worry about this missing section. As of now where clauses are explained [[Haskell/More on functions|later on]], and there is no need to rush over there to check them. This is just a placeholder for when they are moved to this section in the near future.


== Old VarFun/Type basics introduction to types ==
&lt;!-- This example is plain broken. I eagerly await for when we find ourselves in a position to replace it --&gt;
Let us have another look at the circumference examples in [[Haskell/Variables and functions|Variables and functions]]. While playing around with the expressions you might be tempted to try storing a plain value such as &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; and using it in other expressions. Let's see what happens:

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let r = 25
Prelude&gt; 2 * pi * r

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:9:
    Couldn't match `Double' against `Integer'
      Expected type: Double
      Inferred type: Integer
    In the second argument of `(*)', namely `r'
    In the definition of `it': it = 2 * pi * r
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whoops! You've just run into a programming concept known as '''types'''. Types are a feature of many programming languages which are designed to catch some of your programming errors early on so that you find out about them before it's too late. One simple analogy for us to start with are plugs and connectors. For example, many of the plugs on the back of your computer are designed to have different shapes and sizes for a purpose. This is partly so that you don't inadvertently plug the wrong bits of your computer together and blow something up. Types serve a similar purpose, but in this particular example, well, types aren't so helpful.

The tricky bit here is that numbers like &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; can be interpreted as being &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; is one of several types for representing real numbers). For lack of other information, Haskell has &quot;guessed&quot; that its type must be &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; (which cannot be multiplied with a &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;).  To work around this, we simply insist that it is to be treated as a &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let r = 25 :: Double
Prelude&gt; 2 * pi * r
157.07963267948966
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that Haskell only has this &quot;guessing&quot; behaviour in contexts where it does not have enough information to infer the type of something.  As we will see below, most of the time, the surrounding context gives us all of the information that is needed to determine, say, if a number is to be treated as an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; or not.

{{body note|1=
There is actually a little bit more subtlety behind this problem.  It involves a language feature known as the  '''monomorphism restriction'''.  You don't actually need to know about this for now, so you can skip over this note if you just want to keep a brisk pace.  Instead of specifying the type &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;, you also could have given it a '''polymorphic''' type, like &lt;code&gt;Num a =&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, which means &quot;any type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; which belongs in the class &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.   The corresponding code looks like this and works just as seamlessly as before:
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let r :: Num a =&gt; a ; r = 25
Prelude&gt; 2 * pi * r
157.07963267948966&lt;/pre&gt;

Haskell could &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; assign such polymorphic types systematically, instead of defaulting to some potentially incorrect guess, like Integer. But in the real world, this could lead to values being needlessly duplicated or recomputed.  To avoid this potential trap, the designers of the Haskell language opted for a more prudent &quot;monomorphism restriction&quot;.  It means that values may only have a polymorphic type if it can be inferred from the context, or if you explicitly give it one. Otherwise, the compiler is forced to choose a default monomorphic (i.e. non-polymorphic) type. This feature is somewhat controversial. It can even be disabled with the GHC flag (-fno-monomorphism-restriction), but it comes with some risk for inefficiency. Besides, in most cases, it is just as easy to specify the type explicitly.
}}

== Reworked sections of Type basics ==

=== Boolean values ===
One of the other types found in most languages is called a Boolean, or Bool for short. This has two values: true and false. This turns out to be very useful. For example, consider a program that would ask the user for a name then look that name up in a spreadsheet. It might be useful to have a function, &lt;code&gt;nameExists&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates whether or not the name of the user exists in the spreadsheet. If it ''does exist'', you could say that it is ''true'' that the name exists, and if not, you could say that it is ''false'' that the name exists. So we've come across Bools. The two ''values'' of bools are, as we've mentioned, true and false. In Haskell, boolean values are capitalized (for reasons that will later become clear):

{{HaskellExample|Exploring the types of True and False in GHCi|
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t True
True :: Bool
Prelude&gt; :t False
False :: Bool
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

This shouldn't need too much explaining at this point. The values True and False are categorized as Booleans, that is to say, they have type Bool.

=== Numeric types ===
If you've been playing around with typing :t on all the familiar values you've come across, perhaps you've run into the following complication:

 Prelude&gt; :t 5
 5 :: (Num t) =&gt; t

We'll defer the full explanation of this until later. The short version of the story is that there are many different types of numbers (fractions, whole numbers, etc) and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; can be any one of them. This weird-looking type relates to a Haskell feature called [[../Class_Declarations/|type classes]], which we will be playing with later in this book.

== Type signatures in code ==

''As of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell/Type_basics&amp;oldid=1827970 this revision of Type Basics].''

''Readers: As of now there are a few forward references in this section. We are in the process of sorting out some module sequencing issues, which means that problem will be solved soon. In the meantime, you might prefer to go through the next module, &quot;Lists and tuples&quot; and then return here to finish this one.''

Now we've explored the basic theory behind types as well as how they apply to Haskell, let's look at how they appear in actual code. The first thing to point out is that it is a good practice to ''annotate'' every function with its associated type. For an applied example, let us have a look at a very small ''module'' (modules in Haskell are just a neat way of making a library by packing functions for usage in other programs. No need to worry with details now).

{{HaskellExample|Module without type signatures| 
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module StringManip where

import Data.Char

uppercase = map toUpper
lowercase = map toLower
capitalise x = 
  let capWord []     = []
      capWord (x:xs) = toUpper x : xs
  in unwords (map capWord (words x))
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

This tiny library provides two handy string manipulation functions. &lt;code&gt;uppercase&lt;/code&gt; converts a string to uppercase, &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; to lowercase, and &lt;code&gt;capitalize&lt;/code&gt; capitalizes the first letter of every word. Each of these functions takes a String as argument and evaluates to another String. For now, don't worry with how the code actually works, as it is obviously full of features we haven't discussed yet. Anyway - and specially because we don't understand the implementation yet - stating the type for these functions explicitly would make their roles more obvious. For example, most Haskellers would write the above module something like the following:

{{HaskellExample|Module with type signatures| 
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module StringManip where

import Data.Char

uppercase, lowercase :: String -&gt; String
uppercase = map toUpper
lowercase = map toLower

capitalise :: String -&gt; String
capitalise x = 
  let capWord []     = []
      capWord (x:xs) = toUpper x : xs
  in unwords (map capWord (words x))
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The added signatures inform the type of the functions to both the interpreter/compiler and the human readers. Note that you can group type signatures together into a single type signature (like ours for &lt;code&gt;uppercase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; above) if the two functions share the same type.

=== Type inference ===
We just said that type signatures tell the interpreter (or compiler) what the function type is. However, in the modules before this one you wrote perfectly good Haskell code without any signatures, and it has been accepted by GHC/GHCi. That means it's not strictly necessary to add type signatures. But that doesn't mean that if you don't add type signatures Haskell simply forgets about typing altogether! Indeed, when you didn't tell Haskell the types of your functions and variables, it ''figured them out''. This is a process called ''type inference'', in which the compiler starts with the types of things it knows, then works out the types of the rest of the things. Type inference for Haskell is ''decidable'', which means that the compiler can ''always'' work out the types, even if you never write them in &lt;ref&gt;Some of the newer type system extensions to GHC ''do'' break this, however, so you're better off just always putting down types anyway.&lt;/ref&gt;. Let's look at some examples to see how the compiler works out types.

{{HaskellExample|Simple type inference| 
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- We're deliberately not providing a type signature for this function
isL c = c == 'l'
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

This function takes a character and sees if it is an &lt;code&gt;'l'&lt;/code&gt; character. The compiler ''derives'' the type for &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; through a process like the following:

{{HaskellExample|A typing derivation|
&lt;pre&gt;
(==)  :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
'l'   :: Char
Replacing the second ''a'' in the signature for (==) with the type of 'l':
(==)  :: Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool
isL   :: Char -&gt; Bool
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

The first line indicates that the type of the function &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, which tests for equality, is &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; (you can think of the &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; as a placeholder which stands for any type - &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; will accept any two arguments as long as they are of the same type. That is called a ''polymorphic function'') &lt;!-- This needs to be reworked when the introduction to polymorphism is finished --&gt; &lt;ref&gt;This is a slight lie. That type signature would mean that you can compare two values of any type whatsoever, but this clearly isn't true: how can you see if two functions are equal? Haskell includes a kind of 'restricted polymorphism' that allows type variables to range over some, but not all types. Haskell implements this using ''type classes'', which we'll learn about later. In this case, the correct type of &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The compiler also knows that something in single quotes has type Char, so clearly the literal &lt;code&gt;'l'&lt;/code&gt; has type Char. Next, the compiler starts replacing the type variables in the signature for &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; with the types it knows. Note that in one step, we went from &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, because the type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was used in both the first and second argument, so they need to be the same. And so we arrive at a function that takes a single argument (whose type we don't know yet, but hold on!) and applies it as the first argument to &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;. We have a particular ''instance'' of the polymorphic type of &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, that is, here, we're talking about &lt;code&gt;(==) :: Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; because we know that we're comparing Chars. Therefore, as &lt;code&gt;(==) :: Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; and we're feeding the parameter into the first argument to &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, we know that the parameter has the type of Char. Phew!

But wait, we're not finished yet... What's the return type of the function? Thankfully, this bit is a bit easier. We've fed two Chars into a function which (in this case) has type &lt;code&gt;Char -&gt; Char -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, so we must have a Bool. Note that the return value from the call to &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; becomes the return value of our &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; function.

So, let's put it all together. &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes a single argument. We discovered that this argument must be of type Char. Finally, we derived that we return a Bool. So, we can confidently say that &lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; has the type:

{{HaskellExample|&lt;code&gt;isL&lt;/code&gt; with a type|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
isL :: Char -&gt; Bool
isL c = c == 'l'
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

And, indeed, if you miss out the type signature, the Haskell compiler will discover this on its own, using exactly the same method we've just run through.

So if type signatures are optional, why bother with them at all? Here are a few reasons:

* '''Documentation''': the most prominent reason is that it makes your code easier to read. With most functions, the name of the function along with the type of the function is sufficient to guess at what the function does. Of course, you should always comment your code properly too, but having the types clearly stated helps a lot anyway.&lt;!-- add a discreet note on Haddock later --&gt;
* '''Debugging''': if you annotate a function with a type, then make a typo in the body of the function, the compiler will tell you ''at compile-time'' that your function is wrong. Leaving off the type signature could have the effect of allowing your function to compile, and the compiler would assign it an erroneous type. You wouldn't know until you ran your program that it was wrong. In fact, since this is such a crucial point we will explore it some more.

=== Types prevent errors ===
Imagine you have a few functions set up like the following:

&lt;!-- I think now I see why to add basic pattern matching in Truth values, and stand corrected --&gt;
{{HaskellExample|Type inference at work|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fiveOrSix :: Bool -&gt; Int
fiveOrSix True  = 5
fiveOrSix False = 6

pairToInt :: (Bool, String) -&gt; Int
pairToInt x = fiveOrSix (fst x)
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Our function &lt;code&gt;fiveOrSix&lt;/code&gt; takes a Bool. When &lt;code&gt;pairToInt&lt;/code&gt; receives its arguments, it knows, because of the type signature we've annotated it with, that the first element of the pair is a Bool. So, we could extract this using &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; and pass that into &lt;code&gt;fiveOrSix&lt;/code&gt;, and this would work, because the type of the first element of the pair and the type of the argument to &lt;code&gt;fiveOrSix&lt;/code&gt; are the same.

This is really central to typed languages. When passing expressions around you have to make sure the types match up like they did here. If they don't, you'll get ''type errors'' when you try to compile; your program won't ''typecheck''. This is really how types help you to keep your programs bug-free. To take a very trivial example:

{{HaskellExample|A non-typechecking program|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot; + &quot; world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Having that line as part of your program will make it fail to compile, because you can't add two strings together! In all likelihood the intention was to use the similar-looking string concatenation operator, which joins two strings together into a single one:

{{HaskellExample|Our erroneous program, fixed|
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot; ++ &quot; world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

An easy typo to make, but because you use Haskell, it was caught when you tried to compile. You didn't have to wait until you ran the program for the bug to become apparent.

This was only a simple example. However, the idea of types being a system to catch mistakes works on a much larger scale too. In general, when you make a change to your program, you'll change the type of one of the elements. If this change isn't something that you intended, or has unforeseen consequences, then it will show up immediately. A lot of Haskell programmers remark that once they have fixed all the type errors in their programs, and their programs compile, that they tend to &quot;just work&quot;: run flawlessly at the first time, with only minor problems. ''Run-time errors'', where your program goes wrong when you run it rather than when you compile it, are much rarer in Haskell than in other languages. This is a huge advantage of having a strong type system like Haskell does.

{{Exercises|
Infer the types of following functions:

# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;f x y = uppercase (x ++ y)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;g (x,y) = fiveOrSix (isL x) - ord y&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;h x y = pairToInt (fst x,y) + snd x + length y&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sheaf theory ==

We say &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''pre-sheaf'' on a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if
* (i) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group for every open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt;
* (ii) For each inclusion &lt;math&gt;U \hookrightarrow V&lt;/math&gt;, we have the group morphism &lt;math&gt;\rho_{V, U}: \mathcal{F}(V) \to \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that
*:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{U,U}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{W,U} = \rho_{V,U} \circ \rho_{W,V}&lt;/math&gt; for any inclusion &lt;math&gt;U \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;

A pre-sheaf is called a ''sheaf'' if the following &quot;gluing axiom&quot; holds:
:For each open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and its open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f_j \in \mathcal F(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; are such that &lt;math&gt;f_j = f_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_j \cap U_k&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a ''unique'' &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal F(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = f_j&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the uniqueness implies that if &lt;math&gt;f, g \in \mathcal F(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = g|_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f = g&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''4 Example''': Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a topological group (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all continuous maps from open subsets &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; forms a sheaf. In particular, suppose the topology for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is discrete. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''constant sheaf''.

Given sheaves &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt;, a ''sheaf morphism'' &lt;math&gt;\phi: \mathcal F \to \mathcal G&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of group morphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi_U: \mathcal F(U) \to \mathcal G(U)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying: for every open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset V&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_U \circ \rho_{V, U} = \rho_{V, U} \circ \phi_V&lt;/math&gt;
where the first &lt;math&gt;\rho_{V, U}&lt;/math&gt; is one that comes with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; and the second &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G&lt;/math&gt;.

Define &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{ker}\phi)(U) = \operatorname{ker}\phi_U&lt;/math&gt; for each open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}\phi&lt;/math&gt; is then a sheaf. In fact, suppose &lt;math&gt;f_j \in \operatorname{ker}\phi_{U_j} &lt;/math&gt;. Then there is &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal F(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} = f_j&lt;/math&gt;. But since
:&lt;math&gt;(\phi_U f)|_{U_j} = \phi_{U_j} (f|_{U_j}) = \phi_{U_j} f_j = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\phi_U f = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}\phi&lt;/math&gt; does not turn out to be a sheaf if it is defined in the same way. We thus define &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{im}\phi)(U)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of all &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal G(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that there is an open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt; is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a sheaf. In fact, as before, let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal G(U)&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;f|_{U_j} \in \operatorname{im}\phi_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have an open cover of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; restricted to each member &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of the cover is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi_V&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^0, \mathcal{F}^1, \mathcal{F}^2&lt;/math&gt; be sheaves on the same topological space.

A sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''flabby'' if &lt;math&gt;\rho_{X, U}:\mathcal{F}(X) \to \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_p = \lim_{U \ni p} \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and, for each &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}f = \{ x \in U | f|_p \ne 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}f&lt;/math&gt; is closed since &lt;math&gt;f|_p = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f|_q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;q \in U&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}\mathcal{F} = \{ x \in X | \mathcal{F}_x \ne 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;i: Z \hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}\mathcal{F} \subset Z&lt;/math&gt;, then the natural map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \to i_* i^{-1} \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism.

'''4 Theorem''' ''Suppose
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^2 \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
''is exact. Then, for every open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;''
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow \Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^0) \longrightarrow \Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^1) \longrightarrow \Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^2)&lt;/math&gt;
''is exact. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^1) \to \Gamma_Z(U, \mathcal{F}^2)&lt;/math&gt; is surjective if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^0&lt;/math&gt; is flabby.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: That the kernel of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}\mathcal{F}^0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1&lt;/math&gt; is trivial means that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}\mathcal{F}^0(U) \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1(U)&lt;/math&gt; has trivial kernel for any &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the first map is clear. Next, denoting &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^1 \to \mathcal{F}^2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, suppose &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}^1(U)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;df = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_j \in \mathcal{F}(U_j)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d u_j = f|_{U_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;d u_j = f = d u_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_j \cap U_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{U_j \cap U_k}&lt;/math&gt; is injective by the early part of the proof, we have &lt;math&gt;u_j = u_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_j \cap U_k&lt;/math&gt; and so we get &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;du = f&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, to show that the last map is surjective, let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}^2(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \{ (U, u) | du = f|_U \}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\{ (U_j, u_j) | j \in J \} \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is totally ordered, then let &lt;math&gt;U = \cup_j U_j&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; agree on overlaps by totally ordered-ness, there is &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u|_{U_j} = u_j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;(U, u)&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound of the collection &lt;math&gt;(U_j, u_j)&lt;/math&gt;. By Zorn's Lemma, we then find a maximal element &lt;math&gt;(U_0, u_0)&lt;/math&gt;. We claim &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose not. Then there exists &lt;math&gt;(U_1, u_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d u_1 = f|_{U_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;d(u_0 - u_1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_0 \cap U_1&lt;/math&gt;, by the early part of the proof, there exists &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathcal{F}^0(U_0 \cap U_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;da = u_0 - u_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;d(u_1 + da) = du_1 = f|_{U_1}&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;(U_1, u_1) \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;) while &lt;math&gt;u_1 + da = u_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U_0 \cap U_1&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the maximality of &lt;math&gt;(U_0, u_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, we conclude &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;du_0 = f&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4 Corollary'''
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^1 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}^2 \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
''is exact if and only if''
:&lt;math&gt;0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}_p^0 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}_p^1 \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}_p^2 \longrightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
''is exact for every &lt;math&gt;p \in X&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map. The sheaf &lt;math&gt;f_* \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; (called the pushforward of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by &lt;math&gt;f_* \mathcal{F}(U) = \mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(U))&lt;/math&gt; for an open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;f: Y \to X&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map. The sheaf &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is then defined by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\mathcal{F}(U) = &lt;/math&gt; the sheafification of the presheaf &lt;math&gt;U \mapsto \varinjlim_{V \supset f(U)} \mathcal{F}(V)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The two are related in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; be an open subset. Then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}f_*\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; consists of elements &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(V))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V \supset f(U)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V) \supset U&lt;/math&gt;, we find a map
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}f_*\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
by sending &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f|_U&lt;/math&gt;. The map is well-defined for it doesn't depend on the choice of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

It was fun to have the opportunity to ask the contest administrator whether we should nuke a comet.  I am in favor of both nuking a comet for AsteroidWatch target practice (because comets represent the greatest potential threats, with short lead times from the Oort Cloud) and excavation.  I had the opportunity to suggest an engineering analysis of which comet would be easiest to excavate and park in a [[w:Mars cycler|cycler]] orbit using its inherent fluids as propellant.

Their [http://bahcc.org/reference/2010_05_BAHCC.pdf June newsletter] on page 5 states, &quot;1889 Ferdinand PORSCHE Sr. (German, 1875-1951) was involved in the first hybrid car.... Exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1899, it was made by Pieper Establishments of Liege, Belgium and Vendovelli and Priestly Electric Carriage Company, Paris.... He was declared the 'Car designer of the XXth century' in 1997 by a jury of 132 professional journalists from 33 countries.&quot;
