      <text xml:space="preserve">WireHose defines a delegate interface which can use to customize how users are authenticated, how guest users get created, and whether or not users can view, edit or delete objects. The WireHoseEngageSupport framework provides an implementation which uses WHTag subclasses to model roles-based access control, with users, groups, operations and inheritable permissions.

== Authentication ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHApplicationHelper.html WHApplicationHelper]&lt;/b&gt; will automatically authenticate users based on username and password or unique login cookies or request headers. If a user can't be found, a guest user will be used. You can customize this behavior by implementing delegate methods which allow you to inspect whatever form values, cookies or headers you find in an incoming request to determine the user for a session.

== Access control ==
The &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHApplicationHelper.Delegate.html WHApplicationHelper.Delegate]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface also defines methods such as userCanViewObject and userCanEditObject, which you can implement to control what users are allowed to do.

The &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/package-summary.html com.wirehose.base.engage]&lt;/b&gt; package uses tags to implement roles-based access control, with users, groups, operations and inheritable permissions for taggable objects. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/WHEngageTag.html WHEngageTag]&lt;/b&gt; is a WHTag subclass which is taggable and indexable, so you can control access to tags. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/WHEngageUser.html WHEngageUser]&lt;/b&gt; represents users which can belong to multiple groups. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/WHGroup.html WHGroup]&lt;/b&gt; is a WHTag subclass which represents groups that can be arranged in an arbitrary hierarchy.

Permissions, represented by the &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/WHPermission.html WHPermission]&lt;/b&gt; class, are tags which are assigned to taggable objects to indicate an association between a group and a &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/WHOperation.html WHOperation]&lt;/b&gt; object. Permissions can be marked as inheritable, which means you can assign a permission to a tag, and any resources tagged with that tag will inherit the assigned permission.

      <text xml:space="preserve">WireHose applications can have multiple user interface appearances. This can be used to support multiple branded affiliates from a single codebase, as in an application service provider environment, or to allow the user to personalize the look of their page in addition to personalizing its content. You can also use this ability to support multiple output formats, such as XML, HDML, SMIL, RSS, RDF, etc.

== Layout dictionary ==
Each separate look in a WireHose application is called a layout. Layouts are defined in a file called a &lt;b&gt;layout dictionary&lt;/b&gt;. You can provide a layout dictionary programmatically, or specify the location of a layout dictionary file on the command line. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHSessionHelper.html WHSessionHelper]&lt;/b&gt; is the primary object used for accessing the layout dictionary.

By default, WireHose will use the value of the user's currentLayout property to determine which layout to use. It can also automatically determine which layout to use by sniffing HTTP request headers, which is useful for temporarily overriding the user's layout preference if they are using a handheld device or other non-HTML client.

== Pages, wrappers and areas ==
Like all WebObjects applications, a WireHose application consists of pages and components. You can substitute pages and components for a given layout; the session helper uses the layout dictionary to determine which components to use. Each layout has an associated &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHWrapper.html WHWrapper]&lt;/b&gt;, which defines the look for that layout. Wrappers and pages also may define multiple areas on the page using &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHArea.html WHArea]&lt;/b&gt; components. For example, a three-column layout may define three areas, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, while another layout may include only a &quot;main&quot; area. Channels are mapped to a particular area through their areaName property; you can map areas from one layout to another through entries in the layout dictionary.

== Dynamic binding resolution ==
Components that inherit from &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHComponent.html WHComponent]&lt;/b&gt; can optionally resolve their bindings through the layout dictionary rather than being set directly by a parent component. A component's color binding can resolve to &quot;blue&quot; in one area, and &quot;green&quot; in another, depending on the current area, page and layout.

== Localization ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHSessionHelper.html WHSessionHelper]&lt;/b&gt; provides methods which return localized strings depending on the session's languages array, and will look in several places to resolve the value. You can define strings for a particular component on a particular page, or for a particular component, or for a particular page. You can also provide default localizations for components which are in a framework, and those localizations can be overridden in a particular application. You can also define non-localized strings in the layout dictionary.  &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHPropertyBinder.html WHPropertyBinder]&lt;/b&gt; objects are used to get localized labels and values for binding to popup menus.

== Cookies, URL rewriting and bookmarkable pages ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHDirectAction.html WHDirectAction]&lt;/b&gt; provides a mechanism for automatically detecting whether cookies are enabled in a client's browser, and controlling whether session IDs are visible in URLs accordingly. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHHyperlink.html WHHyperlink]&lt;/b&gt; is a dynamic element which includes support for URL-rewriting similar to Apache's mod_rewrite, but which is applied to URLs generated by your application. Together these two classes enable your applications to have clean, bookmarkable URLs such as &quot;/WireHoseDemo/MyHomePage&quot; and still provide personalized sessions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The WireHose frameworks are designed to help you build content management and portal applications faster. You can use them to build new applications from scratch, or you can add WireHose functionality to an existing codebase, usually without subclassing WireHose objects.

== Xcode templates ==
WireHose provides Xcode templates for creating new WireHose applications and frameworks. It also includes templates for rapidly building new channels, channel factories, taggable and indexable entities, as well as components for rendering and editing channels and resources.

== Using interfaces instead of subclassing ==
WireHose defines several Java interfaces which you can implement, enabling you to add WireHose support to your existing enterprise object classes. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHEnterpriseObject.html WHEnterpriseObject]&lt;/b&gt; provides methods for automatically discovering entities which implement an interface, and performing fetches against all entities which support a given interface. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHFetcher.html WHFetcher]&lt;/b&gt; defines an interface for fetching, caching and retrieving objects based on an entity name or interface, and &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHCachingDataSource.html WHCachingDataSource]&lt;/b&gt; provides a default implementation, which also doubles as an EODataSource so you can use it to drive display groups. Most interfaces provide a default implementation, so the amount of code you need to write to support a particular interface is minimal.

== Creating entities at runtime ==
WireHose makes extensive use of entity inheritance, taking advantage of the fact if an entity is not visible at runtime, any database rows described that entity are simply unavailable to the application. This is a simple but effective way to partition objects between separate application instances which share identical codebases and differ only in configuration files or launch arguments. For example, if you are deploying multiple news portals, users connecting to the Seattle portal should only see Seattle-area traffic cams, and Portland users should only see Portland-area traffic cams, but both should have access to national newsfeeds.

&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHEnterpriseObject.html WHEnterpriseObject]&lt;/b&gt; provides several methods for dynamically creating subentities at runtime, so you don't have to manually model many common types of inheritance in EOModeler. These methods are especially convenient for horizontal and single-table inheritance.

WHEnterpriseObject also includes special support for &quot;affiliate-based inheritance&quot;, which is used by many WireHose entities. In this approach, you define an attribute on your base entity called &quot;affiliate&quot;. This attribute is used with a restricting qualifier to identify subentities. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHApplicationHelper.html WHApplicationHelper]&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHTag.html WHTag]&lt;/b&gt; use a &quot;default affiliate&quot; to determine which subentity should be used. WHApplicationHelper also lets an application access multiple affiliates simultaneously, and WHEnterpriseObject can automatically create subentities for all available affiliates.
  
== Database independence ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHEnterpriseObject.html WHEnterpriseObject]&lt;/b&gt; makes it simple to switch between databases when an application is launched. EOModel connection dictionaries can be replaced on the fly through command-line arguments, so you can use a different database during development versus deployment, or deploy multiple instances of the same application against multiple database backends. WireHose also makes extensive use of attribute prototypes so models don't have to be modified even when switching between different database vendors. In addition, since databases vary in how boolean values are supported, WHEnterpriseObject provides utility methods which transparently set and retrieve booleans, whether the columns are defined as INT, BOOLEAN or CHAR.

      <comment>please keep redirect</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Redirect ==

The original page at &quot;Sibyll Trelawney&quot; used the character name in the US books, and the US spelling. The new page uses the UK spelling of her name, just as much of the book uses UK spellings and names. I would recommend keeping the redirect, as people will link to it from outside WB.

== Questioning the spoiler content of the character overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

I question the inclusion of the prophecy statement before any spoiler section is made.  The overview I believed was for general understanding of the character, not letting on story lines etc.  The statement includes information about the prophecy, how it involves Voldemort, how it was made to Dumbledore.  I believe this is too in-depth and critical to the storyline in the lastest books, not for somebody that may have just finished the first few books.  Does anybody agree this should be at least under intermediate levels, I would think advanced?  --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 10:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi and welcome.  Just a quick word of warning, it may not be a good idea to create an account with your email address, as
* It lets everybody see your email, and they may email you when you don't want them do (eg. if you were to get into a disagreement with somebody)
* It leaves your email open for spammers to read.  

If you create an account with a different username, even &quot;Mudson gee&quot; you can enter your email in the &quot;email address&quot; section, and other wiki-persons can email you using a tool designed to protect your privacy from unknown people.  

Just a suggestion, no need to change it if you don't want to.  Other than that, again, welcome to Wikibooks!  --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 10:35, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Draft for a model of online Video Production ==

Creating a DVD or a programme for Tv with a decentralised production team communicating and exchanging Video content, research and subtitles via the Internet is now possible. 

Are there any ways we can help make the process easier by sharing resources. 

To find this out we can have a look at a possible workflow, analyse and improve it and potentially use it for a base for a Production project to test this way of working. 

The best way of representing a possible way of working together is a diagram. 

It can also be expressed as follows. Divided into 2 possibilities of distribution one unedited direct retransmission of the Video segment uploaded by the original producers. The other a model for editing and contextualising this content. 

===Technical notes=== 

Uploading Dvavis, or Dv quicktimes for use in Premiere or Final Cut pro is the simplest way of collaborating online. 

Final Cut pro also supports XML which creates other possibilities for collaborative video making. 

http://www.echochamberproject.com/collaborativefilmmaking

===No Derivation model / Submitting finished Segments=== 

Aim: Creating a high quality resource of online Video files and subtitle files which can be retransmitted on DVD, Cinema and community screenings, TV, Cable, Satellite. 

What is needed: 

* Video collectives who can create a video and subtitle file of their content and who are prepared to distribute it under a creative commons licence 
* A space to upload large quality video files (like http://archive.org) 
* A network of translators who can work with subtitle files
* Links to good resource and documentations files to make the process easier for users of the system

The original production team take on the encoding and uploading of their work. 
This should be uploaded in full [dv avi/ mpeg2] and preview quality to a public/ private server. It should probably be made available under a non-derivation licence. The video file should definite be made available with a subtitle file [*.srt format], which corresponds exactly to the Time. 
There are subtitle notes here for more information about why this is very important http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Video

Subtitle files are passed to translation collectives who translate the original language file to as many languages as appropriate. This process may use some of the existing subtitling / translation collectives. But currently there is a need for more skill sharing for using subtitling software for translation. Specifically the Indymedia and Babels collective. 

The orginal video file and translated subtitle files can be showcased in a public or private webspace. It can then be downloaded to create DIY pick and mix DVD's / screening tapes. 

It is likely that the translators would work with the screening collectives to select and translate the segments of video that best suit their target audience. As such there is no obligation for any group to take on translation which they feel to be unnecessary. 

The example used above of a DVD is arbitrary, The output could be any suitable outlet; Satellite TV such as Free Speech, peer to peer networks, website distribution. The choice of a creative commons licence for non commercial use allows other outlets to approach the original production group to ask for right for retransmission for cable or terrestrial channels. The key focus here is making the Video file available high quality. 

This process is similar to the European Newsreal model which is described here http://europeannewsreal.indymedia.org
There is a recent post on their email list which discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this process 
http://lists.indymedia.org/pipermail/european-newsreal/2006-May/0523-77.html

===Editing and contextualising model=== 
[this is similar to the Deep Dish / Undercurrents / Asia 247 model and incorporating online submission]
 
Aim: to create Edited programmes from films and footage submitted online. This will create programmes with better context for viewers. 

What is needed:
* Video collectives who can create a video and subtitle file of their content and who are prepared to distribute it under a creative commons licence 
* A space to upload large quality video files (like http://archive.org) 
* A network of translators who can work with subtitle files
* Links to good resource and documentations files to make the process easier for users of the system
* Editorial collectives who can effectively contact, work remotely with original video producers, establish trust and edit content sensitively and checking that original producers are happy with the final result.
* Outlets to distribute edited content to.  

The original production team take on the encoding and uploading of their work. 
This should be uploaded in full [dv avi/ mpeg2] and preview quality to a public/ private server. It should probably be made available under a non-derivation licence. The video file should definite be made available with a subtitle file [*.srt format], which corresponds exactly to the Time. 
There are subtitle notes here for more information about why this is very important http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Video

And editorial team previews this material and decides on a the theme and target of a specific production, which could be a DVD or a 23 minute programme. This editorial team then contacts the original producers to gain permission to edit their work, and negotiate rights, payment and use.  

As such editorial decisions are hard to make in large groups especially in online situations over email lists, for example, it may be suggested that a maximum size for such a collective is 4-5 people. 

The editorial team then work with the translation collective to get subtitle files of their edited work. This process may use some of the existing subtitling / translation collectives. But currently there is a need for more skill sharing for using subtitling software for translation. Specifically the Indymedia and Babels collective.  

The editorial team then output the finished work as a non-derivative licence and makes it available in what everways they want to. DVD, for download, as Mpeg2 files for cable and Satellite retransmission, peer 2 peer, etc. If the editorial team charge for the finished programme, they should have negotiated a clear way of dividing the revenue between those involved in the process.

:This is a tutorial for converting from different video formats ([[w:AVI|AVI]], Real Media, Mkv, Ogg, etc) to a [[w:DVD|DVD]] format, playable on any DVD player.

== Versão em Português/Portuguese Version ==
Para uma versão em português, vá para este link: [[:pt:Tudo Sobre Conversão De Diversos Formatos Para DVD|Tudo Sobre Conversão De Diversos Formatos Para DVD]].

For a Portuguese version, go to this link: [[:pt:Tudo Sobre Conversão De Diversos Formatos Para DVD|Tudo Sobre Conversão De Diversos Formatos Para DVD]].

== Introduction ==
I am writing this tutorial because I spent months trying to make good DVDs from fansubbed animes and most of the errors I got (which were '''a lot''') didn't get explained well enough on any of the guides I found.

I intend to deeply cover all the steps and troubleshooting for making good DVDs out of AVIs and Real Media videos.

== Software Needed ==
=== Software Overview ===
==== TMPGEnc Xpress ====
This is the software that is going to be used for conversions. One or more video files are loaded on [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], edited (using any of the filters available) and transcoded into [[w:MPEG-2|MPEG-2]] format. The converted videos are then ready to be compiled onto DVD.

==== Avisynth ====
This software is going to be used to [[w:frameserving|frameserv]] the original video to [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress]. This will be explained further in the [[#Frameserving]] section.

==== DVD Lab Pro ====
This is a DVD authoring software. It is used to compile a DVD using [[w:MPEG-2|MPEG-2]] files. It allows you to create several different types of menus including animated, with sound, etc... 
It is a powerful piece of software, but in this tutorial I am going to stick to the basics, i.e. creating simple good looking menus, chapter selection, etc...

==== Riverpast Audio Converter ====
Sometimes [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] cannot recognize the audio stream from the video file. When that happens, the audio will have to be extracted from the video file, so [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] can load the video and audio streams separetly.

==== Divfix ====
This software will be used in case the video files are corrupt.

==== Real Alternative ====
This software is necessary if you want to convert Real Media files, because [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] cannot recognize these formats (like '''rm''' or '''rmvb''') otherwise.

==== G-Spot ====
This software is used to find out which codecs the AVI video requires. You have to download these codecs if you still don't have them in order to play the video.

==== Codecs ====
These are not strictly essential. Depending on the video, different codecs will be needed. I recommend using the [http://www.cccp-project.net/ Combined Community Codec Pack]. This codec pack has never caused any errors on my PC, and it comes with almost every codec you are ever going to need.

== Conversion Process Overview ==
This section covers some technical terms and processes involved in the conversion process.

=== Frameserving ===
One of the problems encountered while encoding videos is crashing. [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] uses a lot of memory while converting videos, and if you try to convert several videos (for example, encoding several chapters of an anime) and import the video files directly into [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], the chances that the program will crash during conversion are extremely high. Just one tiny reading error during the encoding is enough to stop all the conversion that was already running for several hours. when this happens you will have to start from the beginning.

Frameserving solves that problem. If you try  to load the video directly into [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], huge temporary files are created during conversion, which greatly increases the memory usage, and consequently increases the chances that reading problems occur and a lot of time gets wasted.
[http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] is a software that allows you to create scripts to read the video file and send only small parts of it to the decoder. For example, you have a video called '''Movie.avi''', and a script file called '''Movie.avs'''. '''Movie.avs''' is basically a text file with a few lines that indicate the video to be loaded. So one of the lines will look like this: '''''file = &quot;Movie.avi&quot;'''''. Then, when normally you would open '''Movie.avi''' in [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], now you will open '''Movie.avs''' instead. This way, when the conversion starts, [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] starts to frameserv '''Movie.avi''', which is sending tiny pieces of the video file one at a time for [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] to read. This way, the space used for the temporary  files is minimized, memory usage is reduced, and the chances of crashing is greatly reduced.

=== Converting ===
Most DVD players cannot read AVI/RM/RMVB... etc. files directly. To be able to watch such videos on the TV, you must first convert them to a format that the DVD player can understand. This format is MPEG-2. MPEG-1 is also readable by DVD Players, but they have much lower quality. If you want to make [[w:VCD|VCDs]] then that is the format you want to convert to. This tutorial will not be covering the process for creating VCDs.

[http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] plays the converting part. I also
choose this software because it has several features that really makes our life easier, like been able to resize the video and converting several videos together, like chapters, to easily preview and fill the size of one DVD.

One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.
Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public. For that reason, everything you see on the TV had the borders cut, top, bottom and sides. Thas is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan. Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, it's borders will most likely be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.

The solution to that is simple. [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] has an option of '''resizing''' the video. All you have to do is adjust the size (the size has to be only a little smaller than the original video to fix the overscan). Then the video will get a little smaller with black borders on the sides. Those borders will be on the overscan area and the video will show on the whole screen without the cut borders.

It is always a good idea to test on the TV several different resize values for the video you are converting to know which one will best fill the TV. For that, [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] has also the option of cut editing the video. You can then select only a few seconds of video to convert faster, so you can quickly test the results on the TV.

=== Compiling the DVD ===
After the conversion is successfully completed, the files are still not ready to be burned to the DVD.
The format is correct, but the files have to be organized in order to be played in a regular DVD player.

The last step before burning it to load the video files onto [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/dvdlabpro.html DVD Lab Pro]. Then you can configure the chapters, 
menus, extras, backgrounds, and any other details you may like to add to the DVD. After that, the DVD will be compiled, a process that usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Then the DVD is ready to be burned and played on any DVD Player.

== Making the DVD - AVI ==
These are the steps to be followed in order to make DVDs out of AVI files. Other formats will be covered later, because only a few modifications of the general process have to be made.

=== Creating the script with Avisynth ===
The first step is to create a script that points to the video that you are going to convert. The
script created is going to be processed by [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] and can be played like a normal  video in most video players, like '''Windows Media Player'''. It is also treated like a video by [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], as explained in the section [[#Frameserving]].

This is a basic script that is going to be used in the conversion. This script has been borrowed from the tutorial [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Converting_AVI_to_MPEG-2_with_AviSynth_and_TMPGEnc_Xpress|Converting AVI to MPEG-2 with AviSynth and TMPGEnc Xpress]:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
# source AVI file
file = &quot;C:\...\Movie1.avi&quot; # use actual filename
# open AVI video-only to get correct frame rate
AVISource(file, audio = false)
# save correct frame rate for DirectShowSource
frate = Framerate()
# reopen in DirectShow for better audio compatibility
DirectShowSource(file, fps = frate)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Basically all you have to do is paste this text on the notepad, change the '''file''' parameter to point to your movie, and save it with a name like '''Movie1.avs'''. The '''avs''' extension is important so [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth] can recognize the script file and load the video.

After you have done that, open the script in '''Windows Media Player''' to see if it worked.
If you get a error that looks like this:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD Avisynth Error.PNG]]

This kind of error usually means you have made a mistake on the file name or a typo anywhere in the script. Just see what line the error is in and try to correct it. If you copied the script exactly like shown in here, it should work fine, unless the path to the video is incorrect, there is an error in the video or a missing codec. If that's the case, use [http://www.headbands.com/gspot/ G-Spot] to find out which codec you will need. For help in that, go to [[/G-Spot/]].

If the video works correctly, that means you are ready to open it in [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress]. Jump to [[#Creating a test video]]

'''OBS:''' The video takes longer to open through the script. But it will open much faster if you have the codec [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow ffdshow] installed. That's good if you are opening several files on [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], because they all can take a while to load (maybe one minute each) without [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow ffdshow].

If the video plays but has no sound and you have the correct codec installed, then you will have to extract the audio stream to a '''WAVE''' file. [http://www.riverpast.com/en/prod/audioconverter/index.php Riverpast Audio Converter] is very easy to use, but use any program you like. For some reason [http://www.virtualdub.org/ Virtual Dub] seems to have problems with [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] though, so I don't recommend using it to extract the audio from the movie.

Simply drag and drop the movie onto [http://www.riverpast.com/en/prod/audioconverter/index.php Riverpast Audio Converter].

On the '''Audio Format''' options on the bottom, select the following configurations:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
File Type   : WAV - Waveform
Compressor  : PCM/Uncompressed Stereo
Sample Rate : 48khz - DVD Quality
Resolution  : 16 bits - Normal
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Then click '''Convert'''.

Now you will have to change the script, so you can load the video and the audio separately. Use the following script and change the path to point to the correct video and audio (that you have just converted).

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
# source AVI file
file = &quot;C:\(...)Name.avi&quot;
# source WAV Audio file
audio = WavSource(&quot;C:\(...)Name.wav&quot;)
# open AVI video-only to get correct frame rate
AVISource(file, audio = false)
# save correct frame rate for DirectShowSource
frate = Framerate()
# reopen in DirectShow for better audio compatibility
video = DirectShowSource(file, fps = frate)
Normalize(0.98)
# combine them into a single clip
AudioDub(video, audio)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Test it on the '''Windows Media Player''' now. You should see the video and hear the audio just fine.

=== Creating a test video ===
The next step is to test the right configuration so the video will look good on the TV. All these tests seem to be a waste of time, but with a little practice you will be able to do them really fast. And they are important so you can know how the DVD will look like on the TV before actually having to convert the whole thing.

Open [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress]. Click on '''Start new project'''. This step is only a test, so even if you are planning to convert several chapters at once, you should not do that yet. For now, add '''the same script''' two or three times. You will use a different configuration for each one, so you can know which one will look better on the TV.

Click on '''Add File'''. Add the '''whateverthename.avs''' that you created before. Now the following screen will appear:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD TMPGENC1.PNG]]

Before you change any configurations on this page, you have to check the resolution of your video. If you cannot see the resolution in the properties of the file, click on '''Filter''' (Marked 3 on the screenshot). In the screen that will appear, right below the timeline, the resolution will be shown (for example, 800x600). Then click on '''Clip info''' above, to return to the previous screen.

You must know the resolution so you can select the correct '''Aspect Ratio''' (marked '''1''' on the image above) on [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress]. For example, if your video is '''640 x 480''', then you should select '''Image 4:3'''. If you don't know which resolution is '''widescreen''' (16:9) and wich one is '''standard''' (4:3), check this [[w:List of common resolutions|List of common resolutions]]. Even if the resolution of your video is not listed in there, its easy to know just by watching. If your video is '''widescreen''', select '''Image 16:9''', otherwise, select '''Image 4:3'''. Don't click OK yet.

Select '''Cut-Edit''' on the top (marked '''2''' on the image above). The following screen will appear:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD TMPGENC3.PNG]]

What you will do now is select only a small portion of the video to be converted, only a few seconds. This way, you can convert that part of the video really quickly to test the results on the TV without wasting time.

Click on the timeline (marked 1) and drag it to any part of the video that has a good image. Is even better to select a scene with subtitles showing. Then click on '''Set as Start Frame''' (Marked 2). In the timeline, go a few seconds further, and then click on '''Set as End Frame''' (Marked 3). You should get something like the image shown above. The small triangles bellow the timeline restrict the video that will be converted.

After that, click on '''Filter''' (Marked 3 on the first screenshot).
The following screen will appear:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD TMPGENC5.PNG]]

This is the screen that you will use to fix the overscan of the film. Select '''Resize''' on the left (Marked 1). This setting allow you to resize the video and create black borders around it, so they wont be cut in the TV. In '''Image position''' (Marked 2), select '''Center (Custom size)'''. This means the video will be centralized, and from the new edges to the end of the original size, black borders will be put.

Don't put huge borders. Just look at the original size and take 20 pixels from top and sides. For example, if the video is '''640x480''', the new size should be '''620x460'''. That is very little, so the movie won't really get stretched the from the disproportional resizes. If you want to get a calculator and find out the proportion to resize correctly, that's ok, but the difference will really be insignificant. When converting widescreen videos, I have learnt that the videos get a better look when stretching the most possible in hight. Usually I make my widescreen videos with a resolution of '''694x480''', no matter the starting size (again, that is only for '''widescreen''' videos). In the preview there will seem like the video will exceed the borders of the screen, but in the output the video will be perfect.

In this example, the original size was 640 x 364 (widescreen). I resized it to 620 x 340. The black borders you see in the center are just a preview. They will look even larger in the TV, so you can't create big borders. But like I said, actually I would use a resolution of '''694x480'''.

You don't have to change the '''Resize method'''. Just keep it '''Adaptive'''.

Now click '''OK'''.

Ok, now do that whole '''Add file''' process again. Repeat everything, but now don't use the '''Resize''' filter. Now you have two tiny peaces of video, one with borders and the other fullscreen. If wou want, make another file with a different border. But probably just the 20 pixels will be good enough. When you play that on the TV, just see what video looks better, and use that configuration to convert the whole thing.

Next, click on '''Set Output''', on the top. Select '''Standart Template-&gt;DVD-&gt;NTSC'''. On aspect ratio, select the same aspect ratio you have chosen previously ('''16:9''' for widescreen, and '''4:3''' for '''Standart'''). Click on '''Select''' on the bottom.

The following screen should appear:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD TMPGENC6.PNG]]

If it doesn't, click there:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD TMPGENC7.PNG]]

Now look at the blue bar (marked 1). That bar cannot pass the limit of the DVD. In the test step, the videos are so small that it is impossible for that to happen. But be careful, when you are converting for real, if you use more than '''100% of its capacity''', the video will be converted, but later it won't fit in the DVD! Just click the arrow '''down''' until it gets to '''100%'''. If you cannot get it down to '''100%''', that means you are trying to convert too many videos on the same DVD and [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] cannot compress anymore, so you will have to delete one or more of them.

Now look at '''Image resolution''' (marked 2). Make sure it's on 704 x 480, or else you will get a really ugly output.

That's it! Click '''OK''', then click '''Encode'''. On the '''Output path''' tab bellow, select '''Output clips separately'''. It decreases the chance of crashing and makes it easier to create chapters later. In the '''Encoder setting''' tab, in the '''Preview frequency''' option, select '''No preview'''. The process goes faster when the preview is turned off. Still on the same tab, on both of the '''Task priority''' options, select '''Highest''', to accelerate the process even more. Now click on '''Start Output''', and wait. Since this is a test, it should take less than a minute. When you are doing the real thing, though, it will take several hours. You should let it running at night. And don't turn on high memory using programs, like games or anti-viruses while encoding.

The output files will be MPEG files, and are ready to be loaded on [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/dvdlabpro.html DVD Lab Pro] and burned.

=== Compiling the test DVD ===
Now open [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/dvdlabpro.html DVD Lab Pro]. If you have [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/index.html DVD Lab Standart], you can try to use it. But I had several weird bug problems with the standard version, so I recommend using the '''Professional''' version.

At this point, you will make the test DVD, so you don't have to worry with adding chapters, putting backgrounds and all that. But I'll explain how to do those things in advance. So, when you are creating the real thing, just follow these instructions.

When you open it, you will see this screen:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD DVDLAB.PNG]]

So, to the basics:

'''1'''&lt;br&gt;
This is the '''preview screen'''. It doesn't really show anything important. Only the video, without audio. It is only useful really if you want to set the chapter points at specific places. Otherwise, you don't need this screen.

'''2'''&lt;br&gt;
This is the '''connections screen'''. It shows you, for example, what happens when the menu times out, if it goes to the next menu, or the video, etc. It is useful if you want to play one movie after the other. Just drag the little gray ball from '''movie 1''' to '''movie 2'''.

'''3'''&lt;br&gt;
These are the '''movies''' you have on the project. It is an important part. You will have to create one '''movie''' for each chapter or movie you want to put on the DVD. By '''chapter''', in this case, I mean each separate MPEG file that you have created in the conversion process.

'''4'''&lt;br&gt;
These are the '''menus''' you have on the project. If you want to create a main menu and one chapter menu, for example, you will need two '''menus'''.

'''5'''&lt;br&gt;
This is the '''Assets''' screen. It is a very important screen. Any movies, audios, subtitles, etc. will be imported and shown on this screen.

First of all, go to the folder where you have created the '''MPEG''' files with [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress]. Select all of them and drag to the '''Assets''' screen. A screen will appear asking if you want to demultiplex the files. This means to separate the audio and the video in two different files. [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/dvdlabpro.html DVD Lab Pro] tells you that it is better do demultiplex, but since you used [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress] to create the movies, you don't have to worry. Demultiplexing takes a while and you really don't need to do it. Just click '''quick mode without demultiplexing'''.

Now that your videos are in the '''Assets''' screen, you have to add them to the DVD. Suppose you have created three videos. Right click on the '''Project screen''' (the one with the numbers '''2''', '''3''', and '''4''' marked). Then select '''Add movie'''. Just to that until you have enough movies for each file you want in the DVD (in this case, three).

Now, double click on each movie you added (where I marked '''3'''). This screen will appear in the place where were the '''Connections screen''':

[[Image:AACFSVFTD DVDLAB2.PNG]]

Just drag the movie from the '''Assets''' screen to the '''Movie screen''' above. If you have demultiplexed, the audio is in a different file and you have to drag it too. If you have a separated file for subtitles, drag it here too. Do that to each movie you have on the '''assets''' screen, and drag each one of them the each '''movie''' screen that you created.

Now you can add chapters, if you want. The easiest way is to make a text file with the minutes you want to make the chapters. This way, you can use this file to add chapters to every movie you make. Let's say you want to add chapters at every three minutes. Just create a text file like this:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
00:03:00
00:06:00
00:09:00
00:12:00
00:15:00
00:18:00
00:21:00
00:24:00
00:27:00
00:30:00
00:33:00
00:36:00
00:39:00
00:42:00
00:45:00
00:48:00
00:51:00
00:54:00
00:57:00
01:00:00
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Now click the menu ''''Movie-&gt;Import Chapters...'''', and import the file you saved. This will add chapters every three minutes to your movie until it reaches one hour. If it has less the one hour, [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/dvdlabpro.html DVD Lab Pro] will automatically stop adding chapters. If it has more than one hour, or you want place the chapters differently, just change the text. You can also use the '''preview screen''' to see exactly where you want to place the chapters, and click on '''Add chapter point''', which is the little '''+''' just above the preview screen.

Now, you have to create the menus. Click on '''menu 1''' on the left ('''marked 4'''). If you want to make a main menu, and a chapter menu, just add another menu like you added the movies.

This screen will appear:

[[Image:AACFSVFTD DVDLAB3.PNG]]

This is where you will create your menu. First, if you want to put a background, just find a picture you like and drag here. You can resize it to fit that screen.

To make the menu options, click on '''1'''. Then write whatever you like so who is watching the DVD will understand. For example, write '''PLAY'''. After that, the option '''PLAY''' will be where you have placed it. But that is just a word yet. To actually make that work as an option to ''''play'''', you have to link it. Right click on the word and select '''Link-&gt;Movie 1-&gt;Chapter 1(Movie start)'''', marked '''3'''. That means that when you select '''PLAY''' on the DVD player, it will play the '''Movie 1''' from the start. Use the same process to navigate through the menus linking one to another (to link an option to another menu, right click on the word and select '''Link-&gt;Movie 1-&gt;Menu 1'''', marked '''4'''), changing the audio, the subtitles, etc. This is the base to crate different and complex menus, so just try more and more features. When you get the hang of it you will be able to easily make a lot of different good-looking menus. Take a look at the features in the menu '''Menu''' as well, there are interesting things available there. Just use your imagination!

Now that you made the menus, you might want to test them. Just click on the '''Simulate''' button, and on the '''Follow links''' button, both marked '''5''' on the screenshot. Now you can click on the options you have programmed to check if they do what you want.

Now it is time to compile the DVD. Click on the menu '''Project-&gt;Compile DVD'''. The compile screen will open. Don't change the default options, just set the destination directory you want for your DVD files, and make sure the checkbox '''Run on Background''' is unchecked. If you run it in foreground the compilation will be much faster.

After the compilation is done, just burn the compilation with Nero or another program of your choice. In Nero, select the option to create a '''DVD-Video''' and just drag the compilation folder in there. Always keep a DVD-RW, so you won't waste the DVDs with the test video. Now you can test the DVD on the TV.

=== Creating the real DVD ===
When you test the DVD on the TV, look which movie looked better on the TV. When you know that, do the same process again. But now, instead of adding the same script twice on [http://tmpgenc.pegasys-inc.com/en/product/te3xp.html TMPGEnc Xpress], add all the videos you want to put on the DVD. Don't use the '''Cut edit''' setting, because now you probably want to convert the whole movie. Use the filter settings exactly as you used on the movie that looked better on the TV. Remember all the other details, just as you have seen on [[#Creating a test video]], for they all are important. When everything is set, click on '''Start Output''' again. Now is the time you should let it running and go to sleep. It will probably take all night long.

When it is done, just make the compilation as explained on [[#Compiling the test DVD]] and burn it. You are done! Now you have your DVD ready to run on any DVD player!

== Making the DVD - Real Media - MKV - others ==
To convert from real media to MPEG-2, a few things must be changed from the previous instructions. Just do everything you would do to convert from an AVI format. Ill list below the changes you should make for Real Media. I am not an expert at converting from real media to MPEG-2, actually I hadn't done it so much. But I will talk about the errors I encountered when I did.

Obs. Know that Real Media is a very detail poor format, so if you try to convert it to DVD, the result will have probably low resolution and should look bad on the TV. If you are looking for quality, consider using AVI instead.

'''1'''&lt;br&gt;
When you load '''Real Media''' videos with [http://www.avisynth.org/ Avisynth], there is a great chance the audio will get out of synchronization. To fix that I changed the script. I used a script with this single line:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
DirectShowSource(&quot;c:\movie.rmvb&quot;, fps=23.976, convertfps=true)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

That fixed it. Separating the video from the audio didn't. If that doesn't work, you should try different fps values.

'''2'''&lt;br&gt;
When loading the converted MPEGs into [http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/dvdlabpro.html DVD Lab Pro], the program will ask you to demultiplex the files, and you probably wont have a choice of '''not''' doing that. I faced then a strange bug. After you demultiplex the files, only the video stream was created, and no audio. I don't know why that happened, so pay attention if that happens to you too. If only the video files appear on the '''assets screen''' (the video files are the ones with the '''.mpv''' extension, and the audio files are '''.mpa''') after you demultiplex, you will have to extract the audio from the MPEG yourself. You can use the [http://www.riverpast.com/en/prod/audioconverter/index.php Riverpast Audio Converter] for that. The only problem is that the '''WAV''' output file is really big, so you will probably need to convert the '''WAV''' to '''AC3''' or '''MPA''' first, or the final compilation may not fit in the DVD. Is not hard to find software that convert from WAV to AC3. After you have extracted and converted the audio streams, you will have to add them to the '''assets screen''' too, and add them with each video you add in the '''Video screen''', as explained in the section [[#Compiling the test DVD]].

Those are the problems I had when converting from '''Real Media''' to DVD. If you have different problems, go to the section [[#Contact]] bellow.

Now, to convert mkv, ogg, or most other types of formats, just use this line to load the file:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
DirectShowSource(&quot;file.extension&quot;, fps=23.976, convertfps=true)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

That will open the movie without problems. If you want to load a separate subtitles file into the movie, add the line below:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
TextSub(subtitle file)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

In this case, the script would look something like this:

:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
DirectShowSource(&quot;Video.mkv&quot;,fps=23.976,convertfps=true)
TextSub(&quot;subtitle.ass&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Now all you have to do is load this script on TMPGEnc Xpress. DirectShowSource works with most of the video format.

== Troubleshooting ==
Bellow will be listed common errors you may encounter when converting videos.

* ''When I try to extract the audio stream from the movie ('''AVI''') with [http://www.riverpast.com/en/prod/audioconverter/index.php Riverpast Audio Converter], the program says that it doesn't recognize the format of the file.''

This could mean an error in the video file. Try using [http://www.divx-digest.com/software/divfix.html Divfix] to fix the file and try to extract the audio again.

Make sure you tell me exactly what went wrong, and if possible what video where you trying to convert, the codecs used, where did you get it from, etc. The more information you can give me, the better. I will take a look at your problem and see if I can do something about it. Just make sure you read throughout this tutorial so you don't have to ask me things already explained here. 

I am still going to write on this book whenever I think there is something important to add, so keep an eye for updates.

So that's it, and I wish you all the best of luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Similar to the Windows Registry, embedded codes should be treated with utmost respect and caution.

The DVX manual/online help contains a detailed section on embedded codes, and procedures for eliminating 'rogue codes' prior to importing Word files are described at http://www.necco.ca/dv/word.htm and in the section on how to [[prepare Word files before import]]  of this guide.

The basic rule is '''never delete embedded codes from source segments''', because this can cause severe file corruption and associated frustration.

Nevertheless, ''advanced users'' may be interested to know that certain 'non-critical' codes can in fact be deleted safely from source segments, and it may be convenient to do so in certain situations. Further details can be found at [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-3/message/147]

== Card Catalog Subjects ==
It seems that perhaps 'Strawberry' and some of the other subjects listed in on the page are not sufficiently notable enough to warrant front-page notice.  Some of the books in Civil Engineering should probably cross-list to Structural Engineering as well. [[Special:Contributions/128.42.157.132|128.42.157.132]] ([[User talk:128.42.157.132|talk]]) 20:13, 2 December 2008 (UTC)

== Creating archive pages ==

I have just created a first [[Wikibooks talk:Card Catalog Office/Archive 1|archive page]]
as a subpage of this one to keep access to the initial discussions on the CCO while making place for the new discussions on categorizing and book lists. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 14:09, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

Also created an archive for the general reading room [[Wikibooks talk:Card Catalog Office/Archive 2|categorization discussion]]  that gave way to the book list subproject. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 14:22, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

== Book list subproject ==

=== Objective ===

The objective here is to create a book list of all wikibooks books along with an update procedure. Any wikibookian is welcome to join in the effort. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 14:32, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

The main problem with creating a book list is maintenance. The list will have to be recreated regularly without any manual intervention. To solve that problem a set of rules for building the list will have to be identified. Those rules will have to have certain characteristics:
*Applying the whole set will have to generate a complete list
*The rules must be implementable with an automated tool 
*The set of rules must consider any change to wikibooks that is compatible with policies and guidelines so that the list remains valid when regenerated over time.

So this subproject will consist in defining the correct set of rule and implementing it with an automated tool(s). This will probably be an iterative process because implenting a set of rule will probably generate exceptions that will imply modifications to the rules.

The next section will gradually evolve into the targeted set of rules.

=== Book list generation rules ===

This set of rules serves for the generation of a complete book list for wikibooks. 

* Books are found in the main, wikijunior and cookbook namespaces (the list should be parametrized for future evolution). For the rest of the rules definition the list of namespaces where we can find books will be called the book namespaces.

* The Cookbook is a book encompassing the whole cookbook namespace.

* All pages in the book namespaces either represent books or pages except for the following:
** A redirect page. A redirect page is identified by the presence of a line starting with &lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[page name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
** A transwiki page
** -- put other exceptions here --

* The root page of a set of pages (more then one page) following the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] represent a book.

* Non root pages of a set of pages following the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] represent pages for which the root page is the corresponding main book.

* -- other rules to be included here --

: This list looks good to me. It will give us more impetus to fix the (few) remaining books that don't follow the naming policy! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 06:07, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

: Not so sure about the Transwiki exception, because transwikied pages have there own namespace, so any transwikied pages not in that namespace should be either considered to be part of a book having been renamed appropriately, or used to begin a new book. Other excepts include old books using the old naming conventions that have not been renamed to use the new naming convention, and books created by inexperienced Wikibookians who do not understand how books are organized. You could just include a list of books which use the new naming convention and mark any &quot;books&quot; with no subpages as &quot;unknown&quot; to deal with later. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:49, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

=== First results ===

Here are the first analysis results. They are unconfirmed and should not be used. This is just to show that we were able to download and use the daily dump of the database content.

There seems to be about 3300 pages that must be analyzed.

There seems to be about 1600 books with more than one page and probably a few hundreds from the single pages.

:These are actually pretty fantastic results. I would love to see more. I assume the &quot;single pages to be analyzed&quot; is going to give us an estimate for the number of books that we have here. It would be fantastic to hear that we have over 3,000 books here (although i'm sure many of them are not books). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:39, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

:: There are 2 main questions here:
::*How many of the 1620 groups of pages will confirm as being ''books'' (I assume most) 
::*How many of the 3329 non redirect single pages won't finish has ''first level subpages'' or something else.
 
::The message behind this is that there is more work than anticipated before having a strong list. 5000 cases must be checked, lots of them manually, so a systematic approach will have to be taken. I have some ideas but will let them ''percolate''. As usual any idea is welcomed.

== Why no books about the Arts? ==

Why is there nothing here relating to the arts? Fine arts especially.

Furthermore, there are no books being written that focus on creative disciplines, and yes, there are such things. I swear to it.

The capacity to learn is Dependant on ones ability to be creative. Being taught is not learning. Unless one can form relationships between ideas, as they have been represented, the ideas haven't been learned at all. They've simply been photocopied by the brain.

The greatest minds in the world, dared to be the most creative. I think that by leaving out the arts, and creative disiplines we are doing a disservice to the source of many forms of intelligence and even those of intellect.

Ideas? Responses? Am I not looking in the right place?

Rigel

:Hi Rigel, Thanks for your interest in Wikibooks and sorry for the late response. You can post your questions to the [[ Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|Reading room]] but I will try to answer here. I just checked the Featured Books (books voted as best) list and effectively no books on Fine arts. Take a look at the [[Subject:Fine Arts|Fine arts section]] and its subsections and you will see that there is a big opportunity for contribution. Some books are started but lot of work to do.
:All work on Wikibooks is volunteer and people write books on their area of expertise so if you already know some specific Fine arts subject, you are more then welcome to give a hand. Just pick a book or create one and [[Wikibooks:Be bold|'''be bold''']]. What I can guarantee is that there is no negative thinking about Fine arts or any other subject that lends itself to the ''textbook'' formula.

== Love to Browse ==
This comment isn't separate from the above comment....it's actually meant to augment it: I just don't like the current &quot;Browse&quot; set-up......it's too darned busy!! I wish we had fewer categories or something.  I wish the &quot;tree&quot; only had a few large limbs and then smaller &quot;branches&quot; that broke off from them. Honestly, I don't know how to fix it.....or even if it's broken.....it's just broken ''for me''.[[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] ([[User talk:Buddpaul|talk]]) 16:30, 20 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction of semiconductor ==

Nearly everything that we use contains semiconductors. From old relics such as &quot;Transistor Radios&quot;, to computers, and everything in between, semiconductors make modern human technology operate. Before this book, wikibooks had a number of sources on semiconductors, scattered as stub pages and individual chapters in other books. However, this book is an attempt to bring all that information together into a single resource, and therefore become more valuable to the wikibooks community at large. Now, other books that used to provide their own mini discussions of semiconductors can instead link to this book in an effort to save time and space.

== What Semiconductors Are == 

Semiconductors are special materials (frequently silicon-based) that conduct differently under different conditions. This is, of course, only a partial definition, but it is certainly an important part. Semiconductors can be used to control the flow of electricity in a circuit, they can be used to amplify a signal, or they can be used to switch current flow on or off. In fact, this is only a small subset of the things that semiconductors can do. This book will explain what semiconductors are, and how they are used.

== What This Book Will Cover ==

It is the intent of this book to become a thorough and complete reference resource on semiconductors. The first section will discuss what semiconductors are, and how they are constructed physically. The second section will begin to discuss transistors, first through the use of specific models (Transistors as a switch, and Transistors as an amplifier). Section 3 will talk about Field Effect Transistors (FET), how they operate, and how they are made. Section 4 will talk further about the use of transistors as amplifiers, and will discuss Op-Amp circuits in detail. Section 5 will discuss rectifier circuits and regulator circuits. Section 6 will talk more in depth about using transistors as switches, and will discuss the popular CMOS and TTL design methodologies. Finally, section 7 will discuss the use of light with semiconductors, including phototransistors, photodiodes, and LEDs. In the future, additional topics may be covered. 

== Who This Book Is For ==

This book is designed to be a complete resource on semiconductors, from manufacture to theory, and finally through the use of semiconductors in complex circuits. As such, this book is squarely designed for all readers who are looking to increase their understanding of any of these subjects (or all of them). University-level students, especially those in physics, engineering, chemistry, and mathematics will find this book most helpful.</text>

First of all, install the software.

Then run it. Drag and drop the video you want to check to the program and wait a few seconds. The displayed screen will show all the information on the codecs used to make this video. Right below an arrow it will say &quot;5 compatible codecs installed&quot;. That means the video will should play properly. If that's not the case, you should download the codecs marked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hooke's law==
&lt;math&gt;F = {k\;x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This applies to an object's deformation only before the elastic limit; from then on it deforms plastically and no longer follows this law.
it states that,extention is directly propotional to the applied force.

==Spring Constant==
&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{gradient}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; 


&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{F}{x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The gradient refers to the gradient of a Tension-Extension graph.&lt;br&gt;
The standard units of k are N m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

==Strain==
&lt;math&gt;Strain = \frac{Extension}{Original\; length}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Because this is a division of two measurements of length, Strain has no units and remains a ratio.

==Stress==
&lt;math&gt;Stress = \frac{Force}{CrossSectional\; Area}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The units for Stress are N m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, otherwise known as Pascals (Pa)

==The Young's modulus==
&lt;math&gt;Young \; modulus = \frac{Stress}{Strain}&lt;/math&gt;

==Strain energy==

&lt;math&gt;Strain \; energy = \frac{1}{2}Fx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, due to Hooke's Law, it can be calculated in another form;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Strain \; energy = \frac{1}{2}2jx = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 &lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>added right hand grip rule, the most basic principle and can be used to avoid flemings left hand rule in finding the direction of force(by imagining the resultant magnetic field when combined with a stationary magnet)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Right Hand Grip Rule==
The most basic principle. Imagine your right hand gripping a pen while doing a &quot;thumbs up&quot;(it is vulgar in certain countries but this is for science). The thumb points to the direction of the conventional current while the other fingers points to the direction of the magnetif field lines(it circles around the direction of current).

==Fleming's left hand rule==
Use your thumb, first and second fingers to point at 90° to each other: like the corner of a box.&lt;br&gt;
First finger: Field&lt;br&gt;
seCond finger: Current&lt;br&gt;
THumb: THrust&lt;br&gt;

==Formula==
&lt;math&gt;F = B\,I\,L&lt;/math&gt;

F is the force produced, measured in newtons.
B is the magnetic field strength (flux density), measured in Tesla.
I is the current that the magnetic field is acting on, measured in Amps.
L is the length of the electrical wire, measured in metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definitions and units==
*Frequency (''f'') &amp;mdash; the number of complete oscillations of a particle each second.
**Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 complete cycle per second.
*Period (''T'') &amp;mdash; the time taken for one complete oscillation.
**Period is usually measured in seconds, especially when used in equations.
*Amplitude (''A'') &amp;mdash; the maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position.
*Wavelength (''λ'') &amp;mdash; the shortest distance between two parts of the same wave that are oscillating in phase with each other.

===Relationship between ''f'' and ''T''===
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
and hence, &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;


==Wave speed==
The speed of a wave (''v'') is just the distance the wave has travelled over the time. If we take the time to be one period, then the distance will be one wavelength. Hence the speed of the wave is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{wavelength}{period} \,\, =\,\ \frac{\lambda}{T} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that,
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
we can re-arrange the above equation to give
:&lt;math&gt;v = f \, \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

==Laws of reflection==
Angle of Incidence = Angle of Reflection

The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence are all in the same plane.

==Refractive index==
When light passes from one material to another the refractive index is the ratio of the speeds of light in the two materials.

Refractive Index = Speed in Air / Speed in Medium

==Snell's Law==
Snell's law is the simple formula used to calculate the refraction of light when travelling between two media of differing refractive index.

&lt;math&gt;Refractive\, index = \frac{1}{Sin C}&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Properities of Logarithms */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Logarithms (commonly called &quot;logs&quot;) are a specific instance of a function being used for everyday use.  Logarithms are used commonly to measure earthquakes, distances of stars, economics, and throughout the scientific world.

==Logarithms==
In order to understand logs, we need to review exponential equations. Answer the following problems: 

1) What is 4 to the power of 3?

2) What is 3 to the power of 4?

3) &lt;math&gt;2^5 \!&lt;/math&gt;

4) &lt;math&gt;5^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

After you finish, check your answers:

1: &quot;4 to the power of 3&quot; means &quot;4 multiplied 3 times.&quot;  Thus, 4 to the power of 3 equals 4 times 4 times 4.  4 times 4=16. 16 times 4=64.  So 4 to the power of 3 equals 64.

2: 3 times 3 = 9.  Times 3 equals 27.  Times 3 equals 81.  So 3 to the power of 4 equals 81.

3: &lt;math&gt;2 ^ 5 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32 \!&lt;/math&gt;

4: &lt;math&gt;5 ^ 2 = 5 * 5 = 25 \!&lt;/math&gt;

Just like there is a way to say and write &quot;4 to the power of 3&quot; or &quot;&lt;math&gt;4^3 \!&lt;/math&gt;, there is a specific way to say and write logarithms.  

For example, &quot;4 to the power of 3 equals 64&quot;  can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;4^3=64 \!&lt;/math&gt;

However, it can also be written as:

&lt;math&gt; \log_4 (64) = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Once, you remember that the base of the exponent is the number being raised to a power and that the base of the logarithm is the subscript after the log, the rest falls into place. I like to draw an arrow (either mentally or physically) from the base, to the exponent, to the product when changing from logarithmic form to exponential form.  So visually or mentally I would go from 2 to 5 to 32 in the logarithmic example which (once I add the conventions) gives us: &lt;math&gt; 2^5 = 32 \!&lt;/math&gt;

So, when you are given a logarithm to solve, just remember how to convert it to an exponential equation. Here are some practice problems, the answers are at the bottom.

==Properties of Logarithms==
The following properities derive from the definition of logarithm.

If &lt;math&gt; b&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; b&lt;&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, then for every real y,a,c it is:

1)&lt;math&gt; \log_b (y^a) = a \log_b (y) \ &lt;/math&gt;

2)&lt;math&gt; \log_b (b^a) = a  \ &lt;/math&gt;

3)&lt;math&gt; \log_b (a c) = \log_b (a)+\log_b (c) \ &lt;/math&gt;

4)&lt;math&gt; \log_b (a/ c) = \log_b (a)-\log_b (c) \ &lt;/math&gt;


There is also the &quot;change of base rule&quot;:

&lt;math&gt; \log_b (a) = \frac{\log_d (a)}{\log_d (b)} &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt; d&gt;0, d\neq1 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

Let us take the log to base d of both sides of the equation &lt;math&gt; b^c = a &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \log_d (b^c) = \log_d (a) &lt;/math&gt;.

Next, notice that the left side of this equation is the same as that in property number 1 above. Let us apply this property:

&lt;math&gt; c \log_d (b) = \log_d (a) &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating c on the left side gives

&lt;math&gt; c = \frac{\log_d (a)}{\log_d (b)} &lt;/math&gt; 

Finally, since &lt;math&gt; c = \log_b (a) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \log_b (a) = \frac{\log_d (a)}{\log_d (b)} &lt;/math&gt; 

This rule allows you to evaluate logs to a base other than e or 10 on a calculator. For example,
&lt;math&gt; \log_3 (12) = \frac{\log_{10} (12)}{\log_{10} (3)} = 2.262 &lt;/math&gt;


*Solve these logarithms
**&lt;math&gt; \log_3 (81) = \!&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt; \log_6 (216) = \!&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt; \log_4 (64) = \!&lt;/math&gt;

*Evaluate with a calculator
**&lt;math&gt; \log_4 (6) = \!&lt;/math&gt;

*Find the ''y'' value of these logarithms
**&lt;math&gt; \log_3 (y) = 3 \!&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt; \log_5 (y) = 4 \!&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt; \log_9 (y) = 4 \!&lt;/math&gt;

Logarithms are the reverse of exponential functions, just as division is the reverse of multiplication, for example:

&lt;math&gt;5 \times 6 = 30&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;30/6 = 5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;7^{3} = 343&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\log_{7} 343 = 3&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in a more general form, if &lt;math&gt;a^b=x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x=b&lt;/math&gt;. Also, if &lt;math&gt;f(x)= a^x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)= \log_{a}x&lt;/math&gt;, so if the two equations are graphed each is the reflection of the other over the line &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. (in both equations, ''a'' is considered to be the ''base'').

Because of this, &lt;math&gt;a^{\log_{a}b}=b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}a^b=b
&lt;/math&gt;.

Common bases used are bases of 10 which is a called a ''common logarithm'' or ''e'' which is called a ''natural logarithm&quot; (''e''~=2.71828182846).

Common logs are written either as &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}x&lt;/math&gt; or simply as &lt;math&gt;\log x&lt;/math&gt;.

Natural logs are written either as &lt;math&gt;\log_{e}x&lt;/math&gt; or simply as &lt;math&gt;\ln x&lt;/math&gt; (the ln stands for natural logarithm).

Logarithms are commonly abbreviated as logs.

== Properties of Logarithms ==
# &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x + \log_{a}y = \log_{a}x*y&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x - \log_{a}y = \log_{a}\frac{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x^b = b \times \log_{a}x&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x + \log_{a}y = \log_{a}x*y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x + \log_{a}y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\log_{a}x = b &lt;/math&gt;     and        &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}y = c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ a^b = x &lt;/math&gt;       and      &lt;math&gt;\ a^c = y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ xy = a^b a^c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ xy = a^{(b+c)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\log_{a}xy = b + c&lt;/math&gt;

and replace b and c (as above)

&lt;math&gt;\log_{a}xy = \log_{a}x + \log_{a}y &lt;/math&gt;

== Change of Base Formula ==
&lt;math&gt;\log_{y}x=\frac{\log_{a}x} {\log_{a}y}&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' is any positive number, distinct from 1. Generally, ''a'' is either 10 (for common logs) or ''e'' (for natural logs).

Proof:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\log_{y}x = b&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ y^b = x&lt;/math&gt;

Put both sides to &lt;math&gt;\log_{a}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\log_{a}y^b = \log_{a}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ b\log_{a}y = \log_{a}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ b = \frac{\log_{a}x}{\log_{a}y}&lt;/math&gt;

Replace &lt;math&gt;\ b&lt;/math&gt; from first line

&lt;math&gt;\log_{y}x = \frac{\log_{a}x}{\log_{a}y}&lt;/math&gt;

== Swap of Base and Exponent Formula ==

&lt;math&gt;a^{\log_{b}c}=c^{\log_{b}a}&lt;/math&gt; where a or c must not be equal to 1.

Proof:

&lt;math&gt; log_{a}b = \frac{1}{log_{b}a}&lt;/math&gt; by the change of base formula above.

Note that &lt;math&gt;a=c^{log_{c}a}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

&lt;math&gt;a^{log_{b}c}&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as

&lt;math&gt;({c^{log_{c}a}})^{ log_{b}c}&lt;/math&gt; or by the exponential rule as

&lt;math&gt;c^{{log_{c}a}*{log_{b}c}}&lt;/math&gt; 

using the inverse rule noted above, this is equal to 

&lt;math&gt;c^{ {log_{c}a} * { \frac{1}{log_{c}b} } }&lt;/math&gt;  

and by the change of base formula

&lt;math&gt;c^{log_{b}a}&lt;/math&gt;

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Vietnamese uses the Latin alphabet (the alphabet used in English), but without the letters J, W, and Z. Several letters have forms of the letter that are made with diacritics. Including these special letters, there are 29 letters in all. Vietnamese also uses 10 digraphs and one trigraph. Here are all the letters, digraphs, and trigraphs:

:A, Ă, Â, B, C, D, Đ, E, Ê, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, Ô, Ơ, P, Q, R, S, T, U, Ư, V, X, Y

CH, GH, GI, KH, NG, NGH, NH, PH, QU, TH, TR

Vietnamese also uses five marks to show the tone of a word. These marks always come above a letter, except for one. Even when the letter already has a diacritic, the tone mark normally goes above that diacritic!

In this table, the letters A and Ă are used to show where each tone mark goes, even when there's already a diacritic.

==How many people speak this language?==
Vietnamese is spoken by about 86 million people, making it the 15th most common language.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Vietnamese is an official language in Vietnam, but is also spoken by immigrants in the United States, Cambodia, France, Australia, and Canada.

==What is the history of this language?==
Actually, the language that people use today is quite different from what they used to use before the French ruled Vietnam for 100 years. Before that, people used to speak two types of common dialects: Han Viet and Chu Nom.

Han Viet was the more formal language that was first borrowed, then changed, from the Chinese language. China had ruled Vietnam for 1000 years before the French came, so their influence was much stronger.

Chu Nom was the more informal, popular version of Han Viet that everyone could speak and understand.

&quot;Vietnamese&quot;, as we know it today, comes from a French missionary who thought that Han Viet and Chu Nom were just too hard for people to use. He took the language, gave it a Roman alphabet (a,b,c.. instead of Chinese characters) and made a few other changes as well. This is what is used today in Vietnam.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
*Hàn Mặc Tử
*Nguyễn Du 
*Hồ Xuân Hương
*Tú Xương
*Xuân Diệu
*Bà Huyện Thanh Quan

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
*'''chào''': hello/good-bye
*'''tôi/mình''': I
*'''anh''': I/you/he/older brother
*'''chị''': I/you/she/older sister
*'''em''': I/you/he/she/younger sibling
*'''mẹ/má''': mother
*'''ba/bố/cha''': father
*'''Bạn có khỏe không?''': How are you? (addressed to a friend)

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
&lt;center&gt;Tiến Quân Ca (the Vietnamese national anthem)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Tiếng Việt
!English
|-
|Đoàn quân Việt Nam đi

Chung lòng cứu quốc

Bước chân dồn vang trên đường gập ghềnh xa

Cờ in máu chiến thắng mang hồn nước,

Súng ngoài xa chen khúc quân hành ca.

Đường vinh quang xây xác quân thù,

Thắng gian lao cùng nhau lập chiến khu.

Vì nhân dân chiến đấu không ngừng,

Tiến mau ra sa trường,

Tiến lên, cùng tiến lên.

Nước non Việt Nam ta vững bền.
|Armies of Vietnam, forward!

With the single determination to save the Fatherland,

Our hurried steps resound on the long and arduous road.

Our flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of the country.

The distant rumbling of the guns mingles with our marching song.

The path to glory is built by the bodies of our foes.

Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases.

Ceaselessly for the People's cause let us struggle,

Let us hasten to the battlefield!

Forward! All together advancing!

Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

The '''Cosmopolitan''' is a vodka-based cocktail that has become very popular with women, especially since its prominent appearance in the popular HBO television show &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; The Cosmopolitan, or &quot;Cosmo&quot; is a sweet-tart combination of citrus and cranberry flavors that, conveniently, is an attractive pink color when mixed and served properly.

{{-}}
===Ingredients===
* 2 oz. vodka
* 1 oz. triple sec liqueur
* 1 oz. cranberry juice
* dash Rose's lime cordial (or juice of 1/4 fresh lime)

===Garnish===
Flamed orange zest
===Glass===

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Preparation===
#Combine ingredients. 
#Shake over ice. 
#Strain into a cocktail glass garnished with flamed orange zest.

===Variations===

Some recipes substitute:&lt;br&gt;
*Cointreau liqueur for the Triple Sec, or
*Absolut Citron for plain vodka, (which increases the citrus kick)&lt;br&gt;
*lime juice with 1/2 oz. of Rose's sweetened lime juice, (resulting in a drink more sweet than tart.)
===Note===
Despite the fact that it's served in a cocktail glass, and thus frequently branded a &quot;Martini,&quot; the Cosmopolitan is a cocktail that has more elements akin to sours than the herbal genre of the Martini.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Driving factors that pushed Microsoft to transform its technical training group ==
Microsoft needed to adapt to a maturing software market where quality and value were more important than a proliferation of new features.

The PC software market has matured over the last decade. The market has broadened, as has the role of software in people’s everyday lives. Instead of a market dominated by technically savvy customers, the market is now dominated by business professionals and novice home users. At the same time, Open Source software has been competing against commercial software in key markets.

Microsoft determined that higher quality, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and better integration were the ways to compete with Open Source. In addition, the rise of high-speed Internet access left customers vulnerable to a variety of malicious software. Mission-critical business applications and family communication and entertainment applications must continue to run flawlessly and safely within this environment. Thus, Microsoft had to change the way its software was engineered to focus on security, reliability, privacy, and customer value. 

Initially, Microsoft focused on fixing the products themselves by stopping all development and reviewing every line of code for quality issues. Every engineer was trained in what to look for and how to fix it. However, this was not a sustainable approach if the company was to continue to innovate and create new value for customers. Microsoft needed a more comprehensive and balanced strategy.

Executive leadership sought expertise from outside the company to repurpose the training organization as a performance support organization that could drive engineering improvement across the company.
 
== Critical steps that enabled a successful transition ==
* Received strong executive sponsorship from the highest levels.
* Hired an experienced Human Performance Technology (HPT) professional to lead and transform the training organization.
* Repurposed and trained senior engineers from each discipline as performance consultants.
* Established engineering governance bodies for all engineering disciplines.
* Mapped out three-year performance improvement plans for each engineering discipline.
* Received support from governance bodies for the plans and began implementation.
* Built 60 percent of the HPT infrastructure.
* Started a three-year project to build comprehensive career models for all disciplines.
* Demonstrated value and improvement to the corporation the first two years.

== Detailed results from the first two years ==
* Achieved executive sponsorship across all divisions for our three-year plans within a year.
* Consolidated divergent improvement initiatives across all divisions within a year.
* Moved to a six-month rolling calendar within a year.
* Re-defined our discipline curricula within a year.
* Rolled out new engineering career models for principle disciplines within 18 months.
* Doubled the engineering awards program and event in size within 18 months.
* Defined and approved new product life cycle framework by all divisions within 18 months.
* Increased global training deliveries by 650 percent.
* Rated # 38 in Training Magazine’s Top 100 our first year, and # 23 in our second year.
== Key learnings from the transition, good and bad ==
* Transforming the organization starts at the top and works its way down.
* Repurposing senior engineers as performance consultants provides a huge head start in analysis.
* Establishing a three-year planning process lends credibility and space to work.
* Creating governance and the rest of the system infrastructure cannot be underestimated.
* We should have focused more on operations earlier so they were ready when our plans ramped up.
== Plans for the next few years ==
* Complete the HPT infrastructure to drive analysis, interventions, and evaluation.
* Complete the career models for remaining engineering disciplines.
* Complete the discipline curricula.
* Establish a sustainable, continuous improvement model.
* Rotate senior engineers back into the engineering groups to drive change, and out of the engineering groups to provide fresh perspective and continue improvement.
* Put broad and strong evaluation and analysis systems in place to streamline and validate the planning process and return on investment (ROI) data.
* Upgrade and integrate a new Learning Management System (LMS).
* Establish a cadence for curriculum updates and scheduling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the development of &quot;complex computer systems&quot; (e.g. [[w:artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]], [[w:expert system|expert system]]s, control, simulation, or business software) a '''subject matter expert (SME)''' is a person who is knowledgeable about the domain being represented, but is not necessarily knowledgeable about the programming technology used to represent it in the system.  Simply stated, the SME tells the software developers what needs to be done by the computer system, and how the SME intends to use it.  The SME may interact directly with the system, possibly through a simplified interface, or may codify domain knowledge for use by [[w:knowledge engineering|knowledge engineers]] or [[w:ontology|ontologists]].  A SME is also involved in validating the resulting system.  SME has formal meaning in certain contexts such as [[w:SW-CMM|SW-CMM]].

SMEs are critical partners in the development of knowledge.  They are often key partners for learning and performance improvement organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fulltime SMEs vs Technical Trainers – Why and How ==

Performance Improvement focus drives need for full time SMEs
Alignment of SME role with career path
To affectively address the cultural and technical challenges within each discipline top performing SMEs with credibility within the disciplines were needed to staff the core team.
For Performance Improvement in HPT model part time SMEs would not suffice
Existing career taxonomy included 7 major engineering disciplines all with unique challenges and cultural differences
Align with discipline leaders to function as the board of directors (and partners) of the new organization
Leadership Team Members are the managers of the HP SMEs we wanted

== Designing the right role for high performing SMEs ==


Discipline leadership teams and HPT organization joined with HR to develop new Career Stage Profiles and Competencies
Part of new career profiles included experiences that broadened scope for senior level engineers
Training had to be a component of role but to a degree that it was a plus and not the entire role
Research into technical and process challenges had to be part of the role
Working deeply with key line engineers on a daily basis needed to be maintained
Developed the three core quadrants for the Knowledge Engineer role and ensured it mapped well to the experiences for senior engineers looking for a great challenge
Make the job rotational

== Key learnings, good and bad ==


Invest in HPT and training development early in rotation
The core learning effectiveness organization needed to be very strong to support so many untrained knowledge engineers
Need proof of role as career accelerator, had to give up some team talent to prove it was good for new crop.
Need to let engineers be engineers even when in an HPT organization
Too much training will burn the engineer out and limit their career growth
Line organizations will still fight you to keep the best of their best
Some engineers cannot make the transition into the new role so be selective
You can lose your top talent too soon to other organizations, other companies and other opportunities

      <text xml:space="preserve">Simulations Designed to Meet Business Needs
Intel has had great success in customizing simulations to address business challenges.  The process involves the following steps:

#  Scoping meeting with General Manager
#  Organizational Needs Analysis
#  Customization of Business Challenges Tasks
#  Debrief and follow up

== Simulation Pedagogy ==
Simulation Pedagogy is the instructional strategy that is aligns the simulation activities to the learning. Simulation Pedagogies in use are Total Enterprise Simulation (TE), Large Scale Simulation (LSS), and Goal Based Scenario(GBS).

===Total Enterprise Simulation (TE)===
Washbush and Gosen (2001) conducted longitudinal exploratory studies to reveal learning in total enterprise simulations. They proposed research hypothesis on the basis of three issues: (a) the validity of simulations as learning tools, (b) the relation between learning and simulation performance, and (c) the relation between individual differences and learning from simulation. As a result of the study, they found that due to the participation into simulation activities learning took place. That is why they stated that “the simulation is a valid learning experience” (p. 288). Moreover, they pointed out that there is no relation between learning and simulation performance.

===Large Scale Simulation (LSS) ===
Brown,Parente,Stephen (2002) Parente(1995) LSS integrates theory, simulation, and role-playing into a coherent whole that seeks to provide an active, experiential learning environment.  The LSS pedagogy prescribes to teaching techniques that are appropriate for selected learning objectives. Component of an LSS can include computer based simulation, and role play.

== Title: ==

'''LMS On A Shoestring'''

== Description: ==

Over the past few years it was a great honor to have been recognized for the ability to launch a very effective e-learning capability on a shoe string budget (Corporate e-learning champion, 2002 and Top Training 100, 2003 &amp; 2006). Initially this was based on providing access to over 160 modules via our Intranet and obtaining incredible usage rates. There was something for everyone, including required technical training, leadership development, wellness training, environmental health and safety training, and certification training. 

This is a story about the implementation of a successful on-line learning initiative in two companies. Due to the success of the on-line learning initiative (“E-Learning on a Shoestring”, e-learning magazine, published 10/17/02; See also Bozarth,J., 2005, ''E-Learning Solutions on a Shoestring'', John Wiley &amp; Sons/Pfeiffer), we needed a more sophisticated approach to managing this system. The solution would have to be a Learning Management System (LMS). However, similar to the challenge of developing on-line materials, the costs for LMS systems resulted in sticker shock. We had to resort to a solution similar to what we did with on-line learning. We had to install a LMS on a shoestring budget. What we stumbled on was a very effective approach that cost us less than $30,000 to develop and introduce. 

In both cases, our continued success with our on-line learning initiatives led to new challenges. Now that our employees were actively using on-line learning in a blended approach, we were confronted with methods to track and report on training usage in addition to other opportunities that surfaced. These included:


1.	More effective tracking and reporting of training activity

2.	Ability to assign modules to individuals, groups, or company

3.	Ability to provide on-line testing

4.	Ability to associate required training modules with annual certifications

5.	Ability to create pre-requisite training

6.	Ability to capture on-line and instructor-based training

7.	Ability to provide managers with access to training activity for their direct reports

8.	Ability to link to our training records in our HR system


We realized that this would require investigating learning management systems (LMS). Panic set in similar to when we were initially investigating the options available to launch on-line learning capability. We realized that there were a number of options available, but that most carried a considerable price tag. Due to the continued economic times, budgets were tight and expenditures were closely scrutinized. Based on our ability to launch an effective on-line learning capability we however, did not let our initial panic to hold us back. 

Upon investigating option after option, a small note in one of the training magazines caught our eye. Included in the title, were the words, “Fixed Price License - No User Fee LMS”. What was the catch? The initial reaction based on skepticism of so called “fixed fee” and a license fee less than $15,000 for unlimited users. We’d seen other opportunities in the past which had failed miserably. I decided that it was worth investigating. It involved the opportunity to download a 30 day test of the product which would allow us to “kick the tires”. There was the opportunity to add-on other modules such as 360 Degree if we ever needed. Anyway, we signed the agreement for testing and received a web address to download the software.   

We successfully installed the LMS, and to our surprise, it worked! We had a few technical questions, and we were very pleased with the company’s response time and fixes, even though they had gained nothing financially from us at this point. We were able to provide access to our existing modules and track activity. This intrigued us to the point of investigating what other options were available, and most importantly, at what cost!

To our surprise, we learned that we could set up functionality similar to other LMS systems costing in some cases hundreds of thousands, for approximately $30,000. This included customized reports along with the capability to interface to employee data on our HR system. With the respect and credibility we had developed, due to our success in providing necessary training in a just-in-time format, we were able to convince management to pursue this choice.

From date of contract to going live, we were up and running in only 30 days. We were able to update our employee training records through the middleware piece that was installed by the vendor. We set it up to update employee training records every 30 days. We downloaded the employee records from SAP where we stored our employee records, and updated our employee list in the LMS system. The middleware piece would allow us to update SAP records as well, although we did not see the need for this option.

Shortly after a successful installation, I found myself in the situation of a company in the throws of making changes and moving production off shore. During this transition, I found a new home with Bose Corporation at their manufacturing facility in Columbia, SC. The plant needed to make significant changes to their existing training operations. This challenge, along with the support that was evident from senior management and the value the company maintained towards training, made this a welcome and exciting opportunity.

It was only a few months into making changes, that I realized the need to install a similar LMS system. On-line learning once again proved to be a valuable addition to improving the overall knowledge and skills of our workforce. It wasn’t long before I turned to Acadia HCS to once again provide us with a solution. They once again provided me with the exact level of service I had found at my last company.

Acadia HCS provided their newest LCMS solution. It was an .NET based framework (the latest Microsoft technology) that included all of the functionality I was accustomed to in their previous version, along with a number of new enhancements. Their price once again made this the most cost-effective solution on the market. Even though Bose was investigating a potential global solution to tracking training activity for the years to come, Acadia's LMS provided us with an excellent interim solution, along with the possibility that this could become the global solution. 

Once again, the installation including comprehensive testing, took only 30 days before we went live. A few bugs did appear with their latest version, but we were delighted with the quick turnaround time and service from the vendor. 

So what exactly did the LMS system provide us and what was our experience with this? This is broken down into the following topics:


1.	Launch On-Line Training

2.	Training Management

3.	Certifications

4.	On-line testing

5.	Technical Training

6.	New Hire Orientation

7.	Supervisor Technical Development

8.	Leadership Development

== '''Launch On-Line Training''' ==


The very basic functionality was providing the capability to provide easy access to on-line learning modules and the ability to register for instructor-led classes. The LMS was installed so that anyone with access to the Intranet could access the on-line learning modules via the LMS. Since our modules included audio, we recommended that employees use headsets so not to interfere with their neighbors in adjoining cubicles or offices. We purchased several headsets, Bose Tri-Ports of course, and loaned these out to employees as needed. 

We also set up our existing computer lab to provide access to employees who did not have access to their own PC. We established open lab time in order to provide all employees with 24/7 access to these modules. Our plant operated on a 24/7 schedule which poses a unique challenge to training. There was no “off” time for those employees operating on a 24/7 schedule. Attempting to offer classes before or after a 12 hour schedule was unrealistic and too demanding on the employees. Therefore training needed to be on-line for the most part.

One of the nice features is that each employee is provided with their unique log in and account. They were able to see their own training transcript along with modules that they were required to take. The ability to set up required modules to individuals, groups, departments or the entire plant was an important feature (covered in more detail in the Certification section).

The LMS provided the capability to set up open registration (anyone can access a module), or restricted use. Restrictions could be placed on modules by either requiring a user to request access to the module or linking specified modules to specific individuals, groups, or organizations. This was not an issue until we launch our leadership development series where it would be appropriate that only select audiences view specific modules.

 

== '''Training Management''' ==


The administration of training activity is a nightmare for many companies. The ability to provide up-to-date and accurate training records was critical not only for internal purposes, but for external auditors. These included company’s that we provided product to, who often conducted audits including the training department to ensure that employees were trained and certified in their current positions. In addition we were audited for ISO, QS and other regulatory agencies, who checked our records for thoroughness and accuracy. 

We moved our training administrative function from a manually based system, using a number of Excel spreadsheets and databases, to a centralized database using the LMS. The spreadsheets were laden with errors which compromised our credibility. It was also very time consuming, forcing the role of a full time training coordinator to keep up with the tracking and reporting requirements. 

The LMS provided us with the capability to track all on-line training activity, on-line testing (pre and post tests), completed and incomplete training activity and individual employee transcripts. It also provided self-service ability for employees to register for instructor led classes and instructor capability to track attendance and scores for test activity within the ILT classes. Reports were presented in a number of formats allowing the option of additional analysis using Excel. Within minutes we were now able to determine usage per training module, average test scores and who did not complete the required training initiatives. 

The result was that we reduced the administrative workload by a minimum of 50%. This allowed us to shift the roles and responsibilities of the administrator to a more active training support and instructor role. Eventually we calculated that as we learned more of the features and capabilities of the LMS, our administrative requirements were reduced by 75%! This allowed us to offer more training activity and particularly floor support that was highly valued by our internal customers (manufacturing).

Another highlight was our ability to produce reports on demand for management, external customers and auditors. Employees were also able to view their own training transcripts. Managers could view the training activity of their direct reports. This impressed the auditors who quickly realized that we had our administrative side of the house in order.

Financially, we were able to justify the purchase of the LMS based on the reduced administrative requirements alone. We made simple and conservative estimates with respect to the time it currently took to enter in a training record vs. this being automated with the LMS. The icing on the cake came from the savings it took to prepare training reports. Since the data was easily transferred to our Intranet and managers had ready access to their direct report’s transcripts, requests for training related information was reduced to a minimum, also saving a considerable amount of administrative time and costs. 

This also translated into opportunity costs which is the amount of time we could now transfer towards other needed training initiatives. The current administrator began to assume greater roles in conducting re-certifications and ultimately the development and delivery of training materials. She was excited about the opportunity to more directly support the training team. Her role now included the development of certification modules, tests, checklists and conducting the actual certifications. This was well received by the other instructors who no longer had to interrupt their other training initiatives with re-certification requests.
  


== '''Certifications''' ==


It is my belief that annual certifications for all key positions is a must. All positions are prone to discovering short cuts and voids. Our certifications are rigorous and comprehensive, ensuring to us and management that the employees know the proper procedures and could demonstrate to us that they were able to perform their job to expected levels. For those that were unable to demonstrate this to us, a restricted certification was issued. There were 3 levels of restricted certification depending on the score the employee received. This basically meant that an employee required varying degrees of supervision during the next 90 days. They had one more attempt to pass their certification by the end of this 90 day period. Otherwise, they were no longer permitted to operate in this position.

We revised our certification process to a monthly format. Each month a specified job function needed to be re-certified (e.g. soldering, assembly, machine operator). This helped to organize approximately 18 different annual certifications. Certifications included taking on-line refresher modules, hands-on classes and/or checklists that required the employee to demonstrate the required skills of the position. The on-line modules covered the procedures, step-by-step overview of how to perform key tasks, along with information relating to issues that developed in these roles over the past 12 months. The employees were required to take and pass a knowledge test for each module. 

Each on-line module was 15-30 minutes in length. They included still pictures and video segments along with audio. The pictures and video showed the step-by-step and the audio share commentary on what was taking place and any specific notes. Most certifications included a single module that the employee was required to view and pass the post test prior to being judged with the hands-on checklist. In some cases we used the annual certification as an opportunity for up-training. We realized that we had a captive audience that gave us the chance to refer to new procedures, new equipment, steps in the process, etc. In some cases the certification included several modules. 

A key benefit to the certification process was eliminating the excuse that training was the problem. Once the employees were certified we were able to convince supervision and management, that the majority of the issues experience on the line were now performance issues vs. training issues. In these cases, employees were directed to review the module once again in order to remind them of what is expected of them. This helped to establish respect for the training department. 

Critical to the certification process was the ability to track and report on certification status. The number one request by our external customers was with regards to employee certification status and what was involved with specific certifications. Our LMS included the capability to incorporating certifications. Certifications could be set up to include required module(s) and classes. Once all of the requirements were complete, the employee’s transcript revealed that they held a current certification. We were also able to set up each certification with an expiration date, helping to inform us and the employees when it was time to re-certify. 

We were finally in a position to answer the key question of who did not complete the certification requirements. This also provided us with the means to provide management with these reports. Reports were sent out at the end of each month with the list of employees who did not complete that month’s requirements. This served as a powerful tool since managers did not want their department to be well represented on these reports!

Here is an example of how well this new process worked along with some of the savings we accrued as a result of using the new LMS. A new requirement this year was that all plant employees needed to take and pass electro-static discharge (ESD) certification. This included a 30-minute module on the impact ESD can have on the production process, and specific issues that were identified in the plant. Prior to this plant-wide requirement, only employees involved in the production process had to have this certification. 

Prior to this method of delivering the ESD certification, employees were required to take a required module in the training department since there was no means to access this module at any other location. The test was then administered manually via paper and had to be corrected by the administrator. If the employee passed, they received a stamp that was placed on their badge and then their name was entered into the ESD certification log. In other cases, classes had to be set up to coordinate multiple employees needing to take the class at specified times. Instructors had to schedule classrooms and their own time for these sessions.

The new process allowed employees to take the module at any time during the designated month. This way they could take this module at their convenience or during down time on a line. This minimized the impact of employees having to be scheduled by their supervisor, having to be covered during production time, or being rushed in order to return to their position. 

The ROI in this example was calculated based on approximately 15 minutes of training staff time per employee. This included the time it took to schedule the employee, set them up, administer and correct the test, stamp their badge and enter the training record. Multiply this times 800 employees with a conservative burden rate of $15/hour and the result is $3,000 savings. This did not include the savings related to no longer needing to schedule classes and instructor time. Once again, the savings were associated with 200 more hours of time we could now focus on other training initiatives. So even though this is a relatively small amount, it did not take long to demonstrate to management the ROI we were actually accruing from the purchase of the LMS. 

Another benefit was the ease of reporting from the LMS. At the end of each month, we produced a list from the LMS of only those who had completed all of the certification requirements and held a current certification. These lists of names were posted on the Intranet and were accessible by everyone. Quality auditors used these lists during their frequent line audits to ensure that operators had the required certification for their current position. This also eliminated the need to place a stamp on the employee’s badge which everyone was happy about due to the issues that arose with this error prone process.



== '''On-line testing''' ==


Along with each module we created a knowledge based post test using the functionality of the LMS called the Test Builder. These included primarily multiple choice, matching and true/false questions. The LMS provided us with the functionality of pre-tests, although we do not currently use this. Our plans are to in the near future since it will provide a measurement for increase in learning.

The inclusion of the tests helped to ensure that employees viewed the modules in their entirety. This also provided us with a measure to the employee’s overall knowledge for each module. This was useful Level II data to report on. Over time our plans are to measure the change in scores to reflect to some degree the increase in knowledge levels. However, changing module content and test questions minimized the true comparison of this data over time. 

We decided to use the feedback capability to provide employees with instant feedback whether they were right or wrong, along with what the correct answer is. This presented a challenge in and of itself, since this meant that employees could learn the correct answer, and by repeating the test, improve their score. Employees also were quick to find ways to “cheat” the system. Even though our pools of questions and randomization feature meant that each employee received different test questions, employees wrote down the responses and used this information to ensure they passed on their 2nd and 3rd attempts. However, it was our decision to stick to this method believing that employees still learned simply by writing the responses down. 

To further support this philosophy, it was communicated to every employee that they were responsible for the content of the module. If they were caught not following proper procedure of the information in the module, they would be held accountable and this would result in a performance issue. This was reinforced by the supervision who were also required to view each certification module that related to their production area. 

 

== '''Technical training''' ==


The methodology of tell me, show me, let me, assess me was used to develop all of our technical training materials. Our predicament was that we were always limited in what we could provide based on available training resources to demand. There were always new machine platforms arriving to the plant, new applications, or changes being made to procedures, etc. 

The solution came with using a blended approach incorporating on-line learning, OJT and hands-on classroom sessions where necessary. The on-line modules reviewed the theory of the equipment or process, along with a visually guided step-by-step instruction. In effect, the modules covered the Tell Me, Show Me and knowledge portion of the assessment for the training session. 

The instructors, who were in many cases the subject matter experts, were able to develop an on-line module in approximately one week. This was increasing our availability of training modules at a rapid pace. In other cases, the instructors met with the SME’s and typical turnaround was approximately 2 weeks per module. The LMS was key to providing a single means of access to these modules. We used the feature of adding comments to the log in page to introduce employees to new modules. 

The most significant benefits came from the increased quantity and availability of technical training and in quick manner from inception to delivery. A list of employees requiring the training was obtained and then set up in the LMS as required to take the specified module. At any time we were able to provide completed training reports within minutes of the supervisor’s request. This served as a strong reinforcement to ensuring that required training was indeed completed. 

After only a few months, we had over 60 modules available on-line. This was with a staff of 3 technical instructors and an administrator. This averaged out to be approximately 2 modules per instructor per week. The ability to create content within Acadia's latest creation, called the Content Authoring/Management System, was a breeze. Our learning time was less than a day and since the interface is similar to PowerPoint, we were developing courses online to our server within 24 hours. Since CA/MS is a management tool as well, we could store all of our images (or objects) in the repository. This made development and reusing course lessons a cinch.

== '''New Hire Orientation''' ==


Orientation training initially consisted of 2 days of instructor-led training relating to HR paperwork, Safety training, and other required training. Over time the trend required orientation sessions for 1-5 new hires at a time. It quickly became a real challenge to schedule and consume several Bose employees time for these very small sessions. 

Our approach was to utilize the new on-line learning capability to streamline the orientation process. All of the training that took place used PowerPoint based presentations. We then met with the presenters (Subject matter experts) and created the script that they would have presented during the session. Using the existing format to orientation, we only had time to cover a few topics. What we quickly realized was that by using the on-line format, we could cover more topics that we agreed were important for new hires to review.

The orientation format was revised so that only Day 1 required HR staff to review paperwork, procedures, etc. During Day 2 they were oriented to the new LMS and were told that they needed to review all of the modules listed in the Orientation catalog. This now consisted of 8 modules covering a wide variety of required training materials (e.g. safety) and orientation training about our manufacturing process. New hires were required to take these modules and pass the post test. They were also provided a tour of our manufacturing center.

What we learned from this process were several key benefits. First of all employees really enjoyed the modules, stating that they learned a lot, and also enjoyed the ability to take these at their own pace. They were able to take breaks as needed. We noticed that everyone was learning at their own pace. Traditionally these lecture oriented modules when delivered in the instructor-led format resulted in putting people to sleep.

In addition we noticed that by the time we conducted the tour, they were more knowledgeable based on the materials they reviewed in the modules. They were now exposed to materials that we did not have time for in the previous format (e.g. manufacturing overview module). We were also able to ensure that before they left for the day that they had completed all of the required training and verify that they passed all of the post tests. All of this information was tracked in the LMS thereby reducing additional administrative demands.

The instructors were also freed up to perform other required training development, floor support or training. Overall we realized that this new format for orientation using on-line learning was much more effective than the previous method. 
 


== '''Supervisor technical development''' ==


One of the biggest challenges going forward is ensuring that supervisors have the required technical knowledge for all of the equipment and processes on their line. This was necessary in part to ensure that the employees were performing their functions to expectation and not using shortcuts or avoiding steps entirely. Supervisors are extremely limited for time, and the idea of attending multiple day sessions to learn each position was not probable. 

On-line learning and the LMS provided the perfect alternative. To date the largest volume of on-line modules relates to the technical process. Therefore it provides supervisors and others with a perfect means to acquaint themselves with the wide variety of equipment and processes on their lines. In addition, they are able to review these modules at various times during the day during a very hectic schedule. 

The reality of training in a 24/7 environment also supports that a majority to training take place in a self-paced format. The challenge of scheduling classes across shifts and more importantly changing demands on those you would want to participate in these sessions, makes this new format a viable alternative. 

However, we also realize that on-line learning alone can not be the sole solution. Due to the technical nature of the material, there would undoubtedly be unanswered questions along with needed information unique to a particular process or line. This is where we realized that the appropriate compliment from our technical trainers is what we refer to as floor support. This provides 1:1 training time with supervisors and employees on materials taught using the on-line system. Most importantly it was out on the floor that we could help to assess the overall performance of their employees and provide development suggestions to the supervisors. It was during this interaction that we realized that the supervisors had the chance to learn more detail about a particular machine or step in the process.

This process of enhancing the technical knowledge of supervisors also spread to other support staff such as line engineers, technicians, etc. In effect we realized that we were creating a knowledge repository of modules relating to specific areas of the manufacturing process that were now available to anyone in the plant.

Overall, the ability to provide on-line learning to supervisors and support staff was the perfect tool to enhance their technical knowledge of their process. This also freed up our instructor time to provide floor support which is the perfect compliment to create a blended learning format without the need for a classroom.



== '''Leadership Development''' ==


Frankly, it was easy to find the fit for technical and orientation training on the LMS. You simply stripped off the knowledge or lecture discussions from what would have been presented in the classroom to an on-line format with audio. What was realized through this process is that the same steps can be used for traditional leadership development curriculum. 

While with my previous employer, we offered a wide variety of courses that are typically associated with leadership development (e.g. coaching, feedback, time management, etc.). These courses lasted anywhere from 4 – 8 hours. The first symptom we were experiencing was the attendance was continually dropping off. During our needs assessment it was realized that employees simply did not have the time to invest in the classroom. They wanted to, and understood the benefit, their reality however was that they all had too much on their plates. 

We responded by brainstorming ways to deal with this reality and the continuing need for leadership development. The solution once again came from our experience with on-line learning thus far. This was to strip off the knowledge aspect of our leadership classes and place this material on-line. What remained was the simulations, case studies, role plays, etc. 

This process was beta tested with a few popular classes. Once again we used only PowerPoint along with appropriate clip art, video segments, audio and animation sequence to create a visually pleasing presentation. However, our challenge was to keep the presentation to no longer than 45 minutes. This we continually found was the maximum window that an employee would be able to devote to self-paced learning. The ideal length of the module was 20-30 minutes. We then offered what we called “follow-up” sessions which were only 2 hours in length. These included a brief review of the on-line material with the remainder of the time devoted to hands-on activities.

Where there was typically discussion about a topic, we included short video segments of one or more employee’s responses or comments. Included were scenarios with possible responses where an employee received audio feedback based on the selection they made. Actual scenarios were also included to tie the material back to their work environment. 

The response was overwhelmingly positive. Our attendance rates skyrocketed and actually surpassed earlier record levels when these classes were presented only using instructor-led format. We typically held the sessions in the middle of the week and first thing in the morning. 

What we discovered as other benefits from this new blended format are as follows:

*more employees were now involved in taking leadership training
*employees coming into the follow-up sessions did retain the knowledge from the module which allowed us to focus effectively on the hands-on activities.
*employees were using the on-line materials as refresher updates and found this a lot more effective than referring back to manuals, participant guides, etc.
*our observation of activities was that their abilities to demonstrate the new skill sets from the classroom activities, equaled and surpassed the earlier instructor-led only sessions. 
*our instructors now had time to deliver more sessions and participate in other training and OD related activities
*these sessions often resulted in more specific OD type interventions to follow-up and support the material covered (e.g. assist an organization to improve their performance management process after their manager attended this training).
*we had greater job security&lt;br&gt;

== '''Summary''' ==


In all, we were able to achieve all of our corporate learning initiatives on a slim budget. To date, we have developed over 80 web-based courses with only 3 instructors (not developers) in less than three months. Of course, much of this material previously existed as a PowerPoint file; however, the CAMS product made the transition to moving courses and developing new courses a breeze.

The final statement that needs to be made is this. Keep it simple. Choose the best tools, not the most expensive. Without a doubt, the Brandon-Hall Report “15 Low Cost Learning Management Systems” is a must. 

In many cases I would have liked to have had more time to assess more specific ROI for this investment. However, time did not permit. But, it is without question that there was significant ROI and that this was the right approach to take. Our method is all based on the KISS approach to training. Hire subject matter experts and turn them on to the ability to capture their expertise into a new and exciting on-line format. Install a basic LMS without going broke to enjoy the advantages and benefits referred to in this article. Then, and only then, determine whether the investment is needed to further enhance your multimedia design capability. At this point, I am hesitant to make this next step due to the resources it would involve to get there. The bottom line is that this approach has worked extremely well in both cases and at very minimal expense. Management has recognized these results which has only served to make my job easier and more secure. Not bad for only $30K.

== Technologies Used ==

The company uses Acadia HCS. Web site: [http://www.acadiahcs.com Acadia HCS Home Page]. 

Those on even tighter budgets may find simpler, less expensive answers via an exploration of any number of free ,online technologies. The architecture offered by free online communities, such as Yahoo Groups or MSN Groups, provide a repository for file and graphic storage, polling features, group email, etc. An entire course catalog could easily be hosted here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Whataburger's WhataGames: Hitting the Reset Button through Training'''


== Title: ==

Using competition to encourage a wide-spread workforce to focus on basic training.  

[[Image:Wg_07_logo_small.jpg]]

== Description: ==

[http://www.whataburger.com Whataburger] has 650 quick service restaurants with 20,000+ employees.  Whataburger's corporate teams carefully develop the processes and procedures that should be followed by all locations to serve the products for which we are known.  The Training &amp; Development Department is aligned with Marketing in the Brand Development Department, following the theory that Marketing makes a promise to our customers, and Training delivers upon it.  In a fast-paced environment, it is common for employees to look for workarounds and shortcuts to the standard procedures.  In 1996, [http://www.whataburger.com Whataburger] began holding a &quot;corporate Olympics&quot;, known as WhataGames, with the stated purpose of refocusing every restaurant on using effective training to &quot;hit the reset button&quot; and get the employees to relearn their jobs and use proper procedures.  The event uses a high level of excitement and major awards to encourage training on the skills and knowledge that define the brand.

== Methods Used ==

The program is designed around measurement; no ''new'' training tools are provided.  The goal is to reinforce the use of the ''existing'' training tools.  During the initial competition, all units are Mystery Shopped 10 times per month for two months.  Additionally, a live Call Center is used to call every unit 6 times per month for two months.  During this call, the person who answers must complete a 5 question quiz on proper standards.

Based upon these scores, a number of units are named as Semi-finalists, each of which is inspected &quot;curb to kitchen&quot; for quality, service, friendliness and cleanliness.

These scores are used to name 16 Finalist Restaurants who will compete at the WhataGames Finals held in conjunction with the Whataburger National Convention.  

At the Finals, each Unit will run an actual restaurant while judges simulate a busy half-hour.  They are judged on every aspect of the operation.  Additionally, members of the team participate in a game show to test their knowledge of company standards, procedures and history.

The Gold Medal winners of the event each win $5000, which is a tremendous motivator for people who earn fairly low wages.  The total prize pool for the event exceeds $100,000.

== Results ==

This event has grown to be an important part of the [http://www.whataburger.com Whataburger] Culture, reflecting the attitude our owners have towards their &quot;family members.&quot;  We have seen a consistent rise in mystery shops scores, same store sales increases and reductions in turnover.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Trading Swaps with Futures Seminar'''

This is a test Wiki Book


== Title: ==

learn how the swap cash and futures market and how best to hedge using these instruments.

== Presenters: ==
Steve Dayon, Director Business development, Chicago Board of Trade

Peter Barker, Director Interst Rate Products, Chicago Mercantile Exchange

John Donato, Product Development and Business Analysis, ICAP plc.

== What you learned ==

• Global over-the-counter interest rate derivatives volumes have increased 27% annually over the last 5 years.

• Standardized plain vanilla interest rate swaps account for 78 % of all swap trades.

• The top 10 dealers account for over 75% of swaps trading volume.
As margins on these plain vanilla swaps are becoming razor thin, participants look for more capital efficient ways to conduct business. By using a combination of futures and cash instruments, traders can efficiently trade and manage swap spread risk.

• Counterparty risk is virtually eliminated through the guarantee of the clearing house.

• Liquidity pools are increased by the introduction of quarterly contracts.

• Standardized future contracts can be aggregated into a single net position, whereas each new OTC swap is an individual security.

• Straight through processing and bookkeeping are already in place.

• Current post trade services such as credit netting, trade margining and centralized payment centers are provided up front through the exchanges at no extra cost.

Please join us as product experts from ICAP, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange demonstrate how interest swaps and swap spreads can be traded with futures. This presentation includes detailed discussion on how to use Reuters data provided by ICAP, the CME and CBOT, along with Reuters analytics to benchmark “fair value.”

== Results ==

In a very short time frame, the groups used 50 SME's to create over 200 learning modules, available in 13 languages with only a few months of development time.

Learners rated the courses highly, stating that the courses are &quot;more engaging because of the realism and the relevance&quot; of the material created by SME's.

== Lessons Learned ==

* Many learning modules have a short shelf life, so the most cost-efficient way to produce the content is through SME-developed, rapid authoring using PowerPoint.

* In many cases, you don’t need an LMS to launch and track the learning. The content map approach provides more flexibility when accessing learning content.

* Competencies should most often be measured on-the-job and not through online learning. Online learning works well for teaching, but assess outside the course using more traditional measures.

* If more interaction is needed for instructional purposes, add a “learn more” link to provide additional opportunities. These can be online, such as simulations, or perhaps can even give someone an assignment to talk to another person or engage in on-the-job learning.

* Content stored in PowerPoint is much easier to translate than content organized in other authoring tools.

* PowerPoint-converted learning can be used for self-paced learning, but many people overlook its potential for using the same material for group learning in a classroom setting. We’ve found that it works great for facilitated learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because [http://www.Nestle.com Nestle] (270,000 employees) has a very decentralized training function, with training development ocurring inside many of the Nestle lines of business (such as Carnation, Perrier, Purina, Nestle chocolate, etc.); the company established a staff of centralized training resources. The purpose of the central staff is not to create training for the operate, rather their purpose is to train &quot;learning champions&quot; across the organization and also to establish centralized tools and processes for creating online learning.

Several years ago, the central training group came up with a plan to have Subject Matter Experts (SME) create learning content directly inside PowerPoint with a central repository for all master PowerPoint source material. The consistent format of the training material allows &quot;learning champions&quot; to download, repurpose, translate, etc. the content for their own use.

== Methods Used ==

The plan focused around 3 main objectives:

* Use a tool, common to all groups, to convert the PowerPoint Source material online.

* Provide specific training to the groups on (1) how to develop instructionally sound PowerPoint learning materials and (2) how to use the features and functions of PowerPoint.

* Encourge knowledge sharing amongst business units

== Results ==

In a very short time frame, the groups used 50 SME's to create over 200 learning modules, available in 13 languages with only a few months of development time.

Learners rated the courses highly, stating that the courses are &quot;more engaging because of the realism and the relevance&quot; of the material created by SME's.

== Techologies Used ==

== Title: ==

Methodology for implementing new online charting software for system clinical staff.

== Description: ==

Saint Luke's Health System was faced with a challenge of educating over 3,000 clinical end users on the system's new online patient charting software - Horizon Expert Documentation (HED).  Note: HED is proprietary software developed by McKesson ([http://www.mckesson.com McKesson Corporation]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Involving SMEs from Project Inception to Deployment'''

SMEs are a crucial part of the project from inception to deployment. Their input will help to shape the eventual scope, structure and content of the course. This plan details how to involve your SMEs from start to finish.

== Description: ==

SMEs should be involved in all stages of the project, as follows: 

1. '''Scoping''' - SMEs provide valuable insight into the requirements for training and the scope of knowledge required to perform the task being covered. As you scope the project with your stakeholders, involve the SMEs to assist in defining the knowledge and skills required.

2. '''Project Kickoff''' - Ensure the SMEs are listed on the project team and their roles are explained to the stakeholders and other participants.

3. '''Knowledge Acquisition''' - The SMEs will run this part of the project, brining the content and providing the structure.

4. '''Storyboard through Beta Review''' - SMEs will participate as content reviewers.

5. '''QA Testing''' - SMEs will test deployed content to ensure proper flow.

6. '''Deployment''' - SMEs standby when the course rolls out to ensure there are no further revisions that require their input.

== Methods Used ==


== Results ==
* Content is limited to need-to-know information

* Case studies and stories used to reinforce learning are based on true-to-life situations.

* Content is developed more rapidly as content is acquired more efficiently and SMEs can edit it directly through the wiki project page.

== Techologies Used ==
* PowerPoint is used to gather content and board it for review by project team.

* Wiki project page is used to gather feedback by the project team in a consolidated format. All contributors to the knowledge acquisition, development and review process can fine-tune the feedback to ensure complete and accurate content.

== Lessons Learned ==

* SMEs need to understand the business objective and results expected before providing their input.

* Project team roles need to be very clearly defined during the kickoff meeting so team members provide the appropriate type of feedback. You don't want your SMEs spending their time on copy-edit review.

== Title: ==

LMS: Do You Need one?

== Description: ==

Nicole Vikhlyantsev has consulted on a wide variety of projects. Based on her extensive research she has found a pretty consistent formula for success in determining whether you need an LMS or not.

== Methods Used ==

Assess the number of customers you currently have or plan to have.

Consider what is being captured; how much effort needs to go into this?  How will the results be used?  How valuable is this information to the organization?

== Results ==

If the answer is less than five customers, you don't need an LMS. Or, maybe you need Moodle. However, if each of your customers has already spent more than one million USD, you might want to get them one anyway.

== Techologies Used ==

Mostly right brain stuff

== Lessons Learned ==

* People will get angry with you if you spend their money unneccesarily.

* Owning an LMS does not make you seem cool or sexy.

* an LMS will not solve anything. However it is a great business tool to solve problems in the hands of the competent.

* This advice is completely free

      <text xml:space="preserve">To create simulations that speak to business goals, it is critical to have a scoping meeting with the business or operations manager.  In addition, it is key to &quot;socialize&quot; these concepts with appropriate key stakeholders in the business group and other peers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Grove' Best Practice Profile'''


== Grove: ==

Grove provides integrated solutions to a wide range of facilitation and organization-change challenges. They pioneered creative, visual approaches to traditional organization-change work that consistently stimulate participation, focus big-picture thinking, enhance group memory and win commitment to action.

== Description: ==

[http://www.grove.com Grove] 

The Grove's Strategic Visioning™ Process engages an entire organization in combining its best hindsight and foresight in aligned action. It uses large, graphic templates or Graphic Guides® to step groups through the development of traditional strategic analysis, creative visioning work, focused action planning, and organization-communications design. The Strategic Visioning Process illustrates an optimal path through these activities and, like other Grove tools, invites variations and improvisation. 

The stages are:

*Preparing: Sponsors, process-design teams, and consultants determine the Outcomes, Agenda, Roles and Rules for the process, and plan for involvement of critical stakeholders.


*Exploring and Learning: Participants review the history of the organization for insight into values and core competencies, scan the relevant environment, and study industry structures and competitive patterns.


*Agreeing on Current Realities: Complete traditional SWOT analysis, trends, assumptions and imperatives, and reviews of existing constraints and givens.


*Opening to a Vision: Tap the group's stories about the future—its aspirations and concerns—and find shared themes about future direction.


*Creating Strategies: Ground the visions in clear strategies that articulate the bold steps and initiatives needed to move forward.


*Implementing Change: Involve the organization in creating action plans for strategies and initiatives, changing processes, and refining value propositions.


*Living the Vision: Determine ways to walk the talk every day and keep the vital strategic conversations alive in the organization.

== Methods Used ==

== Results ==



== Techologies Used ==

*Large 4'x 8' preprinted graphic templates.

*Powerpoint templates that match the preprinted, allowing one to easily create a powerpoint slides that capture items recorded during the use of the preprinted templates.

== Lessons Learned ==

*The process must be followed.
*Facilitators of the process should avail themselves of the training, though a seasoned facilitator can use the template guides to learn the best use and process for each template.
*The results are positive and exciting.
*Groups walk away with a vision of the future and elements of the vision which easily can be translated into strategies.
*The process itself is quite scalable, and individual templates can be used for many other processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Technologies Used==
The company is experimenting with iPods and Mix Cast Live to create Podcasts for its new managers.  

==Purpose==
To put learners in the environment where the work will be done, using technology they are familiar with.  

==An Example==
Housekeeping Managers need to know how to inspect rooms once a housekeeper finishes cleaning it.  We are experimenting with creating a podcast that takes the new manager through a step by step process including what they should be looking for and what has to be captured on the Room Inspection Sheet.  The manager would then listen to the podcast in the guest room while following its instructions and capturing results on the Room Inspection Form.

==The Goal==
Younger generations use iPods in their personal life.  Our thought is that they will be more willing to listen and follow the training in the workplace using the same iPod.  Also, placing them in the guestroom, they are completely immersed in their learning, enhancing memory and getting the information they need.

== Title: ==

Using alignment with business priorities and objectives to gain management buy-in across the enterprise.

== Description: ==

As the enterprise business software leader, [http://www.sap.com SAP] (35,000 employees) has sophisticated technology which enables alignment of the operations across an entire company.  However, even though the business operations are aligned inside SAP, the training functions are very silo'ed.  So, to find a way to integrate the various infrastructures and processes, while also leveraging technology and staying in alignment with the overall business priorites, SAP created an enterprise-wide learning council.  The membership includes senior business managers from each of the various lines of business.  blah, blah, blah...

== Methods Used ==

The plan focused around 3 main objectives:

* Facilitate talent development and performance excellence

* Accelerate agility, high performance and ability to adapt

* Drive accountability

== Results ==

(to be updated....)

== Techologies Used ==

The company uses their SAP HCM (Human Capital Management) software to link performance management, talent management and learning management as well as SAP NetWeaver collaboration tools.

== Lessons Learned ==

'''Best Practice in Customizing Training - The Power of QRGs'''


== Title: ==

Creating Quick Reference Guides (QRGs) that are specific to how we use software in our environment enables us to customize our training to our specific users at a low cost. 

== Description: ==

Because the J. Paul Getty Trust with [http://www.getty.edu] (1,500 employees) is a complex organization, that focuses on the visual arts, conservation, humanity research, and a philanthropy, it is important that training provided to the divergent knowledge workers, is very focused on the task or function that must be achieved, while framed in with the &quot;WIFM&quot; (What's in it for Me) and the Why for the Business.

== Methods Used ==

To focus our efforts, decrease our design and deliver time, we created:

* A cheat sheet of questions to ask the Business Owner (sponsor) and the Subject Matter Expert (SME) on what success looks like, how is it used in the job, and the what is the single best way to accomplish the task.

* A Quick Reference Guide template that enable all trainers to quickly develop a core job aid.  The Value of the QRG is that it really forces the trainer/instructional designer to work closely with the SME and business owner on what really needs to be accomplished. 


== Results ==

As a result any of our trainers can create Quick Reference Guides in just a couple days.

The template for the Quick Reference Guide template forces us to answer the questions of &quot;why&quot; are we making this change, what policies and procedures are changing, and then what are the core steps to achieve the job. 

== Techologies Used ==

To keep costs and cycle time down, we create the QRGs in Word.  

== Lessons Learned ==

* Though this sounds overly simply, too often when managing a Training Department, we become enamored in the tools.  When one does not have much budget, or has a very short lead time, or does not have very experienced staff, the use of templates and check list enables us to do much more, much faster.

* By using the template, we can focus on how the software is used in our environment, and enables us to spend more time understanding how it contributes to the organization, while keeping it as simple as possible. 

* Remembering that many of our users find technology annoying, really keeping it simple and task focused is extremely valuable. 

* A reminder is that less is more.  Our QRGs also called placemats are very valued, so that if a task is not done regularly, it is easy for a user to accomplish the task.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Whataburger's WhataGames: Hitting the Reset Button through Training'''


== Title: ==

Using competition to encourage a wide-spread workforce to focus on basic training.  

[[Image:Wg_07_logo_small.jpg]]

== Description: ==

[http://www.whataburger.com Whataburger] has 650 quick service restaurants with 20,000+ employees.  Whataburger's corporate teams carefully develop the processes and procedures that should be followed by all locations to serve the products for which we are known.  The Training &amp; Development Department is aligned with Marketing in the Brand Development Department, following the theory that Marketing makes a promise to our customers, and Training delivers upon it.  In a fast-paced environment, it is common for employees to look for workarounds and shortcuts to the standard procedures.  Beginning in 1996,  Whataburger began holding a &quot;corporate Olympics&quot;, known as WhataGames, with the stated purpose of refocusing every restaurant on using effective training to &quot;hit the reset button&quot; and get the employees to relearn their jobs and use proper procedures.  The event uses a high level of excitement and major awards to encourage training on the skills and knowledge that define the brand.

== Methods Used ==

The program is designed around measurement; no ''new'' training tools are provided.  The goal is to reinforce the use of the ''existing'' training tools.  During the initial competition, all units are Mystery Shopped 10 times per month for two months.  Additionally, a live Call Center is used to call every unit 6 times per month for two months.  During this call, the person who answers must complete a 5 question quiz on proper standards.

Based upon these scores, a number of units are named as Semi-finalists, each of which is inspected &quot;curb to kitchen&quot; for quality, service, friendliness and cleanliness.

These scores are used to name 16 Finalist Restaurants who will compete at the WhataGames Finals held in conjunction with the Whataburger National Convention. 

After a store is chosen for the finals the store will choose 10 employees for the competition. This is done by the area manager sitting all the employee's interesting in going down and testing them on store and cleaning procedures. This is done so that the most knowledgeable employee's are selected and all employee's have a fair chance in going. The team has to consist of one General Manager, one Manager, two Team Leaders and 6 Team Members. For the next two months before the competition the team will practice in and outside of work.

At the Finals, each Unit will run an actual restaurant while judges simulate a busy half-hour. They are judged on every aspect of the operation. This portion of the competition is worth the most points. Additionally, 5 members of the team participate in a game show to test their knowledge of company standards, procedures and history. The team has to include in the games show: The General Manager, The manager, 1 Team Leader of choice and 2 Team members of choice. Last but not least is the flash card game. In this game their are to card sets one on  product time and the other on portioning. In the game 5 members of the team compete and one time to match all the cards and the last one done is the final time. After both cards sets have been played the two times are added together. Each top three wins in any event means points for that team. The team with the most points places.

The Gold Medal winners take home $5000, Silver Medal winners take home $2500 and Bronze Medal winners take home $1000. Also for the stores hard work all the employees that were not on the finals team that went get money too. The Gold Medal store employee's receive $500, Silver Medal winners store employee's receive $250 and the Bronze Medal store employee's receive $100 which is a tremendous motivator for people who earn fairly low wages.  The total prize pool for the event exceeds $100,000.

== Results ==

This event has grown to be an important part of the Whataburger Culture, reflecting the attitude our owners have towards their &quot;family members.&quot;  We have seen a consistent rise in mystery shops scores, same store sales increases and reductions in turnover.

Mustangs are also supposedly awarded.  The cars, not the cows. The Ford Mustangs are awarded to a General Manager for winning the General Manager of the year award. Many other awards are given such as store with most sales for the years.

In 2005, Store 698 from San Antonio, TX took 1st Place. Store 698 had to overcome odds such as a team member being in a bad accident a month before the competition. The team had to replace him quickly. Also the day before the competition the pregnant manager of the team was hospitalized for three days after becoming very sick. That night before the competition the store was allowed to drive another team member from the store to the competition. No store has ever competited without a manager let alone win. For all the manager's hard work Tom Dobson (president/CEO) himself awarded her the prize of $5000 along with the rest of the team.

Also in 2005, store 839 from San Antonio, TX took 3rd place

In 2007, Store 790 from San Antonio, TX took 1st place

In 2007, store 698 from San Antonio, TX took 2nd place barely losing to store rivals 790. This is the first time in competition history that a team has one a medal twice. Putting a question on the store will they medal again in 2009.

== Title: ==

Improving Communication Among Teams in the Workplace

== Description: ==

Chimes was faced with a disconnect among team members in different departments of the organization.

== Methods Used ==

The plan was to host &quot;Cafe Conversations&quot; to provide team members with the opportunity to meet and create a dialogue centered around specific questions such as:

* What do you do each day to support your team members?

* When you do not agree with a team decision, how do you support that decision?

== Results ==

After the initial &quot;Cafe Conversation&quot; the team members requested additional Cafe's addressing additional topics.

== Techologies Used ==

The facilitator used a PowerPoint to display the questions on a screen and to explain the process.

 == Lessons Learned ==

* Team members have the desire and the solution to solve problems if given the opportunity.

* Engaging in a dialogue in a relaxed, informal setting affords team members the opportunity to solve own problems and create.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg|250px|thumb|The United States Bill of Rights]]
The '''United States Bill of Rights''' is the document containing the first ten amendments to the [[../Constitution/]]. These amendments explicitly limit the Federal government's powers, protecting the rights of the people by preventing Congress from abridging freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religious worship, and the right to bear arms, preventing unreasonable search and seizure, cruel and unusual punishment, and self-incrimination, and guaranteeing due process of law and a speedy public trial with an impartial jury. These amendments came into effect on December 15, 1791, when ratified by three-fourths of the 13 states. Initially drafted by James Madison in 1789, the Bill of Rights was written at a time when ideological conflict between Federalists and anti-Federalists, dating from the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, threatened the Constitution's ratification. The Bill of Rights plays a central role in American law and government, and remains a fundamental symbol of the freedoms and culture of the nation. The original handwritten copy is on display in the [[../National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[w:Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] It is the third of the three Charters of Freedom along with the [[../Declaration of Independence/]] and the [[../Constitution/]].

[[Image:JamesMadison.jpg|200px|thumb|James Madison, &quot;Father of the [[../Constitution/]] and first author of the Bill of Rights.]]
==Background==
The Philadelphia Convention, convened in 1787, set out to correct weaknesses inherent in the [[../Articles of Confederation/]] that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded: it was widely conceded that the government needed broader power to generate revenue, as Congress lacked authority to levy taxes; the [[w:Liberum Veto|Liberum Veto]] and the requirement of a supermajority to enact major legislation enabled one or two states to defeat legislative proposals; no provisions were made for an executive branch to enforce the laws or for a national court system to interpret them; and individual states could refuse to be bound under treaties and agreements negotiated with foreign powers.

This need for a stronger legislature, a unified currency, and a central authority with a power to conduct affairs of state led to the stronger Federal government adopted by compromise at the Convention.

The newly constituted Federal government, included a strong executive branch, a stronger legislative branch and an independent judicial branch. However, debate between political factions known as the Federalists and anti-Federalists ensued over the balance between strengthening the nation's government and weakening the rights of the people who only ten years earlier had explicitly rebelled against the perceived tyranny of [[w:King George III|King George III]] of England.

[[Image:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Alexander Hamilton, the man who wrote most of the Federalist Papers]]
===Arguments against the Bill of Rights===
The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial, and was strongly opposed by many notable American statesmen, including Alexander Hamilton. In one of the [[../Federalist Papers/]], published during the Philadelphia Convention on May 28, 1788, Hamilton argued against a &quot;Bill of Rights,&quot; asserting that ratification of the Constitution did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, and therefore that protections were unnecessary: &quot;Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reservations.&quot;As critics of the Constitution referred to earlier political documents that had protected specific rights, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different.  Unlike previous political arrangements between sovereigns and subjects in the United States, there would be no agent empowered to abridge the people's rights: &quot;Bills of rights are in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgments of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was &lt;!--PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A QUOTATION OF HAMILTON IN WHICH HE USED THE ALTERNATE SPELLING &quot;MAGNA CHARTA&quot; IT IS NOT A TYPO - PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY IT, THANKS!--&gt;[[w:Magna Carta|Magna Charta]], obtained by the Barons, sword in hand, from King [[w:John of England|John]].&quot; 

Finally, Hamilton expressed the fear that protecting specific rights might imperil rights that were not mentioned: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted.  For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|200px|thumb|The [[w:Magna Carta|Magna Carta]], a British document which influenced [[../Constitution/]] and the Bill of Rights.]]
===The Anti-Federalists===
During the debate over the ratification of the Constitution, famous revolutionary figures such as Patrick Henry came out publicly against the Constitution. They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the President would become a king, and objected to the federal court system in the proposed Constitution. Thomas Jefferson, ambassador to France, described his concern over the lack of a Bill of Rights, among other criticisms. In answer to the argument that a list of rights might be interpreted as being exhaustive, Jefferson wrote to Madison, &quot;Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can.&quot;

The best and most influential of the articles and speeches criticizing the Constitution were gathered by historians into a collection known as the [[w:Anti-Federalist Papers|Anti-Federalist Papers]], an opposite of the [[../Federalist Papers/]] which had supported the creation of a stronger federal government. One of these, an essay &quot;On the lack of a Bill of Rights,&quot; later called &quot;Antifederalist Number 84,&quot; was written under the pseudonym Brutus. In response to the Federalist view that it was unnecessary to protect the people against powers that the government would not be granted, &quot;Brutus&quot; wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We find they have, in the ninth section of the first article declared, that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellion,-that no bill of attainder, or ex post facto law, shall be passed,-that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this Constitution.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;Brutus&quot; continued with a dark implication directed against the Framers:  &quot;Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought. So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage.&quot;

===Ratification and the Massachusetts Compromise===
Individualism was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt, and the Anti-Federalists were able to play on these feelings in the ratification convention in Massachusetts. By this stage, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease; however, the Massachusetts convention was bitter and contentious: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In Massachusetts, the Constitution ran into serious, organized opposition. Only after two leading Antifederalists, John Adams and John Hancock, negotiated a far-reaching compromise did the convention vote for ratification on February 6, 1788 (187-168). Antifederalists had demanded that the Constitution be amended before they would consider it or that amendments be a condition of ratification; Federalists had retorted that it had to be accepted or rejected as it was. Under the Massachusetts compromise, the delegates recommended amendments to be considered by the new Congress, should the Constitution go into effect. The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Four of the next five states to ratify, including New Hampshire, Virginia, and New York, included similar language in their ratification instruments. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain.

==Drafting==
After the Constitution was ratified in 1789, the first United States Congress met in Federal Hall in New York City. Most of the delegates agreed that a &quot;bill of rights&quot; was needed and most of them agreed on the rights they believed should be enumerated.

James Madison, at the head of the Virginia delegation of the 1st Congress, had opposed a Bill of Rights but hoped to preempt the potential political disaster of a second Constitutional Convention that might have undone the difficult compromises of 1787: a second convention would open the entire Constitution to reconsideration and could undermine the work he and so many others had done in establishing the structure of the United States Government.

Madison based his work on George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776), which itself had been written with Madison's input. In addition to this direct influence, Madison's work on the Bill of Rights reflected centuries of English law and philosophy, further modified by the principles of the American Revolution. It has been argued that all men have inalienable natural rights and that the purpose of government was to protect property rights, ideas that became part of the American view of government. Madison, in the United States Bill of Rights, continued in the radical tradition of the American Revolution by further extending and codifying these rights.

==Twelve amendments proposed==
At first, on June 8, 1789, a motion was made to have the &quot;Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union,&quot; that is, the entire House of Representatives work on proposals for amendments until they were deemed fit to refer to the States for consideration. On July 17, 1789, a motion was passed referring this work to a select committee of eleven members, consisting of Congressmen from every State, including Madison, John M. Vining (Delaware), Abraham Baldwin (Georgia), Roger Sherman (Connecticut), Aedanus Burke (South Carolina), Nicholas Gilman (New Hampshire), George Clymer (Pennsylvania), Egbert Benson (New York), Benjamin Goodhue (Massachusetts), Elias Boudinot (New Jersey), and George Gale (Maryland). The committee drafted the precise language of the amendments, and referred their work back to the House. After revisions in the House, the Bill was passed to the United States Senate on August 24, 1789, and returned with revisions on September 21, 1789.

Finally, the joint proposal of twelve Amendments was approved on September 25, 1789 and submitted to the State Legislatures for approval, and while ten were ratified, two failed. The Congressional Apportionment Amendment, intended to determine the number of Congressional Representatives and assure representation for the common people &lt;ref&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_The_First &quot;Article The First&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, was ratified by only eleven of the state legislatures, one shy of the twelve required to achieve the three-fourths threshold. The Congressional Compensation Amendment fared even worse, passing only six states, but was revived in the 1980s and eventually ratified in 1992 as Amendment XXVII to the United States Constitution.

==Ratification process==
On November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first state to ratify these amendments. On December 15, 1791, ten of these proposals became the First through Tenth Amendments—and official United States law, when they were ratified by the Virginia legislature.

Articles III–XII were ratified by 11/14 States (&gt; 75%). Article I, rejected by Delaware, was ratified by 10/14 States (&lt; 75%), and later by Kentucky (11/15 States &lt; 75%), and failed. Article II was ratified by 6/14, later 7/15 States, and failed.

===Ratification dates===
*New Jersey, November 20, 1789; rejected article II 
*Maryland, December 19, 1789; approved all 
*North Carolina, December 22, 1789; approved all 
*South Carolina, January 19, 1790; approved all 
*New Hampshire, January 25, 1790; rejected article II 
*Delaware, January 28, 1790; rejected article I 
*New York, February 27, 1790; rejected article II 
*Pennsylvania, March 10, 1790; rejected article II 
*Rhode Island, June 7, 1790; rejected article II 
*Vermont, November 3, 1791; approved all 
*Virginia, December 15, 1791; approved all 

===Later consideration===
Lawmakers in Kentucky, which joined the Union in June 1792, ratified the entire set of twelve proposals during that commonwealth's initial month of statehood, perhaps unaware—given the nature of long-distance communications in the 1700s—that Virginia's approval six months earlier had already made ten of the package of twelve part of the Constitution!

Although ratification made the Bill of Rights effective in 1791, three of the original thirteen States: Connecticut, Georgia, and Massachusetts, did not &quot;ratify&quot; the first ten amendments until 1939.

==Incorporation extends to States==
Originally, the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government and not to the several state governments. Parts of the amendments initially proposed by Madison that would have limited state governments (&quot;No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.&quot;) were not approved by Congress, and therefore the Bill of Rights did not appear to apply to the powers of state governments.

Thus, states had established state churches up until the 1820s, and Southern states, beginning in the 1830s, could ban abolitionist literature. However, in 1925, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment, which had been adopted in 1868, made certain applications of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. The Supreme Court then cited the Gitlow case as precedent for a series of decisions that made most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states.

==Display and honoring of the Bill of Rights==
In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared December 15 to be &quot;Bill of Rights Day&quot;, a national holiday commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights is on display at the [[../National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], in the &quot;Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom.&quot;

The Rotunda itself was constructed in the 1950s and dedicated in 1952 by President Harry S. Truman, who said, &quot;Only as these documents are reflected in the thoughts and acts of Americans, can they remain symbols of power that can move the world. That power is our faith in human liberty. . .&quot;

After fifty years, signs of deterioration in the casing were noted, while the documents themselves appeared to be well-preserved: &quot;But if the ink of 1787 was holding its own, the encasements of 1951 were not...minute crystals and microdroplets of liquid were found on surfaces of the two glass sheets over each document...The CMS scans confirmed evidence of progressive glass deterioration, which was a major impetus in deciding to re-encase the Charters of Freedom.&quot;

Accordingly, the casing was updated and the Rotunda rededicated on September 17, 2003. In his dedicatory remarks, 216 years after the close of the Constitutional Convention, President George W. Bush stated, &quot;The true [American] revolution was not to defy one earthly power, but to declare principles that stand above every earthly power -- the equality of each person before God, and the responsibility of government to secure the rights of all.&quot;

==Text of the Bill of Rights==
The text of the Bill of Rights can be divided into fourteen sections: the preamble, the Congressional Apportionment Amendment, the Congressional Compensation Amendment, 10 ratified amendments, and the signatures. (Note that these headings are not part of the text of the document).

===Preamble===
''Congress of the United States begun and held at the City of New-York, on Wednesday the fourth of March, one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine.''

''THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.''

''RESOLVED by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all, or any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution; viz.''

''ARTICLES in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, proposed by Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of the several States, pursuant to the fifth Article of the original Constitution.&quot;''

===Congressional Apportionment Amendment===
''Article the first .... After the first enumeration required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be not less than one hundred Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every forty thousand persons, until the number of Representatives shall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty thousand persons.''

===Congressional Compensation Amendment===
''Article the second .... No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.''

===Amendment I===

==Analysis of the text==
This section describes each section of the Bill of Rights.

===Analysis of the Preamble===
The preamble starts out by saying that the 13 states wished to create this document to prevent the federal government from abusing the powers it was granted by the [[../Constitution/]]. Also, it states that the listed amendments are being proposed as stated in Article V of the Constitution.

===Analysis of the Congressional Apportionment Amendment===
This failed amendment seeks to make certain that seats in the House of Representatives are reapportioned according to population every ten years, but given the current population of the United States, the algorithm that it sets forth would now place very few restrictions on the size of the House. Were this amendment to be ratified today, it would allow anywhere between 200 and nearly 6,000 Representatives.

===Analysis of the Congressional Compensation Amendment===
This amendment, which also failed, prevented any law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives intervened. This amendment was finally ratified as Amendment XXVII in 1992.

===Analysis of Amendment I===
This amendment, the most important and well-known to most Americans, prevented the U.S. Congress from infringing on six important human rights. It forbids federal laws that:

*Establish a state religion or prefer certain religion; 
*Prohibit the free exercise of religion; 
*Infringe the freedom of speech; 
*Infringe the freedom of the press; 
*Limit the right to assemble peaceably; 
*Limit the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 

===Analysis of Amendment II===
This amendment declares the need for &quot;a well regulated militia&quot;, and prohibits infringement of &quot;the right of the people to keep and bear arms&quot;.

===Analysis of Amendment III===
This amendment prohibits the quartering of soldiers (military personnel) in private homes without the owner's consent in peacetime. It makes quartering legally permissible in wartime only, but only in accordance with law.

===Analysis of Amendment IV===
This amendment guards against unreasonable searches and seizures. It was a response to the controversial writs of assistance (a type of general search warrant) which were a significant factor behind the American Revolution.

===Analysis of Amendment V===
This amendment is related to legal procedure. Its guarantees stem from English common law. For instance, grand juries and the phrase &quot;due process&quot; both trace their origin to common law.

===Analysis of Amendment VI===
This amendment codifies rights related to criminal prosecutions in federal courts. The Supreme Court has ruled that these rights are so fundamental and important that they are protected in state courts by Amendment XIV's Due Process Clause.

===Analysis of Amendment VII===
This amendment codifies the right to jury trial in certain civil trials. The Supreme Court has not extended the Amendment to the states under Amendment XIV, as it has for many other components of the Bill of Rights.

===Analysis of Amendment VIII===
This amendment prohibits excessive bail or fines, as well as cruel and unusual punishment. 

===Analysis of Amendment IX===
This amendment protects at least some rights not specifically written in the Bill of Rights.

===Analysis of Amendment X===
This amendment makes explicit the idea that the federal government is limited only to the powers it is granted in the Constitution, is generally recognized to be hardly worth mentioning.

===Analysis of the Signatures===
The Bill of Rights is signed by four important cabinet members to ensure its validity. The signers are Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenburg, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Adams, the Vice President and President of the Senate, John James Beckley, the Clerk of the House of Representatives and Samuel Allyne Otis, the Secretary of the Senate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Goal==
The goal of the Fermentation lab is to introduce the students to the idea of sugar catabolism. They realize that they have seen this occurring in their everyday life but did not know the details.

Point out the fact that yeast can breakdown sugar both aerobically and anaerobically, but if they do it anaerobically they yield only 2 ATP energy from each glucose, while they yield 36 or 38 ATP whey they use oxygen.

The lab is designed to clearly show the beginning and end points of the reaction. 
The students add sugar to water and then add the yeast. In the end, they smell the alcohol and test the CO2.

This lab can be done only qualitatively or quantitatively. Chose which is most appropriate for your students.

==Yeast Fermentation Lab==
The Fermentation lab is fun and you can easily change the difficulty.

For the simplest case, make it a demonstration. Place the balloon on top of the flask, and let it sit on the teacher's desk while you lecture. The balloon will slowly enlarge.

For more complex protocols allow the student to distill the alcohol produced, and test that CO2 is present by using Lime Water.

Remember that the time required for this lab will vary due to temperature and the quality of the yeast. If students do not get results, let the reaction continue 20 more minutes and try again.

===Part C. Demonstrations===
====Observing a Yeast sample====

If you make a microscope slide of the yeast, you will see sand like dots at 40X, small clumps of round things at 100X, and clumps of nucleated cells at 400X

If you do not dye the cells with a dye that kills the cells like iodine, then the cells will continue to grow, and the students can observe bubbles forming under the glass even without a microscope. Have them draw the slide as soon as they make it, and then draw it again after 15 minutes. The bubbles should be larger and more pronounced. Ask them what is happening in the slide.

====Burning Ethanol====
   1. Your instructor will show you that ethanol still contains energy by burning a sample of 95% ethanol.

A. Pour some 95% ethanol on a watch glass and carefully light.

B. Turn off the light to see it easier.

C. Be careful. I burned my hand doing this experiment today!

D. Tell the students that although ethanol is the end product of fermentation, it still holds energy in the molecules. The way that cells get that energy out is Aerobic respiration.

E. Cover the watchglass with a beaker and watch as the fire goes out.
Tell the students that the burning of pyruvate requires oxygen, just like the flame does.

====CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Demonstration====

   2. Look at the demonstration flask, and see if you can observe the presence of CO2 gas in the mixture.

A. Cap an Erlenmeyer flask with a stopper containing one hole. 
Place a glass tube through the hole. 

B. Attach this to plastic tubing that goes into another beaker filled with lime water.

C. As fermentation occurs, CO2 will be produced. It will go through the tube and bubble out through the lime water. Hopefully, you will see a white precipitate.

D. Using Lime water CaOH2 to precipitate CO2 is a classic chemical test. The white powder is chalk.
The wikipedia entry on CO2 says:

&quot;The gas may be bubbled into calcium hydroxide solution (lime water). The lime water will turn milky if CO2 is introduced because of the formation of calcium carbonate.&quot;

The equation is:

Limewater + Carbon Dioxide --&gt; Chalk + Water :

Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) --&gt; CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)

For more info, see the Wikipedia article on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limewater lime water]]


==Getting Quantitative results from this experiment==
====Measuring the CO2 content.====
Use round balloons for this experiment.
Then have the students wrap a string around the widest part of the balloon.
Lay down the string and measure the length. This tells you the circumference of the circle.

Calculate the radius to the center of the circle using the equation:

     &lt;math&gt;C/2 \pi   = r&lt;/math&gt;

Once you have that, you can figure out the volume of the balloon using the equation:

     &lt;math&gt;V=4/3 \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

The easiest thing is to compare volumes directly, but it should be able to figure out the amount of CO2 produced.


Assuming that it is pure CO2, and assuming standard temperature and pressure, you can figure out the moles of CO2 generated by this reaction by using the ideal gas law.

''The Ideal Gas Law'' 

P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, T is temperature, and R is the gas constant, which has various values depending on the unit of pressure:

&lt;math&gt;\qquad PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;

To get the moles of CO2 released use the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\qquad  n= PV/RT&lt;/math&gt;

Two moles will have been released for each glucose molecule broken down by glycolysis.

glucose --&gt; 2 Ethanol + 2 CO2

so multiply the number of moles by two to get the number of moles glucose burned in your fermentation reaction. 


==Variations==
1. Repeat the experiment with different carbohydrate sources to find which sugars are utilized best.

2. Measure the volume of the balloon at different time points, or pour the reactants into test tubes and take a measurement of both the sugar and the gas volume at different time points.


(Be sure to ask the students what sources of error they may have in their experiments.)

== Possible problems ==
If you want to go the quantitative route, please note these possible sources of error.

The corn syrup will stick to the graduated cylinder, and if the students are impatient, they may not get all of the sugar out. I have seen almost 5 mls of sugar left in the flask after they have &quot;emptied&quot; it. 
If you are using the amount of sugar measured in your calculations, it is most likely off.

If you want to calculate the amount of CO2 made, use the mMol/L measurement of the sugar found on the test strips so that you can compare how much sugar was in the original amount.

      <comment>/* B. Observe yeast cultures */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fermentation lab==
In this lab we will observe fermentation occurring in yeast cells. Yeast cells are fungal cells that can metabolize in two ways. In the presence of oxygen, they use aerobic respiration and break glucose down into CO2 and water. In the absence of oxygen, they ferment sugar creating CO2 and ethanol.

We will take yeast cells and grow them absence of oxygen. We will test the glucose content before and after they are allowed to ferment and notice the difference if any.

===Instructions:===
====A. Make the yeast cultures====

# Measure 10ml of sugar
# Place into labeled 500ml Erlenmeyer flask and fill to 200ml with warm water. Mix well. Cover tube.
# Add 1 package of rapid rise yeast to flask and mix briefly.
# Pour some of the mixture into a small beaker to test.
# Place a balloon over the mouth of the flask.

====B. Observe yeast cultures====

#  Allow yeast to grow for at least 30 minutes.
#  Look at the balloons on the flasks. Observe changes if any.
#  Take a bit of brown yeast scum and make a wet mount slide. Observe at 400x. See if you can see the budding action of yeast cell division. ( Do not dye with Iodine, this will kill the cells
#  Let slide sit for 5 minutes, and observe. Are there air bubbles under the slide?  Explain.

====Questions====
1 Write the equation for anaerobic fermentation starting with glucose. Label the reactants and the products.
C6H12O6 =CO2 +C2H5OH



2. Draw the equation that shows the result of aerobic respiration.

C6H12O6 +O2 =CO2 +H2O

3. What was the glucose concentration in each flask when you started?



4. What was the glucose concentration in each flask when you ended?



5. Was there any difference?



6. If so, why do you think that one flask had less Glucose?



7. Why does ethanol burn when water does not?



8. Name two foods that are fermented.



9. Why is wine stored in sealed casks?



10. Draw a picture of budding yeast cells.

      <comment>/* How To Lead for Team Inclusion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction of Best Members for Team Inclusion ==
How can teams include the &quot;best&quot; members and what does &quot;best&quot; mean in selecting members? What key attributes, skills, competencies, etc, should be looked for in selecting team members, which ones can be sacrificed?

When selecting team members, it is importatnt to select the “best” team members.  “Best” in this circumstance could be defined as the right team members with the necessary skills and abilities to function together as a team.  However selecting the best team members can be very difficult.  Thus it is important to have a process in place to assist in team selection.  The proper selection will lead to better inclusion.

If you are not included in a team that you consider will get a benefit with your inclusion, here is presented some steps that can help you to approach the situation.

== What Is the Process? ==
What process should be followed in order to select team members, or should a formal process exist?

The Process should exist, but be somewhat flexible.  Flexibility is important to allow for small change within each organization.  The three step process as defined below can be used as a foundation for a process.  

=== Identify goal or team purpose ===
	
; Goal : Defining a clear goal is important so the group understands what it is trying to achieve.  Without a clear goal or purpose, the team may not be able to identify when the task has been completed or finished. With a clear goal, the team can unify and focus on the objectives rather than determine what the objectives should be.  

; Timeline : It is important to establish a timeline for group selection as well as project finish date (the project finish date may be defined as ongoing or indefinite). While selecting the &quot;best&quot; members of a group, one must not loose track of the date by which the group must be formed.

=== Identify Group Needs ===

; Experience : Identifying experience is important for group confidence. Experience in particular areas can help the group identify with individuals and 	allow individuals to shine in their appropriate areas.  

; Attributes : Identify attributes are important as this can either help or hurt the group cohesion.  Identifying whether potential members are aggressive, passive, compassionate, dedicated , or motivated can directly influence the speed and accuracy of the completion of team objectives.  It is important to have a well rounded team so they can effectively challenge and complement one another.  

; Specialty interest : Indentify passions or non-passions.  Identifying indivial passions or non-passions can help identify and individuals motivation.  If a team member does not care about the outcome of the projcet, their motivation and contribution may be limited.  On the other hand, someone with extreme passion may be overbearing and inhibit team success.  Finding individuals with the appropriate interest levels must be balanced.  

; Skills : The necessary skill level is important so highly skilled individuals aren’t bored with the project at hand.  However it is important to have appropriately skilled individuals to be able to accomplish the task at hand.

; Personalities : Are ideas going to be challenged?  This question is important.  If you have a group of individuals that behave in the same manner, will the ideas presented in the group environment be challenged sufficiently to be identified as the best possible solution or end product?  Allowing individuals to be challenged, or defend particular point of views can allow healthy collaboration. However with personalities that are overbearing and dominearing it can lead to a very “unsafe” group environment.  This can lead to other problems like group polarization.  
	
=== Identify Possible Team Members ===
The third step in the process is to identify individuals who may fit within the team. Identify the “best” team members according to the group needs and the defined goal, so the group has appropriate motivation and does not stagnate.

These three steps are staring points to form the “best” team.  Following these three processes can allow a group to be interdependent on each other to complete group tasks.  Not only can interdependence help the group work together, it fosters a sense of inclusion, because every group member feels that she is needed.  As well, a simple process identifying the “best” individuals can help a group overcome stereotyping, social loafing, group process loss.

== Team Relationships ==

''To what extent should interpersonal relationships dictate who is included?''

It is very important to understand interpersonal relationships to create the best team. The different relationships in a team can destine it for failure or great success, so it is very important to consider each person who is put in a team. Also depending upon the task or goal of a team, there may be better types of relationships for that team. A team's inclusion and relationships can be improved with training and experience.

In order to answer the posed question, it is important to understand what is involved in interpersonal relationships.  These relationships are as diverse as there are different types of personalities.  Every person has a personality that has been shaped by years of experiences.  Some are very aggressive and others very relaxed. There are outspoken people and quiet people, analytical and qualitative, and many others.  All of these things are important in understanding how team members will handle different situations and problems that they will face in a team.  A good team facilitator will quickly pick up on the different team member’s skills and personalities and then use this information to make the team effective. 

The qualities of relationships that are the best for teams to be effective include being productive, having mutual understanding and are self corrective. These things need to be evaluated in who is picked for a team.

; Productivity : A team needs to be productive, and therefore the relationships within a team need to be productive as well.  When all team members are included and involved in the team process, the team becomes very productive.  We have all probably been assigned to teams that were too large and it did not feel like your individual effort mattered.  When teams get too large, there is no longer a mutual need for the input of every member.  Despite having information or skills that the team needs, individuals may no longer put as much effort into a project when there are too many members.  Also in large groups, members tend to have a perception of “someone else will go it”, so there is no need to be assertive.  There usually are a number of members that will no longer participate and feel like their time is being wasted.  Having too large of a team is a common way to loose the inclusion of all members.

; Mutual understanding : Maybe you have been part of a team where certain members took over and made it harder for others to be involved.  Some members are reluctant to express conflicting ideas depending upon who is involved or in charge of the meeting.  Overly aggressive members can really stifle a team’s creativeness and productivity.  The mutual understanding and focus on a group task gets demoted by the over aggressiveness or ego of someone who dominates a team. When everone in a team feels free to contribute, the mutual strength of the team increases.  So it is important to pick team members with relationships that will create a collaborative environment.  
 
; Self corrective : When selecting members of a team it is good too look at each individual’s skills in communicating with others and their ability to work with others.  Depending upon the type of problem to be solved by a group or team, there may be a need for homogeneity, or a need for great diversity.  In teams where everyone has very similar backgrounds, values, and personalities, there is very low risk of conflicts.  These teams also tend to be more likely to make mistakes and to not explore all of the possibilities in solving problems. They can have a hard time finding their mistakes and correcting them. Teams that have a large difference in personality and background tend to have much more conflict and less cooperation.  Despite these challenges, these teams can be very effective in solving challenging issues, even relationship issues.  One key to making diverse teams be productive is to create a collaborate environment and keep the team focused on the goal or task of the group.  Diverse teams that understand the value of conflict resolution and the value of their diversity, can  be self correcting and ease the burden of a team leader or facilitator. Good team skill training and time together with a team can really help diverse teams.   

The interpersonal relationships in a team are keys to being successful.  So to what extent should they dictate who is included?  To a large extent.  A good manager will understand the different personalities in his organization and be able to include those in teams that can be the most productive in resolving an issue or reaching the team goal.

== Being Part of a Team ==

''If you are not included in a team that you think could benefit from you being included, how do you approach the team leader and/or existing team members to be included, or should you at all?''

If we are not included in a team that you consider you should, the best thing to do is to present your concerns to your team leader, your supervisor or manager. From my own experience, you can proceed according with the following steps that have helped me through my last 10 years of work experience:

# Request a space in his/her agenda
# Present your concern
# Present your point of view
# Discuss possible reasons if you get a no
# Conclude the meeting 
# Follow up

As part of a team, we need to have an open and honest communication not only with our managers and supervisors, but also with our team leader and co-workers.   Communication is the key to succeed. Communication is more than talking to others or writing e-mails or letters, it also includes the art of “listening”.  Also I will explain in detail each of what I call “my golden key to success” in this type of situation:      

# Request a meeting: Is a good idea to request a meeting, especially with superiors, because usually they are busy and you will want to capture all of his/her attention.  When you request a meeting, you can be sure that the other person will pay attention to your concern.  Usually this type of meetings doesn’t last very long.  Remember that our bosses are busy.  A half hour to an hour will be enough.
# Present your concern: Don’t be afraid, present your concern. Be open and honest.  Ask why you were not considered. The majority of the times you will be surprised that a) there was not a reason behind, they just didn’t think about you or  b) you can realize the reason behind the decision.  At this point, you will have the opportunity to clarify the perception or you can ask how you can perform better or in a different way in order to be considered in future projects.     
# Present your point of view and the reason(s) why you consider you will be a great asset to the team: If the reason is they didn’t think about you, sell yourself and present your ideas. Showing them that you have the experience and knowledge, as well as the  skills and background that can benefit the team selected.  If you are still not considered, at least they will have an idea of who you are and it will be a possibility in the future that they will select you.  Remembe: be clear, concise and simple. 
# Discussion and answer of questions: Be prepare to defend your ideas, also to answer questions.  Usually the other person just wants to better understand your point of view.  Other times they just want to know if you really have the knowledge and the experience that you said you have. Don't be afraid to sell yourself and tell them about your experience and knowledge. An excellent way to do this is telling stories.  
# Conclude the meeting: Always conclude the meeting in good and positive terms. Most of the times a diplomatic conversation is more valuable and can open other opportunities.
# If necessary, always follow up the conversation: If after the meeting you get a possibility to be included in the team,  always follow up the conversation to show that you are interested.  

As a lesson: Always confront the conflict, never avoid it. Be a peacemaker and not a peacekeeper.  An article called “ Avoiding Conflict at any cost”  recommends that we should confront the situations and don’t be afraid to express our feelings.  If you truly believe that you should be included in a team, express your concerns.''

== Managing Inclusion ==

''How do teams effectively deal with changes in team member inclusion?''

Changes to the makeup of an existing team can be very disruptive especially if that team is an effectively functioning group.  By changing the group membership of an effective team you can cause them to redirect their focus from the tasks and processes at hand, to having to focus on relationships, which can quickly turn that team into an ineffective unit.  When changing the membership of a team, there are certain measures which both the existing team and the new members should consider in order to make for a smooth and successful transition.

=== Suggestions for Existing Team Members ===

; Socialize : Anytime someone joins a new group they are coming in as an outsider.  Entering into an existing team situation may stifle that person's ability to be effective and to focus on the task at hand.  It is the responsibility of the existing team members to socialize with the new member, help them feel that they belong, let them know that they have a valid voice and that they can and should contribute just as much as any other member of the team.

; Educate : It will also be necessary for the existing team members to educate the new member on the history of the team.  This includes helping them to learn about and understand the goals of the team, and to learn about the progress which has been made.  This will include learning about the obstacles that have been overcome and the obstacles which now lay before them.

=== Suggestions for New Team Members ===

; Integrate : Whenever a team is created there will be several key roles which must be filled.  These roles can include; Controller, Adviser, Creator, Organizer, Producer and several others.  When someone joins an existing team they should determine which roles are already filled, which are vacant, and how their skills can best fit into one of these vacancies.

; Self-Education : A new member must be proactive in their education.  They will need to be proactive in learning what has been addressed and what has yet to be addressed.  They can’t be shy about asking questions.  In addition, the new member must realize that they are an asset and important part of the team.  They possess a different perspective which is unique from the rest of the team because of their skills and experience which may benefit the entire team.  If they don’t speak up, they may be holding up the progress of the team.

== How To Lead for Team Inclusion ==
''From leader’s perspective, what are the ways to insure full participation/inclusion/contribution of team members? How does the leader or other team members insure the involvment of a passive and uninterested team member?''

Every team consists of different individuals with different personalities, background and values. Some team members are more active than others, some contribute more than others, some are more motivated than others. To ensure a viable and effective team, a team leader must make sure that every team member participates, contributes and feels as part of the team.

; Put yourself in his/her shoes : In order to influence the behavior of a team member, a team leader must first understand that team member. In order to do so, one should understand the background and values of each team member. Acknowledging the fact that each team member is different will show respect and consideration. In addition, understanding the values will help to identify what kind of things a certain person would cherish or neglect. Values come handy when a leader needs to use motivation. Overall, the objective of the leader in this step is to get to know his/her team members, in other words, a leader needs to to think as a team member does.

; Motivation : Motivation is perhaps the most important factor to ensure effective inclusion of team member. The  foundation  of recognition and motivation is that people need and want  acceptance, approval and appreciation.  Almost all positive motivation is based on these needs. People want to  know  that what they do makes a difference.   Just recognizing the staff is the  most  important step  one  can  take. In addition to financial rewards, there are number of other ways that can be effectively utilized. One of them is to reward the team members for their contributions to the team. A gift certificate or a free dinner might go a long way. The recognition given for work that is well done and public praise will also strengthen the sense of importance and belonging to the team.

; Build Confidence : Part of the reason that a team member will not fully contribute could be the lack of confidence in self and his/her abilities to perform the job. A leader's duty is to notice and take steps to improve the behavior of the team member. Even though building self-confidence is a personal matter and a leader may have little influence over it, a leader should be able to identify the strengths of  team players and build on those. One way to do it is to delegate responsibilities with freedom to think and act. It is also important to remain fair and impartial as slight advantage given to one member over the other may hinder the progress and undermine the efforts of some team members. Accentiating the positives is another tool a leader should continually keep in his arsenal.

; Ensure collaborative climate : Lastly, the team's ability to effectively collaborate, share data and insight in open and positive climate will affect the degree of participation of its members. Nonjudgemental attitude void of team politics is an essential ingredient to building such climate in teams. In addition, a team leader should should be able to establish open and direct relationship with a passive or uninterested team member and encourage other team members to do the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The contents of this wikibook are out of date and have now moved to http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WO/Home. 

The naming convention for objects in WebObjects is that names are written in what is now called &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case camel case]&quot;.

The various prefixes are not hard to explain. The &quot;NS&quot; stands for &quot;NextStep&quot;, the &quot;EO&quot; for &quot;EnterpriseObject&quot;, the &quot;WO&quot; for WebObjects.

Binary Search implementation in Java. The algorithm is implemented recursively.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
/* BinarySearch.java */
public class BinarySearch {
	public static final int NOT_FOUND = -1;
	
	public static int search(int[] arr, int searchValue) {
		int left = 0;
		int right = arr.length - 1;
		return binarySearch(arr, searchValue, left, right);
	}
		
	private static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int searchValue, int left, int right) {
		if (right &lt; left) {
			return NOT_FOUND;
		}
		/* 
		int mid = mid = (left + right) / 2;
		There is a bug in the above line;
		Joshua Bloch suggests the following replacement:
		*/
		int mid = (left + right) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;
		if (searchValue &gt; arr[mid]) {
			return binarySearch(arr, searchValue, mid + 1, right);
		} else if (searchValue &lt; arr[mid]) {
			return binarySearch(arr, searchValue, left, mid - 1);
		} else {
			return mid;
		}		
	}
}

&lt;/source&gt;

Joshua Bloch wrote the binary search in &quot;java.util.Arrays&quot;,
so perhaps he knows a thing or two about binary searching in Java.&lt;ref&gt;
Joshua Bloch.
[http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html &quot;Extra, Extra - Read All About It: Nearly All Binary Searches and Mergesorts are Broken&quot;]
2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Test class for a BinarySearch class.
Note: Array must be sorted before binary search.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
/* BinarySearchTest.java */
import java.util.Arrays;

public class BinarySearchTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] arr = {1, 5, 2, 7, 9, 5};
		Arrays.sort(arr);
		System.out.println(BinarySearch.search(arr, 2));
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== [[wikipedia:Java programming language|Java]] using java.util ==

In Java '''java.util.Arrays''' have an overloaded version of binarySearch for all types of '''Object'''s and variables&lt;br /&gt;
Here's an example of using it with an int[]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.util.Arrays;
public class BinarySearchTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] arr = {1, 5, 2, 7, 9, 5};
		
		// Precondition to the Arrays.binarySearch
		Arrays.sort(arr);
		
		// Search an element
		int index = Arrays.binarySearch(arr, 3);
		
		if (index &gt;= 0)
			System.out.println(&quot;Data found at &quot; + index + &quot; (0-based)&quot;);
		else // index &lt; 0
			System.out.println(&quot;Data not found. It should be inserted before the &quot; + (-index - 1) + &quot;. element (0-based)&quot;);
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use it with '''Object'''s. First of all you need an object. In this case it's the '''IntHolder''', which holds an integer for the reason of simplicity. It has a '''Constructor''', and a '''getter''' function to handle that integer. Discard '''Comparable''' and '''compareTo''' for this time.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
/** A class that holds an integer*/
class IntHolder implements Comparable&lt;IntHolder&gt; {
	public IntHolder(int num) {
		this.num = num;
	}
	// implenets the Interface Comparable
	public int compareTo(IntHolder o) {
		return this.num - o.num;
	}
	public int getNum() {
		return num;
	}
	private int num;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to use this class in Arrays.sort or Arrays.binarySearch, you need to create another class, which can compare two IntHolders:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.util.Comparator;
/** A class that can compare two IntHolders*/
class IntHolderComparator implements Comparator&lt;IntHolder&gt; {
	/** returns &lt; 0 if o1 &lt; o2; &gt; 0 if o1 &gt; o2; and 0 if o1 == o2 */
	public int compare(IntHolder o1, IntHolder o2) {
		return o1.getNum() - o2.getNum();
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now finally here's the example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
IntHolder[] oArr = {
	new IntHolder(1), new IntHolder(5),
	new IntHolder(2), new IntHolder(7),
	new IntHolder(9), new IntHolder(5)
};

// Precondition to the Arrays.binarySearch
IntHolderComparator comp = new IntHolderComparator();
Arrays.sort(oArr, comp);

// if the class don't have a public int compareTo(Object) method, use Comparator
int oIndexC = Arrays.binarySearch(oArr, new IntHolder(2), new IntHolderComparator());
		
// else use it as any builtin primitive type
int oIndex = Arrays.binarySearch(oArr, new IntHolder(2));
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, one can use '''Arrays.binarySearch''' without a '''Comparator'''. This can be achieved if your class implements the '''Comparable''' interface shown above. This also applies to '''Arrays.sort'''.

==[[wikipedia:PHP|PHP]] ==

Working PHP binary search code. Note that this code is extremely inefficient because of the use of array_slice.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function binary_search($a, $k){

    //find the middle
    $middle = round(count($a)/2, 0)-1;

    //if the middle is the key we search...
    if($k == $a[$middle]){
        echo $a[$middle].&quot; found&quot;;
        return true;
    }
    //if the array lasts just one key while the middle isn't the key we search
    elseif(count($a)==1){
        echo $k.&quot; not found&quot;;
        return false;
    }
    //if the key we search is lower than the middle
    elseif($k &lt; $a[$middle]) {
        //make an array of the left half and search in this array
        return binary_search(array_slice($a, 0, $middle), $k);
    }
    //if the key we search is higher than the middle
    elseif($k &gt; $a[$middle-1]) {
        //make an array of the right half and search in this array
        return binary_search(array_slice($a, $middle+1), $k);
    }     
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a better version from the PHP documentation
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function fast_in_array($elem, $array){
   $top = sizeof($array) -1;
   $bot = 0;

   while($top &gt;= $bot)
   {
      $p = floor(($top + $bot) / 2);
      if ($array[$p] &lt; $elem) $bot = $p + 1;
      elseif ($array[$p] &gt; $elem) $top = $p - 1;
      else return TRUE;
   }
    
   return FALSE;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== [[wikipedia:Python programming language|Python]] ==

Working python binary search code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class BinarySearch:
        NOT_FOUND = -1

        def binarySearch(self, arr, searchValue, left, right):
                if right &lt; left:
                        return self.NOT_FOUND

                mid = (left + right) / 2
                if searchValue &gt; arr[mid]:
                        return self.binarySearch(arr, searchValue, mid + 1, right)
                elif searchValue &lt; arr[mid]:
                        return self.binarySearch(arr, searchValue, left, mid - 1)
                else:
                        return mid

        def search(self, arr, searchValue):
                left = 0
                right = len(arr) - 1
                return self.binarySearch(arr, searchValue, left, right)

if __name__ == '__main__':
        bs = BinarySearch()
        a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 66]
        print bs.search(a, 5)
&lt;/source&gt;

That code isn't exactly idiomatic.  It's a class, but it has no state.  Additionally, it unnecessarily consumes stack space by recursing.
Here is another version:
(Not binary search actually but binary + linear)
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
NOT_FOUND = -1

def bsearch(l, value):
    lo, hi = 0, len(l)-1
    while lo &lt;= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) / 2
        if l[mid] &lt; value:
            lo = mid + 1
        elif value &lt; l[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return NOT_FOUND

    // Find the middle element of the vector and use that for splitting
    // the array into two pieces.
    unsigned middle = start + ((end - start) / 2);

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spin is an essential component of an advanced game. Spin influences every aspect of the players' interaction with the ball. Not to mention the satisfying feeling you get when your side spin makes the ball curve just outside of your opponent's stroke.

When learning how to apply spin to the ball, at first the ball is likely to go everywhere but on the table. It is absolutely '''imperative''' that you keep trying. The originating author of this Wikibook made the mistake of giving up on top spin while his friends kept trying. He laughed as he beat them easily, since they were (unsuccessfully) trying to apply top spin. However, once they mastered it, he was unable to stop the onslaught of fast, curving balls, and had to play catch-up.
&lt;!-- Is the above in violation of a Wikibook style guideline? I figured first person would be out of the question, since there will be multiple authors, so I tried that. I included it because it's a good anecdote to encourage the learning process. --&gt;

There are seven types of spin, which makes sense, because there are three axes of motion (forward/backward, left/right, up/down) and no-spin, which can have just as much effect on an opponent as a spun ball. The other six are: Top spin, slice, left side spin, right side spin, left corkscrew spin, and right corkscrew spin.

==Theory==
Understanding how spin works is important. Knowing why spin makes balls curve and jump and seemingly stop helps when implementing it. Spin actually makes the ball behave like an aircraft's wing. Take slice (backspin), for example. Sliced balls seem to float through the air and never bounce as much as a regular (no-spin) ball. This is because the rotation of the ball makes air move over the top of the ball more quickly than the air on the bottom. The slower moving air is at a higher pressure than the faster moving air above the ball. When there is a difference in pressure, high pressure air tries to move into low pressure areas, so the pressure difference imparts lift on the ball. This pressure difference is responsible for the behavior of all spins. When the ball hits the table, it is spinning backwards, so when it grips the table for a moment, that backward rotation is applied to the table and it seems to not bounce as much. Advanced players can apply slice with such energy that the ball will jump backwards when it hits the table.

==Top Spin==
Top spin is the bread and butter of most advanced players' strokes. Just like in tennis, top spin in table tennis causes the ball to curve downwards. This allows players to impart considerable power to the ball, but instead of soaring off of the table, it will curve down and strike his opponent's side.

Top spin is applied by forcing the ball to spin end over end in an upward manner relative to the player who hit it. In other words, if you hit the ball with the label pointing straight at you, you would see the label move from the bottom of the ball to the top of the ball, and it would not move from left to right. This can be done with several strokes.

One way to impart top spin is to add a wrist flick to the standard stroke. This is a good, basic way to start.

An alternative to the above stroke is to push the ball. Instead of bringing the paddle back towards the body when finishing a stroke, a player would continue the forward movement, so that the paddle only moves in one direction, forward. This stroke has the advantage of being more easily learned for the backhand, which is more difficult with the other strokes.

Some players choose to only flick their wrists upward when hitting the ball. This has the advantage of being able to impart an insane amount of spin without hitting the ball extremely hard. However, it is also one of the more difficult ways to do it.

==Slice==
Slice, also known as backspin, is a powerful spin and can easily catch an opponent off guard. Sliced balls seem to float through the air, and never bounce as one would expect. The degree of spin affects what the ball will do when it hits the table. With less powerful spin, the ball will not bounce as far as a no-spin ball. With more powerful spin, the ball will either bounce straight up or backwards (toward the player who imparted the slice). However, it becomes more difficult to get the ball to hit the other side as the amount of slice imparted increases, since the more slice the ball has, the more it floats. When first learning slice, don't be surprised when most of your sliced balls float right off the end of the table. With practice you will gain control of the slice beast.

Almost all methods for imparting slice involve getting the paddle either entirely beneath or mostly beneath the ball and striking it so that it runs along the paddle while the paddle moves away from the player. Slice is called slice because the stroke it uses, for lack of a better word, slices at the ball. If correctly done, the label on the ball will move from top to bottom, and not left or right. if you hit the ball from the top the ball will go back up ward toward to you

==Side spin==
Side spin is very versatile. It is quite possible to use side spin on every shot in a rally and remain competitive, which is much harder to do with top spin and slice. Also, strokes for side spin are much easier to learn. The only action required is moving the paddle laterally when hitting the ball. When correctly done, the label on the ball will move either from left to right or right to left with no up or down movement. There are two methods of imparting side spin.
===Push===
Push side spin results from moving the paddle laterally away from your body when hitting the ball. Push side spin doesn't require you to impart as much speed to achieve the same amount of spin as pull side spin. The risk you run with push side spin is that you can hit the ball with the leading edge of your paddle instead of allowing it to glide across. The ball whizzes off with no hope of hitting anything but a spectator or wall.
===Pull===
Pull side spin can be extremely effective. Pull side spin results from moving the paddle laterally toward your body when hitting the ball. You must be selective when using it, because although it can generate insane amounts of spin, the speed of the ball increases with spin. With no top spin to get it down on the table, it can fly off the table quite easily. Practice is essential, because once you master it, your pull side spin shots will be fast and curve right past your opponent's paddle.

==Corkscrew spin==
First of all: This type of spin is almost exclusively seen at the highest level (world class) of play. Occasionally novices may hit it by accident when hitting a low (below the playing surface) ball. Corkscrew spin can be described as side spin turned on its head. This is '''the''' most powerful spin, and is accordingly the hardest to use, much less master. When hit correctly, a ball with right or left corkscrew spin will jump to the right or left (respectively) when it hits the table. And they '''jump'''. If the label is facing you when the ball is hit, the label will seem to rotate in the center, not moving up, down, left, or right.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ball placement is the basic factor that most influences the winner of a game. Mastering ball placement will make you the puppetmaster of players who have not mastered it. You can move them at will, forcing them to run from side to side, or lean back for a far shot then jump forward for a near shot. You can make your opponent catch the ball with his hand when you place your shot in a far corner that he ''knows'' won't make it (and this will happen). If you haven't gotten it yet, ball placement is very important.

==Bad placements==
Figuring out where not to hit the ball is just as important as placing those corner shots. This actually ties in with the section [[../Types_of_Player|Types of Player]]. Here's an exercise to help: Think of shots that you love to hit, forehand, backhand (not very common), or whatever. The odds are that your opponent likes at least a few of those shots too. '''Do not''' give those to your opponent. One shot that should be avoided at all costs is a medium-to-high-bouncing ball with no spin (you'll learn about that later) that is three-quarters of an arm's length away from your opponent. That's called asking for a slam.

==Good placements==
===Backhand vs. Forehand===
Most players prefer to hit balls on their forehand. That means that most players are likely to be less proficient hitting backhands than forehands. Therefore, hitting to your opponent's backhand is preferable to hitting to their forehand. This doesn't apply at all times. If you've just sent a ball to your opponent's far backhand, you might want to consider hitting to their far forehand once they return it.

===Body===
The vast majority, if not all, players dislike hitting balls near their body. This is a great thing to take advantage of. One thing to consider, is that the farther away a player is from the table, the less this dislike will affect their ability to return it. Of course, the opposite also applies. If you notice that your opponent is almost or actually touching the table with their body, the next shot you make should be directed towards his body and should hit the table as far back as you feel you can make it (don't go so far that it could go off the table). After this shot, you should back off the table since their return will either hit the net (very likely), hit your side far back with moderate power (a little likely), or go off the end (even less likely).

===Runaround===
A simple concept, and also used often in tennis, is hitting to alternating sides such that your opponent must use a considerable amount of energy to get to the balls. This is especially effective when playing in warm, humid weather in such venues as garages.

===Near vs. Far===
A variation on the runaround is to use the same alternating concept, but instead of forehand to backhand, you hit near to far (in relation to the net). Hitting a near shot right after a far shot can certainly throw your opponent off balance. If your opponent is able to return the near shot following the far shot, continue the cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Serving is pretty important, because it's the first thing you do in a point. This part of the guide focuses on the serve widely accepted in social play, ignoring the rules set for tournament play by the USATT. For the curious, tournament serving requires that the ball lays on the server's open palm, not moving, then must be thrown at least 16cm upwards (&quot;near vertical&quot;) and falls without touching anything before being hit.

=== The Service===
Most social players won't call any rules on you for serving, but there are some widely accepted guidelines. First, you can't bounce the ball before you hit it, you must have it in your hand and hit it before it touches anything else. It then hits your side once and then your opponent's side, clearing the net. If the ball hits the net but goes over (colloquially referred to as a ''netball''), a ''let'' is called and the server is allowed another try. If the ball hits the net and doesn't go over, a ''net'' is called and the receiver gets the point.

Basic strategy for beginning servers is all about control. Try to serve low over the net, but not at the expense of hitting the net more than necessary. Don't serve a high and short ball that bounces vertically, because you give the other player a chance to slam it right back at you, with minimal chance of a return.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Feigning is an excellent technique, and when used sparingly will almost always catch your opponent off guard. The great thing about feigning is that it can be applied to almost everything in this Wikibook so far.

==Feigning Placement==
===Service===
A basic, but very effective, feign is the placement of your service. Very few players will look at your paddle to determine where the shot will go. Absolutely critical to making the feign believable is your eyes. You '''must''' look at where you want your opponent to think the shot is going to go. Also important, but usually only caught by players who have had feigns used on them for a while, is not interrupting your service routine. Don't change anything, and your opponent won't know when to expect a feign.
===Rally===
Rally feigning is a bit different from service feigning. It is more versatile, however. A common feign is used when performing the [[../Ball_Placement#Good_Placements|runaround]]. After settling into the forehand-backhand pattern, interrupt it by hitting to the same side (instead of the opposite side) that your opponent returned from. This works flawlessly on unanticipating opponents.

==Feigning Spin==
Feigning spin is more complicated than feigning placement. First, your opponent must be advanced enough to recognize spin. If you can convince your opponent that you ''always'' spin, you can win critical points by not spinning the shot. They will anticipate the spin and either completely miss the ball or miss the sweet spot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The earliest era in Egyptian history is called the '''Predynastic''' period. The neolithic ended in Egypt around 4400 BCE with the appearance of the Amratian culture in Upper Egypt. The Amratians buried their dead in communal cemeteries in the desert, and showed signs of caring about the fate of the dead by such actions as covering the bodies with mats. In Lower Egypt, the Maadi culture developed around 4000 CE, about the same time that the Amratians underwent significant changes, evolving into or being replaced by the Gerzean culture. The Gerzeans continued to bury their dead in the desert, while the Maadi placed their dead in burial mounds. All three cultures produced distinctive pottery, which has helped Egyptologists to identify where and when each culture was active. Around 3200 BCE, a group from Upper Egypt came to dominate the whole country, which Egyptologists designate as Dynasty 0. The burial of the Dynasty 0 ruler King Scorpion shows signs of the formation of Pharaonic civilization. Tags that served as an inventory of King Scorpion's funerary goods are the earliest known example of a writing system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Saqqara BW 5.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Step Pyramid of Djoser, designed by the architect Imhotep. When completed the Step Pyramid was by far the largest building ever constructed.]]

The '''Old Kingdom''' began with the rise of the 5th dynasty. The Old Kingdom is marked by the construction of most of Egypt's pyramids, giving the first part of the Old Kingdom the name &quot;tha age of pyramids.&quot; The architect Imhotep designed the first pyramid&amp;mdash;the Step Pyramid&amp;mdash;for Pharaoh Djoser at Saqqara. Larger than any building to have built before it, the Step Pyramid is not a true pyramid, but rather a series of platforms stacked on top of each other, with the smallest level at the top and the largest on the bottom. Djoser's successor Snefru constructed three pyramids at Dashur; the third pyramid&amp;mdash;the pink
 Pyramid&amp;mdash;became the first true pyramid to be completed. The greatest pyramids were constructed by the fourth dynasty at Giza. The Giza complex includes the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Great Sphinx. 

These large projects could be constructed due to the mobilization of the whole country to serve the order of the pharaohs. The Old Kingdom ended due to a combination of the rising power of priesthoods and nobility, and a dry period in which the Nile failed to flood annually for several years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Middle Kingdom''' period of Egyptian history is characterized by a powerful noble class and similarly powerful priesthoods of several prominent gods jockeying for power.  The Middle Kingdom collapsed when a group of outside invaders called the ''Hyksos'' invaded Egypt using chariots, horses and iron.  The Hyksos established their own monarchy and controlled Lower Egypt for approximately 200 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''New Kingdom''' period of Egyptian history commenced with the uprising of Pharaoh Ahmose, who used the Hyksos technologies of chariots, horses and iron against the outside invaders, and re-conquered Lower Egypt.  The New Kingdom's pharaohs were powerful compared with their authority in the Middle Kingdom, but still had to balance their wills against both priesthoods and nobility.  A rising middle class also appeared in Egypt, and the idea of a universal afterlife (and acceptance of mummification for all social classes) took hold throughout the country.  No pyramids were constructed during this age, since the nobles and the temples had building projects of their own which competed with royal building.  However, the rock-cut tombs of the Valley of the Kings date to this period, including the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun.  Religious controversy also shattered the internal peace of Egypt several times, most notably during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten, who attempted to institute monotheism upon his subjects.

      <comment>/* Early Dynastic periods */ rv a confusing piece not fitting the context (saying Sumerian = Mesopotamia)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Sumer was a civilization located in the southern part of Mesopotamia (modern day southeastern Iraq) from the time of the earliest records in the mid 4th millennium BC until the rise of Babylonia in the late 3rd millennium BC. The term &quot;Sumerian&quot; applies to all speakers of the Sumerian language. Sumer is considered the first settled society in the world to have manifested all the features needed to qualify fully as a &quot;civilization&quot;.  Settlements such as Ur and Uruk were the first to arise on Earth which could qualify as ''cities'', where the majority of inhabitants were engaged in pursuits other than agriculture, supported by the surplus food production of surrounding lands.

Sumer was a favorable location for a civilization to arise.  Watered by the annual floods of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the rich soil of the region, combined with the warm climate, offered farmers a long growing season and high productivity.  Sumer also lay at a confluence of trade routes -- the Persian Gulf offered access to Arabia and lands around the Indian Ocean, while the Tigris and Euphrates were natural highways leading north and west toward Anatolia and the Mediterranean Sea.  Since the first appearance of agriculture six millennia earlier, Mesopotamia had been home to a series of farming cultures of increasing number and sophistication.  As populations in the region rose, leaders organized communal labor to build irrigation systems and bring more land into production.  These efforts, which required coordination and record-keeping, most likely became the basis for the Sumerian state.

==Ubaid period==
[[Image:Frieze-group-3-example1.jpg|thumb|right|An example of Ubaid pottery]]
:ca. 5300 - 4000 BC

Saw the settlement of the first town in lower mesopotamia, Eridu, ca. 5300 BC, by a group which brought with them the Samarran culture from the north.

First settlement beyond the 5 inch rainfall isohyet - there was not enough rain to grow crops, but the water table was high enough to allow for manual irrigation of the rich alluvial soil - a project which was labor intensive and necessarily centrally coordinated.

Eridu was not the first city - well-known cities such as Jericho and Çatalhöyük already existed as year-round trading colonies or for seasonal protection.

Farming also existed, but was seasonal - when not farming, people continued to be mobile hunter-gatherers.

==Uruk period==
:ca. 4000-3000 BC
Archaeological sites show a gradual shift from fine quality pottery of the Ubaid period (which were often made with the help of a turntable),  to plain pottery mass-produced on a true fast potter's wheel. The technology used to make the fast potter's wheel would then be used for the mill-wheel and for vehicular wheels.

Ca. 3500, the need for record keeping led to the development of writing - starting with number symbols, pictograms were added to represent what was being counted. This quickly developed into a full logographic script to represent the full range of language, not just counted objects, and the ancient Egyptians and the ancient Elamites soon developed their own logographic writing systems. At first symbols were simple carved in a medium or drawn in clay. By the end of the millennium, a triangular stylus came into use to make impressions in clay, creating the characteristic cuneiform script. With the use of the stylus, symbols became more abstract.

==Jemdet Nasr period==
:ca. 3000-2900 BC
Archaeology shows the Jemdet Nasr period is followed by a layer of riverine sediment throughout the Sumerian area in lower Mesopotamia, indicating  what was probably a devastating flood event for the Sumerians. The Sumerian king list then picks up the &quot;kingship&quot; in Kish, far to the north.

==Early Dynastic periods==
:ca. 2900 - 2334 BC (short chronology)
Ca. 2600, the cuneiform symbols started being used to represent the sounds of individual word syllables, independent of cuneiform symbols' meanings. This syllabary would be adopted by the Akkadians, Eblaites and Elamites, and later by the Hittites and Uragitic speakers. This wide dissemination has allowed the cuneiform script, and the Sumerian language to be deciphered by modern linguists. The previously used logographic scripts, both Sumerian and Elamite, remain undeciphered, unlike the ancient Egyptian, which retained their logographic hieroglyphs well into the Hellenistic period. The Rosetta Stone, a text written in both hieroglyphs and in classical Greek was the key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Because Egyptian hieroglyphs had remained essentially the same since the beginning, we are able to read Egyptian texts going back to ca. 3100 BC. But for Sumer, the historical record only opens for us starting ca. 2600 BC, when the syllabary came into use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Akkad was a city that came to dominate the region of northern  Mesopotamia, situated on the west bank of the Euphrates. It reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, before the rise of Babylonia. The Akkadians were recognized as gifted warriors for their time, this reputation was probably attained for the Akkadians after the numerous conquests launched by King Sargon, who built the world's first empire.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assyria in earliest historical times referred to a region on the Upper Tigris river, named for its original capital, the ancient city of Assur. Later, as a nation and Empire, it also came to include roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia.

The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the Old, Middle, and Neo-Assyrian kingdoms, or periods. The most powerful and best-known nation of these periods is the Neo-Assyrian kingdom, 911-612 BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parthia was a civilization situated in the northeast of modern Iran, but at its height covering all of Iran, Mesoptamia, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, and Central Asia. Led by the Arsacid dynasty, reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the Greek Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late 3rd century BC, and intermittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca 150 BC and 224 AD. It was the second native dynasty of ancient Iran (Persia). Parthia (mostly due to their invention of heavy cavalry) was the arch-enemy of the Roman Empire in the east; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond central Anatolia.

The Parthian empire lasted four centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. After the Scythian-Parni nomads (Assyrians called them Ashkuz) had settled in Parthia and had built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king Mithradates the Great. The end of this loosely organized empire came in 224 AD, when the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the Sassanid dynasty. The Parthins in battle were noted for the use of the so called Partian arrow. This being in retret from the enemy they would losse an arrow at the enemy. Thus a parting shot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

== ROM ==

One type of memory that is as cheap as it is useless is Read-Only Memory (ROM). I say that it is useless because you can program it once, and then you can never change the data that is on it. This makes it useless because you can't upgrade the information on the ROM chip (be it program code or data), you can't fix it if there is an error, etc.... Because of this, they are usually called &quot;Programmable Read-Only Memory&quot; (PROM), because you can program it once, but then you can't change it at all.

=== EPROM ===

In contrast to PROM is EPROM (&quot;Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory&quot;). EPROM chips will have a little window, made of either glass or quartz that can be used to erase the memory on the chip. To erase an EPROM, the window needs to be uncovered (they usually have some sort of guard or cover), and the EPROM needs to be exposed to UV radiation to erase the memory, and allow it to be reprogrammed.

=== EEPROM ===

A step up from EPROM is EEPROM (&quot;Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory&quot;). EEPROM can be erased by exposing it to an electrical charge. This means that EEPROM can be erased in circuit (as opposed to EPROM, which needs to be removed from the circuit, and exposed to UV). An appropriate electrical charge will erase the entire chip, so you can't erase just certain data items at a time.

Many modern micrcontroller have an EEPROM section on-booard, which can be used to permanently store system parameters or calibration values. These are often referred to as non-volatile memory (NVM). They can be accessed - read and write - as single bytes or blocks of bytes. Like Flash memory EEPROM allows only a limited number of write cycles, usually several ten-thousand. 

Write access to on-board NVM tends to be considerably slower than RAM. Embedded software must take this into account and &quot;queue&quot; write requests to be executed in background.

== RAM ==

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a temporary, volatile memory that requires a persistant electric current to maintain information. As such, a RAM chip will not store data when you turn the power OFF. RAM is more expensive than ROM, and it is  often at a premium: Embedded systems can have many Kbytes of ROM (sometimes Megabytes or more), but often they have less than 100 '''bytes''' of RAM available for use in program flow.

== FLASH Memory ==

Flash memory is a combination of the best parts of RAM and ROM. Like ROM, Flash memory can hold data when the power is turned off. Like RAM, Flash can be reprogrammed electrically, in whole or in part, at any time during program execution.

Flash memory modules are only good for a limited number of Read/Write cycles, which means that they can burn out if you use them too much, too often. As such, Flash memory is better used to store persistant data, and RAM should be used to store volatile data items.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Determining what type of player your opponent is can help you make good decisions, most importantly, [[../Shot_Placement|shot placement]]. If you have a group of people that you play with, it should be easy to recall the strengths and weaknesses of each. When playing against a new opponent, it should be your priority to determine what kind of player they are.

==Aggressive or Defensive==
This is the basic divide in table tennis players, and can usually be easily determined. There are many indicators of aggressiveness or defensiveness. Does your opponent seem to crowd the table even when shots are flying quickly? That's an aggressive stance and you can expect fast returns, which can go into the net or on your side. Defensive players tend to just get the ball back, waiting for their opponents to make mistakes. Defensive players tend to not slam balls, and some extremists refuse to slam even when there is almost no chance of missing. Good players can shift their style of play, just as no basketball team plays offense all the time. When a chronically defensive player and a chronically aggressive player play, the defensive player will find himself standing far from the table, returning the blazing shots the aggressive player is making. Either one could win, taking advantage of weaknesses (with shot placement) could win the game.

==Forehand, Backhand, or Both==
This is pretty straightforward and easy to determine. Left-handed players can throw a wrench into the works, though. Simply, does your opponent use energy to favor forehand or backhand, or does he hit both with no real preference to either? If they favor one or the other, use [[../Shot_Placement|shot placement]] to take advantage of their weaker side.

== Site structure ==

Usually best practice is to create separate branche for each language like:

Root
*en
**en-pages
*se
**se-pages
*dk
**dk-pages

By using dictionary items, templates and some xslt, most of the functionality built for one language is easily available for other languages. 
 
Pros:
- flexibility, sites can really be different and still share mutual resources
- easy assignment of user rights for nodes

Cons:
- sometimes sharing of resources, like media files, will become a mess.
Consider case when you have 5 languages and documentation in 2, which you want to share depending on language.  
 

One other option is to use multiple tabs in your text pages, one tab for each language and change body content depending on a language variable (might be the active sub-domain).

The draw-back (or advantage) with this second solution is that all editors will be able to change all languages since you can't restrict access to different tabs in umbraco.
Another one might be that your menu XSLT's will become a bit complex if 
you have to check if the language exists for each node you want to 
display...

== Language specific char in page names ==
Umbraco can handle language specific characters so that you do not have them in page names.
Like in Icelandic we have ð and þ among others. http://yourdomain.com/þaðan.aspx would become http://yourdomain.com/thadan.aspx if configured correctly.
Umbraco handles spaces dots and danish char by default. To ad yours modify umbracosettings.xml from the config folder, find the &lt;urlReplacing&gt;&lt;/urlReplacing&gt; section and add your char to it. Like &lt;char org=&quot;þ&quot;&gt;th&lt;/char&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Page titles ==
It looks like you guys have been making some pages without knowing the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. It then appears you discovered the policy and have been moving content to comply with the policy. This is great. I would ask, however, that you keep track of the old page titles, so the administrators can delete them. You might keep a list on this talk page, or over at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. Thanks for helping us keep the site clean. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

== Structure ==
When I came across this book, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Training_Best_Practices&amp;oldid=1353505 it was] just a list of loosely bound and wide ranging topics. Many were links to non-existent pages &amp;mdash; which is fine as long as they form a structure to which content will be added.

Others were stubs that contributed little or nothing or overly specific ones that only the original author can finish. I've tried weeding this a bit, but there is still a lot of work to be done before this book lives up to its potential.

Happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:39, 12 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>[[Statics:Three-Dimensional Equilibrium]] moved to [[Statics/Three-Dimensional Equilibrium]]: fixed NC</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are six equations expressing the equilibrium of a rigid body in 3 dimensions.

Sum of Forces: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{}^{} F_x=0&lt;/math&gt;,        &lt;math&gt;\sum_{}^{} F_y=0&lt;/math&gt;,        &lt;math&gt;\sum_{}^{} F_z=0&lt;/math&gt;

Sum of Moments: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{}^{} M_x=0&lt;/math&gt;,        &lt;math&gt;\sum_{}^{} M_y=0&lt;/math&gt;,        &lt;math&gt;\sum_{}^{} M_z=0&lt;/math&gt;

To solve three dimensional statics problems:
*Resolve force components 
*Resolve moments about a point
*Resolve moments about a line or axis. See [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/scalar_triple_product Scalar Triple Product]

Knowing how to find the Determinate of a matrix can help alot here.

Thank you for your pronunciation uploads. Often users copy old audio files to new file names as tests, so it was a pleasant surprise to hear a new voice. One question I have is regarding your pronunciation of &quot;sympa.&quot; I was taught that it was pronounced as &quot;s'''ah'''mpah&quot;, rather than with a hard e. Is that wrong? Again, thank you for your contributions.

{{Neapolitan}}

===Final vowel sounds===
Neapolitan words can end either stressed (with an accent mark) or unstressed. As a general rule, words ending with a stressed vowel (called &quot;acute&quot; words) have the last vowel pronounced.

The ends of many unstressed words are pronounced as a schwa ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa ə]); that is, it sounds as if the final vowel is being swallowed. This has lead to Neapolitan often being written with many words ending in consonants followed by an apostrophe- 
*''facenn&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''facenno'' (&quot;doing&quot;), ''sacc&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''saccio''  (&quot;I know&quot;) etc.. 

Generally, all words ending in &quot;a&quot; have the last vowel pronounced, though less strongly than as would be the case in Italian.
*''còzzeca'' (&quot;mussel&quot;), ''varca'' (&quot;boat&quot;), ''mammà'' (&quot;mother&quot;).

===The &quot;d&quot; and &quot;c&quot; situation===
The letter &quot;d&quot; is often pronounced as an &quot;r&quot;, such as ''r&quot;o'' for ''d&quot;o'' (&quot;of the&quot; or '&quot;from the&quot;) or ''arrò'' for ''addò'' (&quot;where&quot;).  Similarly, the letter &quot;c&quot; is often pronounced as a soft &quot;g&quot; sound, as in the English &quot;god&quot;.  For example, ''ncoppa'' (&quot;on&quot;) is frequently heard as ''ngoppa''.
As a result of this difference between the classical written word and the spoken one, words are often written straight out with an &quot;r&quot; or a &quot;g&quot; rather than the traditional &quot;d&quot; or &quot;c&quot;.  This can be the cause of some confusion.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why learn Uyghur?

* '''To support the Uyghur people.''' Learning a different language is a way to share in the culture of the people who speak it. It is one of the best ways to break down the fear and stereotypes that result from ignorance. With the Uyghur name most commonly being associated with terrorists since 2001, it is a timely decision.
* '''To directly stand by your belief in the value of linguistic diversity.''' Even in Xinjiang, Uyghur schools full of Uyghur children are increasingly teaching directly in Han Chinese (Mandarin). Uyghur people are learning their own language as if it was a foreign one. Even Xinjiang University now teaches all its courses in Han Chinese. There are some ten million Uyghur speakers and it is unlikely to become extinct in our lifetime, but if the treatment and attitude towards it continue, it may well become endangered. 
* '''To get an edge over your fellow polyglots.''' If you can speak Uyghur you will be able to quickly learn several related languages of central Asia. These languages are rarely spoken in the Western world and will definitely &quot;value-add&quot; in a global job-market more than French or Spanish!

Why is this Wikibook necessary?
The only resources that exist to learn Uyghur in English are:
* [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0914584898/103-7938061-5102268?v=glance&amp;n=283155 An Uyghur-English Dictionary] by Henry Shwarz (1992 - no Arabic script)
* [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0295970154/ref=ed_oe_h/103-7938061-5102268?%5Fencoding=UTF8 Spoken Uyghur] by Reinhard Hahn (1991)
* [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0864424191/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_2/103-7938061-5102268?%5Fencoding=UTF8 Lonely Planet Central Asia Phrasebook]by Justin Jon Rudelson (1998)

It's pretty unbelievable that the most recent book to learn Uyghur is a travel phrasebook that is not even solely focused on Uyghur... and it's almost a decade old!

There are more substantial resources available in Chinese and even Russian to learn Uyghur. But for English? Nada. Creating and using this Wikibook is a great opportunity to encourage more people to learn Uyghur (or just learn about it). Because Wikibooks is available under the GNU Free Documentation License, it can easily be copied and distributed (for free, a nominal cost, or whatever you want to charge!) without worry about breaking copyright.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since WebObjects make use of JDBC to connect to the Oracle server, it is fully compliant with Oracle 9i and 10g (and 8i for the most).

Last year (2005), a quite huge WebObjects deployment (40 XServes) has been demoed in combination with Oracle 10g RAC (Real Application Cluster).
Press release: 
http://www.oracle.com/global/eu/pressreleases/10gonmac.html

What was interesting is that the standard WebObjects deployment is clustered-like, and so is 10g in its RAC version. The performances and the load-handling were quite impressive.




PS: Would you like more info on WebObjects + 10g RAC, you are more than welcome to drop a question at http://www.intelli-core.com. Probably, your Oracle rep will welcome you, too ;-)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Babylace.  These are the requirements for the Knot Tying honor rather than the Physical Fitness honor.  I'm going to move this over to where it belongs.

Also, the main page of this book indicates that we're specifying the requirements as adopted by the NAD.  The ones you've outlined here are slightly different fro mthe latest version adopted by the NAD.

The easiest way to get the requirements in is by downloading them from http://www.pathfindersonline.org/html/honors/honors_ay_manual.htm and then cut and paste them from Adobe into the edit window and add the markup.  It's a lot easier to add the markup than it is to re-type all the requirements.

I surround each requirement with a &lt;no wiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt; and surround sub-requirements with &lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

The other thing I do when outlining the requirements is use the &quot;honor_header&quot; template I developed at the beginning:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
=Honor Name=
{{honor_header|skilllevel|year introduced|notes}}
== 1. Requirement one.==
=== a. first sub-requirement===
=== b. second sub-requirement===
== 2. Requirement two.==
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Again, thanks for your help on this project.  It is very much appreciated.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Cuisine of Peru]]

==Ingredients==

* 1 lb (500g) [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|pallares]] (large lima beans)
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 2-3 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Vinegar|white vinegar]]
* 1 spoonful [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|red onion]], finely diced
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* a few sprigs of [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]

==Procedure==

# Soak one pound of pallares (large lima beans) overnight or at least 6 hours. Change water two or three times.
# Boil the beans (without salt) with enough water to cover them. Use high heat until water reaches boiling point. Skim and reduce your fire. Simmer for about 1 hour. No exact timing is possible, since cooking time depends on the dryness of the beans. 
# When the beans are plump and tender, take them off the heat and drain. You might reserve the boiling liquid to process leftovers into a soup.
# Season the beans lightly with salt (kosher works great) and, while the beans cool down, prepare your vinaigrette.
# Mix one cup of olive oil, two or three spoonfuls of white vinegar, one spoonful of Dijon mustard, salt and pepper to taste, one finely diced small red onion, and two diced seeded tomatoes. 
# About half to one hour later, once the beans are at room temperature, check the seasoning of the vinaigrette. It should taste a bit stronger than expected. 
# Carefully mix the vinaigrette with the beans. Finely cut a few sprigs of parsley and mix again. 
# Reserve some more parsley for decoration, and voila!

In this chapter, we will present some very diverse examples of monads being used for practical tasks. Consider it as bonus material, and go through it at your own pace. You can always come back later if some parts (e.g. the final example about concurrency) seem too alien right now.

In the previous chapters, we saw how monads were used for IO, and started working more extensively with some of the more rudimentary monads like &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;.  Now let us try something quintessentially &quot;practical&quot;: writing a simple parser. Monads provide a clean way of embedding a domain specific parsing language directly into Haskell without the need for external tools or code generators. For a brief and accessible presentation of the subject, we suggest the paper [http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/223/1/pearl.pdf Functional Pearls: Monadic Parsing in Haskell], by Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer. Right now, however, is time to get our hands dirty; and for that we will be using the [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.1 Parsec] library, version 3 or greater.

We need an extension for this code: FlexibleContexts. This allows us to write class constraints such as &lt;code&gt;(Stream s u Char) =&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where one of the type variables is defined instead of polymorphic.

 {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}

Start by adding this line to the import section:

 import Control.Monad
 import Control.Monad.Identity (Identity)
 import System.Environment (getArgs)
 import Text.Parsec hiding (spaces)

This makes the Parsec library functions and getArgs available to us, except the &quot;spaces&quot; function, whose name conflicts with a function that we'll be defining later. In addition, the Identity monad is made available so that we can use ParsecT on Identity.

Now, we'll define a parser that recognizes one of the symbols allowed in Scheme identifiers:

 
 symbol :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m Char
 symbol = oneOf &quot;!#$%&amp;amp;|*+-/:&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;?@^_~&quot;

This is another example of a monad: in this case, the &quot;extra information&quot; that is being hidden is all the info about position in the input stream, backtracking record, first and follow sets, etc. Parsec 3 uses a monad transformer to take care of all of that for us. We need only use the Parsec library function oneOf (see [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.1/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Char.html Text.Parsec.Char]), and it'll recognize a single one of any of the characters in the string passed to it. And as you're about to see, you can compose primitive parsers into more sophisticated productions.

The type of the function is somewhat confusing. Stream s m Char defines a &quot;stream&quot; of Char's of type s, wrapped around monad m. Examples are of s would be String or ByteString. Accommodating both String and ByteString is the main reason for defining our function to be polymorphic around String. Parsec contains a type called Parser, but its not as polymorphic as we would normally like - it explicitly requires a stream type of String.

ParsecT defines a parser for a stream type s, state type u (we don't really need to use state, but its useful to define our functions to be polymorphic on state), inner monad m (usually Identity if we don't want to use it as a transformer) and result type Char, which is the &quot;normal&quot; type argument to Monads.

Let's define a function to call our parser and handle any possible errors:

 
 readExpr :: Stream s Identity Char =&amp;gt; s -&amp;gt; String
 readExpr input = case parse symbol &quot;lisp&quot; input of
     Left err -&amp;gt; &quot;No match: &quot; ++ show err
     Right val -&amp;gt; &quot;Found value&quot;

As you can see from the type signature, readExpr is a function (-&amp;gt;) from a Stream (String or ByteString, most of the time) to a String. We name the parameter &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;, and pass it, along with the &lt;code&gt;symbol&lt;/code&gt; action we defined above and the name of the parser (&quot;lisp&quot;), to the Parsec function [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/parsec/3.1.1/doc/html/Text-Parsec-Prim.html#v:parse parse].

Parse can return either the parsed value or an error, so we need to handle the error case. Following typical Haskell convention, Parsec returns an [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html#$tEither Either] data type, using the Left constructor to indicate an error and the Right one for a normal value.

We use a &lt;code&gt;case...of&lt;/code&gt; construction to match the result of &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; against these alternatives. If we get a Left value (error), then we bind the error itself to &lt;code&gt;err&lt;/code&gt; and return &quot;No match&quot; with the string representation of the error. If we get a Right value, we bind it to &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt;, ignore it, and return the string &quot;Found value&quot;.

The &lt;code&gt;case...of&lt;/code&gt; construction is an example of pattern matching, which we will see in much greater detail [evaluator1.html#primitiveval later on].

Finally, we need to change our main function to call readExpr and print out the result:

 
 main :: IO ()
 main = do args &amp;lt;- getArgs
           putStrLn &lt;span class=&quot;changed_code&quot;&gt;(readExpr (args !! 0))&lt;/span&gt;

To compile and run this, you need to specify &quot;-package parsec -package mtl&quot; on the command line, or else there will be link errors. For example:

 
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ghc -package parsec -o simple_parser [../code/listing3.1.hs listing3.1.hs]
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser $
 Found value
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser a
 No match: &quot;lisp&quot; (line 1, column 1):
 unexpected &quot;a&quot;

=== Whitespace ===

Next, we'll add a series of improvements to our parser that'll let it recognize progressively more complicated expressions. The current parser chokes if there's whitespace preceding our symbol:

 
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;   %&quot;
 No match: &quot;lisp&quot; (line 1, column 1):
 unexpected &quot; &quot;

Let's fix that, so that we ignore whitespace.

First, let's define a parser that recognizes any number of whitespace characters. Incidentally, this is why we included the &quot;hiding (spaces)&quot; clause when we imported Parsec: there's already a function &quot;[http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#spaces spaces]&quot; in that library, but it doesn't quite do what we want it to. (For that matter, there's also a parser called [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#lexeme lexeme] that does exactly what we want, but we'll ignore that for pedagogical purposes.)

 
 spaces :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m ()
 spaces = skipMany1 space

Just as functions can be passed to functions, so can actions. Here we pass the Parser action [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#space space] to the Parser action [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#skipMany1 skipMany1], to get a Parser that will recognize one or more spaces.

Now, let's edit our parse function so that it uses this new parser:

 
 readExpr input = case parse &lt;span class=&quot;changed_code&quot;&gt;(spaces &amp;gt;&amp;gt; symbol)&lt;/span&gt; &quot;lisp&quot; input of
     Left err -&amp;gt; &quot;No match: &quot; ++ show err
     Right val -&amp;gt; &quot;Found value&quot;

We touched briefly on the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (&quot;then&quot;) operator in lesson 1, where we mentioned that it was used behind the scenes to combine the lines of a do-block. Here, we use it explicitly to combine our whitespace and symbol parsers. However, then has completely different semantics in the Parser and IO monads. In the Parser monad, then means &quot;Attempt to match the first parser, then attempt to match the second with the remaining input, and fail if either fails.&quot; In general, then will have wildly different effects in different monads; it's intended as a general way to structure computations, and so needs to be general enough to accommodate all the different types of computations. Read the documentation for the monad to figure out precisely what it does.

Compile and run this code. Note that since we defined spaces in terms of skipMany1, it will no longer recognize a plain old single character. Instead you ''have to'' precede a symbol with some whitespace. We'll see how this is useful shortly:

 
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ghc -package parsec -o simple_parser [../code/listing3.2.hs listing3.2.hs]
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;   %&quot; Found value
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser %
 No match: &quot;lisp&quot; (line 1, column 1):
 unexpected &quot;%&quot;
 expecting space
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;   abc&quot;
 No match: &quot;lisp&quot; (line 1, column 4):
 unexpected &quot;a&quot;
 expecting space

=== Return Values ===

Right now, the parser doesn't ''do'' much of anything - it just tells us whether a given string can be recognized or not. Generally, we want something more out of our parsers: we want them to convert the input into a data structure that we can traverse easily. In this section, we learn how to define a data type, and how to modify our parser so that it returns this data type.

First, we need to define a data type that can hold any Lisp value:

 
 data LispVal = Atom String
              | List [LispVal]
              | DottedList [LispVal] LispVal
              | Number Integer
              | String String
              | Bool Bool

This is an example of an ''algebraic data type''&lt;nowiki&gt;: it defines a set of possible values that a variable of type LispVal can hold. Each alternative (called a &lt;/nowiki&gt;''constructor'' and separated by |) contains a tag for the constructor along with the type of data that that constructor can hold. In this example, a LispVal can be:

# An &lt;span class=&quot;inline_code&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/span&gt;, which stores a String naming the atom
# A &lt;span class=&quot;inline_code&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;, which stores a list of other LispVals (Haskell lists are denoted by brackets)
# A &lt;span class=&quot;inline_code&quot;&gt;DottedList&lt;/span&gt;, representing the Scheme form &lt;span class=&quot;inline_lisp&quot;&gt;(a b . c)&lt;/span&gt;. This stores a list of all elements but the last, and then stores the last element as another field
# A &lt;span class=&quot;inline_code&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;, containing a Haskell Integer
# A &lt;span class=&quot;inline_code&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;, containing a Haskell String
# A &lt;span class=&quot;inline_code&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;, containing a Haskell boolean value

Constructors and types have different namespaces, so you can have both a constructor named String and a type named String. Both types and constructor tags always begin with capital letters.

Next, let's add a few more parsing functions to create values of these types. A string is a double quote mark, followed by any number of non-quote characters, followed by a closing quote mark:

 
 parseString :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseString = do char '&quot;'
                  x &amp;lt;- many (noneOf &quot;\&quot;&quot;)
                  char '&quot;'
                  return $ String x

We're back to using the do-notation instead of the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; operator. This is because we'll be retrieving the value of our parse (returned by [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#many many] ([http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#noneOf noneOf] &quot;\&quot;&quot;)) and manipulating it, interleaving some other parse operations in the meantime. In general, use &amp;gt;&amp;gt; if the actions don't return a value, &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= if you'll be immediately passing that value into the next action, and do-notation otherwise.

Once we've finished the parse and have the Haskell String returned from &lt;code&gt;many&lt;/code&gt;, we apply the String constructor (from our LispVal data type) to turn it into a LispVal. Every constructor in an algebraic data type also acts like a function that turns its arguments into a value of its type. It also serves as a pattern that can be used in the left-hand side of a pattern-matching expression; we saw an example of this in [#symbols Lesson 3.1] when we matched our parser result against the two constructors in the Either data type.

We then apply the built-in function [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html#$tMonad return] to lift our LispVal into the Parser monad. Remember, each line of a do-block must have the same type, but the result of our String constructor is just a plain old LispVal. Return lets us wrap that up in a Parser action that consumes no input but returns it as the inner value. Thus, the whole parseString action will have type Parser LispVal.

The $ operator is infix function application: it's the same as if we'd written &lt;code&gt;return (String x)&lt;/code&gt;, but $ is right-associative, letting us eliminate some parentheses. Since $ is an operator, you can do anything with it that you'd normally do to a function: pass it around, partially apply it, etc. In this respect, it functions like the Lisp function [http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-9.html#%_sec_6.4 apply].

Now let's move on to Scheme variables. An [http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-5.html#%_sec_2.1 atom] is a letter or symbol, followed by any number of letters, digits, or symbols:

 
 parseAtom :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseAtom = do first &amp;lt;- letter &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; symbol
                rest &amp;lt;- many (letter &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; digit &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; symbol)
                let atom = [first] ++ rest
                return $ case atom of 
                           &quot;#t&quot; -&amp;gt; Bool True
                           &quot;#f&quot; -&amp;gt; Bool False
                           otherwise -&amp;gt; Atom atom

Here, we introduce another Parsec combinator, the choice operator [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#or &amp;lt;|&amp;gt;]. This tries the first parser, then if it fails, tries the second. If either succeeds, then it returns the value returned by that parser. The first parser must fail before it consumes any input: we'll see later how to implement backtracking.

Once we've read the first character and the rest of the atom, we need to put them together. The &quot;let&quot; statement defines a new variable &quot;atom&quot;. We use the list concatenation operator ++ for this. Recall that &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; is just a single character, so we convert it into a singleton list by putting brackets around it. If we'd wanted to create a list containing many elements, we need only separate them by commas.

Then we use a case statement to determine which LispVal to create and return, matching against the literal strings for true and false. The &lt;code&gt;otherwise&lt;/code&gt; alternative is a readability trick: it binds a variable named &lt;code&gt;otherwise&lt;/code&gt;, whose value we ignore, and then always returns the value of &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt;.

Finally, we create one more parser, for numbers. This shows one more way of dealing with monadic values:

 
 parseNumber :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseNumber = liftM (Number . read) $ many1 digit

It's easiest to read this backwards, since both function application ($) and function composition (.) associate to the right. The parsec combinator [http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#many1 many1] matches one or more of its argument, so here we're matching one or more digits. We'd like to construct a number LispVal from the resulting string, but we have a few type mismatches. First, we use the built-in function [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html#$vread read] to convert that string into a number. Then we pass the result to Number to get a LispVal. The function composition operator &quot;.&quot; creates a function that applies its right argument and then passes the result to the left argument, so we use that to combine the two function applications.

Unfortunately, the result of &lt;code&gt;many1 digit&lt;/code&gt; is actually a Parser String, so our combined &lt;code&gt;Number . read&lt;/code&gt; still can't operate on it. We need a way to tell it to just operate on the value inside the monad, giving us back a Parser LispVal. The standard function &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; does exactly that, so we apply liftM to our &lt;code&gt;Number . read&lt;/code&gt; function, and then apply the result of that to our Parser.

This style of programming - relying heavily on function composition, function application, and passing functions to functions - is very common in Haskell code. It often lets you express very complicated algorithms in a single line, breaking down intermediate steps into other functions that can be combined in various ways. Unfortunately, it means that you often have to read Haskell code from right-to-left and keep careful track of the types. We'll be seeing many more examples throughout the rest of the tutorial, so hopefully you'll get pretty comfortable with it.

Let's create a parser that accepts either a string, a number, or an atom:

 
 parseExpr :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseExpr = parseAtom
         &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; parseString
         &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; parseNumber

And edit readExpr so it calls our new parser:

 
 readExpr :: String -&amp;gt; String
 readExpr input = case parse &lt;span class=&quot;changed_code&quot;&gt;parseExpr&lt;/span&gt; &quot;lisp&quot; input of
     Left err -&amp;gt; &quot;No match: &quot; ++ show err
     Right _ -&amp;gt; &quot;Found value&quot;

Compile and run this code, and you'll notice that it accepts any number, string, or symbol, but not other strings:

 
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ghc -package parsec -o simple_parser [.../code/listing3.3.hs listing3.3.hs]

# Rewrite parseNumber using

Change parseString so that \&quot; gives a literal quote character instead of terminating the string. You may want to replace &lt;code&gt;noneOf &quot;\&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; with a new parser action that accepts ''either'' a non-quote character ''or'' a backslash followed by a quote mark.

For the others, you can define compound types that represent eg. a Rational as a numerator and denominator, or a Complex as a real and imaginary part (each itself a Real number).
}}

=== Recursive Parsers: Adding lists, dotted lists, and quoted datums ===

Next, we add a few more parser actions to our interpreter. Start with the parenthesized lists that make Lisp famous:

 
 parseList :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseList = liftM List $ sepBy parseExpr spaces

This works analogously to parseNumber, first parsing a series of expressions separated by whitespace (&lt;code&gt;sepBy parseExpr spaces&lt;/code&gt;) and then apply the List constructor to it within the Parser monad. Note too that we can pass parseExpr to [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#sepBy sepBy], even though it's an action we wrote ourselves.

The dotted-list parser is somewhat more complex, but still uses only concepts that we're already familiar with:

 
 parseDottedList :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseDottedList = do
     head &amp;lt;- endBy parseExpr spaces
     tail &amp;lt;- char '.' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; spaces &amp;gt;&amp;gt; parseExpr
     return $ DottedList head tail

Note how we can sequence together a series of Parser actions with &amp;gt;&amp;gt; and then use the whole sequence on the right hand side of a do-statement. The expression &lt;code&gt;char '.' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; spaces&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;Parser ()&lt;/code&gt;, then combining that with parseExpr gives a Parser LispVal, exactly the type we need for the do-block.

Next, let's add support for the single-quote syntactic sugar of Scheme:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 parseQuoted :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseQuoted = do
     char '\''
     x &amp;lt;- parseExpr
     return $ List [Atom &quot;quote&quot;, x]
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Most of this is fairly familiar stuff: it reads a single quote character, reads an expression and binds it to x, and then returns &lt;code&gt;(quote x)&lt;/code&gt;, to use Scheme notation. The Atom constructor works like an ordinary function: you pass it the String you're encapsulating, and it gives you back a LispVal. You can do anything with this LispVal that you normally could, like put it in a list.

Finally, edit our definition of parseExpr to include our new parsers:

 
 parseExpr :: Stream s m Char =&amp;gt; ParsecT s u m LispVal
 parseExpr = parseAtom
         &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; parseString
         &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; parseNumber
         &lt;span class=&quot;changed_code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;|&amp;gt; parseQuoted
         &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; do char '('
                x &amp;lt;- (try parseList) &amp;lt;|&amp;gt; parseDottedList
                char ')'
                return x&lt;/span&gt;

This illustrates one last feature of Parsec: backtracking. parseList and parseDottedList recognize identical strings up to the dot; this breaks the requirement that a choice alternative may not consume any input before failing. The [http://research.microsoft.com/users/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#try try] combinator attempts to run the specified parser, but if it fails, it backs up to the previous state. This lets you use it in a choice alternative without interfering with the other alternative.

Compile and run this code:

 
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ghc -package parsec -o simple_parser [../code/listing3.4.hs listing3.4.hs]
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;(a test)&quot;

 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;(a (nested) test)&quot; Found value

 Found value
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;(a '(quoted (dotted . list)) test)&quot;
 Found value
 debian:/home/jdtang/haskell_tutorial/code# ./simple_parser &quot;(a '(imbalanced parens)&quot;
 No match: &quot;lisp&quot; (line 1, column 24):
 unexpected end of input
 expecting space or &quot;)&quot;

Note that by referring to parseExpr within our parsers, we can nest them arbitrarily deep. Thus, we get a full Lisp reader with only a few definitions. That's the power of recursion.

You should end up with a parser that matches a string of expressions, and one that matches either nothing or a dot and a single expressions.

== Generic monads ==

:''Write me: The idea is that this section can show some of the benefits of not tying yourself to one single monad, but writing your code for any arbitrary monad m.  Maybe run with the idea of having some elementary monad, and then deciding it's not good enough, so replacing it with a fancier one... and then deciding you need to go even further and just plug in a monad transformer''

For instance: Using the Identity Monad:

&lt;pre&gt;
module Identity(Id(Id)) where
 
newtype Id a = Id a
instance Monad Id where
    (&gt;&gt;=) (Id x) f = f x
    return = Id

    show (Id x) = show x

&lt;pre&gt;
import Identity
type M = Id

my_fib :: Integer -&gt; M Integer
my_fib = my_fib_acc 0 1

my_fib_acc :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; M Integer
my_fib_acc _ fn1 1 = return fn1
my_fib_acc fn2 _ 0 = return fn2
my_fib_acc fn2 fn1 n_rem = do
    val &lt;- my_fib_acc fn1 (fn2+fn1) (n_rem - 1)
    return val
&lt;/pre&gt;

Doesn't seem to accomplish much, but it allows to you add debugging facilities to a part of your program on the fly.
As long as you've used return instead of explicit Id constructors, then you can drop in the following monad:

&lt;pre&gt;
module PMD (Pmd(Pmd)) where --PMD = Poor Man's Debugging, Now available for haskell

import IO

newtype Pmd a = Pmd (a, IO ())

instance Monad Pmd where
    (&gt;&gt;=)  (Pmd (x, prt)) f = let (Pmd (v, prt')) = f x 
                              in Pmd (v, prt &gt;&gt; prt')
    return x = Pmd (x, return ())

instance (Show a) =&amp;gt; Show (Pmd a) where
    show (Pmd (x, _) ) = show x
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we wanted to debug our Fibonacci program above, We could modify it as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
import Identity
import PMD
import IO
type M = Pmd
...
my_fib_acc :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; M Integer
my_fib_acc _ fn1 1 = return fn1
my_fib_acc fn2 _ 0 = return fn2
my_fib_acc fn2 fn1 n_rem =
    val &lt;- my_fib_acc fn1 (fn2+fn1) (n_rem - 1)
    Pmd (val, putStrLn (show fn1))
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we had to change is the lines where we wanted to print something for debugging, and add some code wherever
you extracted the value from the Id Monad to execute the resulting IO () you've returned. Something like

&lt;pre&gt;
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let (Id f25) = my_fib 25
    putStrLn (&quot;f25 is: &quot; ++ show f25)
&lt;/pre&gt;

for the Id Monad vs.

&lt;pre&gt;
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let (Pmd (f25, prt)) = my_fib 25
    prt
    putStrLn (&quot;f25 is: &quot; ++ show f25)
&lt;/pre&gt;

For the Pmd Monad. Notice that we didn't have to touch any of the functions that we weren't debugging.

== Stateful monads for concurrent applications ==

You're going to have to know about [[../Monad transformers | Monad transformers ]] before you can do these things.
Although the example came up because of [[../Concurrency | Concurrency ]], if you realize a TVar is a mutable variable of some kind, why this example came up might make some sense to you.

This is a little trick that I find makes writing stateful concurrent applications easier, especially for network applications.  Lets look at an imaginary stateful server.

Each currently connected client has a thread allowing the client to update the state.

The server also has a main logic thread which also transforms the state.

So you want to allow the client to update the state of the program

It's sometimes really simple and easy to expose the whole state of the program in a TVar, but I find this can get really messy, especially when the definition of the state changes!

Also it can be very annoying if you have to do anything conditional.

So to help tidy things up ( Say your state is called World )

=== Make a monad over state ===

First, make a monad over the World type

 import Control.Monad.State.Lazy

 -- heres yer monad
 -- it can liftIO too
 type WorldM
  = StateT World IO

 data World =
   World { objects :: [ WorldObject ] }

Now you can write some accessors in WorldM

 -- maybe you have a bunch of objects each with a unique id
 import Data.Unique
 import Data.Maybe
 import Prelude hiding ( id )

 data WorldObject =
    WorldObject { id :: Unique }

 -- check Control.Monad.State.Lazy if you are confused about get and put
 addObject :: WorldObject -&gt; WorldM ( )
 addObject wO = do
    wst &lt;- get
    put $ World $ wO : ( objects wst )

 -- presuming unique id
 getObject :: Unique -&gt; WorldM ( Maybe WorldObject )
 getObject id1 = do
    wst &lt;- get
    return $ listToMaybe $ filter ( \ wO -&gt; id wO == id1 )
                                  ( objects wst )

now heres a type representing a change to the World

   data WorldChange = NewObj WorldObject |
                      UpdateObj WorldObject | -- use the unique ids as replace match
                      RemoveObj Unique -- delete obj with named id

What it looks like all there's left to do is to

   type ChangeBucket = TVar [ WorldChange ]

   mainLoop :: ChangeBucket -&gt; WorldM ( )
   mainLoop cB =
      -- do some stuff
         -- it's probably fun
            -- using your cheeky wee WorldM accessors
      mainLoop cB -- recurse on the shared variable
      

Remember, your main thread is a transformer of World and IO so it can run 'atomically' and read the changeBucket.

Now, presuming you have a function that can incorporate a WorldChange into the existing WorldM your 'wait-for-client-input' thread can communicate with the main thread of the program, and it doesn't look too nasty.

=== Make the external changes to the state monadic themselves ===

However!  Since all the state inside your main thread is now hidden from the rest of the program and you communicate through a one way channel --- data goes from the client to the server, but the mainLoop keeps its state a secret --- your client thread is never going to be able to make conditional choices about the environment - the client thread runs in IO but the main thread runs in WorldM.

So the REAL type of your shared variable is
   
   type ChangeBucket = 
      TVar [ WorldM ( Maybe WorldChange ) ]

This can be generated from the client-input thread, but you'll be able to include conditional statements inside the code, which is only evaluated against the state when it is run from your main thread

It all sounds a little random, but it's made my life a lot easier.  Heres some real working code, based on this idea 

* this takes commands from a client, and attempts change the object representing the client inside the game's state
* the output from this function is then written to a ChangeBucket ( using the ChangeBucket definition in this section, above ) and run inside the DState of the game's main loop.

( you might want to mentally substitute DState for WorldM ) 

   -- cmd is a command generated from parsing network input
   mkChange :: Unique -&gt; Command -&gt; DState ( Maybe WorldChange )
   mkChange oid cmd = do
      mp &lt;- getObject oid -- this is maybe an object, as per the getObject definition earlier in the article
      -- enter the maybe monad
      return $ do p &lt;- mp -- if its Nothing, the rest will be nothing
                  case cmd of
                     -- but it might be something
                     Disconnect -&gt;
                        Just $ RemoveObject oid
                     Move x y -&gt; 
                        Just $ UpdateObject $ DO ( oid )
                                                 ( name p )
                                                 ( speed p )
                                                 ( netclient p )
                                                 ( pos p )
                                                 [ ( x , y ) ]
                                                 ( method p )

==== A note and some more ideas. ====

Another design might just have
  type ChangeBucket = TVar [ WorldM ( ) ]

And so just update the game world as they are run.  I have other uses for the WorldM ( Maybe Change ) type.

So I conclude - All I have are my monads and my word so go use your monads imaginatively and write some computer games ;)

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Haskell Basics}}

''All the examples in this chapter can be typed into a Haskell source file and evaluated by loading that file into GHC or Hugs. Do not include the &quot;Prelude&gt;&quot; prompts at the beginning of input. When the prompt is shown, you can type the code into an environment like GHCi. Otherwise, you should put the code in a file and run it.''

== Variables ==

We have seen how to use GHCi as a calculator. Of course, this is only practical for short calculations. For longer calculations and for writing Haskell programs, we want to keep track of intermediate results.

Intermediate results can be stored in ''variables'', to which we refer by their name. A variable contains a ''value'', which is substituted for the variable name when the variable is used. For instance, consider the following calculation

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
ghci&gt; 3.1416 * 5^2
78.53999999999999
}}

That is the approximate area of a circle with radius &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, according to the formula &lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;. It is cumbersome to type in the digits of &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 3.1416&lt;/math&gt;, or even to remember them at all. In fact, an important motivation of programming is delegating mindless repetition and rote memorization to a machine so that our minds are free to deal with more interesting ideas. For the present case, Haskell already includes a variable named &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt; that stores over a dozen digits of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; for us.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
ghci&gt; pi
3.141592653589793
ghci&gt; pi * 5^2
78.53981633974483
}}

Note that the variable &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt; and its value, &lt;code&gt;3.141592653589793&lt;/code&gt;, can be used interchangeably in calculations.

== Haskell source files ==

Whenever we write code that will be used more than momentarily, we save it in a Haskell source file with the extension &lt;tt&gt;.hs&lt;/tt&gt;. Basically, .hs files are plain text. If you need suggestions for text editors appropriate for coding, the [[w:text editor|Wikipedia article on text editors]] is a reasonable place to start. Vim and Emacs are popular choices among Haskell programmers. Proper source code editors will provide ''syntax highlighting'', which colors the code in relevant ways to make reading and understanding easier.

To keep things tidy, create a directory (i.e. a folder) in your computer to save the Haskell files you will create while doing the exercises in this book. Call the directory something like &lt;tt&gt;HaskellWikibook&lt;/tt&gt;. Then, create a new file in that directory called &lt;tt&gt;Varfun.hs&lt;/tt&gt; with the following code:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r = 5.0
&lt;/source&gt;

That code defines the variable &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; as being &lt;code&gt;5.0&lt;/code&gt;. Setting our own variables can make it easier to do future calculations.

Note: make sure that there are no spaces at the beginning of the line because Haskell is sensitive to whitespace.

Next, navigate to the &lt;tt&gt;HaskellWikibook&lt;/tt&gt; directory in your terminal, start GHCi and load the &lt;tt&gt;Varfun.hs&lt;/tt&gt; file using the &lt;code&gt;:load&lt;/code&gt; command:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; :load Varfun.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Varfun.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
}}

&lt;code&gt;:load&lt;/code&gt; can be abbreviated as &lt;code&gt;:l&lt;/code&gt; (as in &lt;code&gt;:l Varfun.hs&lt;/code&gt;). 

If GHCi gives an error like &lt;code&gt;Could not find module 'Varfun.hs'&lt;/code&gt;, you probably are in the wrong directory. You can use the &lt;code&gt;:cd&lt;/code&gt; command to change directories within GHCi (for instance, &lt;code&gt;:cd HaskellWikibook&lt;/code&gt;).

With the file loaded, you can use the newly defined variable &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in your calculations.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; r
5.0
*Main&gt; pi * r^2
78.53981633974483
}}

So, to calculate the area of a circle of radius 5, we simply define &lt;code&gt;r = 5.0&lt;/code&gt; and then type in the well-known formula &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; for the area of a circle. There is no need to write the numbers out every time; that's very convenient!

Since this was so much fun, let's add another definition: Change the contents of the source file to

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r = 5.0
area = pi * r ^ 2
&lt;/source&gt;

Save the file and type the &lt;code&gt;:reload&lt;/code&gt; (shorter version is &lt;code&gt;:r&lt;/code&gt;) command in GHCi to load the new contents (note that this is a continuation of the last session):

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; :reload
Compiling Main             ( Varfun.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt;
}}

Now we have two variables &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; available

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; area
78.53981633974483
*Main&gt; area / r
15.707963267948966
}}

{{body note|It is also possible to define variables directly at the GHCi prompt, without a source file. Skipping the details, the syntax for doing so uses the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; ''keyword'' (a word with a special meaning) and looks like:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Prelude&gt; let area = pi * 5 ^ 2&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Although we will occasionally use ''let'' this way for expediency, it will become obvious that this practice is not convenient once we move into slightly more complex tasks. So, we are emphasizing the use of source files from the very start.
}}

{{body note|GHC can also be used as a compiler (that is, you can use GHC to convert your Haskell files into a standalone program that can be run without depending on the interpreter). How that is done will be explained later, in the [[Haskell/Standalone programs|Standalone programs]] chapter.}}

== Comments ==
Before we continue, it is good to understand that it is possible to include text in a program without having it treated as code. This is achieved by use of ''comments''. In Haskell, a comment can be started with &lt;code&gt;-- &lt;/code&gt; and continues until the end of the line:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 5     -- The variable x is 5.
y = 6     -- The variable y is 6.
-- z = 7
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are defined, but &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is not. Comments can also go anywhere using the alternative syntax &lt;code&gt;{- ... -}&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = {- Do this just because you can. -} 5
&lt;/source&gt;

Comments are generally used for explaining parts of a program that might be, on their own, confusing to readers. Beware of overdoing it, though. Too many comments make programs harder to read. Also, comments must be carefully updated whenever the corresponding code is changed, so that they do not become outdated, incorrect and misleading.

== Variables in imperative languages ==
If you are already familiar with imperative programming languages like C, you will notice that variables in Haskell are quite different from variables as you know them. We now explain why and how.

If you have no programming experience, you might like to skip this section and continue reading with [[#Functions|Functions]].


Unlike in imperative languages, variables in Haskell ''do not vary''. Once defined, their value never changes; they are immutable. For instance, the following code does not work:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r = 5
r = 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The variables in functional programming languages are more related to variables in mathematics than to changeable locations in a computer's memory. In a math classroom, you would definitely never see a variable change its value within a single problem. Likewise, in Haskell the compiler will respond to the code above with an error: &quot;multiple declarations of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Those familiar with ''imperative programming'', which involves explicitly telling the computer what to do, may be used to read this as first setting &lt;code&gt;r = 5&lt;/code&gt; and then changing it to &lt;code&gt;r = 2&lt;/code&gt;. In functional programming languages, however, the program is in charge of figuring out what to do with the computer's memory.

Here's another example of a major difference from imperative languages:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r = r + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead of &quot;incrementing the variable &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, this is actually a recursive definition of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in terms of itself (we will explain [[Haskell/Recursion|recursion]] in detail later on; just remember that there is a radical difference from what would happen in an imperative language). If &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; had been defined with any value beforehand, then &lt;code&gt; r = r + 1 &lt;/code&gt; in Haskell would bring an error message. That is akin to saying, in a mathematical context, that &lt;math&gt;5 = 5 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, which is plainly wrong.

Because their values do not change within a program, variables can be defined in any order. For example, the following fragments of code do exactly the same thing:

{|border=&quot;0&quot;
|-
||&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 y = x * 2
 x = 3
&lt;/source&gt;
||&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 x = 3
 y = x * 2
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

We can write things in any order that we want, there is no notion of &quot;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; being declared before &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or the other way around. This is also why you can't declare something more than once; it would be ambiguous otherwise. Of course, using &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; will still require a value for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, but this is unimportant until you need a specific numeric value.

By now, you might be wondering how you can actually do anything at all in Haskell where variables don't change. But trust us; as we hope to show you in the rest of this book, you can write every program under the sun without ever changing a single variable! In fact, variables that don't change make life ''much'' easier because it makes programs much more predictable. That is a key feature of purely functional programming; it requires a very different approach and mindset from those of imperative programming.

== Functions ==
Now, suppose that we have multiple circles with different radii whose areas we want to calculate. For instance, let us calculate the area of another circle with radius 3. If we were to build on the program we have just written, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; would already have been defined as &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. We could change the entire program of so that &lt;code&gt;r = 3&lt;/code&gt;, but then we would lose the ability to calculate the first circle. An alternative is defining a new variable &lt;code&gt;r2&lt;/code&gt;, and also another new variable &lt;code&gt;area2&lt;/code&gt; for the area calculated with &lt;code&gt;r2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;As this example shows, the names of variables may contain numbers as well as letters. Variables ''must'' begin with a lowercase letter, but for the rest, any string consisting of letter, numbers, underscore (_) or tick (') is allowed.&lt;/ref&gt; Our new source file for both circles is:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
r  = 5
area  = pi*r^2
r2 = 3
area2 = pi*r2^2
&lt;/source&gt;

Clearly, that is unsatisfactory because we are repeating the formula for the area of a circle verbatim. To eliminate this mindless repetition, we would prefer to write it down only once and then apply it to different radii. That's exactly what ''functions'' allow us to do.

A ''function'' takes an ''argument'' value (or ''parameter'') and gives a result value (this is essentially the same as mathematical functions). Defining functions in Haskell is simple: It is like defining a variable, except that we take note of the function argument that we put on the left hand side. For instance, the following is the definition of a function &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; which depends on a argument which we name &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
area r = pi * r^2
&lt;/source&gt;

Look closely at the syntax: the function name comes first (in our example, it is &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt;), followed by a space and then the argument (&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in the example). Following the = sign, the function definition is a formula that uses the argument in context with other already defined terms.

Now, we can plug in different values for the argument in a ''call'' to the function. Save the code in a file, load it into GHCi and try the following:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; area 5
78.53981633974483
*Main&gt; area 3
28.274333882308138
*Main&gt; area 17
907.9202768874502
}}

Thus, we can call this function with different radii to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of any length.

Our function here is defined mathematically as
:&lt;math&gt;A(r) = \pi \cdot r^2&lt;/math&gt;
In mathematics, the parameter is enclosed between parentheses, as in &lt;math&gt;A(5) = 78.54&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A(3) = 28.27&lt;/math&gt;. The Haskell code will also work with parentheses, but they are normally omitted. As Haskell is a ''functional'' language, we will functions all the time, and whenever possible we want to minimize extra symbols.

Parentheses are still used for grouping ''expressions'' (any code that gives a value) to be evaluated together. Note how the following expressions are parsed differently:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
5 * 3 + 2       -- 15 + 2 = 17 (multiplication is done before addition)
5 * (3 + 2)     -- 5 * 5 = 25 (thanks to the parentheses)
area 5 * 3      -- (area 5) * 3
area (5 * 3)    -- area 15
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how Haskell functions take ''precedence'' over all other operators such as &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, in the same way that, for instance, multiplication is done before addition in mathematics.

=== Evaluation ===
Let us try to understand what exactly happens when you enter an expression into GHCi. After you press the enter key, GHCi will ''evaluate'' the expression you have given. That means it will replace each function with its definition and calculate the results until a single value is left. For example, the evaluation of &lt;code&gt;area 5&lt;/code&gt; proceeds as follows:

    area 5
 =&gt;    { replace the left-hand side  area r = ...  by the right-hand side  ... = pi * r^2 }
    pi * 5^2
 =&gt;    { replace  pi  by its numerical value }
    3.141592653589793 * 5^2
 =&gt;    { apply exponentiation (^) }
    3.141592653589793 * 25
 =&gt;    { apply multiplication (*) }
    78.53981633974483

As this shows, to ''apply'' or ''call'' a function means to replace the left-hand side of its definition by its right-hand side. As a last step, GHCi prints the final result on the screen.

Here are some more functions:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
double x    = 2*x
quadruple x = double (double x)
square x    = x*x
half   x    = x / 2
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Exercises|1=
* Explain how GHCi evaluates &lt;code&gt;quadruple 5&lt;/code&gt;.
* Define a function that subtracts 12 from half its argument.}}

=== Multiple parameters ===

Of course, functions can also have more than one argument. For example, here is a function for calculating the area of a rectangle given its length and its width:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
areaRect l w = l * w
&lt;/source&gt;

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; areaRect 5 10
50
}}

Another example that calculates the area of a triangle &lt;math&gt;\left(A = \frac{bh}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
areaTriangle b h = (b * h) / 2
&lt;/source&gt;

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; areaTriangle 3 9
13.5
}}

As you can see, multiple arguments are separated by spaces. That's also why you sometimes have to use parentheses to group expressions. For instance, to quadruple a value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, you can't write

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
quadruple x = double double x
&lt;/source&gt;

because that would mean to apply a function named &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; to the two arguments &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;: ''functions can be arguments to other functions'' (and you will see why later). Instead, you have to put parentheses around the argument:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
quadruple x = double (double x)
&lt;/source&gt;

Arguments are always passed in the order given. For example:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
subtract x y = x - y
&lt;/source&gt;

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; subtract 10 5
5
*Main&gt; subtract 5 10
-5
}}

Here, &lt;code&gt;subtract 10 5&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;10 - 5&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;subtract 5 10&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;5 - 10&lt;/code&gt; because the order changes.

{{Exercises|1=
* Write a function to calculate the volume of a box.
* Approximately how many stones are the famous pyramids at Giza made up of? Hint: you will need estimates for the volume of the pyramids and the volume of each block.
}}

=== Remark on combining functions ===

It goes without saying that you can use functions that you have already defined to define new functions, just like you can use the predefined functions like addition &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt; or multiplication &lt;code&gt;(*)&lt;/code&gt; (operators are defined as functions in Haskell). For example, to calculate the area of a square, we can reuse our function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
areaRect l w = l * w
areaSquare s = areaRect s s
&lt;/source&gt;

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; areaSquare 5
25
}}

After all, a square is just a rectangle with equal sides.

This principle may seem innocent enough, but it is really powerful, in particular when we start to calculate with other objects instead of numbers.

{{Exercises|1=
* Write a function to calculate the volume of a cylinder.  The volume of a cylinder is the area of the base, which is a circle (you already programmed this function in this chapter, so reuse it) multiplied by the height.
}}

== Local definitions ==
=== &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses ===
When defining a function, it is not uncommon to define intermediate results that are ''local'' to the function. For instance, consider [[w:Heron's formula|Heron's formula]] &lt;math&gt;A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt; for calculating the area of a triangle with sides &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
heron a b c = sqrt (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
    where
    s = (a+b+c) / 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The variable &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is half the perimeter of the triangle and it would be tedious to write it out four times in the argument of the square root function &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt;.

Simply write the definitions in sequence will not work...

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
heron a b c = sqrt (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))  -- s is not defined here
s = (a+b+c) / 2                           -- a, b, and c are not defined here
&lt;/source&gt;

... because the variables &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; are only available in the right-hand side of the function &lt;code&gt;heron&lt;/code&gt;, but the definition of &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; as written here is not part of the right-hand side of &lt;code&gt;heron&lt;/code&gt;. To make it part of the right-hand side, we have to use the &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

Note that both the &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; and the local definitions are ''indented'' by 4 spaces, to distinguish them from subsequent definitions. Here is another example that shows a mix of local and top-level definitions:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
areaTriangleTrig  a b c = c * height / 2   -- use trigonometry
    where
    cosa   = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2*b*c)
    sina   = sqrt (1 - cosa^2)
    height = b*sina
areaTriangleHeron a b c = result           -- use Heron's formula
    where
    result = sqrt (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
    s      = (a+b+c)/2
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scope ===
If you look closely at the previous example, you'll notice that we have used the variable names &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; twice, once for each of the two area functions. How does that work?

Fortunately, the following fragment of code does not contain any unpleasant surprises:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; let r = 0
Prelude&gt; let area r = pi * r ^ 2
Prelude&gt; area 5
78.53981633974483
}}

An &quot;unpleasant surprise&quot; here would have been getting &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for the area because of the &lt;code&gt;let r = 0&lt;/code&gt; definition getting in the way. That does not happen because when you defined &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; the second time you are talking about a ''different'' &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;. This is something that happens in real life as well. How many people do you know that have the name John? What's interesting about people named John is that most of the time, you can talk about &quot;John&quot; to your friends, and depending on the context, your friends will know which John you are referring to. Programming has a notion similar to context, called ''[[Wikipedia:Scope (programming)|scope]]''.

We will not explain the technicalities behind scope (at least not now). Just keep in mind that the value of a parameter is strictly what you pass in when you call the function, regardless of what the variable was called in the function's definition.

== Summary ==

# Variables store values. In fact, they store any arbitrary Haskell expressions.
# Variables do not change.
# Functions help you write reusable code.
# Functions can accept more than one parameter.

We also learned that comments are non-code text within a source file.

&lt;p&gt;I have been an avid reader since the age of four, and the first thing I did after learning to read was to start teaching my friends in the yard to read, too. So I guess I liked to share my books already then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I think the whole [http://www.wikimedia.org/ Wikimedia] phenomenon is awesome, and I would like to do my share. I see WikiBooks as an important promoter for free information and learning and a workable way to develop higher quality teaching with marginal added cost.&lt;/p&gt;

'''Pikelets''' are small, thick [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], and are standards of the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] kitchen. They are also made in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]].

==Ingredients==

* 125g [[Cookbook:Flour|strong bread flour]]
* 125g [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]]
* 1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|bicarbonate of soda]]
* 8g [[Cookbook:Yeast|fresh yeast]]
* 75ml lukewarm [[Cookbook:Milk|whole milk]]
* ½ teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 250ml lukewarm [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Sift the flours into a large mixing bowl adding half a teaspoon of the bicarbonate of soda and the salt.
# Crumble the yeast into a small bowl and slowly add the water until you have a brown paste.
# Pour the liquid yeast into the mixing bowl.
# Mix it about a bit until you have a very thick batter. You can use a wooden spoon, but you get much better results if you get stuck in and use your hands.
#Cover the bowl with a warm and damp cloth and leave in a warm place for two hours. I like to bake this after I have had my dinner so I usually put it into the oven. If you do the same make sure the oven is not too hot before you do this as not only will the mixture start cooking, but you could melt a plastic mixing bowl.
# Return to the now frothy batter (if it is not then you have done something wrong). Dissolve the rest of the Bicarbonate of soda in the lukewarm milk and slowly add it to the batter.
# Heat either a lightly greased griddle or an ordinary frying pan and oil until it is very hot. Now with a spoonful at time cook the mixture for about two minutes on each side. The indication to turn should be when the bubbles that will form dry out.

==1. Describe the ways in which trees and shrubs differ.==
Trees are generally taller than shrubs and have a main trunk from which all the secondary branches  grow.  Shrubs are generally shorter and may have multiple stems rather than a single trunk.  Some plants can be considered either shrubs or trees depending on their growing conditions, so the division should not be considered exact.

==2. Collect and identify typical leaves from 15 different species of trees. Spread neatly, press dry, mount, and label in a suitable notebook or on uniform-size sheets of paper.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Leaf_collection}}

==3. Name two examples each of trees that have been named for:==
===a. What they are used for===
*'''Sweet Gum:''' the gummy sap of this tree has been used as chewing gum.
*'''Cork Oak''' forms a thick, rugged and corky bark. Over time this bark can develop considerable thickness, and this is harvested every 10-12 years as cork.
*'''Balsam Fir:''' produces a resin which is known as ''Canadian Balsam''.  A balsam is the same thing as a balm, a soothing liquid - anything that soothes, heals, or restores.
*'''Boxwood:''' produces a tight-grained wood ideal for carving or for making boxes.

===b. The surroundings or environment in which they grow===
*'''Mountain Ash''' grow in the mountainous areas of the northern US and Canada.
*'''Swamp Ash''' live in the swamps of the southern US.

===c. Some distinctive feature===
*'''Sugar Maple:''' The primary source of sugary maple syrup.
*'''Hornbeam:''' The common English name of &quot;hornbeam&quot; derives from the hardness of the wood (likened to horn) and the Old English beam, meaning a tree (like the German word &quot;baum&quot; which we know as &quot;tannenbaum&quot;). 
*'''Tulip Tree:''' is so named because its flowers resemble tulip flowers.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===d. The geographic region in which they live===
*'''Brazilwood:''' is not named after Brazil - Brazil is actually named for the tree!
*'''Cedar of Lebanon''', is a coniferous tree native to the mountains of the Mediterranean region, in Lebanon, western Syria and south central Turkey
*'''Mexican Buckeye''' is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Mexico and adjacent western Texas and southern New Mexico.

===e. Persons who first found and described them:===
*'''Douglas Fir:''' The common name honors David Douglas, the Scottish botanist who first introduced the tree into cultivation in 1826.

*'''Fraser Fir:''' named after John Fraser, a Scottish botanist.  Fraser Firs are farmed and sold as Christmas trees.

==4. Give the common name and tell the difference between the two great classes of trees.==
The two great classes of trees are the '''gymnosperms''' and '''angiosperms'''.  The gymnosperms do not produce flowers, but rather, produce naked seeds usually attached to the scale of a cone (such as a pine cone).  The angiosperms do produce flowers which in turn become seed-bearing fruits (or nuts).  More commonly, the gymnosperms are called ''evergreens'', though this is not an accurate term because some angiosperms are evergreen (such as palms and the live oak).  Also, the Ginkgo is a gymnosperm, but it is not evergreen.  Gymnosperms and angiosperms are also commonly referred to as ''softwoods'' and ''hardwoods'' though those terms are not terribly accurate either, as several gymnosperms have hard wood and several angiosperms have soft wood.

==5. Describe the importance of forest conservation in your area.==
Properly managed, forests are a renewable resource.  In order to ensure a continuous supply of forest products (such as lumber), forests must be properly cut and replanted.  Forests also serve as an important habitat for several species, both animal and plant.  When plants lose their habitat they simply die.  When animals lose their habitat, some will die and others will move into other areas - notably, areas where humans live.  This promotes undesirable encounters between potentially dangerous animals and humans, with the animal invariably getting the short end of the stick.

==6. Name several examples of the kinds of wood used in each of the following:==
;a. Flooring for houses: Oak, maple, pine, teak.
;b. Common plywood: Pine, fir, spruce
;c. Furniture: Walnut, oak, cherry, maple, pine, mahogany
;d. Ax handles: Hickory, ash
;e. Fence posts: Locust, cedar, redwood, fir (treated)
;f. Railroad ties: Hardwoods and softwoods.
;g. Support beams for construction work:  Oak, hickory, ash
;h. Bows and arrows: Osage orange, yew, and elm for bows.  Cedar, spruce, and fir for arrows
;i. Ideal for use as kindling: Softwoods such as pine and cedar.
;j. Burns slowly and leaves a bed of hot coals: Hardwoods, especially hickory and mesquite.

==7. Name two examples each of trees which:==
;a. Grow best in wet lands: Bald Cypress, Sycamore, Willow, Swamp White Oak, Swamp Chestnut Oak, Overcup Oak, Tupelo Gum and Cottonwood.

;b. Grow best at high levels in mountains:
Larch, Bristlecone Pine (and many other pines), Birch, and Beech.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Definition of Social Loafing =

[[Image:1904_tug_of_war.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]

Social loafing describes the phenomenon that occurs when individuals exert less effort when working as a group than when working independently.  Research indicates that there is some degree of social loafing within every group, whether high-functioning or dysfunctional. 

In 1913, a French agricultural engineer, Max Ringlemann, identified this social phenomenon.  He recognized a collective group performance required less effort by individuals compared to the sum of their individual efforts (Kravitz &amp; Martin, 1986). The effect he noted has been termed the Ringlemann Effect.  In this experiment, participants pulled on a rope attached to a strain gauge.  Ringlemann noted that two individuals pulling the rope only exerted 93% of their individual efforts.  A group of three individuals exerted 85% and groups of eight exerted 49% of their combined individual effort.  As more individuals pulled on the rope, each individual exerted themselves less.  From these observations, Ringlemann determined that individuals perform below their potential when working in a group (LaFasto &amp; Larson, 2001, p. 77). 



Since Ringlemann’s observation, social loafing has been identified in numerous studies.  Social loafing has several causes and effects that will be discussed in this document, as well as methods for dealing with social loafing to promote more effective group work. 

'Ringleman's brainchild of social loafing has now been used within a diverse variety of studies, ranging from its impact on sports teams to the affects on groups within huge conglomerates.’ (Dr Karen Virendra Patel, 2002; pg 124)'''''

== Causes of Social Loafing ==

Many theories explain why social loafing occurs., below are several explanations of social loafing causes:

'''Equitable contribution''': Team members believe that others are not putting forth as much effort as themselves.  Since they feel that the others in the group are slacking, they lessen their efforts too.  This causes a downward cycle that ends at the point where only the minimum amount of work is performed.

'''Submaximal goal setting''':  Team members may perceive that with a well-defined goal and with several people working towards it, they can work less for it.  The task then becomes optimizing rather than maximizing. 

'''Lessened contingency between input and outcome''': Team members may feel they can hide in the crowd and avoid the consequences of not contributing.  Or, a team member may feel lost in the crowd and unable to gain recognition for their contributions (Latane, 1998).  This description is characteristic of people driven by their uniqueness and individuality.  In a group, they lose this individuality and the recognition that comes with their contributions.  Therefore, these group members lose motivation to offer their full ability since it will not be acknowledged (Charbonnier et al., 1998).  Additionally, large group sizes can cause individuals to feel lost in the crowd.  With so many individuals contributing, some may feel that their efforts are not needed or will not be recognized (Kerr, 1989).

'''Lack of evaluation''': Loafing begins or is strengthened in the absence of an individual evaluation structure imposed by the environment (Price &amp; Harrison, 2006).  This occurs because working in the group environment results in less self-awareness (Mullen, 1983).  For example, a member of a sales team will loaf when sales of the group are measured rather than individual sales efforts.

'''Unequal distribution of compensation''': In the workplace, compensation comes in monetary forms and promotions and in academics it is in the form of grades or positive feedback.  If an individual believes compensation has not been allotted equally amongst group members, he will withdraw his individual efforts (Piezon &amp; Donaldson, 2005). 

'''Non-cohesive group''':  A group functions effectively when members have bonded and created high-quality relationships.  If the group is not cohesive, members are more prone to social loafing since they are not concerned about letting down their teammates (Piezon &amp; Donaldson, 2005).

== Effects of Social Loafing ==

Social loafing engenders negative consequences that affect both the group as a whole as well as the individual.  

=== Effects on Groups ===

[[Image:argue.gif|left|thumb|200px|]]
As explained in the Ringlemann Effect, output decreases with increased group membership, due to social loafing.  This effect is demonstrated in another study by Latane, et al.  In this experiment subjects were asked to yell or clap as loudly as possible.  As in Ringlemann’s study, the overall loudness increased while individual output decreased.  People averaged 3.7 dynes/sq cm individually, 2.6 in pairs, 1.8 in a group of four, and 1.5 in a group of six.  In this study there was no block effect (indicating tiredness or lack of practice).  Due to social loafing, average output for each individual decreases due to the perception that others in the group are not putting forth as much effort as the individual.  

In considering this first experiment, some individuals suggested that results might be invalid due to acoustics (i.e. voices canceling each other out or voices not synchronized).  To disprove this theory, another experiment was performed.  For this study, participants were placed in individual rooms and wore headphones.  In repeated trials, these participants were told they were either shouting alone or as part of a group.  The results demonstrated the same trend as in the first experiment--individual performance decreased as a group size increased (Latane, 1979).

In reality, there are not many groups with the objective of yelling loud, however the example above illustrates a principle that is common in business, family, education, and in social gatherings that harms the overall integrity and performance of a team by reducing the level of output, one individual at a time.  The negative social cues involved with social loafing produce decreased group performance (Schnake, 1991, p. 51).  Reasonable consequences of social loafing also include dissatisfaction with group members who fail to contribute equally and the creation of in groups and out groups.  Additionally, groups will lack the talents that could be offered by those who choose to not contribute.  All of these factors result in less productivity.

=== Effects on Individuals ===

The preceding section identifies the effect of social loafing on a group which is arguably the most prominent consequence of the group behavior.  However, social loafing also has an impact on the individuals that comprise the group.  There are various side effects that individuals may experience. 

One potential side effect is the lack of satisfaction that a member of the group might experience, thereby becoming disappointed or depressed at the end of project.  When a member of a group becomes a social loafer, the member reduces any opportunity he might have had to grow in his ability and knowledge.  Today, many college level classes focus on group projects.  The ability for an individual to participate in social loafing increases at the group increases in number.  However, if these groups remain small the individual will not have the opportunity to become invisible to the group and their lack of input will be readily evident.  The lack of identifiably in a group is a psychological production that has been documented in several studies. (Carron, Burke &amp; Prapavessis, 2004)

Social loafing can also negatively impact individuals in the group who perform the bulk of the work.  For example, in schoolwork teams are often comprised of children of varying capacities.  Without individual accountability, often only one or a few group members will do most of the work to make up for what the other students lack.  Cheri Yecke, Minnesota’s commissioner of education, explains that in these instances group work can be detrimental to the student(s) who feel resentment and frustration from carrying the weight of the work.  Yecke recounted an experience of one child who felt she had to “slow down the pace of her learning and that she could not challenge the group, or she would be punished” with a lower grade than desired.  Especially in situations where members of the group of differing abilities, social loafing negatively affects group members who carry the weight of the group.

== Variation in Social Loafing ==

=== Culture ===

Social loafing is more likely to occur in societies where the focus is on the individual rather than the group.  This phenomenon was observed in a study comparing American managers (individualistic values) to Chinese managers (collectivistic values).  Researchers found that social loafing occurred with the American managers while there was no such occurrence with the Chinese managers.  The researchers explained this through a comparison between collectivistic and individualistic orientations.  

A collectivistic orientation places group goals and collective action ahead of self-interests.  This reinforces the participants' desires to pursue group goals in order to benefit the group.  People from this orientation view their individual actions as an important contribution to the group's well-being.  They also gain satisfaction and feelings of accomplishment from group outcomes.  Further, collectivists anticipate that other group members will contribute to the groups' performance and so they choose to do the same in return.  They view their contributions to group accomplishments as important and role-defined (Earley, 1989).

In contrast, an individualist's motive is focused on self-interest.  Actions by these individuals emphasize personal gain and rewards based on their particular accomplishments.  An individualist anticipates rewards contingent on individual performance. Contribution toward achieving collective goals is inconsistent with the self-interest motive unless differential awards are made by the group. Individuals whose contributions to group output go unnoticed have little incentive to contribute, since they can &quot;loaf&quot; without fear of consequences. As a result, an individualist can maximize personal gain without putting forth as much effort as had he/she done the work individually. The self-interest motive stresses individual outcomes and gain over the collective good (Earley, 1989).

=== Gender ===

[[Image:Hutterer-Frauen bei der Arbeit.jpg|left|thumb|200px]] 
Research indicates that women are more inclined to sustain group cohesion where men are more interested in task achievement.  As a result, women, who deem collective tasks more significant than individual tasks, are less likely to engage in social loafing than men.  This phenomenon is demonstrated in a study conducted by Naoki Kugihara.  To determine the social loafing effect on men versus women, he had 18 Japanese men and 18 Japanese women pull on a rope, similar to the Ringlemann experiment.  On the questionnaire, several participants indicated their perception that they pulled with their full strength.  However, Kugihara observed the men did decrease their effort once involved in collective rope pulling.  Conversely, the women did not show a change in effort once involved collectively.  

In the paper reporting the results of this study, Kugihara explains some reasoning behind this different reaction between men and women.  In observing Japanese junior high students, Tachibana and Koyasu found that boys engaged more earnestly in the task when they were told that achievement was being measured.  When they were told they could relax and enjoy the task, the boys did not put forth as much effort.  However, with the girls they did not notice any change in effort between the achievement and relaxation tasks.  These results indicate that men are more likely to engage in social loafing in a group setting because they will not be driven by achievement motivation since their efforts will not be as visible.  However, women tend to not be affected by achievement motivation and therefore are less likely to engage in social loafing (1999).

== Confronting the Social Loafer ==
[[Image:Two_koreans_in_discussion.jpg|left|thumb|200px|]] 

No one ever likes to be confronted or told what to do.  So in a group setting, what is the best way to make the most out of each individual’s contributions?  Especially in groups where there is no designated leader, it is difficult for one group member to confront another.  However, Dan Rothwell offers advice for handling these situations.

'''Private confrontation''':  The team leader or a selected team member should confront the social loafer individually.  This individual should solicit the reasons for the lackluster effort.  Additionally, the loafer should be encouraged to participate and understand the importance of his contributions.

'''Group confrontation''':  The entire group can address the problem to the dissenting team member and specifically address the problem(s) they have observed.  They should attempt to resolve the problem and refrain from deleterious attacks on the slacking individual.

'''Superior assistance''':  After trying to address the problem with the individual both privately and as a group, group members should seek the advice of a superior, whether it be a teacher, boss or other authority figure.  Where possible, group members should provide documented evidence of the loafing engaged by the individual (De Vita, 2001).  The person in authority can directly address the problem with the lackluster team member.
  
'''Exclusion''':  The loafer should only be booted out of the group as a last resort.  However, this option may not be feasible in some instances.

'''Circumvention''':  If all the above steps have been attempted without result, then the group can reorganize tasks and responsibilities.  This should be done in a manner that will result in a desirable outcome whether or not the loafer contributes.

(Rothwell, 2004)

== Preventing Social Loafing ==

[[Image:Traitdunion 02-2002 Ostia-Talk LR.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]

In order to prevent or limit the effects of social loafing, there are a number of guidelines a team leader might initiate to manage team members’ efforts toward team goals.  Though some do depend upon the nature of the team and the type of team, most of these guidelines can be adapted to provide a positive benefit to all teams.  

'''Develop rules of conduct''':  Setting rules at the beginning will help all team members achieve the team objectives and performance goals.  Establishing ground rules can help to prevent social loafing and free-riding behaviors by providing assurances that free-riding attempts will be dealt with (Cox, 2007).

'''Create appropriate group sizes''':  Do not create or allow a team to undertake a two-man job. For example, municipal maintenance crews often have crew members standing around watching one or two individuals work.  Does that job really require that many crew members?

'''Establish individual accountability''':  This is critical for initial assignments that set the stage for the rest of the task (Team Based).  Tasks that require pre-work and input from all group members produce a set of dynamics that largely prevent social loafing from happening in the first place.  If this expectation is set early, individuals will avoid the consequences of being held accountable for poor work.

'''Encourage group loyalty''': Not all cultures experience social loafing.  In China, social striving, the opposite of social loafing, occurs.  In these cases, individual performance is enhanced by being in a group (Davies, 2006).  The individuals care more about the success of the group than their own success.  They have a clear view of the group’s objective and what leads to its fulfillment.  This sense of group loyalty is created by individual awareness of the team’s position in reaching the goal.  If production plant employees know the goal, know how far they need to go, and where the competition is, they are more inclined to work towards the goal than if they did not have that knowledge.

'''Implement peer evaluation''':  In academic cultures, college instructors use peer evaluations to instill accountability for individual contributions in group products. These evaluations are given early in the term and are more effective in deterring social loafing than peer evaluations given later in the term (Brooks &amp; Ammons, 2003).

'''Write a team contract''':  Confusion and miscommunication can cause social loafing.  Although it may seem formal, writing a team contract is a good first step in setting group rules and preventing social loafing.  This contract should include several important pieces of information such as group expectations, individual responsibilities, forms of group communication, and methods of discipline.  If each group member has a measurable responsibility that they alone are accountable for, he is not able to rely on the group for his portion of responsibility.  

'''Choose complementary team members''':  When possible, carefully choose individuals to join a team.  Make sure they have strengths and personalities that will complement other group members rather than deter from reaching the group goal.

'''Minimize group size''':  Whenever possible, minimize the amount of people within a group.  The less people available to diffuse responsibility to, the less likely social loafing will occur.

'''Establish ground rules''':  Discuss what the team’s goals and objectives are and then develop a process to meet them.  Agree to perform by team roles discussed in the initial meeting of a project.  Also discuss consequences of not following rules and the process to call an individual on their negative behavior.

'''Specifically define the task''':  Clarify the importance of the task to the team and assign members to do particular assignments.  Establish expectations through specific measurable and observable outcomes, such as due dates.  At the end of each meeting, refresh everyone’s memories as to who is required to do what by when and offer clarification on required duties.

'''Create personal relationships''':  Provide opportunities for members to socialize and establish trusting relationships.  Dedicated relationships cause people to fulfill their duties more efficiently.

'''Highlight achievement''':  Invite members of management to attend team sessions.  Allow team accomplishments to shine through to superiors.  Close meetings by summarizing their group’s successes.  Pat them on the back and remind them of their upcoming duties.

'''Establish task importance''':  Allow team members the opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to do their work in a timely fashion.

'''Evaluate progress''':  Meet individually with team members to assess their successes and areas of improvement.  Discuss ways in which the team leader may provide additional support so the task may be completed. When possible, develop an evaluation based on an individual contribution.  This can be accomplished through individual group members’ evaluations of others on team.

'''Manage discussions''':  Ensure that all team members have the opportunity to speak.  Make every individual feel they have a valuable role on the team and their input is important to group success.

'''Engage individuals''':  When intrinsic involvement in the task is high, workers may feel that their efforts are very important for the success of the group and thus may be unlikely to engage in social loafing even if the task visibility is low.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Grammar ==

=== Essive case ===

The essive or case carries the meaning of a '''temporary state of being''', often equivalent to the English ''as a...''.

In the Finnish language, this case is marked by adding '''-na/-nä''' to the stem of the noun.

The essive case ending '''-na''' or '''-nä''' will not cause a strong grade stem to weaken.

Examples:

* '''lapsena''' ''as a child'', ''when (I/he/you) was a child''.
* '''lapsina''' ''as children'',''when (we/you'all/they) were children''.
* '''Hän on opettajana''' ''he is teaching (temporarily)'' or ''he is working as a teacher for the time being''
: If his profession was a teacher and is likely to remain so the statement would be '''Hän on opettaja''' ''He is a teacher''


You can add personal suffixes to words that are in essive, although the resulting forms are not so common.

Examples:

* '''lääkärinäsi''' ''as your doctor'', ''when (I/he/you) was your doctor''.
* '''lääkäreinäsi''' ''as your doctors'',''when (we/you'all/they) were your doctors''.


Some verb structures always feature essive:

* '''Pitää jotakuta jonakin''' (''regard someone as something'')
** Hän pitää minua aivan tyhmänä

* '''Olla hulluna johonkin''' (&quot;''Be as a mad into something''&quot;)
** Hän on hulluna japanilaisiin sarjakuviin.


Pronouns have their own essive forms.

'''minä''' -&gt; '''minuna''', '''sinä''' -&gt; '''sinuna''', '''hän''' -&gt; '''hänenä''', '''me''' -&gt; '''meinä''', '''te''' -&gt; '''teinä''', '''he''' -&gt; '''heinä'''

* Teinä kiirehtisin.
* Sinuna olisin ystävällisempi häntä kohtaan.

'''tämä''' -&gt; '''tänä''', '''tuo''' -&gt; '''tuona''', '''se''' -&gt; '''sinä'''

* Hän saapui tuona myrskyisenä iltana.
* Me lähdimme sinä päivänä, kun meri oli tyyni.

'''nämä''' -&gt; '''näinä''', '''nuo''' -&gt; '''noina''', '''ne''' -&gt; '''niinä'''

* Laivat lähtevät pian, aivan näinä päivinä.

'''jokin''' -&gt; '''jonakin''', '''joku''' -&gt; '''jonakuna''', '''jompikumpi''' -&gt; '''jompanakumpana''', '''sellainen''' -&gt; '''sellaisena'''

* Hän sanoi että hän haluaisi esiintyä jonakin muuna hahmona tässä näytelmässä.


Essive can be used as a kind of participial phrase like in the following examples

* '''Koska olen lääkäri yritän auttaa potilaita.''' -&gt; '''Lääkärinä yritän auttaa potilaita.'''

* '''Jos olisin lääkäri pystyisin parantamaan sinut.''' -&gt; '''Lääkärinä pystyisin parantamaan sinut.'''


In Finnish, the essive case is also used for specifying times, days and dates when something happens. For 

Examples:

* '''maanantaina''' ''on Monday''
* '''tiistaina''' ''on Tuesday''
* '''kuudentena joulukuuta'''  ''on the 6th of December''.
: '''Kuusi''' ''six'' (nominal)-&gt; '''kuudes''' ''sixth'' (ordinal) -&gt; '''kuudennen''' ''of the sixth'' (genetive stem weak grade kudenne-) -&gt; '''kuudentena''' ''on the sixth'' (Essive used to express time. Note the strong grade nt compared to the weak grade genitive nn)
* '''jouluna''' ''at Christmas''
* '''pääsiäisenä''' ''at Easter''
* '''tänä talvena''' ''in this winter''
* '''ensi talvena''' ''next winter''
* '''tulevana talvena''' ''in the following winter''
* '''Jonakin päivänä''' ''some day'' or ''one of these days''.
: The root words here are '''jokin päivä''' which is ''some day'' in a neutral form, but when inflected in the essive it is used to express that something will happen at some unspecified time
:: The rather unusal inflection pattern of the word jokin is standard in all cases, Thus we have jossakin, jostakin, johonkin etc.

==Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:HATROTATION.jpg]]==
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:HATROTATION.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:HATROTATION.jpg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence
#[[w:public domain|Public Domain]]

*The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an [[w:open content|open content]] license like the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] licence.  If you have the '''express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence''', use the image copyright tag: {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}.  The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government .  Non-free licence governments are listed [[w:Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses|here]]. 

For any other sources of for more information see [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]].  Please remember that if you don't tag your images, they will be deleted.

::''P.S.  If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them.  Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.''

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again.

In culinary terms '''stewing'' can best be described as slowly cooking food in its own juices with the aid of a minimum amount of moistening agent in the form of stock, wine, beer, sauce, butter etc. During cooking the liquid is flavoured by extracts from the stewed food, the result is a highly flavoured liquor or sauce which forms an integral part of the stew. Throughout this process, which is generally a lengthy one, evaporation is kept to a minimum by covering the stewing vessel with a tight fitting lid and simmering the stew on top of the stove or in the oven.
	Condensation, which continually forms on the inside of the lid, acts as a self basting process keeping the food moist. If the rate of evaporation is not kept to a minimum the stew will become dry and could burn. Therefore it may be necessary to add additional liquid as needed throughout the cooking period.
	Once cooked the liquid and food are usually served together to form the complete dish. Tougher cuts of meat may be made tender and palatable by  this method. Foods for stewing are cut into small pieces or cuts before cooking and may comprise of meats, fish, vegetables and fruit.
	The flavour and colour of stock used will be determined on the type of meat to be cooked and the colour required of the finished dish, e.g. brown beef stew using brown beef stock.
	When a brown colour is required the meat and vegetables are sealed and browned in oil/dripping at a high temperature to ensure correct colour and sealing of the meat. Colour is also achieved by browning the roux and by using a brown stock. If a white coloured product is required less heat is applied to seal gently and without browning. The most suitable mediums for this process are butter and margarine. Where a roux is required it is cooked to the blond stage before being moistened with stock to effect a white colour. In some instances meats used for white stews are blanched and refreshed as a means of sealing the meat and also extracting the scum, which would otherwise discolour the resultant sauce.

Throughout cooking, items need to be checked periodically to ensure that stock levels are maintained and that food is not adhering to the base of the cooking vessel as this could result in a burnt stew. Over cooking results in unpalatable meat which breaks up, becomes stringy in texture and difficult to handle.

On completion of cooking the flavoursome liquor is adjusted for consistency. This is achieved by one of the following:
:Reducing the sauce
:Whisking in beurre manié, arrowroot or cornflour, and reboiling to cook the starch and effect thickening
:Adding demi-glace, Jus lie or veloute sauce as required by the dish in question.


Stewing meats is an economical method of cooking as it allows for the use of less expensive cuts of meat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recipe site ideas ==

A rambling note to myself... (an idea which probably ain't so good).
Perhaps we could even add a link to our user page from our favorite recipes - a section for unobtrusive signatures like this: &lt;small&gt;[[User:Singkong2005|s]]&lt;/small&gt; - then the &quot;links here&quot; thing would work. Or add a link to our &quot;favorites&quot; page - &lt;small&gt;[[User:Singkong2005/Favorites|s]]&lt;/small&gt;) - so going to our favorites page and clicking &quot;What links here&quot; will list our favorites - [[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 11:28, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

These are some recommended policies on the standards for How-to textbooks on Wikibooks.  Many of the Wikibooks on the [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|How-tos bookshelf]] were originally created on [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], and have a very non-book orientation as a result.  They were often poorly written and are more of a stub about how to do a certain task.  Originally these were permitted on Wikipedia, but it was felt that they were more book-like than necessarily an encyclopedia article, and as a result were moved to Wikibooks.

These guidelines are being written with an attempt to establish standards that this material can remain on Wikibooks, and are focused on these How-to books alone.

== How-to textbooks should follow existing policies ==

All of the current guidelines that apply to all Wikibooks, as stated on [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], including NPOV guidelines and duplicating content on other Wikimedia projects, also apply to How-to guides.  These should be educational resources worthy of being called a Wikibook.

== How to guides should be textbooks ==

Like all Wikibooks, a How-to guide should go into depth about the topic being covered.  It should be something much more than a recipe. A good how-to should include not only the steps needed to complete the task, but also information about preparation, background information about the task at hand, and tips or suggestions for improving the task. 

== Combining How-to Guides ==

Sometimes there are many individual guides that are related together, or which are all about the same general subject (fixing cars, baking, fishing, etc). These guides should probably then be combined into a single book, so that the information will be easier to find. Keep in mind that a book is not a &quot;collection of articles&quot;, but instead should have a central narrative to tie all the pages together.</text>

Whoever made the stroke order images needs to upload the correct version of ra. The image there now is not a stroke order image but a gigantic script katakana ra. [[User:Addps4cat|Addps4cat]] 14:49, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
===========================
Added correct version of &quot;Ra&quot; ^^
[[User:Xolodilnik|Xolodilnik]] 10:59 PM (NZDT), Aug 30 2006.

----
I just wanted to make it all clear. So, there're no L in japanese. So if R is written, it should e taken as L. But what about foreign words that need R. And...what if a word, a Japanese name is written in katakana with a R. Should it be R or L???

PS. I wish to extend my greatest gratitude to whoever used Latvia as an example. THANK YOU! PALDIES! ARIGATOU! SPASIBO! DANKE! ...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Monads}}

You may have noticed, whilst studying monads, that the Maybe and list monads are quite similar, in that they both represent the number of results a computation can have. That is, you use Maybe when you want to indicate that a computation can fail somehow (i.e. it can have 0 or 1 result), and you use the list monad when you want to indicate a computation could have many valid answers (i.e. it could have 0 results -- a failure -- or many results).

Given two computations in one of these monads, it might be interesting to amalgamate ''all'' valid solutions into a single result. Taking the list monad as an example, given two lists of valid solutions we can simply concatenate the lists together to get all valid solutions. In such a context, it is also useful, especially when working with folds, to require a value corresponding to &quot;zero results&quot; (i.e. failure). For lists, the empty list represents zero results. &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; is a type class which captures these features in a general way.

== Definition ==

&lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; defines two methods. &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; is the monadic value standing for zero results; while &lt;code&gt;mplus&lt;/code&gt; is a binary function which combines two computations.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class Monad m =&gt; MonadPlus m where
  mzero :: m a
  mplus :: m a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
&lt;/source&gt;

Here are the two instance declarations for &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; and the list monad:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance MonadPlus [] where
  mzero = []
  mplus = (++)
 
instance MonadPlus Maybe where
  mzero                   = Nothing
  Nothing `mplus` Nothing = Nothing -- 0 solutions + 0 solutions = 0 solutions
  Just x  `mplus` Nothing = Just x  -- 1 solution  + 0 solutions = 1 solution
  Nothing `mplus` Just x  = Just x  -- 0 solutions + 1 solution  = 1 solution
  Just x  `mplus` Just y  = Just x  -- 1 solution  + 1 solution  = 2 solutions,
                                    -- but as Maybe can only have up to one
                                    -- solution, we disregard the second one.
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, if you import {{Haskell lib|p=mtl|v=latest|Control|Monad|Error}}, then &lt;code&gt;(Either e)&lt;/code&gt; becomes an instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance (Error e) =&gt; MonadPlus (Either e) where
  mzero            = Left noMsg
  Left _  `mplus` n = n
  Right x `mplus` _ = Right x
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that &lt;code&gt;(Either e)&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; in that it represents computations that can fail, but it allows the failing computations to include an error &quot;message&quot; (often, but not necessarily, a string). Typically, &lt;code&gt;Left s&lt;/code&gt; means a failed computation carrying an error message &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Right x&lt;/code&gt; means a successful computation with result &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.

== Example: parallel parsing ==

A traditional way of parsing an input is to write functions which consume it, one character at a time. That is, they take an input string, then chop off ('consume') some characters from the front if they satisfy certain criteria (for example, you could write a function which consumes one uppercase character). However, if the characters on the front of the string don't satisfy these criteria, the parsers have ''failed'', and therefore they make a valid candidate for a Maybe.

Here we use &lt;code&gt;mplus&lt;/code&gt; to run two parsers ''in parallel''. That is, we use the result of the first one if it succeeds, but if not, we use the result of the second. If that too fails, then our whole parser returns &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- | Consume a digit in the input, and return the digit that was parsed. We use
--   a do-block so that if the pattern match fails at any point, fail of
--   the Maybe monad (i.e. Nothing) is returned.
digit :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe Int
digit i s | i &gt; 9 || i &lt; 0 = Nothing
          | otherwise      = do
  let (c:_) = s
  if read [c] == i then Just i else Nothing
 
-- | Consume a binary character in the input (i.e. either a 0 or an 1)
binChar :: String -&gt; Maybe Int
binChar s = digit 0 s `mplus` digit 1 s
&lt;/source&gt;

Parser libraries often make use of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; in this way. If you are curious, check the &lt;code&gt;(+++)&lt;/code&gt; operator in {{Haskell lib|p=base|v=latest|Text|ParserCombinators|ReadP}}, or &lt;code&gt;(&lt;|&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; in {{Haskell lib|p=parsec|v=latest|Text|ParserCombinators|Parsec|Prim}}.

== The MonadPlus laws ==

Instances of MonadPlus are required to fulfill several rules, just as instances of Monad are required to fulfill the three monad laws. Unfortunately, these laws aren't set in stone anywhere and aren't fully agreed on. The most common (but not universal) are that mzero and mplus form a ''monoid''. By that, we mean:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- mzero is a neutral element
mzero `mplus` m  =  m
m `mplus` mzero  =  m
-- mplus is associative
--  (not all instances obey this law, because it makes some infinite structures impossible)
m `mplus` (n `mplus` o)  =  (m `mplus` n) `mplus` o
&lt;/source&gt;

There is nothing fancy about &quot;forming a monoid&quot;: in the above, &quot;neutral element&quot; and &quot;associative&quot; are meant with exactly the same sense that addition of integer numbers is said to be associative and to have zero as neutral element. In fact, this analogy gives the names of &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mplus&lt;/code&gt;.

The [http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html#t%3AMonadPlus Haddock documentation] for Control.Monad quotes additional laws:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mzero &gt;&gt;= f  =  mzero
m &gt;&gt; mzero   =  mzero
&lt;/source&gt;

And the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/MonadPlus HaskellWiki page] cites another (with controversy):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(m `mplus` n) &gt;&gt;= k  =  (m &gt;&gt;= k) `mplus` (n &gt;&gt;= k)
&lt;/source&gt;

There are even more sets of laws available, and therefore you'll sometimes see monads like IO being used as a MonadPlus. Consult [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/All_About_Monads#Zero_and_Plus All About Monads] and the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/MonadPlus Haskell Wiki page] on MonadPlus for extra more information about such issues. &lt;!--''TODO: should that information be copied here?'' I don't think so, it seems a bit too digressive IMO --~~~~ --&gt;

== Useful functions ==

Beyond the basic &lt;code&gt;mplus&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; themselves, there are two other important general-purpose functions involving &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;:

=== msum ===

A very common task when working with instances of MonadPlus is to take a list of monadic values, e.g. &lt;code&gt;[Maybe a]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[a]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and fold it down with &lt;code&gt;mplus&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;msum&lt;/code&gt; fulfills this role:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
msum :: MonadPlus m =&gt; [m a] -&gt; m a
msum = foldr mplus mzero
&lt;/source&gt;

A nice way of thinking about this is that it generalises the list-specific &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; operation. Indeed, for lists, the two are equivalent. For Maybe it finds the first &lt;code&gt;Just x&lt;/code&gt; in the list, or returns &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; if there aren't any.

=== guard ===

When discussing the [[Haskell/Understanding monads/List|list monad]] we noted how similar it was to list comprehensions, but we left the question of how to mirror list comprehension filtering in the list monad hanging. The &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; function allows us to do exactly that. Our example for this section will be the following comprehension, which retrieves all [[w:Pythagorean_triple|pythagorean triples]] (that is, trios of integer numbers which taken together are the lengths of the sides for some right triangle) in the obvious, brute-force way. It uses a boolean condition for filtering; namely, Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
pythags = [ (x, y, z) | z &lt;- [1..], x &lt;- [1..z], y &lt;- [x..z], x^2 + y^2 == z^2 ]
&lt;/source&gt;

The translation of the comprehension above to the list monad is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
pythags = do
  z &lt;- [1..]
  x &lt;- [1..z]
  y &lt;- [x..z]
  guard (x^2 + y^2 == z^2)
  return (x, y, z)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
guard :: MonadPlus m =&gt; Bool -&gt; m ()
guard True  = return ()
guard False = mzero
&lt;/source&gt;

Concretely, &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; will reduce a do-block to &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; if its predicate is &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. By the very first law stated in the 'MonadPlus laws' section above, an &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; on the left-hand side of an &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operation will produce &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; again. As do-blocks are decomposed to lots of expressions joined up by &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; at any point will cause the entire do-block to become &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt;.

To further illustrate that, we will examine &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; in the special case of the list monad, extending on the &lt;code&gt;pythags&lt;/code&gt; function above. First, here is &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; defined for the list monad:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
guard :: Bool -&gt; [()]
guard True  = [()]
guard False = []
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; ''blocks off'' a route. For example, in &lt;code&gt;pythags&lt;/code&gt;, we want to block off all the routes (or combinations of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;) where &lt;code&gt;x^2 + y^2 == z^2&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. Let's look at the expansion of the above &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-block to see how it works:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
pythags =
  [1..] &gt;&gt;= \z -&gt;
  [1..z] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt;
  [x..z] &gt;&gt;= \y -&gt;
  guard (x^2 + y^2 == z^2) &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt;
  return (x, y, z)
&lt;/source&gt;

Replacing &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; with their definitions for the list monad (and using some let-bindings to keep it readable), we obtain:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
pythags =
 let ret x y z = [(x, y, z)]
     gd  z x y = concatMap (\_ -&gt; ret x y z) (guard $ x^2 + y^2 == z^2)
     doY z x   = concatMap (gd  z x) [x..z]
     doX z     = concatMap (doY z  ) [1..z]
     doZ       = concatMap (doX    ) [1..]
 in doZ
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; returns the empty list in the case of its argument being &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. Mapping across the empty list produces the empty list, no matter what function you pass in. So the empty list produced by the call to &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; in the binding of &lt;code&gt;gd&lt;/code&gt; will cause &lt;code&gt;gd&lt;/code&gt; to be the empty list, and therefore &lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt; to be the empty list.

To understand why this matters, think about list-computations as a tree. With our Pythagorean triple algorithm, we need a branch starting from the top for every choice of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;, then a branch from each of these branches for every value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, then from each of these, a branch for every value of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. So the tree looks like this:

    start
    |__________________...
    | |     |
 z  1 2     3
    | |____ |__________
    | |   | |     |   |
 x  1 1   2 1     2   3
    | |__ | |____ |__ |
    | | | | | | | | | |
 y  1 1 2 2 1 2 3 2 3 3

Each combination of x, y and z represents a route through the tree. Once all the functions have been applied, each branch is concatenated together, starting from the bottom. Any route where our predicate doesn't hold evaluates to an empty list, and so has no impact on this concat operation.

== Exercises ==
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove the MonadPlus laws for Maybe and the list monad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We could augment our above parser to involve a parser for any character:
&lt;pre&gt;
 -- | Consume a given character in the input, and return the character we 
 --   just consumed, paired with rest of the string. We use a do-block  so that
 --   if the pattern match fails at any point, fail of the Maybe monad (i.e.
 --   Nothing) is returned.
 char :: Char -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe (Char, String)
 char c s = do
   let (c':s') = s
   if c == c' then Just (c, s') else Nothing
&lt;/pre&gt;
It would then be possible to write a &lt;code&gt;hexChar&lt;/code&gt; function which parses any valid hexidecimal character (0-9 or a-f). Try writing this function (hint: &lt;code&gt;map digit [0..9] :: [String -&gt; Maybe Int]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; More to come...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Relationship with monoids ==

When discussing the MonadPlus laws, we alluded to the mathematical concept of monoids. It turns out that there is a &lt;code&gt;Monoid&lt;/code&gt; class in Haskell, defined in {{Haskell lib|p=base|v=latest|Data.Monoid}}.&lt;ref&gt;A fuller presentation of it will be given in [[Haskell/Monoids|a later chapter]].&lt;/ref&gt; A minimal definition of &lt;code&gt;Monoid&lt;/code&gt; implements two methods; namely, a neutral element (or 'zero') and an associative binary operation (or 'plus').

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class Monoid m where 
  mempty  :: m
  mappend :: m -&gt; m -&gt; m
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, lists form a simple monoid:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monoid [a] where
  mempty  = []
  mappend = (++)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sounds familiar, doesn't it? In spite of the uncanny resemblance to &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, there is a subtle yet key difference: note the usage of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[a]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, in the instance declaration. Monoids are not necessarily &quot;containers&quot; of anything, or parametrically polymorphic. The integer numbers, for instance, form a monoid under addition, with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; as neutral element.

In any case, &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; instances look very similar to monoids, as both feature concepts of zero and plus. Indeed, we could even make &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; a subclass of &lt;code&gt;Monoid&lt;/code&gt; if there was a real need to take the trouble:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 instance MonadPlus m =&gt; Monoid (m a) where
   mempty  = mzero
   mappend = mplus
&lt;/source&gt;

{{body note|Due to the &quot;free&quot; type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in the instance definition, the snippet above is not valid Haskell 98. If you want to test it, you will have to enable the GHC ''language extension'' &lt;tt&gt;FlexibleInstances&lt;/tt&gt;:
* If you are testing with GHCi, start it with the command line option &lt;tt&gt;-XFlexibleInstances&lt;/tt&gt;.
* Alternatively, if you are running a compiled program, add &lt;code&gt;{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}&lt;/code&gt; to the top of your source file.
}}

However, they work at different levels. As noted, there is no requirement for monoids to be parameterized in relation to &quot;contained&quot; or related type. More formally, monoids have kind *, but instances of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, as they are monads, have kind * -&gt; *.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikibooks hosts instructional resources ==

Since this clause of this policy statement is increasingly being used as a rationale for deleting content from this project, I think a major discussion needs to take place (again) on this topic.  Perhaps with some time passing from the original arguments and changes that were made earlier, perhaps we can hold a rational discussion on this topic.

Keep in mind that before the changes by Jimbo and Kernigh, the text of this read:

:''As a general rule, any book you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop is acceptable.''

As has been pointed out, this rule even as stated had exceptions because there was content specifically excluded, including NPOV issues, content that belonged on other Wikimedia projects, and original research issues.

As of now (March 18th, 2006), the wording reads:

:''Wikibooks hosts instructional resources.&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy. This is for textbooks. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''

My #1 objection to this change is that it was done completely by fiat without any sort of community discussion.  Certainly no &quot;community concensus&quot; that the policy should have been changed in this degree.  I want to note here I'm not suggesting that the content be reverted to the version prior to Jimbo's edit, but that a full discussion can and should take place about these changes.  

BTW, I removed the comment about Lollerpedia mainly because I felt that POV opinions about the status of the [[Jokebook]] can and should remain on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Jokebook]] and not debated in this forum.  Also, if you start adding comments about specific Wikibooks on this page it will grow to unreasonable size and is hard to generalize.

I gave a much longer and fairly good essay on this topic as marked above, and I still believe that Wikibooks can be more than simply textbooks.  The drive to delete all content on Wikibooks that is not similar to a college textbook is IMHO far too narrow of a definition.  What should the future of Wikibooks be about?  What sorts of content is acceptable?

More to the point, how do you define an &quot;instructional resource&quot;?

Here is a proposed change I would like to make to this policy, and I am seeking community input on this change before it becomes &quot;official&quot;, unlike other changes that have been made in the past:

:'''As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy.  The primary mission for Wikibooks is the creation of textbooks for instructional purposes.  A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.  Other content may exist on Wikibooks, but it should still act in a supporting role for textbooks as a general instructional resource.'''

This isn't really that big of a change, but it does define more clearly what the &quot;other&quot; content is excpect to be like.  Content similar to [[Organic Chemistry/Periodic table]] is a good example of supporting material (even though this is in an appendix of a Wikibook in this case).

Once consequence of this, however, is that content like [[Voter's Guide]], [[Colonising Mars]], and most of [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]] would be subject to deletion.  These topics have been debated before, but the big question is how do you make a policy here that permits some creativity but at the same time focuses the effort here to textbooks and textbook-like content?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:34, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldn't even try.  I don't think thats what wikibooks should be doing.  Wikibooks was made for instructional resources.  Some of those fit in a classroom setting.  Some of them are more practical knowledge (how-to books, for example).  Others are fields that don't fit in a college or high school classroom.  These items should not be excluded, just because they aren't &quot;textbooks&quot;.  Keep wikibooks as accepting non-fiction, and explicitly exclude areas we don't want.  Its always possible to add exclusions if we find more material we don't want.  Its next to impossible to remove exclusions, because a book will never grow to critical mass to see if its useful to us.  It would be deleted long before then.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

::So should we revert Jimbo's addition here?  Certainly what it means needs to be expanded a bit more somehow, even if I agree with your sentiments here.  Jimbo's wording can be, and is interpreted strictly on many VfD discussions as just textbooks alone and nothing more, with more of an attitude of going for more strictly college textbooks at that.  Wikibooks has certainly gone beyond that, and I think this official policy needs to reflect that change somehow, or some serious discussion should happen if we are to remove all non-textbook material altogether.  The two schools of thought were certainly played out with the [[Jokebook]], where the inclusionists want to keep it here, and the deletionists wanted it gone for good never to come back.  It certainly sits right on the threshold of what could be considered an instructional material by a very loose definition.

::I'm not trying to play that VfD out here again, but the point I'm making is that this is an unsettled question, and similar books are going to be popping up here on Wikibooks again and again with this issue unresolved.  It seems as though Jimbo is either undecided himself on this issue, or that it is to become a continual point of argument for Wikibooks in the future, where each borderline case is to be decided by VfD.  That doesn't sound right either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:02, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
: &quot;A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an '''existing class'''.&quot; - my big objection to this is that it effectively restricts Wikibooks to producing textbooks that somebody else has already made. It would prevent Wikibooks from providing textbooks for new and less popular technologies and fields such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inkscape Inkscape] and other up-and-coming open source software, just because they're too recent and (relatively) obscure to have been in an existing class.
: A better definition would be &quot;a textbook is a book which an official educational institution would use as a study text.&quot;.  It's fitting, but there's more room for community consensus to come to a sensible result rather than being constrained by an arbitrary line.  
: P.S. Yes, this definition still means death to the computer game guides. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 12:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Protection of minors and adult material==

I think there should be a subset of Wikibooks, a &quot;Top Shelf&quot;, that is protected (as far as protection can be guaranteed on the net). &quot;An Illustrated Guide to Photographing Hard Core&quot; would be a valid Wikibook in this age of the internet porn industry but it definitely should not be accessible to a nine year old. A book on &quot;Terrorist Methods&quot; or &quot;Domestic Explosives&quot; or &quot;Shoplifting Methods&quot; should not be available to under 18s.  They are all, probably, valid books. The Top Shelf would be implemented discretely so that, if an adult book is selected, it is held on a URL with adult ratings. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:27, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

:I disagree.  First off, having a garuntee mean anything is impossible-  we'd either need a huge number of admins, or we'd need to switch to an approval based edit system instead of a wiki.  Both of those are unacceptable answers.  

:Secondly, I do not think wikibooks should be enforcing censorship in any way.  WHo gets to decide what is &quot;objectionable&quot;?  Is any picture of the human body?  Any mention of drugs?  A discussion on how to rip a cd to mp3?  Even if we start out with a small set of things banned, it would likely increase with time.  The problem is that the people most interested in such proceedings tend to be religious fanatics-  they will use it to force their version of morality down your throat, &quot;for your own good&quot;.  Such problems end up causing more headaches than its worth.

:Finally, there's just better ways to do it.  You will *never* be able to properly protect a wiki page like that.  Claiming that you try just provides insentive for vandals to try harder.  If you want to do this, the correct way is to take static snapshots of books, so you know they aren't being changed.  I'd also claim that the best way to do this is not via wikimedia, but to let interested third parties do so-  this way wikimedia doesn't need to make censorship decisions, but instead allows whoever wishes ot do the work (hopefully multiple somebodies) to make their own decisions (hopefully slightly different ones for each).  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:17, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Where are Homer and don Quijote? ==
This is the first time i enter this site. I have seen your book categories but the most important of all categories is missing. Can anyone tell me where can I find ''literature'' books?. I searched for &quot;Homer&quot; and &quot;don Quijote&quot; with all possible spelling differences (Quijote/Qixote/quijote/quixote or Homer/homer/Homerius/homerius) but i cant find any important book here. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:200.114.190.149|200.114.190.149]] ([[User talk:200.114.190.149|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/200.114.190.149|contribs]]) 14:28, 15 April 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: Try searching at Wikisource: [[Wikisource:Special:Search/Homer]], [[Wikisource:Special:Search/Quijote]].

For previously-published source texts, you want our sister project, [[Wikisource:Main Page|Wikisource]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 14:41, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

:I would like to point out that a long-term project is to eventually have some sort of searching tool that would allow you to search content on both sites or on other Wikimedia projects.  The problem is that it is going to take some time to simply put all of this together, and for now we are concentrating on just the kinds of content on Wikibooks alone.

:There are also annotated guides about some of this literature, in the form of a textbook about classical literature.  If this is what you want, I would encourage you to start a Wikibook ''about'' '''Don Quijote''' or '''Homer''' and go into details about this literature, especially if you did it in a format similar to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] that went into depth about the characters, people, and themes of other literature.  That it couldn't be found about this more classical literature is mainly that nobody has put in the effort to write content of that nature.  Rather than complaining that it doesn't exist, it is encouraged that you do something about it and start writing content about it!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:45, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

== Expand/Clarify Dictionary Policy ==
Could an instruction to link nouns to Wikipedia be added to the &quot;Wikibooks is not a dictionary&quot; policy? --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 18:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

:I think that it is a bad idea to have all the negative &quot;Wikibooks is not...&quot; instructions full stop.

== Wikibooks would not be a repository for video game manuals ==

The following was [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=434945&amp;oldid=419429 added to the policy]:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px black; padding 0.5em;&quot;&gt;
'''Wikibooks is not a repository for video game manuals'''

Some content about video games could be appropriate, such as a textbook for an existing course on the impact of video games in our culture.  But in general, game guides are not appropriate for Wikibooks.
&lt;/div&gt;

I have removed it because it is too drastic of a change. It needs some discussion (here on en.wikibooks.org) first. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 21:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
just buzzing around and thought to throw in 2 cents. &quot;too drastic of a change&quot; is true, but more complicated than that and potentially
misleading. The original charter is &quot;textbooks&quot; and video games really never did meet those criteria. What happened was a loose interpretation of the rules, owing probably in part to wanting to have ANY material on a newly started project. Wikibooks is full of stuff which doesn't really fit the prime criteria. Again, I think a bookshelf labeled &quot;Fiction&quot; and another labeled &quot;POV&quot; are probably
very good ideas. 

Is there a wikicity on videogames that isn't too specific?
(biggest problem with wikicities, they are tiny micro-umbrellas.)

Another thought; there ought to be more than just a &quot;what wikibooks is not&quot; page, as in a &quot;where to go to contribute on topics x,y,and z&quot;
page.
Thanks fer listening...
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 21:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

I don't understand why this policy was put into place at all!  Is this an attempt to remove the video games bookshelf entirely, or is this something a little more specific.  For Jimbo to add this policy out of the blue like this, without any discussion or even what his mindset is on this issue is totally beyond reason.  Or more specifically, where do you draw the line that doesn't really get things very confused so you start throwing everything out and essentially shut down this whole project?

BTW, as has been said before numerous times, Wikicitites (or Wikia now) is not justification for having or not having a Wikimedia project.  It is a seperate website run by a seperate company and group, even though Jimbo happens to serve as the chairman of both groups, and there is some mixing of users between the two projects.  And there are contributors that will only contribute to Wikimedia projects and not Wikia ones, primarly because of the advertising issues (where Wikia has advertising and Wikimedia projects don't).

I would welcome a reasonable and thoughtful conversation about this issue, but drastic changes like this one are too much, especially if done by one person... even if that person is Jimbo himself.  Even a slight longer explaination '''here''' in this talk page would have been incredibly useful, to even explain motiviations like giving a talk or interview at such and such place, and being embaressed because some academian doesn't give credibility to Wikibooks because of the game guides.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:46, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

: I agree. If Jimbo was embarassed about some press release on Wikibooks, or if a grant was in danger because of Video Game guides, I would understand 100%. But nothing of that matter has been discussed. As said in my post in the next section; there are only 2 Jimbo posts in the past 5 months, and together, they consist of something like, 5 sentences, tops. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:17, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

Actually, in addition to ''Wikia'' http://gameinfo.wikia.com, there is ''Encyclopedia Gamia'' http://egamia.com and, as mentioned on the staff lounge, ''Strategy Wiki'' http://www.strategywiki.net &amp;ndash; the fact that Strategy Wiki is now [http://strategywiki.net/wiki/StrategyWiki:Community_Issues#Wikibooks_bans_game_guides.21 excited about guides moving from here to there] might be reason enough to have a policy against game guides. All three of these are MediaWiki and use GNU FDL.

Actually, since I work on [[NetHack]], it would be nice if I could move it to an actual gaming wiki. However, currently I have no way to delete the guide from Wikibooks if I move it, and I do not want to fork the guide. Maybe we should have a policy allowing users to delete a game guide if they want to move it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:30, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:I appreciate fully, particularly as wikibooks has ''de facto'' allowed games walkthroughs for a large part of its existence, that there are those that will be reluctant to lose them from our library. However, I think Jimbo, and the WMF, are entirely right to ask them to leave wikibooks: they need to protect WMF's non-profit status, and, in line with their charter, they need to ensure that WMF's resources are being used for educational purposes. The details are no doubt open to discussion, together with how best to remove the material, but the general principle is non-negotiable.

:To my mind, whether the precise text Jimbo added remains on the policy page or not, the issue of games walkthroughs is already covered by the bit at the top of the policy that says &quot;As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy. This is for textbooks. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.&quot; Indeed, games walkthroughs do not seem to fit within any section of the &quot;what wikibooks is&quot; part of the policy. Jimbo's request is more an, admittedly belated, request to enforce our own existing policies. Particularly bearing in mind that, although this is a request to enforce ''de jure'' policy that differs from ''de facto'' policy, it is important that enough time and consideration is given towards finding new and happy homes for the content that will be removed from wikibooks. It's also important to thank those who have contributed to them whilst they have been on wikibooks, wish them all the best in their new locations, and make clear to the contributors that they remain most welcome at wikibooks should they wish to read or contribute to textbooks.

:For Jimbo's reasoning, which includes a useful exposition of what sort of books wikibooks should be hosting see [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2006-April/002501.html this comment from Jimbo on the mailing list). It's really not too different from saying WB's content should comply with the general rule noted above, with a wide meaning given to &quot;usable in an existing class&quot;. Jimbo's email says &quot;The key point is that there have to be some kind of courses offered by some kind of serious institution of learning.&quot; It's clear that Jimbo intends &quot;some kind&quot; to be read widely -  so it would include adult learning, professional courses, etc., [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:05, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:: How come none of this has been brought up here or in the Staff lounge? If there really was some issue with the WMF's resources, I would appreciate if Jimbo said something about it. As of now, the '''only''' posts Jimbo made within the past 5 months are those two edits that Jguk pointed out a few weeks ago. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434945] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Computer_and_video_games_bookshelf&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434943]. If there was some kind of issue with the WMF, I would at least ''hope'' that Jimbo would have brought it up by now. Even the post on the mailing list doesn't mention anything about WMF.

:: If &quot;Use in a classroom&quot; is the standard of what is to be accepted in Wikibooks, does [[How To Tie A Tie]] have to go? What about [[How To Escape the Headlock]], and most of the other &quot;How To&quot; books? What about programming languages not taught in many classrooms or &quot;fun&quot; programming languages? Ex. Is a book on the BrainFuck programming language or the Unlambda programming language acceptable here?

:: What about games like [[W:Marine Doom]] or [[W:America's Army]], which was used as a teaching tool in the US Marines/Army? Or a guide to that new &quot;Brain Age&quot; for Nintendo DS? These fit the criterion for teaching tools but are probably not used in a classroom (which seems a little blurry in Jimbo's mailing list post). What about a guide on RedCode assembly language? The sole purpose of which is to play &quot;Core Wars&quot;?

:: Basically, I see this as a change *far* too drastic. It changes everything I know about [[WB:WIW]]. It seems illogical to me to include [[W:Marine Doom] but not [[W:Doom II]]. If we include [[W:Doom II]] but exclude [[W:Quake]]... If we include First Person Shooters (games ilke Marine Doom) but exclude real time strategies... well, you can see where this is going.  I really dont know where the line is drawn anymore. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:10, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

In response to Jguk, computer and video game guides (and [[Wikibooks:Games bookshelf|other game guides]], and [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|how-tos]], and [[Puzzles]]...) are allowed under these two parts of [[WB:WIW]]:

# &quot;Wikibooks hosts instructional resources.&quot; Need to know which weapon is for shooting which enemy, or how to build [[NetHack]] from source code? Those are instructions.
# &quot;Wikibooks includes books based on Wikipedia articles&quot; &amp;ndash; Because Wikipedia has articles about computer and video games, Wikibooks can have books about them.

Also, &quot;class&quot; does not refer to a formal class at a university specifically, but to any [[wikt:class|class]] of persons in general.

Because computer and video game guides are not against any existing policy at Wikibooks, we would need a new policy before we can move them away. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:28, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:We clearly have different readings of what the current wording should mean (rather than what happens in practice on wikibooks at present). But all that means is that I see Jimbo's amendment as seeking to enforce what is currently written down as policy, whereas you see it as a change both to written policy and what happens in practice. Whichever one of us is right, however, does not really matter as it does not change the fact that the President of the Wikimedia Foundation, in his role as President of the Wikimedia Foundation, has stated that going forward computer and video game guides (and other books not meeting the criteria that they must be similar to textbooks used for accredited learning of some description) should not be on wikibooks and should (within a generous timeframe) be removed. Come the end of the day, and whether you agree with it or not, his decision is final. If you have not read it yet, please see [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2006-April/002501.html Jimbo's email to me copied to the mailing list].

::I have deliberately stayed out of this issue, even though my opinion on this matter is fairly obvious.  &quot;Jimbo says&quot; IMHO is not justification any more and not legally binding ''because'' the WMF exists specifically to deal with decisions like this.  This is a policy decision that affects a good many users and is being done arbitrarily, not through some sort of community concensus process such as most of our current policies have been adopted.  If this is to be changed and accepted as an official act of the WMF, it should be done as an official action by the WMF board.  It hasn't been done that way.  If one person can add the policy change in, I, as one person, can remove it as well.  This decision IMHO is not final until it is a formal resolution by the WMF board, of which he is only the chair.  That the other members of this board may be considered puppets or mostly rubber stamp his decisions is a seperate issue.

::For some strange reason the issue of the non-profit status of the WMF is being brought up.  I am willing to argue that as a seperate issue, but my argument is that it is a non-issue because it is not going to affect the non-profit status unless you can show that the WMF is getting some sort of financial benefit for hosting these guides beyond simply an increase in voluntary donations.  This is well within the scope of the IRS guidelines for maintaining non-profit status and is clearly within the mission of the WMF in terms of being a web hosting service with a specific mission.

::I understand that perhaps he is somewhat embaressed by the issue here of video game guides on Wikibooks, but I wish he would state it as such and try not to establish such an arbitrary policy but instead try to deal with deeper issues about what the mission of Wikibooks is, rather than what it is not.  It is from this perspective that I strongly disagree with this action, and question if my involvement with this project is to continue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:37, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

:::That's wikipedia, not wikibooks. Wikipedia meets the educational mission of WMF by being an encyclopaedia, and it's reasonable to have articles on those games in an encyclopaedia.

:::: Thats not the point. Marine Doom was used by the marines to *teach* marines combat. Similarly, America's Army is used by the US army to *teach* combat situations. These are games specifically designed to teach people, and try to be as realistic simulation as possible. Unlike chess, these games are not &quot;case studies&quot; of computer science AI. But instead, they are a form of education offered by a &quot;serious institution of learning&quot; (Combat learning, yes, but learning nonetheless). Other games fall into this catagory of &quot;learning games&quot;; the history section of America's Army in Wikipedia shows this issue pretty well. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:42, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

At present our books on Doom and America's Army are just game guides though. If we had serious textbooks showing (and solely directed at) their value as teaching tools then that would be another matter. I imagine such a book would not be so interesting for gamers though (no need for cheats and all the functionality, I guess). Can you see the focus of these books changing so substantially as to meet this requirement (realistically)? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:26, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

: I could make the same argument for chess and go; they focus on the game and not on building a min-max tree for AI. Or how to build a computer openning moveset database, it only lists the classic openings to chess. (and we can go on and on about the differences between chess and video games, but that isn't the point right now)

: But America's Army amd Marine Doom is different. Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but I gather from the wikipedia article [[W:Marine Doom]] that there are cases where the US Marines basically goes &quot;Aighty privates! Your assignment for tonight is to beat mission 4 in Marine Doom&quot;. Lemme take a quote from the wikipedia article: 

:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1996, General Charles C. Krulak, Commandant of the US Marine Corps issued a directive to use wargames for improving &quot;Military Thinking and Decision Making Exercises&quot;.

:Moreover, he entrusted the Marine Combat Development Command with the task to develop, exploit and approve computer-based wargames to train U.S. Marines for &quot;decision making skills, particularly when live training time and opportunities were limited.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

: In this regards, I see a guide to Marine Doom falling under the same catagory as a guide to the TI-83 calculator. I haven't seen America's Army specifically mentioned anywhere yet as a &quot;training tool&quot;, but in the wikipedia article [[W:America's Army]], they note Rainbow Six as a training tool. 

:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2001 the Department of Defense licensed Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear from the French software company Ubisoft for training military personnel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

: Sorry if it feels as if I'm changing my argument :) (cause now the focus is on Rainbow Six), but I think the overall idea is still the same. So, unless the wikipedia article is wrong (I doubt it), Rainbow Six, the game itself, is used as the training exercize. Again, this would fall under the same catagory as a how-to guide on reading and taking notes on a textbook. The game (Rainbow Six or Marine Doom) '''is''' the learning exersize, the guide simply tells you best way to play the game. The textbook is the learning exersize, and the guide tells you the best way to read the textbook. (or a guide to shakespeare, and so on, so forth) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:37, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

::I suspect the [[Chess]] book, if it is destined to remain on Wikibooks, will continue to exist as a book that teaches chess strategy rather than an exposition on AI techniques. The question is whether there is interest in the educational community in teaching chess strategy. I don't know the answer to that question, as I don't know about teaching chess and haven't looked into it. Some questions I think we should be asking in regards to Jimbo's recent thoughts are:

::* Is the book suitable to use in a classroom setting, as the textbook for an already existing course/seminar/whatever?
::* If not, how does the book need to be modified to make it usable in that context?
::* How extensively would the book need to be changed? Is it sensible to change the purpose of the book rather than allowing work to continue on the same tack on another wiki?

::What I'm aiming at here is that we need to be paying attention to how the books are going to be used. For the academic books (and all instructional books) we shouldn't be working in a vacuum. Regardless of policy issues. --Brian Brondel 01:27, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

===Back to the Main Point===

The idea that Wikibooks can be limited by a definition that focuses solely on &quot;instructional&quot; value is doomed to failure, whether proposed by the President of the Wikimedia Foundation or not.  If there is a specific objection to &quot;game guides,&quot; that needs to be stated, and a policy based on it formulated, so that it can be tailored to inclusion of that which is accepted by the community, and exclusion of problematic contributions.  The classic example has to be the Chess wikibook, because there simply is no way such a book can be supported if the definition of wikibooks is drawn to limit them to classroom instructional materials of a normal nature.  You don't have classes on chess, in general.  And if you DO allow a book on chess to exist, how can you stop one on bridge, or go?  And once they are in place, you open up the realm of other such games.  And certainly someone can probably point to a class somewhere that deals with computer games, strategy of computer games, design and development of such games, etc.  Does that fact alone bring &quot;game guides&quot; within the policy which is proposed?

If the issue is that Wikibooks needs to be narrowed to true &quot;textbooks,&quot; then there will be a considerable amount of content here which will have to be pruned.  I brought this very subject up in here months ago with regard to someone's &quot;book&quot; on some particular type of medical &quot;treatment&quot; which they were essentially promoting through their book.  At the time, I thought it a violation of the policy on WB:WIW; I got no one who paid attention to the issue.  Wikibooks has a TON of such &quot;books&quot; and that has to be considered when deciding what to do.

But as for the specific issue of &quot;game guides&quot; and the like, it seems to me that a policy on them should be held in abeyance unless and until the broader issue of What is TRULY a Wikibook is decided, unless there is a specific concern about &quot;game guides.&quot;  If there is, let's see someone speak up about it (perhaps the important, but not yet dictatorily-powered President of the WMF?).[[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:30, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

: I have said my take on this many months ago. My argument is that game guides are more helpful to Wikibooks than they are hurtful. There are only 2/3 things they can possibly waste is bandwith and space, but so do any other book here that you don't read. (Ex: if you don't like [[German]], it can be argued that it wastes bandwith).

: Reputation is the other possible harmful side effect of the game guides. But from all the press I've read on Wikibooks, our assessment would have been the same with or without game guides. There was a quote along the lines of wikibooks has very few educational books, and the few complete books it has are game guides. We can very easily change the situation to simply wikibooks has very few educational books, but I don't think that is going anywhere.

: As for help, the effects are obvious. First off, I am a wikibooks editor because of Game Guides. Game Guides provide a safer newbie ground for editors. Few newbies have the nerve to go up to a complete book like [[German]] and make major changes or additions. But it is easy for them to add new modules and grow books such as [[Maple Story]]. With that, they gain experiance as they learn software and wikimarkup, and overall gain the skills to make those corrections they were too scared to do in the first place.

: Additionally, game guides increase the userbase of wikibooks. I don't know much about wikis and long term wiki growth, but it seems to me that a larger contributing userbase is always a good thing to a wiki. And obviously, video game editors do contribute to wikibooks, and help grow the userbase. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:49, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

=== Moving forward on this ===

:To aid discussion (and no more) I have created the page [[Wikibooks:Books possibly in contravention with WIW]] as a first shot at what books may have to be moved (although I note straight off that I imagine some of these will remain). I have also consolidated Jimbo's comments on the matter at [[Wikibooks:Comments from the President of the Wikimedia Foundation]], [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:31, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

==== Games are taught at universities ====
A variety of games are taught at a number of universities.  One example would be ''[http://education.mit.edu/11127/ Computer Games and Simulations for Investigation and Education]'' which is a class taught at [[Wikipedia:MIT|MIT]]. —[[User:MJBurrage|MJBurrage]] 15:16, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:How to program games, how to render 3D game environments, and even how to prove mathematically that solving Sudoku is NP Complete are all subjects that are taught at respectable universities. How to play the games themselves are not. Consider this akin to most hobbies or pasttimes: How to go hiking, how to watch TV, how eat snack food, etc. Making your Doritos is an excercise in nutrition, chemistry, and baking, while eating your doritos is not. see the difference? The flip side of this coin however, are other &quot;more popular&quot; games, such as chess, poker, baseball, basketball, etc. These subjects ''are taught at respected and accredited institutions'', both the theory behind them, and the strategy for playing these games. Unfortunately, this divide leaves a bit of a grey area when deciding what stays and whay goes. The powers that be have declared video-game guides are on the far side of that line, and the community at large did not muster enough support to reverse that decision (assuming such a reversal would have been possible given enough support). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:17, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:: I've lost track of how many people in this community want video games here, or at least somewhere in the wikimedia/another wiki. As for those who are arguing for Video games to leave, I have counted 4 who have made comments on removing Video Games from here. Lord Voldemort, You (Whiteknight), JGuk, and Jimbo Wales. While right now, the chances of the community reversing that decision is dwindling (many people have left instead of stay and fight), I would like to think that there was a time when there was enough support that the decision could have been reversed. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:09, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:: And I've pointed out where &quot;Marine Doom&quot; strategy technically was taught in the US Marines, and how Starcraft is taught in Korea. The &quot;Respected and Accredited&quot; institution metric fails to reject those games under that criteria, at least. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

So pages on a game are ok IF they have been used in a class, but not otherwise?  Does that mean that any game I decide to use in the college classes I teach (I am an adjunct  with the Vermont State Colleges) can then be added to WikiBooks.  That seems a little odd and hard to track/verify.  It makes much more sense to me that since games are used educationaly in a number of settings (including being played in some classes) that games in general should be allowed here.  If that is not acceptable, then all the games should go… But where to in the wikimedia set of projects? —[[User:MJBurrage|MJBurrage]] 18:35, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

With respect to computer game walkthroughs being disallowed.  How does that effect pages on board games (I had such a page summarily deleted by an admin recently) —[[User:MJBurrage|MJBurrage]] 18:46, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

==explain==
&quot;I don't understand&quot;

Gawsh, i think i do, and, i'd like to explain.

this is about the information resource function of informational engineering, and what happens if the content as a whole ends up significantly departing from what is in the libraries best interest
for convincing the general public that we are indeed a library.

Its a social and informational engineering tactic, and as such, it is remarkably sensible.

The flipside from my head is the problem of excessive exclusivity.
This is a GOOD tool for the purpose of insuring the success of Wikibooks as an information resource AT ITS CURRENT EVOLUTIONARY STATE. It is a Bad overall idea for the long term library because it
limits the scope and size of the umbrella.

The larger the umbrella, the more applications the information service has, the more clients the information service gets. 

I'd like to quote Jimbo.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have to draw a line somewhere, and we can argue internally endlessly
without getting much resolution.  So a useful technique is to try really
hard to reference some external standards.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is true; we need standards by which to generate reliable and useful information as an information service. The real question here,
is how and why and what and the particulars and details of those standards. A key issue from my perspective is the duration of implementation of an engineering tactic.

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
1. What about guides to games that are not video or computer games?
These can include guides on how to play chess and go (which we already
have), bridge, whist, etc.. together with suitable strategies;
conceivably this may also include more modern games such as risk or
monopoly or cluedo. To my mind, guides on well-known intellectual games
such as these have educational value and are worth keeping, but your
comments would be welcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My question would be whether or not there exist classes at accredited
institutions on the subject which use something similar _as a textbook_.

Notice how this works: first, we can be quite broad in what constitutes
a textbook, for example at my sister's cooking school, they use a
cookbook for a textbook, no question.

But in virtually every university, there are classes on Shakespeare
which use Hamlet as material, but not as _textbook_ per se.

I am unaware of any course at any accredited institution which teaches
risk or monopoly or clue.  Chess and go, probably, but I actually don't
know.  Doom?  No. &lt;/blockquote&gt;


For good psyche reasons, nobody writes textbooks using Doom as
a reference resource. Could it be done in theory? Sure. Not by me,
and, more to the point, what is there isn't that.

The problem we are trying to solve here is that geek pursuits are not
always scholastic, and geeks have the time and energy and motivation
to write books for geeks that aren't scholastic. Might this ever be in the pervue of Wikibooks? Maybe 10 years from now when Wikibooks
has an up and functioning library. Right now, it causes system friction. Entropy ensues.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 21:23, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
2. Your comments included a direct reference to wikibooks having
textbooks suitable for &quot;elementary school, high school, or college
courses&quot; (and I'm not sure what age groups you meant by &quot;college&quot; as it
seems to mean different things in the US from what it means in the UK).
I trust this list was not meant to be exhaustive and that you would
agree that textbooks related to professional learning (eg accountancy),
adult learning (eg cookery) and (if not covered by &quot;college&quot;) university
learning are suitable for wikibooks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes!  I think we should be quite broad about it.  The key point is that
there have to be some kind of courses offered by some kind of serious
institution of learning. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While i agree, in theory, and in principle with the engineering tactic, i think that the primary flaw is that there lacks provisos
or explanations. What problems are you trying to solve with the &quot;rule&quot; Jimbo? 

Perhaps the more important question is &quot;Can we think of some other standards which would be more inclusive and still adress the problem?&quot;

Personally, I don't think that is such a tall order. I remember a similar moment for my poor little &quot;caught in the middle&quot; brain on
Dennis Kuciniches website not so long ago. On the issue of abortion.
You see, I totally want there to never be an Abortion ever. I think
that is a great and wonderful goal. However, legislating that won't
solve as many problems as it will create, and the real solutions to the real problems are an order of magnitude more complicated than that. In order to never have abortions, you have to engineer a more
just and supportive society with also a saner approach en totalia 
to human sexuality. The problem is circular. Those persons most opposed to Abortion are incidentally those perpetuating the social
paradigm which is most responsible for Abortions as a social outcome.

::As I noted above under &quot;Wikibooks hosts instructional resources&quot;, I vote for '''&quot;a textbook is a book which an official educational institution would use as a study text.&quot;''' because Jimbo's definition would prevent textbooks being produced on things such as up-and-coming open source software, just because they're too new to have hit a classroom yet, or too specialised to warrant a localised course. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 12:14, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

:::Wikibooks policy also requires that material presented at wikibooks be verifiable, and that we do not engage in either original research nor speculation. Unfortunately, until a future peice of software ships, usage of that software is open to speculation, and any information is not directly verifiable.

== Utterly confused by specific deletion ==

Well, [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Rip_a_karaoke_cd]] was finally voted on and I thought we reached a concensus about this. But... Jimbo then said &quot;'I (Jimbo Wales) deleted it myself because it is manifestly not a textbook.'&quot;. As said in that section, I'm (very) confused by this, especially noting that that book/howto definitly falls under &quot;instructional resources&quot; IMO anyway. 

PS: I added a link here because of this adds yet again to the continuous controversy of [[WB:WIW]]. I don't know anymore what Jimbo wants. Learning to Rip Karaoke Cds aren't instructional resources, but books on Chess and Go strategy are? 

Finally, please Jimbo, at least explain your decisions a wee bit more before taking another 2/3 week or 6 month or 2 year [[Special:Contributions/Jimbo_Wales | vacation]] from wikibooks. I am willing to help out here in Wikibooks if I know what I'm doing. But these recent decisions you've made in the past few weeks totally contradict what I think Wikibooks is. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:00, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:Jimbo is looking at things in strict terms: he wants wikibooks to restrict itself to textbooks that can be used in accredited institutions, not just any BS instructional nonsense that people feel fit to unload onto the wikibooks servers. There are chess clubs and chess schools out there, and I don't know about Go, but there might be some of them as well. Much of the information on the How-Tos bookshelf is material that is covered in vocational schools and seminar programs. Ripping CD media is not taught anywhere, by anyone respectable, ever. I don't mean to sound aggressive, but the line between intolerable nonsense, and acceptable material is very wide. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]])([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:05, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

I mean, [[How To Build A Pykrete Bong]] and [[Growing Medicinal and Recreational Cannabis]] and [[How to find a book]] and [[MythTV]].

:: A little more clarification (I don't think I put it strongly enough). [[Wiki Science]] is, for the most part, &quot;BS instructional nonsense&quot; at the moment. There are no colleges or institutions that tell even teach you how to set up a Wiki server or be an admin on one; let alone the community effects of Wikis. '''But I wouldn't dare delete it''' and it is 100% a textbook that deserves to be on wikibooks. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:::The books that you listed, I think really do deserve to be deleted. Wikibooks does not need to host instruction about growing pot, or constructing bongs. In fact, i may very well nominate those books to be deleted myself soon. There are a number of nonsense books on that bookshelf, and unfortunately, we do need to clean house eventually. However, a number of books there are worthwhile, and a number of them could be taught in educational programs or vocational schools. &quot;how to find a book&quot; sounds like library science to me, which is an accredited major in many universities. &quot;Wiki science&quot; ''could be taught'' in an educational program, although it hasn't been yet. I can guaruntee you that no self-respecting school is teaching people how to make bongs out of pykrete, however. There is alot of nonsense on the how-to bookshelf, and on all the bookshelves for that matter. that does not mean that the entire bookshelf is vulnerable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]])([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:43, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

While I'm quite neutral on this topic of politics (I don't care which way, but I won't smoke personally) it is most definitly a subject that &quot;could be taught&quot; in the future. Bongs... meh, I dunno. But as an issue, I can see it as legal, and there hookah bars where Bongs are used. I'll tell you that this is the first time I've heard the word &quot;pykrete&quot;, but from what it seems, it can be taught in an Art School and a Bong for a hookah bar can be seen as a project. In that context, you can have a subject that &quot;could be taught&quot; in the future.

== The &quot;Accredited institution&quot; metric ==
Recently in VfD, a lot of deletions are being decided by the taught at &quot;Accredited institution&quot; metric that Jimbo Wales seems to use a lot as well.

While this is a very simple metric and does ''seem'' to serve Wikibooks well, I don't think it is a worthwhile argument to use for or against a wikibook.

For example: The Open Source movement in general has not been taught in any Accredited Institution that I know of, yet if a book on the Open Source movement was written, I'd keep it. (Ex: A book on the different OSS licenses or even on the movement itself as modern History).

An even better example: Wikis have not come out anywhere that I know of even in the general press and books. While I can name several books on the OSS (Open source software), I cannot name any on wikis, let alone &quot;Accredited institutions&quot;. Yet [[Wiki Science]] should stay on Wikibooks.

Naturally, these subjects &quot;feel&quot; academic, to me anyway. Why shouldn't they be in an &quot;accredited institution&quot;? Why, we can probably predict them to be school subjects in the near future. Well, first off, I'm a geek and obsessed with this stuff. And anyone else who is obsessed with OSS and wikis is also, probably a geek. But someone who isn't used to Wikis (aka, those people out there) may object to the idea that an Internet Phenomenon is a school subject. Wikis are probably classified as that thing that started up when Blogging got popular, and why, BBS (Bulleten board systems) and Usenet aren't school subjects so where would Wikis fit in?

My point is this: If we change this metric to include subjects that '''might''' be school subjects in the future, we are left with a test that is so pure bias it aint even funny. The automobile was considered a fad for many years when it first came out, and today we have college degrees offered on automobile engineering.

Whats not to say it could happen to Video Games (also, a very recent subject)? How are we to say that Video Games are not going to be considered academic art in 10 years, as [[Movie Making Manual | Movies]] and [[Wikibooks:Annotated_texts_bookshelf | Books]] are today, especially with the explosive popularity of this subject? (okay, I admit, that is a cheap shot at keeping Video games here, but the point still remains)

Leave the metric as it is, and subjects that only exist academically today, and we cut out [[Wiki Science]] and [[Programming languages bookshelf| Many programming languages ]] that are technically not taught academically today. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:54, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:I say we keep the &quot;accredited Institution&quot; metric just long enough so we can clean out some junk, and then we abandon it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]])([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:04, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

:I don't like the term so far as to determine what is accredited is very subjective, and usually a part of a mutal admiration society rather than anything really official.  Very rarely they are even government endorsed, but at least in the USA the accreditation agencies are completely independent of any government body for the most part.  I know of some universities that deliberately avoid the accrediation standards particluarly because they don't want to have a 3rd party messing with their curriculum.  They get students anyway, and don't care because they choose to be outside of the accreditation process.  The only time you really have to worry about it anyway as a student is if you choose to transfer between institutions, and my experience is that even between accredited colleges they tend to treat college credits as essentially worthless if they didn't originate at the institution that you are trying to get a degree from.  Or as &quot;empty credits&quot; that can't count toward specific graduation requirements.

:I think a much better metric is simply if you can teach a class with the content at all.  This would permit how-to manuals and stuff like working with bio-diesel production.  It would also have excluded the White Heritage Society book, as well as most of the content that has been rejected on the VfD page already.  It would be very difficult to see how you can teach a class out of the content that was in [[Jokebook]] for instance, a nagging issue for Jimbo and the other WMF board members.  Many how-to clinics are rarely accredited (take the Home Depot building classes, for instance), nor do they need to be.  But these are real classes taught by a real instructor often in a real classroom setting.  This can also include much of the adult eductional curriculum sometimes taught as a community service by some school districts, where members of the community can teach a topic to somebody else usually for free or a very nominal fee.

:When you think about Wikibooks contributors, this is IMHO the model we should be following anyway, where this is a Wiki of free content where we are trying to share knowledge about a topic to other people.  If you can't teach the subject out of the contents of the Wikibook because it is opinions alone or does not contain factual material for you to learn, how can you call it a textbook?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:28, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

::I've been using the &quot;accredited Institution&quot; metric keeping in mind all the different vocational schools out there. Vocational schools do teach a number of the subjects that a regular university or public school may not. For instance, a vocational program may very well teach a class about pykrete, but they are highly unlikely to teach a class about using pykrete to construct a bong. There are even &quot;accredited&quot; programs to teach such nonsense as astrology, even if the accrediting entity is dubious. 

::I would venture to say, however, that outside an accredited institutional setting, groups of people could sit around teaching each other how to construct a pykrete bong. Therefore, i put forward that the &quot;can it be taught&quot; metric is worthless if we don't account for the classroom setting in which it is taught. I instead would venture to say that the material must be taught (or be able to be taught) at ''a respected institution''. Senior centers teaching classes on backgammon or chess then would easily qualify. Afterschool programs teaching kids about crafts or whatever would also qualify. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:33, 11 May 2006 (UTC)
:::And for that matter, the Wikimedia Foundation teaching people about WikiScience would qualify under the ''respected institution'' metric as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:38, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: Please; explain. How does [[Wiki Science]] identify itself with a ''respected institution'' metric? I dunno about you, but it sounds a little circular logic to say that &quot;because we teach Wiki Science, it deserves a spot here&quot;. :-) We are teaching video games after all right now, as the guides are here on Wikibooks. We were teaching in the Jokebook, when the jokebook was up a few months ago. Etc. etc. 

:::: Finally: now we simply have shifted the question from the metric, to the definition of &quot;accredited institution&quot;. What is the difference between a Chess Club and a Starcraft Clan for example? From what I've seen, Koreans are [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6648934043675888354&amp;q=scv+rush crazy] about Starcraft. (If that video doesn't load, it is basically a starcraft duel with a giant crowd watching with those big #1 fingers and paint all over their faces and stuff for their favorite player. Sorry there is a Starcraft game going on :-/) I could imagine big enough gatherings for a small class on basic Starcraft strategy over there.

:::: What is different about a Senior Center teaching chess and a school club with sponsor teaching say, Video Game strategy to each other? Popularity? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::Sure, you can ''imagine'' a Starcraft strategy seminar, but I think the question is whether one actually exists. If it does, I think it would be appropriate for us to develop a textbook around the course content. If not, I don't think that would belong here. Brian Brondel 02:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::: The problem with that statement, is again. I can only ''imagine'' a seminar on Wiki Science. I've never seen one in RL before. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::Maybe there is no conceivable difference between a senior center teaching a class on chess, and a starcraft clan teaching it's members about starcraft. Judging from that video, I would say that in at least a parts of this world, people who teach starcraft effectively would be very well respected. With wikiscience, there are definately respectable people and organizations who might see fit to teach the subject: it is, after all, a respectable subject. The wikipedia/wikibooks help pages do teach about wiki science, as does Meta (in far greater detail). I would venture to say that wikimedia is reasonably respected by most people. If you follow this line of logic, we can keep the video-game guides, but we can allso effectively git rid of the drug books, the hacking books, the dating guides, and all sorts of unrespectable rubbish. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:41, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Drug books... thats a difficult one to pin down as well. For example, mixing drinks would be 100% acceptable, while MJ is boarder-line, and heroine on the side of &quot;Only in Wikibooks for the Netherlands&quot; :-p But anyway, there is no clear cut line on Drug books, as using a bong to smoke tobacco is totally legal, and &quot;respectable&quot;. 

:::::: Hacking books is also a touchy subject. The knowledge *to* hack is respectable as well. Reverse-Engineering brought us Open Office (RE the .doc file) and Samba, and is connected very very strongly to the assembly language. Computer security books would need to explicitly label common hacking attacks, and even maybe give a tutorial on how it is done.

:::::: Dating guides... well, that is rubbish :-p But looking at Wikipedia's large repository of [[W:Portal:Sexuality | Sex sex and more sex]], that may be a little difficult to hold off on. But I'd rather not have it here on Wikibooks in my opinion :-) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::::I don't think that drug books, in and of themselves need to disappear, so long as the material is looked at from an objective, professional manner. Having a book written by &quot;DJ Nuggets&quot;, using all manner of street slang is inappropriate. Hacking is another subject that I am a little touchy on, because I have done extensive work on the [[Reverse Engineering]] book, and would hate to see that one get deleted. However, I am strongly in favor of deleting or merging the [[Computer Hacking]] book, because I don't feel that book is well-written enough, or professional enough to stay here on wikibooks. As for the game guides, I don't think it necessary for there to be a class taught on every specific game in order to make the point that there are classes taught on some games. There are certainly games in this world that are taught in respected institutions: football, chess, etc. I'm sure if there was enough money and popularity to be had from teaching videogames, those games would be taught in respected institutions as well. Sexuality is another tough subject to consider, but again, if we look at it from an objective, professional point of view there shouldn't be a problem. I've been preparing an outline for such a book, to cover human sexuality from a neutral, objective point of view [[User:Whiteknight/Sexual Health|HERE on my user page]]. If I can get enough support for such a book, I would love to create it on an appropriate bookshelf. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:19, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::::: Is there some kind of policy here that prevents books from staying because they are humorous? &quot;DJ Nuggets&quot; is obviously a joke aimed at the population of who will read the book. Regardless of the little humor in and out of the book; that MJ guide was *excellent*, with more information than everything in our [[Gardening]] book combined. It was specific enough to detail the best makeup of the fertilizers for MJ.

----

The &quot;accredited institution&quot; metric is not useful. Students in accredited institutions need texts about essentially everything, including texts about how to build bombs and play video games. They need to read biased texts (violates [[WB:NPOV]]). They need to read source texts (see [[Wikisource:Main Page|Wikisource]]). They need to read (and write!) fictional works. They need to read about how to play StarCraft, not so that they can play StarCraft, but so that they can study those who do. [[StarCraft]] was within the scope of Wikibooks, and permissible by policy, before we started moving the various video game books off-wiki.

Literally, anything written in sentences can be used at an accreddited institution, except the most useless junk. We already have plenty of metrics to delete junk (&quot;no meaningful content&quot;, no &quot;soapbox&quot;, ...).

I believe that the scope of Wikibooks should be defined differently; I started working on a draft in '''[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]]''', which other users are welcome to edit (even to make it contradict with itself). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:Why would students need those things? I got through college without ever reading any Starcraft walkthroughs or books about how to build a bomb. If students need these, why aren't they at every university bookstore? I agree that anything could in theory be used in a teaching environment, but some things aren't and shouldn't be. Brian Brondel 02:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

:: And I'm sure you went through without reading advanced books on AI (unless you were a Comp Sci major) or on Game Theory (unless you are a math major). Again, as Kernigh said; this metric accepts stuff that Wikibooks doesn't allow (biased reports, such as Mein Kampf), source texts (like shakespeare) and fictional works. Additionally, this metric rejects stuff that Wikibooks *does* allow (such as [[Wiki Science]], which is technically original research and not taught at universities, and many programming languages not taught at universities. Many Universities don't teach [[Programming:Objective-C]] for example)

:: What do you call a metric that rejects what we accept, and accepts what we reject? Useless! --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:18, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

=== &quot;Respected Institution&quot; Metric ===

I feel that the metric &quot;It must be taught (or be able to be taught) at a Respected Institution&quot;, is a far better metric for material here on wikibooks then the &quot;Accredited Institution&quot; metric that has previously been put forward. Consider the fact that &quot;accredited institutions&quot; would essentially cover: colleges, universities, grade-schools, vocational schools, etc. Now, consider the list of institutions that are respected: un-accredited universities, boy/girl scouts, senior centers, home-depot instructional classes, church groups, day cares, Driver's Ed, substance abuse programs (AA, AlAnon, etc), and so forth. There is a large wealth of information that is taught by such organizations that probably deserves to be here on wikibooks. If enough people feel the same way on this as I do, i would probably like to propose an official change to current policy to reflect this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:27, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

== Original Research Clause ==

I want a little bit of clarification on the &quot;No Original Research&quot; clause here, because I am in a sticky situation. I am currently working on a number of research projects, some of which (hopefully all!) will end up being published in journals, and presented at conferences or whatever. Now, if i write up a new report on my research and publish it in an academic journal, am I then free to write about it here (citing my own artical in the journal as a reference), or Is that not allowed because it is my original research to begin with? Or, if that isn't allowed, would another wikibooks member be able to contribute content based on my published artical? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:39, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

: It would certainly be appropriate for another user to reference your writings. On WP, it might be viewed as bad form to write about yourself or a topic on which you have a vested interest. If your research is &quot;new scientific research&quot; rather than, say, historical research on a topic it would probably be inappropriate for WB by virtue of the fact that your research wouldn't be taught somewhere.

== Video game manuals ==

Having read a post from Whiteknight in the Staff Lounge, I find myself agreeing with him that the time is right for WB:WIW to explain our current position on video game manuals. I suggest, as a temporary measure, to reinstate Jimbo's addition to WB:WIW [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434945], which was to add under a heading of &quot;Wikibooks is not a repository for video game manuals&quot; the following text:

:Some content about video games could be appropriate, such as a textbook for an existing course on the impact of video games in our culture. But in general, game guides are not appropriate for Wikibooks.

Any objections? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:30, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

: Yeah, I'd just like to know how this would better Wikibooks, and then I can rest assured.--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

By removing books that are not textbooks from Wikibooks, Wikibooks will be in a position to become truly focused. This should enable us to attract more writers and readers in so that we can become a leading resource for free textbooks, which is, after all, Wikibooks' aim, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:25, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

: Thats not exactly the answer I expected :-) It doesn't answer why we couldn't attract these writers and readers while video game manuals still were on Wikibooks.

: Case in point; you (Jguk) came to wikibooks even though game manuals were still here. Do you know ''anyone'', personally or online, who would have left wikibooks because of the presence of video game manuals? I'll take your word on it (if you say so), but is seems so farfetched to me that someone truely interested in sharing knowledge would be appauled so much by Video Game manuals that he/she wouldn't contribute. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 11:06, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

: Additionally; I would be one to argue that people now know less of what we are about than before this whole video game guide thingy. Example: we were already in a process of expelling Wikiversity, and had plenty of books in [[WB:VFD]] that we knew we didn't want. We were already focused, why did we have to change?

: The metrics we used to use to judge whether a book would fail/pass [[WB:VFD]] don't work anymore. &quot;Not a textbook&quot; is such a vauge definition; and I argue that no one really knows the difference between a textbook or a non-textbook. For example: we all know that Chess Strategy is a &quot;textbook&quot; (for whatever odd reason... I guess &quot;Jimbo Says&quot; is reason enough), while you argued in [[WB:VFD]] that the pages on wireless internet aren't textbooks (and loads of other materials that *are* studied in colleges, and as a profession).

: Before we can focus on &quot;textbooks&quot;, we have to define &quot;textbooks&quot;. What classifies a textbook? Content? Or matters like layout (FAQ pages vs Book with exersizes/chapters)?

: Basically; we can sit around and try and figure out the difference between the spectrum of Go, Chess, Connect 4, Brain Age, Zelda, Tetris, Mario and Counter-Strike, or we can admit that there really isn't a difference and actually lay down a solid line one way or the other, and get rid of the confusion once and for all. (Unless you know of a difference that I don't) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 11:24, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

Wikibooks should be a repository for GUIDES and textbooks. We should ensure that we are not behind the times on this issue, soon internet games will be the principle games played on computers and users will need outside guides and eventually textbooks to deal with the laws within the games. It is interesting that there is no consensus on this issue, given this and the harmless nature of including games, Jimbo and Jguk might, perhaps, remove the ban. Please.

::I know that is the case, but I wish this whole thing would have been debated in the [[Wikibooks:Game manual guidelines]] page, with the Staff Lounge discussion folded into to this policy page.  Instead, it was argued and fought with admin tools and mass deletions, with accusations and heated words flying everywhere and people leaving the project.  That is something that should never have happened.  And frankly I think it was Jimbo who stirred the pot up with his comments, but then didn't follow up with those comments when some serious questions where raised, and the rest of us trying to &quot;divine&quot; the thoughts of Jimbo.  I hope that this project settles down to some sanity for awhile with the current status quo.  I don't like a Wikibooks that is strictly a video game walkthrough, and of that I do object.  BTW, this was something that was becoming a defacto policy even before Jimbo stirred up the pot, and would have eventually become a part of Wikibooks standards.  And as I've said repeatedly, I think video game books are being deleted because of the topic, not because of the content or its similarity to a textbook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

== Board game rules ==
What is the status of books on the rules of board games and card games?  I see that there are still a number of these, but I had a book on the rules of a board game summarily deleted earlier this year.

If it is limited to games that have been used in a class, than what if I teach it in one of my classes? (I am an adjunct with the Vermont State Colleges)

If board games rules are not acceptable here, then where in the wiki project? —[[User:MJBurrage|MJBurrage]] • [[User talk:MJBurrage|&lt;small&gt;TALK&lt;/small&gt;]] • 15:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

: This is unfortunatly one of the gray areas that I don't like about the new policy here. Arguably, it can go both sides with the current policy. Either way you do it, if an admin decides to delete the project, you can still have all the source and plaintext to your book. To my knowledge, there is no mediawiki project for games. 
: Perhaps if you said what game it is, we could help? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

The book in question (vis-à-vis the deletion) was about [[wikipedia:Formula Dé|Formula Dé]].  The linked Wikipedia article covers the game pretty well from an encyclopedic fashion, but since the games publication there were tournaments that used additional rules not found in the box.  I had originally posted the rules at Wikisource, where (based on the release date) someone alleged that there was a copyright issue.  Long story short, ''game rules cannot be copyrighted, only long text descriptions of those rules'' I had only posted the short rules, and a list of tracks, but once the copyright specter was raised my defense—including case law on the specific topic of game rules being public domain—was of no use.

When I offered to write my own explanation of the rules—not legally required for rules this short, but I wanted to keep the information available—I was told that then would be my original work and therefore not allowed at Wikisource for that reason.  In this course of events someone suggested Wikibooks, which is where I went next.  The rules were only up here for days before they were summarily deleted for being about a game.

Lastly, just to be clear, I have not actually used this game in a class.  With that line—in my previous comments—I was trying to show the flaw in the “used in a class” metric for whether a book is acceptable here. —[[User:MJBurrage|MJBurrage]] • [[User talk:MJBurrage|&lt;small&gt;TALK&lt;/small&gt;]] • 03:24, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

: ''&quot;To my knowledge, there is no mediawiki project for games.&quot;''
: I know of at least one [http://ludism.org/gamedesign/ wiki that discusses board games and card games].
: I suspect some of the other [http://wikiindex.com/Category:Games wiki for games] also discuss board games. (Some of them even use the Mediawiki software, although I don't know of any sponsored by the Wikimedia foundation).
: Even if all kinds of games were allowed at wikibooks, perhaps one of those other wiki would still be a better place for discussing those games.
: Rather than a harsh &quot;Don't talk about that here. We delete anything that mentions it.&quot;,
: perhaps it would be better to reword the policy something more like
: &quot;People at [http://wikiindex.com/Category:Games wiki for games] are happy to see people talk about games on their wiki. If you want to discuss a particular game, feel free to ask at the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge]] which wiki would be the most appropriate one. Instead of writing a game guide all by yourself on one wiki, while someone else unknowningly writes an independent guide on the same game on some other wiki all by himself, it is much more fun to collaborate on a game guide, and the results generally turn out better.&quot;

== Referencing tax-exempt status ==

This is more a debate about the unstable version.  A new clause was added that states:

:'''The Wikimedia Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization which was approved as such by application to the US Government based on a particular charter of operations, and we have NO CHOICE but to follow that charter. Details of 501(c)(3) are given at: Tax exempt status for your organization. The charter for Wikimedia is at : Bylaws of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc..'''

IMHO this is something that simply should '''''not''''' be a part of this page, ever.  For two huge reasons:

#Wikibooks is not strictly about what is legal or not legal in the USA
#This is an attempt to give specific legal advise by people patently unqualified to give it.

More to the point:  I don't think that with very few exceptions there has been any of the content on Wikibooks that would in fact violate the non-profit provisions of the IRS Internal Revenue Code, specifically section 503 (c).  The only real issue is if we are doing something that is openly promoting a commercial product or service, or supporting a political philosophy.  The NPOV policies alone more than compensate for any real issues here on this point, and are far more restricting than anything the IRS is going to be using as rationale to start requiring the WMF to pay some sort of taxes or revoking the tax-exempt status of the WMF.

Invoking the WMF charter is simply silly.  It is also something that is easily modified in the sense that it would only take a vote of the WMF board to change the charter with a filing to the State of Florida and some minor legal paperwork.  Not only that, but the charter specifically states that the WMF is for the developing of open-content written works, and then goes into some details of what kinds of stuff the WMF is doing.  Wikibooks is mentioned as an example of what could be developed, not what it is restricted from doing.  None of the content, even the [[Jokebook]], would violate this charter in the least.

Prove me wrong.  I want to see a specific example of content that would have been found acceptable even six months ago on Wikibooks that would have also violated the IRS tax code and revoked tax-exempt status for the WMF.  I don't think you can find any.  Like I said, NPOV policies as well as the specific exclusions on this page, and other policies like [[WB:FUP]] would more than be sufficient to steer us well clear of any potential violations of this tax-exempt status.  Indeed the only thing I can come up with that might even remotely cause some problems is if we started to offer for sale merchandise on this website (aka published dead-tree books).  Potentially even organizing such commercial activity might be problematic (which is one reason why I have been careful with even suggesting this).  I don't see that happening any time soon, and that activity can be easily seperated onto other servers or even into other organizations to help maintain the tax-exempt status for the WMF.

In short, let's get rid of this whole clause.  I don't know why Jimbo is raising the objection at all in the first place, and it has nothing to do with what is happening on Wikibooks.  As long as all of the content is available under the GFDL (I didn't think that was negotiable), and maintains an NPOV, we will never have to worry about violating the tax-exempt status regardless of what the content of the material is like.  And even books like [[How to cause havoc]] or even blatant pornography are already removed regularly, which would be the only other reason why Wikibooks would come under IRS scrutiny.  This is a completely unneeded and irrelevant section.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

: Agreed. Organizations can and do do things that are outside their charter; and charters can be easily changed. 501(c)(3) educational organizations have a ''very'' wide range of acceptable activities; indeed they can do just about anything except lobbying for legislation. Totally unnecessary. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:24, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

:Like it or not, there are legal issues that need to be considered. We can remove this particular clause from the policy, but the spirit of it is worth remembrance: Wikimedia is bound under a certain charter of operations, and even if we can't only consider the state of wikimedia in america, it would be very bad for everybody involved if wikimedia ran afowl of the IRS. Wikimedia is already strapped for cash and begging for donations: We don't need to lose tax-exempt status because we are filling wikimedia servers with garbage, video-game manuals, &quot;how to get a date&quot;, and instructions on making bombs and ripping Karaoke CDs. Whether you want to reference the charter or not is of no practical concern to me. But we need to understand the ramifications and restrictions of the charter lest we make too many mistakes. There are many materials that wind up here that--i think--can and should be deleted on sight. What we need to do is explicitly define what these materials are, and maybe we need to be heavy-handed at times to keep our own asses out of the fire. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

::What restrictions are we talking about that the charter imposes?  The IRS might go after the WMF if we host bomb making guides only because that is a common political tactic in America to throw on the IRS and do a hard audit if you are doing something politically incorrect.  That still has nothing to do with wheither it violates the WMF charter or not.  I can't find a single restriction mentioned in the charter that has any impact on what we as a community can or can't do, including the open welcome of such supposed garbage (to you) Wikibooks.  You are not a lawyer, nor are you really interpreting USC 501(c) here.  The legal restrictions simply are not there.  This is more an internal WMF fight over the status of Wikibooks and its relationships with other Wikimedia projects.  If there is a legal ramification to some content, it would very likely violate NPOV and copyright issues as well, which is my point.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

::I'm not claiming to be a lawyer, nor am I trying to interpret the law. All I can say is what i've seen and read here. Jimbo certainly thought that the charter and the tax-exempt status were worth mentioning in the debate, so I am inclined to believe that there is some weight to that. Again, however, i could care less whether we reference the tax-exempt status on this policy page or not. Remove it if it's misleading or unneeded or whatever. All I care is that all my hardwork on this project doesnt disappear one day because we angered somebody at the WMF or the IRS, or any other group. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
:::And I think that Jimbo was out of line to even bring that up in the first place.  It didn't have a place in the discussion (although he apparently did believe it), and from my perspective he was trying to imply that Wikibooks was established after the charter was written, and that we are somehow violating the &quot;charter&quot; of Wikibooks.  My counter-argument was that Wikibooks contributors have been narrowing the focus of this project for some time, and even the video game guides were being discussed as perhaps going too far, with some guidelines being drawn up that would have removed most of the objectionable content Jimbo wanted removed anyway.  A calm, rational discussion of the issues with easing out of the books with the participants of those Wikibooks helping to decide where the content should go if it was to be removed would have been very much worthwhile.  As it was, and being a participant in one of those video game guides, it was deleted without so much as a VfD, and certainly I didn't get a chance to even suggest an alternate site before it was moved.  The IRS isn't going to get into our internal politics in this situation, nor is it going to be a problem for the WMF either.  And this response really hasn't answered my question either.  Under the most extreme set of circumstances, what kind of content could you possibly envision that would even cause the ire of the IRS?  Perhaps a Wikibook about how to assassinate the President of the USA would get the ire of the Secret Service, who would also bring in the IRS to do a close check on what we do here.  That sort of thing has been dealt with ad nausium anyway, and would be removed by VfD as well.  Blatant political activity?  That would violate NPOV standards.  In short, the IRS will never be worried about Wikibooks because existing policies will always get rid of any content that might even come close to problems with the IRS.  Video Game guides will never be a problem, even if allowed to remain on Wikibooks.  That was my main point!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:17, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Inclusion criteria/Proposal]] ==

I have drafted up a full revision of this page on [[Wikibooks:Inclusion criteria/Proposal]]. The main difference is in approach: the idea is to define what wikibooks' inclusion criteria are, whereas the approach of the current policy is to stress the negative - saying what is excluded rather than what we stand for. I think it is better to be positive about what we are about - hence the proposal.

I have also added an &quot;enforcement&quot; section, which is largely derived from our deletion guidelines - whilst close to what happens in practice now, these are not intended to replicate our current guidelines.

I do not intend this proposal to be static - please feel free to tweak it, whilst keeping to its general spirit. Also, if Rob's proposals to have guidelines on games textbooks and how-to textbooks pass, I would suggest they are referenced here as agreed ways to interpret the rules (and remain as (official) interpretations of policy rather than be policy themselves), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Perhaps a link to Wikisource would help clarify for those wishing to create 'inappropriate' texts. ==

Much of this seems intended to keep people from misusing Wikibooks as a publishing medium for stuff that does belong in Wikisource, according to my understanding, yet nowhere do I see a link suggesting that location for such material. Would it not help and be appropriate to add such a link? It would both help those looking for such a place to publish works and help prevent inappropriate material from being published here out of a sense of &quot;well, then where CAN I put my oh-so-important online book?&quot; The name &quot;Wikibooks&quot; is rather confusing, and would more appropriately be &quot;Wikitextbooks&quot; and although I am not suggesting a change, I ''am'' suggesting that it would greatly help if Wikisource were mentioned early in this page. 

For example changing the section below as follows would answer many questions right off:
&quot;Wikibooks hosts instructional resources.

As a general rule ... existing class. ''Note that Wikisource is appropriate for a broader range of texts''.&quot; 
[italics just used to indicate suggested addition]

Question: When should I edit an enforced policy page? It suggests using this page instead, and I'm unclear on when to edit vs. use discussion page. In this case an edit would not alter the meaning of the policy so I am guessing would be appropriate, but am not sure.--[[User:Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] 22:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

:Note that this paragraph you are refering to is explosively controvercial, in part because it was edited and stated directly by Jimbo himself.  I'm not going to rehash the history of that paragraph here, but let's just say that I want to avoid making any changes on this paragraph in particular.  I'm even on record as stating I would like it reverted to what was there about a year ago, but I'm classified as too reactionary in that regard.  I believe that Wikibooks can be more than just textbooks, but that is going to rehash old arguments.  Especially changes to this paragraph, it should be made as a major policy vote for the whole project and widespread announcements.  I'm not kidding here either.
:As far as editing enforced policy changes, I've done some minor rewording of some policy pages but I've been very careful when doing so.  If there is a policy change, that should be voted on and discussed.  Adding links for the sake of advertising should be discouraged, although mentioning Wikisource explicitly in this document I think would be appropriate in the right context.  I'll try to look through here again and see where it might be more appropriate.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

== What Exactly Is Wikibooks, Anyways? ==

I always thought that Wikibooks included, for starters, video game guides.  I can understand why you cabal have deleted the game guides, IF THEY WERE SUBJECTIVE, WITHOUT VERIFIBILITY.

For example:


*Video game guides that tell a certain number of mintues to wait until you send in your forces to destroy the enemies base
:Maybe there is another way to defeat the game.
*A certain tunnel to go through, to get a powerup, when there is another way to to get the powerup
:We should explain why this certain tunnel should be used, maybe it will save you time, if it's a clockticking game, for example, or maybe it just less risky, in terms of your gamelifes.



There are should be infinite examples I could cite, but I'm not planning to grow old typing up the four corners of the world.  I believe we can extend this policy attitude to the BOOKS THAT YOU GUYS ARE DELETEING.[[w:User talk:100110100|100110100 of Wikipedia]][[User:70.74.35.252|70.74.35.252]] 03:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Wikibooks includes books based on Wikipedia articles&quot; ==

I want to remove this section, or at least trim it significantly. This section of the policy is essentially instructions for forking wikipedia articles, not part of a definition of what wikibooks is. I also feel that it's obvious that many of our books are about subjects for which there is already a wikipedia article. However, Wikipedia is not the only source for new books, and I would not even consider it to be a particularly good source at that. The section &quot;Wikibooks is not a mirror...&quot; could be expanded to say that wikibooks should not contain verbatim copies of wikipedia articles, if people feel that this is a matter that is worth being mentioned explicitly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 18:22, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:Any policy line that starts with &quot;note that&quot; should be rewritten without prejudice :). We do have a handy tool available now for copying articles for inclusion in books, of course, but the current wording does seem to suggest that we are to host &quot;Wikipedian overflows&quot;, rather than harvesting what we want from wikipedia for book-writing purposes. 
:I disagree on WP not being a good source though.

::Okay, i'll cede the point that wikipedia might make a decent source of material, but we really want to stress the fact that we are not wikipedia and that we are not just an overflow for long wikipedia pages. The average wikipedia article is simply not in a format that is suitable for becoming a textbook, although some wikipedia pages are suitable to become a page in a larger textbook.  Either way, we don't need a &quot;how to fork wikipedia content&quot; section in a policy that describes what wikibooks is, it does put too much focus where focus does not belong. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 19:36, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;What Wikibooks Includes&quot; ==

This section is terribly ambiguous and possibly self-contradictory. I will post the text of this section here, in it's entirety:
:''Wikibooks hosts educational resources. As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy. This is for textbooks. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''
The first line, &quot;Wikibooks hosts educational resources&quot; is terribly ambiguous and not even correct. We do not host &quot;educational resources&quot; in general, most such resources are better suited for wikiversity then Wikibooks. This also contradicts a later line, &quot;this is for textbooks&quot;, which is a little confusing in and of itself. 
I would like to see this section rewritten as follows:
:''Wikibooks is for textbooks, instructional guides, and manuals. These materials can be used as an accompanying guide to an existing class, a Wikiversity course, or as a tool for self-learning. As a general rule, most non-fiction books are not suitable for inclusion at Wikibooks.''
What do people think of this change? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 19:45, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

:: How about ''Wikibooks is for textbooks used in a traditional classroom, an accredited or respected institution, a home-school environment, as part of a Wikiversity course or for self-learning. As a general rule, most non-fiction books are not suitable for inclusion.'' --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:11, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

:::I only want to add the terms &quot;instructional guides and manuals&quot; to the proposal to stem concerns over the non-traditional definition of &quot;textbook&quot; that we tried to employ in the unstable branch of the policy.

:::: I disagree, a lot of books are textbooks and I see no need to add those two terms. I don't know of any instructional guides or manuals that are hosted on Wikibooks. What about, to borrow from your next concern, ''Wikibooks is for textbooks and annotated texts.

As a general rule, most non-fiction books are not suitable for inclusion.'' --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:48, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

The software books are really instructional guides. The problem here, as usual, is the definition of &quot;textbook&quot;. I believe a textbook can be:

# A classic textbook for secondary school studies. These are what people often imagine to be &quot;true textbooks&quot;.
# A mainstream textbook for a university/college course (&quot;Fundamental University Mathematics&quot;).
# A supplementary text, in the style of a textbook, for university modules (&quot;A Guide to Mollusca&quot;). These are what university students call &quot;textbooks&quot;.
# A supplementary text for school use (eg: &quot;A history of slavery in the USA&quot;).
# A guide for a practical course (&quot;Repairing 1960's sports cars&quot;)
# A supplementary text for a practical course (&quot;Making Chippendale Chairs&quot;).
# A guide to textbooks and guides or a guide for courses (&quot;French Assistant's Guide&quot;).

Ultimately a textbook is simply a '''book that can be used in a course of study'''. I think we should simply accept any fact book that does not breach this excessively: &quot;A description of my back yard&quot; or &quot;My Indian Holiday&quot; would be disqualified but if Bill Clinton wrote &quot;Sex in the White House&quot; it would be a supplementary text for late twentieth century studies.  

My suggestion is to say in &quot;What Wikibooks includes&quot;:

''Wikibooks includes any book that can be used in a course of study.''

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:01, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

:I'm not sure I see how that really differs from the statement &quot;Wikibooks contains textbooks, '''instructional guides''', and manuals&quot;.

== &quot;Wikibooks includes annotated texts&quot; ==

This section is another one that I feel doesnt belong here, at least not as it is now. We already have a policy [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]], and I dont think we need to duplicate that material here. I would like to delete most of the information in this section, except for the following:
:''Although we do not permit verbatim copies of pre-existing works, we do permit annotated texts, which are a kind of text that includes an original text within it and serves as a guide to reading or studying that text.
:''Annotated editions of previously published source texts may only be written if use of the source text does not constitute a copyright infringement.'' 
The rest of this section really has more to do with enforcement or other information that has nothing to do with this policy. The rest of the relevant information is already located at the annotated texts policy page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 19:52, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Wikibooks is not a general repository for nonfiction works&quot; ==

I would like to either remove this passage from the &quot;What Wikibooks is Not&quot; section, or else modify it substantially. The fact that wikibooks is not a general repository for all non-fiction books has already been mentioned in the section &quot;What Wikibooks Includes&quot;, and does not need to be repeated. The current text of this section is as follows:

:''All works here must conform to Wikimedia-wide policy of NPOV, no original research, etc. As such, the vast majority of books which you would find on the nonfiction shelves of a book store are not appropriate for Wikibooks.''

I would like to delete this section, and merge the contents of it into the &quot;Wikibooks is not a Soapbox&quot; section (to cover the issue of NPOV), and merge the remainder into the &quot;Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works&quot; section (to cover the NOR requirement). Doing this will leave the meaning of the document in tact, but will make it more readable and less redundant. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:07, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

:'''Done'''. Because all this information is already duplicated, and it's removal doesnt change the policy whatsoever, I have gone ahead and made this change. I didn't merge any of the sections, because the existing sections were better written then the stuff I deleted. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:07, 5 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

And, by the way, I don't know why the author of this page has chosen a Catullus' ''carmen'' (14b) which is incomplete. In fact the above cited phrase lacks of its final part and therefore has not a complete sense. I guess this is because you've mistaken the meaning of ''forte''. The right translation would be:

== The term &quot;Extinct Langage&quot; ==

I think that it is a mistake to use the term &quot;Extinct Langage&quot; in reference to Latin, as it IS spoken regularly in Vatican City and is the official language there. Besides, it still exists. If it exisits, it isn't extinct. Therefore, I propose something like &quot;Latin was originally the language poken by the ancient Romans, but it is now only spoken in Vatican City.&quot; - or something similar (someone smarter than me will have to come up with the wording.) Any thoughts?--[[User:Sowsearsoup|Sowsearsoup]] 03:23, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

:The current version of the module states that Latin is &quot;endangered.&quot; While it may not be completely extinct (it has speakers, if no native ones), it could hardly be called &quot;endangered&quot; in the sense that most endangered languages are endangered, as it is in no risk of dying out altogether in the near future. Therefore, while calling it &quot;extinct&quot; or &quot;dead&quot; may be unsatisfactory, calling it endangered is potentially misleading to the reader--[[User:Arminius|Arminius]] 00:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

The translation of the line &quot;''ei mihi, quod domino non licet ire tuo!''&quot; as &quot;Go on - go to the city forbidden to me - forbidden to your master&quot; seems a little strange. Why is &quot;''mihi''&quot; translated as serving the same grammatical function as &quot;domino...tuo&quot;? Could &quot;''mihi''&quot; be translated as a Dative of Reference, and the line thus be rendered as &quot;Go for me [i.e. &quot;in my place&quot;], because it is not permitted for your master to go&quot; (I'll admit that this isn't the most flowing translation, of course)?

''An inertial reference frame is a collection of objects that have no net motion relative to each other. It is a coordinate system defined by the non-accelerated motion of objects with a common direction and speed.''

:It always puzzles me what an inertial reference frame is. It is certainly not a collection of objects as the first sentence states. It is indeed meant to be a coordinate system that is not accelerated, and hence is in rest or moves with constant velocity, as one might think.

Hi there. These are good points.  The definition was very weak.  I looked through the web and found tremendous confusion on this issue. Most of the definitions were circular (ie: they assume SR to define an inertial reference frame). The best, non-circular definition that I could find was by Blandford and Thorne and has been included both as a summary sentence and as a full-length quote. Weyl (Space, Time, Matter) also says the same over a couple of pages. Carroll, a prominent cosmologist, gives a similar definition to that of Blandford and Thorne:

&quot;Let us consider coordinates (t, x, y, z) on spacetime, set up in the following way. The spatial coordinates (x, y, z) comprise a standard Cartesian system, constructed for example by welding together rigid rods which meet at right angles. The rods
must be moving freely, unaccelerated. The time coordinate is defined by a set of clocks which are not moving with respect to the spatial coordinates. (Since this is a thought experiment, we imagine that the rods are infinitely long and there is one clock at every point in space.) The clocks are synchronized in the following sense: if you travel from one point in space to
any other in a straight line at constant speed, the time difference between the clocks at the ends of your journey is the same as if you had made the same trip, at the same speed, in the other direction. The coordinate system thus constructed is an inertial frame.&quot;
Carroll, S.M. (1997) Lecture Notes on General Relativity. http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9712019

I would have used Carroll's definition but for the fact that he does not specify '''Einstein Synchronisation'''.

Relativity holds that moving objects are not attached to any inertial frame of reference but their own rest frame(i.e.: the clocks go out of sync relative to other inertial frames of reference etc.).

Incidentally, the current Wikipedia definition: &quot;an inertial frame of reference is one in which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line.&quot; and the oft quoted &quot;an inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which Newton's First Law is valid&quot; are bizarre because a reference frame is a coordinate system, not a physical law.  It may well be the case that where clocks remain synchronised and rods remain the same length at all positions Newton's first law of motion applies but in invoking Newton we are assuming Noether's insights and relativity prior to deciding how we can make the measurements on which these theories are based!

==Introduction ==

Special relativity (SR) or the 'special theory of relativity' was developed by Albert Einstein and first published in 1905 in the article &quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;. It replaced Newtonian notions of space and time and it incorporates Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. The theory is called &quot;special&quot; because it applies the principle of relativity to the &quot;restricted&quot; or &quot;special&quot; case of inertial reference frames in 'flat' spacetime where the effects of gravity can be ignored. Ten years later, Einstein published his general theory of relativity (general relativity, &quot;GR&quot;) which incorporated these effects.

Beginners often believe that special relativity is only about objects that are moving at high velocities.  This is a mistake.  Special relativity applies at all velocities but at low velocity the predictions of special relativity are almost identical to those of the Newtonian empirical formulae. Special relativity introduces a deeper understanding of why physical events happen.

This book is intended for undergraduates but can be used by anyone with a higher school level of mathematics. It is arranged in two sections, a general description and a mathematical description of the theory. As a &quot;Wikibook&quot; it is not complete and the next edition can be edited by anyone who feels they have spotted a mistake or wishes to add more detail and clarity.

I have a replacement intro at [[Special Relativity: Introduction | here]] [[User:EvanR|EvanR]] 10:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

==Reference frame and coordinate system==
In general relativity it is important to distinguish reference frames (inertial, flat, curved, etc) from coordinate systems (rectangular, polar, Boyer-Lindquist, etc). It might be helpful to add some text defining these two terms, giving examples of how they are different, and explaining why it is important. I understand the difference myself, somewhat, but not enough to write any good text to describe this. [[User:Kwan3217|Kwan3217]] 04:39, 8 August 2007 (UTC)

==another view==
''“Einstein extended the principle of relativity by proposing that the laws of physics are the same regardless of the inertial frame of reference.”''

I would not call this an ''extension''. It is more of an “interpretation”, however severely incomplete: in addition, laws of physics must refer to ''relative'' velocities only, so that ''predicted observations'' are the same regardless of the inertial frame chosen to describe an experiment.

Indeed the principle of relativity of movements stipulates that ''only relative motion has a reality''. Therefore the representation of an object as being at rest or in motion results from a pure ''convention'' and should have no impact on predicted observations. For the purpose of describing an experiment where objects are in relative motion, ''one must first adopt a convention about what is fixed and what is in motion'', and then apply laws of physics within this framework.

One may decide to change this convention, leading to another description of the experimental pattern. But according to the principle of relativity of movements the same laws of physics shall apply and the same observations will be predicted within the new framework ''provided all relative velocities are maintained unchanged'' through the change of convention… Otherwise it would not be true that only relative motion has a reality.

From the above one can clearly see why it is not sufficient to require that the same laws apply: they must refer to ''relative'' velocities only.

When swapping from one convention to another, all velocities are affected by adding the same vector '''v''', more precisely the mathematical representation of the velocity of every object is affected by this vector, leaving the relative velocities between objects unchanged. Of course the same system of coordinates can be used for the mathematical representation of both frameworks…

In this context it is correct to state that '''v''' marks the difference between both conventions, between both frameworks used for applying laws of physics. However it would not make sense to imagine the “conventions” being in relative motion, or telling that one goes faster than the other, or claiming that one can be at rest.

Should you try and replace the word “convention” by “reference frame”? If it has any bearing to the principle of relativity of movement, a ''reference frame'' must relate to the motion of objects, not to their position. A change of convention concerning what is moving and what is at rest (a change of ''reference frame'' then), must remain independent from a change of positions, the latter being obtained through a change of the ''coordinate system'', another arbitrary ''convention'' according to the principle of relativity of positions in space.

== For readers who do not already know what you mean ==

The current text says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The velocity transformations for the velocities in the three directions in space are, according to Galilean relativity:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and then it goes on to list: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'_x = u_x - v}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

etc. The problem for the beginning reader is that s/he does not know where the &quot;U&quot; factors are coming from. Even though it is easy to argue that the stated form of something is defensible if correctly understood, it would be better to avoid creating a stumbling block for the beginning reader -- especially in regard to something that already has the reputation of being incomprehensible. It only costs the writer a moment to define terms. Failing to do so could discourage a reader for a lifetime.

== Confusion ==

I've been trying to understand the problem mentioned in the [[Special_Relativity: Principle_of_Relativity#Frames_of_reference.2C_events_and_transformations|text]] for nearly an hour. It's not clear from the illustration's text that the coordinates (x,y,z,t) and (x',y',z',t') refer to the event and not the observers. It's also unclear that the two observers are at the exact same point at t=0.

Thank you for pointing this out.  I have extended the text.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RobinH|contribs]]) 18:29, 1 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

In order to live, organisms need to get Energy. '''Energy''' is defined as ''the ability to do work.'' Animals like you and me get energy by eating food.

Both a wagon rolling down a hill, and a boy chasing after the wagon are using energy. This kind of energy is called ''kinetic energy''. '''Kinetic energy''' is the energy of motion.

If the boy catches the wagon and sits it on top of the hill again, the wagon has what we call ''potential energy''. '''Potential energy''' is stored energy. Just a little push and the wagon will roll down the hill again.

The food we eat also has potential energy. The energy is stored and just a little push will release that energy so that we can use it to power ourselves. 

==What is metabolism?==
Every living organism is made up of chemicals. When we grow we must make ourselves bigger by putting those chemicals together to make larger molecules that we call ''macromolecules''. Hair is made of a macromolecule called a ''protein''. When we grow hair, we are building those hairs inside the cells of our body. Making hair requires energy and raw materials. We get those by breaking down the molecules in the food that we eat.

Therefore in every cell of our body, molecules are being broken down to provide energy and built up to make parts of ourselves every moment of every day. All of these reactions together are called our '''metabolism'''.

==Metabolism = Catabolism + Anabolism==
Metabolism is made of the reactions that tear molecules apart called ''catabolism'', and reactions that build larger molecules called ''anabolism''. Catabolic reactions tend to release energy, while anabolic reactions require energy to work. Living organisms use the power of catabolic reactions (such as breaking down food) to drive their anabolic reactions ( such as making hair). This happens even on the small scale where individual anabolic reactions are ''coupled'' together with catabolic reactions that will drive them.

==Where do cells get energy?==

The major food of cells is the sugar '''glucose'''. Cells break down sugar to make energy. Organisms that can make food are called ''autotrophes'' which means &quot;self feeders&quot;. Organisms that eat other organisms are called ''heterotrophes''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Determinative article (the) / L'articolo determinativo ==

The English article ''the'' has several translations into Italian, according to:
* gender: masculine or feminine
* number: singular or plural
* initial of the following word

&lt;b&gt;Basic articles:&lt;/b&gt;
 Masculine singular: il
 Masculine plural: i
 Feminine singular: la
 Feminine plural: le

Articles must have the same gender and number of the referred noun.

&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 Il ragazzo (''the boy'')
 La ragazza (''the girl'')
 I ragazzi (''the boys'')
 Le ragazze (''the girls'')

When the following word begins with z, s+consonant, gn, pn, ps or x, the masculine article is changed as follows:

&lt;b&gt;Masculine articles before impure consonant sounds:&lt;/b&gt;
 Masculine singular: lo
 Masculine plural: gli

&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 Lo zio (''the uncle'')
 Gli zii (''the uncles'')

When the following word begins with a vowel, articles are changed as follows:

&lt;b&gt;Articles before a vowel:&lt;/b&gt;
 Masculine singular: l' (lo)
 Masculine plural: gli
 Feminine singular: l' (la)
 Feminine plural: le

The form l' is not colloquial, it is the normal form even in very polite and refined speech.

&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 L'orso (''the bear'')
 - plural: gli orsi (''the bears'')
 L'arma (''the weapon'')
 - plural: le armi (''the weapons'')

Note that when the vowel is an i pronounced as a semi-vowel, lo and la are used, eg lo iodio, la iarda.
== Indeterminate and Partitive Articles (a/an) / Gli articoli partitivi e indeterminativi (un/uno/una) ==

&lt;b&gt;Basic indeterminate articles:&lt;/b&gt;
 Masculine singular: un
 Masculine singular: uno (For impure consonants z, s+consonant, gn, pn, ps, x)
 Feminine singular: una (un' is written when the following word starts with vowel, do not confuse with masculine un!)

These articles do not have any plural but instead the &lt;b&gt;Partitive Article&lt;/b&gt; can be used. These articles all have the meaning of &quot;some&quot; and they are similar to some prepositions but they are not prepositions, they work like articles.

&lt;b&gt;Partitive articles or plural indeterminative:&lt;/b&gt;
 Masculine plural: dei
 Masculine plural: degli (For impure consonants z, s+consonant, gn, pn, ps, x)
 Feminine plural: delle

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tiger System Preferences Appearance.png|thumb|800px|center|Fig. 1 - The Appearance pane of System Preferences.]]

The Appearance pane of System Preferences lets you adjust the little bits and pieces of the Mac interface. While the changes can be seen as minor, they can make a big impact on your Mac's feel.

The most important controls are the two pop-up menus at the top. 

The first is &quot;Appearance&quot;, which controls the color of accents in Mac OS X. The default setting, &quot;Blue&quot;, is a bit of a misnomer. Not every accent in Mac OS X is blue (for instance, the buttons in window title bars are red, yellow, and green). It would be much better to call this setting &quot;Color&quot;. When this pop-up is set to &quot;Graphite&quot;, the life is sucked out of the Mac interface. Buttons, scrollbars, the Apple menu, etc. all turn a shade of grey.

This is a very niche option. The colored accents in Mac OS X are very appealing, and almost all users prefer to leave them turned on. Graphite is mainly used  among graphic designers, who find extra color distracting and unprofessional. When used together with a neutral Desktop Picture, Graphite gives your Mac a very serious air.

The second pop-up menu lets you choose a highlight color, used when selecting text, windows in Exposé, files on the desktop, etc.

Other options let you customize how scroll bars work, how many items appear in  &gt; Recent Items, and how fonts are smoothed. These options are pretty self-explanatory.

The Dashboard and Exposé pane is used to set shortcuts that let you access both Dashboard and Exposé. The default shortcuts are:

*All Windows - F9
*Application Windows - F10
*Desktop - F11
*Dashboard - F12

Using the four pop-up menus at the bottom of the window, you can assign any one of these functions to any &quot;F&quot; key. You can also assign it to the command, option, shift, or control keys, because there are two of each of these keys: if you assign Dashboard to the right shift key, then you can still use the left shift key for its normal purposes.


{{Mac Trick Box|You can also add a modifer key and an &quot;F&quot; key together to make a keystroke. While choosing a key, hold down one or more modifier keys and watch what happens to the pop-up menus.}}


The top half of the window lets you assign features of Mac OS X to corners of the screen. Drag your mouse into the corner you chose, and the feature you assigned will activate. You can assign each corner to activate one of the following:

*Exposé All Windows
*Exposé Application Windows
*Exposé Desktop
*Dashboard
*Start Screen Saver
*Disable Screen Saver (as long as you leave your cursor in the corner, your screen saver will not start)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Good basic article.  Perhaps an expanded section on the types of fat being used would be helpful in the variations section.

Different fats are commonly substituted by weight.  Their effect on the finished crusts are subtle but noteworthy.

Butter contributes flavor and color from browning.

Vegetable shortening (ex. Crisco) gives flakiness and a longer shelf life.  It contains potentially unhealthy trans-fats, compared to the saturated fat of other solid fats.

Lard gives the tenderest flaky crust.  However, the crust will have the shortest shelf-life and the pie is best eaten within hours of baking.

Margerine is inexpensive.  The hard stick margerine must be used as the softer types are either whipped (increasing volume) or contain water/oils that affect baking.  Hydrogenated margerine can contain trans-fats. [[User:Rthoughts|Rthoughts]] 01:54, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

It is unclear how much dough to make for a one-crust pie vs. a two-crust (covered) pie.

== Vodka ==

I noticed an NPR piece interviewing Chris Kimball, who suggests using vodka in pie crust to add liquid without adding water. The recipe is [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97330375 here]. I haven't tried it but it makes a lot of sense and Cooks Illustrated has a great track record on good recipes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Programming?==
Programming is the ability to get a computer to perform tasks by writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute.  You must remember that the only language a computer understands is binary, a combination of 1s and 0s.  This section looks at how we can write instructions and get the computer to understand those instructions.

==Programming Languages==
When computers were first developed in the 1940s the only way to send instructions to them was by sending them 1s and 0s through flick switches and buttons. Even though the process of sending a computer instructions got better evolving through punch cards, paper tape, magnetic tape and disks, the language computers understand has not changed from the pattern of 1s and 0s, &lt;b&gt;machine code&lt;/b&gt;.  However the way humans construct these 1s and 0s has gotten easier.

===Levels of Programming Language===
High/Low level programming languages are terms used to describe how abstracted the language is from the raw machine code and hardware manipulation. Whether a language is high or low level is purely subjective towards the comparison made. Assembly is considered a low level language but is a higher level language than machine code as it resembles English more closely.  B.A.S.I.C is even further abstracted and can thus be considered a high level language.

====Machine Language - First Generation====
The 1s and 0s that a computer can understand and execute

 100100101110101000101011010010100101

It is very difficult for humans to understand and difficult to write unaided.  Machine code tends to be produced for a specific hardware set up and thus it is not portable to different machines.

====Low Level Language - Second Generation====
In a low level language the programmer controls and specifies the specifics of how to handle the data, where to store it, how to access it and so on. 
Assembly is said to be a low level language. Here is a source extract to print &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the screen

 ; This program displays &amp;quot;Hello, World!&amp;quot;
 dosseg
 .model small
 .stack 100h
 
 .data
 hello_message db 'Hello, World!',0dh,0ah,' '
 
 .code
 main  proc
       mov    ax,@data
       mov    ds,ax
 
       mov    ah,9
       mov    dx,offset hello_message
       int    21h
 
       mov    ax,4C00h
       int    21h
 main  endp
 end   main

|}

====High Level Language - Third Generation====
A high level programming language is one in which the specifics of data handling and manipulation is abstracted away (more so than in a low level language). A high level language generally has more built in functionality than a lower level language and is closer to English for a person to understand.
C++ is considered a high language. Here is the source to print &quot;Hello World!&quot;.

 #include &amp;lt;iostream.h&amp;gt;
 using namespace std; 
 int main()
 {
     cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;;
     return 0;
 }
 //Note: This code may or may not be compilable, as it varies between compilers and platforms.

|}

===Program Translators===
We already know that computers can only execute Machine Code, so we need a way to convert from 2nd and 3rd generation languages to 1st generation, machine code.

There are three different methods that you may have to use. Assemblers, Compilers and Interpreters

====Assemblers====
When using Assembly language you will have to use an Assembler. The Assembler will take the assembly code and convert it into the corresponding Machine Code 1s and 0s (actually current flowing and current off).  There is a one to one correspondence between a single assembly language instruction and a machine code instruction. In general there will be one line of Machine code produced per line of assembly language.  This translation or conversion is called 'assembling' and is performed by a piece of software called an assembler before execution of the code can take place.

====Compilers====
When using a high level language you will have to use a compiler to turn your code into the corresponding machine code.  This is done using a compiler and performed before the execution of the code.  A program like a PlayStation computer game will be written in a High level language and compiled into machine code.  This code will then be burnt to disk at the factory and sent to the shops, when you buy it and place it in the DVD drive of the PS2, the processor will execute the machine code.

====Interpreters====
Another way of running code written in High level languages is to use an interpreter.  This will convert the code you write in machine code for the processor to execute.  However the difference here is that the code is converted into machine code as you are running the program, so the code is interpreted only when you need to run it, line by line.  This can be much slower than compilation but allows for you to correct errors in the code (debugging) when you meet them.  It is also used in common languages like Java and allows you to run the same code on multiple hardware set ups as long as you have an interpreter for that hardware.  Think along the lines of running the same Java Application on Linux, Windows and your mobile phone.

====Comparisons====
You may be asked in the exam which translator you would recommend, here are a few things to think about
* If the code is in Assembly Language (2nd Generation), then you will use an Assembler
* If you want the fastest code you will use a compiler
* If you want the code to be able to run on multiple machines you will need an Interpreter
* If you want to debug code and not have to recompile with every change you make, you want to pick an Interpreter


==Programming Concepts==
In this module we will be looking at '''Imperative languages''', Imperative languages are languages that execute one line after another, take this example for instance
 int x = 1;
 x=x+1;
 x=x+1;
 x=x+1;
 cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x = &quot; &lt;&lt; x; // print x
 
output:
 x = 4

Declaring a variable then assigning a value to that variable is called '''Assignment'''
 int x;
 x = 45;  // this is assigning the value 45 to the variable x

There are other sorts of languages that you will meet in module 4, but for the moment you only need to know about imperative languages.  You will not need to know a particular language for the exam but knowing the concepts behind them and how to understand the pseudo code is essential - '''pseudo code''' is close to a third generation language, which is understandable what it should do to you and me, but probably wouldn't run on a computer.  This section will now outline a few of the concepts you need to understand

===Type Definitions===
You may have met datatypes in GCSE when using databases or spreadsheets.  The idea behind them is to use a type of data to store information that best matches the data you want to store.  In computers this is incredibly important as you are trying to make the best use of the computing resources available, so picking the data type that matches the information you are declaring will be the most efficient way of storing the data.  For example if you want to store a number you don't want to use a data type that can also store letters and other characters as this would be a waste of space. e.g.
 3 stored in ASCII is 0010 0011
 3 stored in pure binary is 0011, thus saving 4 bits

In any programming language you generally have 4 different data types. 
* Integers
*: Integers are whole positive numbers, but unlike in maths the integer range will have limitations to the maximum number. The limitations can vary greatly.
*: e.g. ''104''
 int x = 45;  //declares an integer called x and sets the value to 45
* Strings (Characters)
*: Strings are a collection of single block characters. e.g. 
*: e.g. ''as54sfgjf/.dfg4''
 string x = &quot;herman&quot;;
* Booleans
*: Booleans are variables that are like on/off switches and can only equal one of two values.
*: e.g. TRUE/FALSE  ON/OFF 1/0
 bool x = TRUE;
* Pointers
*: Pointers are an advanced variable type. A Pointer is a 32bit or 16bit or 64bit number (depending on the environment), this number represents a single block in your computer memory. In essence it points to this memory block because you know that it is the nth memory block. Pointers are probably the most useful variable type however you may or may not come across them depending on what language you are using and how high/low level it is.  You do not need to know about pointers for module 1.

There are also other datatypes that languages may possess, such as:
* Character
*: The Character data type is a single character.
*: e.g. ''g''
 char x = 'g';
* Real
*: Real is a more advanced number system than integer, allowing for rational and irrational numbers, decimal places and negatives
*: e.g. ''-12.3231''
 real x = -23.432;
* Array
*: Arrays are collections of other datatypes, generally able to store only one datatype, for example an array of type string may look like this:
*: ''(red, green, orange, blue, brown)''
 array x = new array (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;)// declare array with five elements, each of type string.  
*: Think of an array as a spreadsheet; you have the array (x), which is like a spreadsheet file, and you have the columns inside, e.g. x[2] (array x, 'column' 2). This is a one dimensional array.  A two dimensional array would be where you have rows; e.g. x[2,3] (array x, column 2, row three).  One can have, in theory, as many dimensions in an array as one likes.

===Variables===
In mathematics the idea of variables are introduced. Variables in a program are very similar EXCEPT that they may equal different values at different times of the program (this is why indeed they are called variables, they vary).  They are used to store values that may be needed for the program, you can declare variables of any of the data type declared above.  Think of them as a box with a name, you can change the contents of the box and look inside to see the value at any time:
 int x = 5;
 print x;
 x = 104;
 print x;
 x = 32;
 print x;
output:
 5 104 32
Depending on the programming language you may or may not have to declare variables (in Basic you don't in C you have to). Declaring variables is simply telling the compiler/interpreter that you want to use a variable with that name.

====Global and Local Variable====
Dependent on where a variable is declared,the variable can be seen by other elements of the program code. There are two types of variable declarations, that is the &lt;b&gt;Global&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;Local&lt;/b&gt; variables.

&lt;b&gt;Global variables&lt;/b&gt; are declared in the root area of the program code, that may be right at the beginning of the code (in C for example).  The values stored in these variables will be accessible from any area of the code.  This can be useful if you need to access a variable from anywhere in the program, but if you declare global variables when you don't need to access them all the time, they will sit and take up main memory, thus wasting precious computing resources.  Use with care.

&lt;b&gt;Local variables&lt;/b&gt; are declared in a sub area of the program code, this may be in a function or procedure.  The values stored in these variables will only be accessible from the sub program they are declared in.  This can be friendly on computing resources as they are declared when the sub program is called, used, and when the sub program is exited, destroyed.  So you only use main memory when you need to store the variable and it does not waste main memory like global variables do.  However if you think you will need to variable outside the sub program you should think of using a global variable.

An easy way to think about local and global variables is to think of them as local and global TV channels.  Global channels such as Fox and MTV can be accessed from anywhere in the world, but local TV channels such as Channel 5 or Yorkshire TV, can only be accessed in certain areas.

Special cases could be where you declare a global variable called ''holder'', if you then call a sub routine and in this routine there is a local variable declaration of another ''holder'', you do not overwrite the global variable.  What happens is for the duration of the sub routine the local variable holder is in charge, when the sub routine exits, the local variable is destroyed and the original value of the global variable now becomes dominant. Take this code for example

code:
 main program code
  int holder = 4
  print holder
  ...
  subroutine caller
     int holder = 9
     print holder
  end subroutine
  ...
  run caller
  print holder
 end main

output:
 4 9 4

[['''Rule of thumb:''']]
If you want to quickly tell the difference between a global and a local variable use these quick rules.
*If a variable is declared inside a function or a procedure it is a '''local''' variable
*If a variable is declared inside a iterative or selective statement it is '''local'''
*If the declaration is indented from the left hand boundary it probably meets one of the above criteria and is '''local'''
*If it meets none of the above statements and is declared in the main body of code it is a '''global''' variable

===Constants===
Constants are like variables in their declarations and the ability to look at the value stored inside them, however you can not change the values, the value of a constant remains, constant.

 constant int x = 34;
 print x
output:
 34

===Order of Operation===
===Program Design===
There are several very useful programming statements that you can use.  You probably use these in your everyday lives with out even thinking about it

===Selection===
An important part of programming is the use of selection, that is the ability to do something if a certain criteria is met. This may be as simple as increasing your health bar in a computer game if you eat a chicken drumstick or inserting the cooling rods into the nuclear reactor if the temperature exceeds a certain value.

[[Image:If-Then-Else-diagram.svg|200px]]
The most common selection statement is the '''if statement''', the idea is that you compare a value to some criteria, if the value and criteria match then you proceed in a certain way, otherwise you do something else.
For example:
 If '''Hungry''' Then
 '''Eat'''
 Else
 ''''Go Out''''
 End

[[Image:CASE-IF-THEN-END_flowchart.png]]
The other type is the '''Case statement''', this can be summarised by several if statements where the value is compared to several criteria and the action of first criteria matched is performed, otherwise a default action may be performed.
 Case '''Enter Restaurant and pick up menu'''
 If '''Egg and Chips available''' Then
 '''Order Egg and Chips'''
 End If
 If '''Pie and Chips available''' Then
 '''Order Pie and Chips'''
 End If
 If '''Curry and Chips available''' Then
 '''Order Curry and Chips'''
 End If
 If '''Pizza and Chips available''' Then
 '''Order Pizza and Chips'''
 End If
 Default
 '''Leave hungry'''
 End

===Iteration===
An incredibly important part of computing is the idea of iteration, that is repeating the same thing again and again.  You probably use iteration every day. Take writing lines in a detention for example; you write some lines, check to see if you have met the line limit, and if you haven't you write some more lines, check if you have met the line limit and so on, until you do meet the line limit and then you can stop.  There are three main sorts of iteration.

[[Image:While-loop-diagram.svg|201px]]
The while loop:
For example:
 While '''Hungry''' Do
 '''Eat'''
 End

[[Image:Do-while-loop-diagram.svg|200px]]
Another type of while loop is a Do-While loop.  This is slightly different from the While loop in that you perform the task ''before'' you check that you have to perform the task:
 Do
 '''Eat'''
 While '''Hungry'''
 End

[[Image:For-loop-diagram.png|200px]]
The most complicated tool you may meet is the for loop.  This is a glorified While loop and don't be put off by how complicated it looks.
 For ('''start with Empty stomach''', '''Is stomach empty?''', '''Eat''')
  '''Wipe mouth'''

====Procedural Code====
Procedures and Functions are very slightly different.  Functions return a value whilst Procedures do not.  An easy way to remember this is by saying that functions are fun, if you call them they will send you something back, procedures return nothing.

Functions - note the return value
 code:
 a = addtogether(2,3) + 4
 print (a)

 output: 
 9

Procedure - note the lack of value returned by the procedure
 code:
 addtogether(2,3)
 proc addtogether(a,b)
  {
   print(a+b)
  }

 output: 
 5


To communicate between different parts of the program and to pass variables to the functions and procedures we use '''Parameters'''.  For example

 Function addtogether (number1, number2)
  {
   return: number1+number2
  }

where this code will add together the numbers 1 &amp; 2.

====Object Oriented Code====
=====Structural Concepts=====
======Methods======
======Objects======
======Call Stack======

[[Category:A-level Computing|Introduction to Programming]]
FIXME Expand this article.
NB I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information here, nor how relevant it is to the A Level Syllabus.  It is worth knowing, anyhow.  if it makes no sense to you then there are plenty of tutorials out there!

Object Orientated code is code which forms resides in blocks.  An '''object''', such as a '''class''' is declared, similar to how one would declare a variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    class myClass {
      
      public:
      
      void SayHello(string text) {
        cout &lt;&lt; text;
        return void;
      }
    
    } anInstanceofmyClass myClass;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code declares an '''object''' (of type class) called myClass.

Within myClass a function is declared called SayHello(text), with protection level public (as opposed to '''protected''', or '''private'''.  Protection layers are effectively the same thing as local and global terms as used for variables.  'Public' means that the function is global, and can be accessed wherever an instance (creation) of the class exists.  An object (by which I mean a variable, class, structure or any defined thing in memory) declared with modifier 'private' can only be used, called or accessed by something in that class, e.g. if I declared a private variable in myClass called text it could only be accessed by another Object within myClass, such as the SayHello() function.  '''Protected''' is the protection modifier in between '''public''' and '''private'''.  It can only be accessed by something within the same class, ''or by an object within a class derived from its class''.  '''Derivation''', or '''Inheritance''', as it is more often called, is a powerful feature or Object Orientated Programming (OOP), which basically means passing on the objects in one class to a 'child' class.  The child class can have its own objects, as well as the objects it received from as many 'parent' classes as required.  It can also redefine these objects within itself, e.g. SayHello() no longer takes a variable, it prints the text &quot;hello&quot; on the screen without input.  I hope this is all making sense to you!

After the class is defined, as instance (Object) of the class is created, called anInstanceofmyClass.  One can create as many instances of a class as one likes, e.g.
anInstanceofmyClass1, anInstanceofmyClass2, anInstanceofmyClass3 myClass;
To call the SayHello() function, one would type anInstanceofmyClass.SayHello(&quot;Hello Text&quot;);
anInstanceofmyClass1.SayHello(&quot;&quot;) and anInstanceofmyClass2.SayHello(&quot;&quot;) both do the same thing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== NullPointerException calling WebService with Axis ===
If you get an exception like the following:

  Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
    at java.util.Hashtable.put(Hashtable.java:396)
    at com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.SAXParserImpl.setProperty(SAXParserImpl.java:395)
    at org.apache.axis.encoding.DeserializationContextImpl.parse(DeserializationContextImpl.java:246)

    at org.apache.axis.Message.getSOAPEnvelope(Message.java:376)
    at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invokeEngine(Call.java:2583)
    at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:2553)
    at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:2248)
      ... 5 more

It's most likely because you are using Java 1.5 with Axis 1.1. If you want your client to run on Java 1.5, you will need to upgrade to Axis 1.2RC2.

=== SAXParseException when using HTTPS ===
If, in WebObjects 5.4.x, you get an exception connecting to your web service via HTTPS (through the WebObjects Apache adaptor) and get an error like the following:

  org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Premature end of file.
    at org.apache.xerces.util.ErrorHandlerWrapper.createSAXParseException(Unknown Source
    at org.apache.xerces.util.ErrorHandlerWrapper.fatalError(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLErrorReporter.reportError(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLErrorReporter.reportError(Unknown Source)
    at org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLVersionDetector.determineDocVersion(Unknown Source))
      ... more

You will need to add additional information to the file server.wsdd to tell Apache AXIS what to do when it believes the transport mechanism is 'https.' AXIS will make this determination based on the HTTP header information forwarded by the Apache WebObjects adaptor. If no entry is made to tell AXIS how to handle 'https', it will assume the incoming data from the adaptor is encrypted via SSL, even though the communication between the adaptor and the instance is in the clear. To change the behavior of AXIS, change the file server.wsdd from:

 &lt;transport name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;
  &lt;requestFlow&gt;
   &lt;handler type=&quot;HTTPActionHandler&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;handler type=&quot;URLMapper&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/requestFlow&gt;
 &lt;/transport&gt;

To:

 &lt;transport name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;
  &lt;requestFlow&gt;
   &lt;handler type=&quot;HTTPActionHandler&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;handler type=&quot;URLMapper&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/requestFlow&gt;
 &lt;/transport&gt;
 &lt;transport name=&quot;https&quot;&gt;
  &lt;requestFlow&gt;
   &lt;handler type=&quot;HTTPActionHandler&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;handler type=&quot;URLMapper&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/requestFlow&gt;
 &lt;/transport&gt;

== Wet under the ears... ==

I am new in Wikibooks.

I got drawn here because of the topic on the &quot;new&quot; Filipino alphabet; wondering, how we now pronounce &quot;c&quot;,&quot;f&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;ñ&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot;.

It is very ''interesting/thought-provoking'' that the current pronunctiation is taken directly from the English language. Is this the pronuctiation sanctioned by the ''KWF (Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino)''?

I've been looking for boks from KWF that I can buy online or here in the States. Got any suggestions?

I am native Tagalog speaker and was educated with the &quot;abakada&quot;.  I just find it a little unsettling.  

But, I know, I'll get used to it.

== penultimate or ultimate? ==

:It is usually omitted on words that are stressed on the penultimate syllable; talagá.

Do you mean ''stressed on the '''ultimate''' syllable''? That is where the accent mark is in this word.

:It indicates that there is a glottal stop at the end of the word and that penultimate syllable receives stress; akalà.

So the stress is aKAlà?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikiversity ==
Hello Dcljr,

I apologise for stating my position forcefully before contacting you.

You made some tweaks to the front page of Wikiversity which are probably mostly improvements because I did not notice anything objectionable except:

you inserted a phrase stating that materials were wanted only from teachers &lt;b&gt;not students&lt;/b&gt;.  I would like this phrase deleted or a correcting bullet added to this page immediately.

This a very large error that gives a totally incorrect impression of Wikiversity.  Some of us intend to start with whoever shows up and proceed.  If a student chooses to publish his chemistry, college literature, or phy. ed. game rules and asks me for assistance in improving and placing them along a learning trail I intend to help them out because their use of site is &lt;b&gt;supercritical&lt;/b&gt; to its success.  Wipipedia succeeded because it attract the assistance of hundreds of thousands after it hit critical mass and some of its initial contributors when it was at 39K were uninformed dilletantes like me or lower level students.

We can certainly discuss it some more if you disagree but I would appreciate at least the countering view added alongside your current interpretation of what we intend to do at Wikiversity if it is approved by the Board.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

I go now to see if I can find an admin to make the change as I realize you may be an infrequent user or on wikibreak or unavailable for a few days and I view this as important.   Please take no offense and merely make the changes requested at bottom of the discussion page if you get there first.  Thanks!  [[user:lazyquasar]]

::I have responded to your response there. 8)  We have some further work.  It appears perhaps the root of the problem is our personally interpretation of &quot;course notes&quot;.  In the U.S. schools I attended  at the high school level &quot;course notes&quot; or &quot;student notebooks&quot; were graded in &quot;college prep or track&quot; classes and typically up to ten to fifteen percent of the course grade.  They were explicitly expected to be personal notes and not merely large verbatum chunks of repetition of available materials.  Later in the college the term &quot;course notes&quot; was also used for a comprehensive set of handouts to a course typically available from a copy center for a charge.  Clearly these are instructors copyrights and may not be posted without permission of the copyright holder.   The term &quot;course notes&quot; was also used synonymously with &quot;notebook&quot; after the course was completed and the student notebook was presumed to be a complete snapshot of the course presented as interpreted by the student creator of the set of study materials.

== Anonymous Editing ==

I appreciate the information [[user:Dcljr]] but I often prefer to be editing anonymously.  If someone sees a mistake or has better wording they are welcome to change it.  I experienced a rather severe level of wiki stalking early in Wikipedia's startup and have no desire for all of my inputs to be easily targeted by my editing handle. In my view people often need to learn to evaluate the content rather than who provides it. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 03:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

VMS Is an operating system introduced in 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation which ran on their VAX Minicomputer.  The VAX was the upgrade to the successful PDP-11.  It's processor (VAX-11/780) supported five different levels of operation:
1. PDP-11 emulation mode.  In this mode the processor would run PDP-11 code in a native environment.
2. User mode.  This is the mode in which applications would work.  They could not affect higher levels, other process spaces, etc.
3. Supervisor mode.  This is the level at which the command line interface (CLI) also nowadays referred to as a shell would run.
4. Executive mode.   This mode provided enhanced and lower level access to file and record management systems.
5. Kernel mode.  In this mode running code had full access to the system.

By making the processor protect the level of the running process, true interprocess security and buffer overrun exploits became impossible.

The VAX-11/750 offered a scaled down version of the same.  The VAX-11/730 offered an ever lower version, and finally the VAX 11-720 was the lowest of the low.

Following this successful series, DEC released the VAX-8600 series (later upgraded to include the 8650).

DEC's first VMS supporting systems which did not do PDP-11 emulation mode were the 8700/8800 series, and eventually an entire line of MicroVAXen, VAX workstations (&quot;VAXstations&quot;), etc.

VMS relied on the multiple levels of access to automatically prevent exploits the rest of the world had yet to encounter.

VMS used memory mapping with virtual page tables (now used in Windows 2000, and Windows XP) with page table entries (&quot;PTEs&quot;) indicating the virtual to physical page mapping, status (paged out, paged in, valid, ready to read or write, etc.) and when a process ran out of the amount of memory it was allowed to occupy (its &quot;working set&quot;) it would put its memory into the swapfile on disk, a process called &quot;swapping.&quot;

Device drivers started simple in the PDP-11 emulation days and became two-layer in the 90s.  Drivers that had multiple physical layers were broken into &quot;port/class&quot; drivers.  A class driver was a higher layer driver that implemented the common functionality across the differing ports.  A port class driver specifically addressed a particular port type.  Exemplifying this is the TTY driver, which was recoded as a CLASS (serial terminals) driver and PORT drivers (serial port, telnet port, console port, port over DEC's LAT protocol, etc.)

While the VMS CLI (DCL, &quot;Digital Command Language&quot;) was not multitasking per process, a software product produced by David Kashtan and Kenneth Adelman called &quot;Eunice&quot; offered a replacement CLI (&quot;shell&quot;) for VMS which provided Unix-functionality.  Pipes, redirection, forking, etc., were all available in a standard shell.  This product was bought by The Wollongong Group.

VMS was the first major OS to actually restrict its users and processes when resources were still available.  This prevented unexpected DoS due to lack of resources, and yet led to many efficiency discussions about best use of resources.

VMS was ported to the Alpha architechture in 1991, and DEC entered the 64 bit age.  They shortly collected a lot of money from Microsoft as they discovered Windows/NT had a VMS4.0 kernel equivalent in it, courtesy of recently departed DEC Engineer Dave Cutler.  DEC was purchased by Compaq in 1998.  In 2002 Compaq and Hewlett-Packard merged.

Banks, hospitals, and other highly mission critical application users rely on OpenVMS daily in 2008.

== Random examples ==

Here are a handful of uses of random numbers by example

{{HaskellExample|Ten random integer numbers|2=
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import System.Random

main = do
   gen &lt;- newStdGen
   let ns = randoms gen :: [Int]
   print $ take 10 ns
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The IO action newStdGen, as its name implies, creates a new StdGen pseudorandom number generator state. This StdGen can be passed to functions which need to generate pseudorandom numbers.

(There also exists a global random number generator which is initialized automatically in a system dependent fashion. This generator is maintained in the IO monad and can be accessed with getStdGen. This is perhaps a library wart, however, as all that you really ever need is newStdGen.)

Alternatively one can get a generator by initializing it with an integer, using mkStdGen:

{{HaskellExample|Ten random floats using mkStdGen|2=&lt;pre&gt;import System.Random

randomList :: (Random a) =&gt; Int -&gt; [a]
randomList seed = randoms (mkStdGen seed)

main :: IO ()
main = do print $ take 10 (randomList 42 :: [Float])&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

Running this script results in output like this:

&lt;pre&gt;[0.110407025,0.8453985,0.3077821,0.78138804,0.5242582,0.5196911,0.20084688,0.4794773,0.3240164,6.1566383e-2]&lt;/pre&gt;

{{HaskellExample|Unsorting a list (imperfectly)|2=&lt;pre&gt;import Data.List ( sortBy )
import Data.Ord ( comparing )
import System.Random ( Random, RandomGen, randoms, newStdGen )

main :: IO ()
main =
 do gen &lt;- newStdGen
    interact $ unlines . unsort gen . lines

unsort :: (RandomGen g) =&gt; g -&gt; [x] -&gt; [x]
unsort g es = map snd . sortBy (comparing fst) $ zip rs es
  where rs = randoms g :: [Integer]&lt;/pre&gt;}}


There's more to random number generation than &lt;code&gt;randoms&lt;/code&gt;.  You can, for example, use &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; (sans 's') to generate a single random number along with a new StdGen to be used for the next one, as well as randomR and randomRs which take a parameter for specifying the range. See below for more ideas.

== The Standard Random Number Generator ==

The Haskell standard random number functions and types are defined in
the Random module (or System.Random if you use hierarchical modules).
The definition is at http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/random.html,
but its a bit tricky to follow because it uses classes to make itself 
more general.

From the standard:

 ---------------- The RandomGen class ------------------------
 
 class RandomGen g where
   genRange :: g -&gt; (Int, Int)
   next     :: g -&gt; (Int, g)
   split    :: g -&gt; (g, g)
 
 ---------------- A standard instance of RandomGen -----------
 data StdGen = ... -- Abstract

This basically introduces StdGen, the standard random number
generator &quot;object&quot;.  It's an instance of the RandomGen class which specifies the operations other pseudorandom number generator libraries need to implement to be used with the System.Random library.

If you have r :: StdGen then you can say:

   (x, r2) = next r

This gives you a random Int x and a new StdGen r2.  The 'next' function is
defined in the RandomGen class, and you can apply it to something of type
StdGen because StdGen is an instance of the RandomGen class, as below.

From the Standard: 

 instance RandomGen StdGen where ...
 instance Read      StdGen where ...
 instance Show      StdGen where ...

This also says that you can convert a StdGen to and from a string, which
is there as a handy way to save the state of the generator.  (The dots are not
Haskell syntax.  They simply say that the Standard does not define an
implementation of these instances.)

From the Standard:

 mkStdGen :: Int -&gt; StdGen

This is the factory function for StdGen objects.  Put in a seed, get out a
generator.

The reason that the 'next' function also returns a new random number
generator is that Haskell is a functional language, so no side effects
are allowed.  In most languages the random number generator routine has
the hidden side effect of updating the state of the generator ready for
the next call.  Haskell can't do that.  So if you want to generate three
random numbers you need to say something like

   let
      (x1, r2) = next r
      (x2, r3) = next r2
      (x3, r4) = next r3

The other thing is that the random values (x1, x2, x3) are random
integers.  To get something in the range, say, (0,999) you would have to take
the modulus yourself, which is silly.  There ought to be a library routine
built on this, and indeed there is.

From the Standard:

 ---------------- The Random class ---------------------------
 class Random a where
    randomR :: RandomGen g =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; g -&gt; (a, g)
    random  :: RandomGen g =&gt; g -&gt; (a, g)
 
    randomRs :: RandomGen g =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; g -&gt; [a]
    randoms  :: RandomGen g =&gt; g -&gt; [a]
 
    randomRIO :: (a,a) -&gt; IO a
    randomIO  :: IO a

Remember that StdGen is the only instance of type RandomGen (unless you 
roll your own random number generator).  So you can substitute StdGen 
for 'g' in the types above and get this:

   randomR :: (a, a) -&gt; StdGen -&gt; (a, StdGen)
   random  :: StdGen -&gt; (a, StdGen)

   randomRs :: (a, a) -&gt; StdGen -&gt; [a]
   randoms  :: StdGen -&gt; [a]

But remember that this is all inside *another* class declaration &quot;Random&quot;.
So what this says is that any instance of Random can use these functions. 
The instances of Random in the Standard are:

 instance Random Integer where ...
 instance Random Float   where ...
 instance Random Double  where ...
 instance Random Bool    where ...
 instance Random Char    where ...

So for any of these types you can get a random range.  You can get a
random integer with:

   (x1, r2) = randomR (0,999) r

And you can get a random upper case character with

   (c2, r3) = randomR ('A', 'Z') r2

You can even get a random bit with

   (b3, r4) = randomR (False, True) r3

So far so good, but threading the random number state through your entire
program like this is painful, error prone, and generally destroys the nice
clean functional properties of your program.

One partial solution is the &quot;split&quot; function in the RandomGen class.  It
takes one generator and gives you two generators back.  This lets you say
something like this:

   (r1, r2) = split r
   x = foo r1

In this case we are passing r1 down into function foo, which does
something random with it and returns a result &quot;x&quot;, and we can then take
&quot;r2&quot; as the random number generator for whatever comes next.  Without
&quot;split&quot; we would have to write

   (x, r2) = foo r1


But even this is often too clumsy, so you can do it the quick and dirty
way by putting the whole thing in the IO monad.  This gives you a standard
global random number generator just like any other language.  But because
its just like any other language it has to do it in the IO monad.

From the Standard:

 ---------------- The global random generator ---------------- 
 newStdGen    :: IO StdGen 
 setStdGen    :: StdGen -&gt; IO ()
 getStdGen    :: IO StdGen
 getStdRandom :: (StdGen -&gt; (a, StdGen)) -&gt; IO a


So you could write:

   foo :: IO Int
   foo = do
      r1 &lt;- getStdGen
      let (x, r2) = randomR (0,999) r1
      setStdGen r2
      return x

This gets the global generator, uses it, and then updates it (otherwise every
random number will be the same).  But having to get and update the global 
generator every time you use it is a pain, so its more common to use getStdRandom.  
The argument to this is a function.  Compare the type of that function to that of 'random' and
'randomR'.  They both fit in rather well.  To get a random integer in the
IO monad you can say:

   x &lt;- getStdRandom $ randomR (1,999)

The 'randomR (1,999)' has type &quot;StdGen -&gt; (Int, StdGen)&quot;, so it fits
straight into the argument required by getStdRandom.

== Using QuickCheck to Generate Random Data ==

Only being able to do random numbers in a nice straightforward way
inside the IO monad is a bit of a pain.  You find that some function deep inside your
code needs a random number, and suddenly you have to rewrite half your
program as IO actions instead of nice pure functions, or else have an
StdGen parameter tramp its way down there through all the higher level
functions.  Something a bit purer is needed.

If you have read anything about Monads then you might have recognized the
pattern I gave above:

   let
      (x1, r2) = next r
      (x2, r3) = next r2
      (x3, r4) = next r3

The job of a monad is to abstract out this pattern, leaving the programmer
to write something like:

   do -- Not real Haskell
      x1 &lt;- random
      x2 &lt;- random
      x3 &lt;- random

Of course you can do this in the IO monad, but it would be better if
random numbers had their own little monad that specialised in random
computations.  And it just so happens that such a monad exists.  It lives
in the Test.QuickCheck library, and it's called &quot;Gen&quot;.  And it does lots
of very useful things with random numbers.

The reason that &quot;Gen&quot; lives in Test.QuickCheck is historical: that is where it was invented.  The purpose of QuickCheck is to generate random unit tests to verify properties of your code.  (Incidentally its very good at this, and most Haskell developers use it for testing).  See the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck QuickCheck] on HaskellWiki for more details.  This tutorial will concentrate on using the &quot;Gen&quot; monad for generating random data.

Most Haskell compilers (including GHC) bundle QuickCheck in with their standard libraries, so you probably won't need to install it separately.  Just say

 import Test.QuickCheck

in your source file.

The &quot;Gen&quot; monad can be thought of as a monad of random computations.  As well as generating random numbers it provides a library of functions that build up complicated values out of simple ones.

So lets start with a routine to return three random integers between 0 and 999:

 randomTriple :: Gen (Integer, Integer, Integer)
 randomTriple = do
    x1 &lt;- choose (0,999)
    x2 &lt;- choose (0,999)
    x3 &lt;- choose (0,999)
    return (x1, x2, x3)

&quot;choose&quot; is one of the functions from QuickCheck.  Its the equivalent to randomR.
The type of &quot;choose&quot; is

 choose :: Random a =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; Gen a

In other words, for any type &quot;a&quot; which is an instance of &quot;Random&quot; (see above),
&quot;choose&quot; will map a range into a generator.

Once you have a &quot;Gen&quot; action you have to execute it.  The &quot;unGen&quot; function executes an action and returns the random result.  The type is:

 unGen :: Gen a -&gt; StdGen -&gt; Int -&gt; a

The three arguments are:

# The generator action.
# A random number generator.
# The &quot;size&quot; of the result.  This isn't used in the example above, but if you were generating a data structure with a variable number of elements (like a list) then this parameter lets you pass some notion of the expected size into the generator.  We'll see an example later.

So for example:

 let
    triple = unGen randomTriple (mkStdGen 1) 1

will generate three arbitrary numbers.  But note that because the same seed value is used the numbers will always be the same (which is why I said &quot;arbitrary&quot;, not &quot;random&quot;).  If you want different numbers then you have to use a different StdGen argument.

A common pattern in most programming languages is to use a random number generator to choose between two courses of action:

 -- Not Haskell code
 r := random (0,1)
 if r == 1 then foo else bar

QuickCheck provides a more declarative way of doing the same thing.  If &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; are both generators returning the same type then you can say:

 oneof [foo, bar]

This has an equal chance of returning either &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;bar&quot;.  If you wanted different odds, say that there was a 30% chance of &quot;foo&quot; and a 70% chance of &quot;bar&quot; then you could say

 frequency [ (30, foo), (70, bar) ]

&quot;oneof&quot; takes a simple list of Gen actions and selects one of them at random.  &quot;frequency&quot; does something similar, but the probability of each item is given by the associated weighting.

 oneof :: [Gen a] -&gt; Gen a
 frequency :: [(Int, Gen a)] -&gt; Gen a

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Wikibooks. I hope you enjoy your time here.

Just one quick note, if I may - we don't usually create pages just to leave them blank. Instead we tend to leave red links (as are in your [[Backgammon]] main page) to indicate that nothing as yet has been written about the subject, and to encourage others to help write on the topic. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 09:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

:I should have added that our naming policy for new books is that they should use back-slashes for pages, not colons. (See [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].) So it would be [[Backgammon/Introduction]] rather than [[Backgammon:Introduction]]. This also has the benefit of automatically creating a backlink to the [[Backgammon]] page on each other page of the book. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 09:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:OpenOffice.org Calc.png|thumb|OOo Calc]]
== What is Calc? ==
Calc is the spreadsheet component of OpenOffice.org (OOo). You can enter data, usually numerical data, in a spreadsheet and then manipulate this data to produce certain results.

Alternatively you can enter data and then use Calc in a ‘What If...’ manner by changing some of the data and observing the results without having to retype the entire spreadsheet or sheet.

== Spreadsheets, sheets and cells ==
Calc works with elements called ''spreadsheets''. Spreadsheets consist of a number of individual ''sheets'', each containing a block of cells arranged in rows and columns.

These cells hold the individual elements—text, numbers, formulas etc.—which make up the data to be displayed and manipulated.

Each spreadsheet can have many sheets and each sheet can have many individual cells. In version 3.0 of OOo, each sheet can have a maximum of 65,536 rows and a maximum of 1024 columns.

You can enter data into Calc in several ways: using the keyboard, the mouse (dragging and dropping), the Fill tool, and selection lists. Calc also provides the ability to input information into multiple sheets of the same document at one time.

After entering data, you can format and display it in various ways.
A ''function'' is a pre-defined calculation entered in a cell to help you analyze or manipulate data in a spreadsheet. All you have to do is add the arguments, and the calculation is automatically made for you. Functions are the main reason for spreadsheets. If you understand functions, then you can start to use the real power of a spreadsheet.

== Understanding functions ==
Calc includes over 350 functions to help you analyze and reference data. Many of these functions are for use with numbers, but many others are used with dates and times, or even text. A function may be as simple as adding two numbers together, or finding the average of a list of numbers. Alternatively, it may be as complex as calculating the standard deviation of a sample, or a hyperbolic tangent of a number.

Typically, the name of a function is an abbreviated description of what the function does. For instance, the FV function gives the future value of an investment, while BIN2HEX converts a binary number to a hexadecimal number. By tradition, functions are entered entirely in upper case letters, although Calc will read them correctly if they are in lower or mixed case, too.

A few basic functions are also represented by symbols. For instance, SUM, which adds arguments, can also be entered as + while PRODUCTION, which multiplies arguments, can also be entered as *.

Each function has a number of ''arguments'' used in the calculations. These arguments may or may not have their own name. Your job is to enter the arguments needed to run the function. In some cases, the arguments have pre-defined choices, and you may need to refer to the online help or Appendix B (Description of Functions) in this book to understand them. More often, however, an argument is a value that you enter manually, or one already entered in a cell or range of cells on the spreadsheet. In Calc, you can enter values from other cells by typing in their name or range, or—unlike the case in some spreadsheets—by selecting cells with the mouse. Should the values in the cells change, then the result of the function is automatically updated.

Strictly speaking, when all the arguments are entered and a function is ready to run, it becomes a ''formula''. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but the distinction is worth preserving, because a formula can use functions as an argument.

For compatibility, functions and their arguments in Calc have almost identical names to their counterparts in Microsoft Excel. However, both Excel and Calc have functions that the other lacks. Occasionally, too, functions with the same names in Calc and Excel have different arguments, or slightly different names for the same argument—neither of which can be imported to the other. However, perhaps nine-tenths of functions can be imported between Calc and Excel without any problems.

== Understanding the structure of functions ==
Except for simple functions such as + or *, all functions have a similar structure. If you use the right tool for entering a function, you can escape learning this structure, but it is still worth knowing for troubleshooting.

To give a typical example, the structure of a function to find cells that match entered search criteria is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;= DCOUNT (Database;Database field;Search_criteria)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Like most functions, this one starts with an equal sign. It is followed by DCOUNT, the name of the function. After the name of the function comes its arguments. All arguments are required, unless specifically listed as optional.

Arguments are added within the brackets (parentheses) and separated by semicolons, with no space between the arguments and the semicolons. Many arguments are a number. A Calc function can take up to thirty numbers as an argument. That may not sound like much at first. However, when you realize that the number can be not only a number or a single cell, but also an array or range of cells that contain several or even hundreds of cells, then the apparent limitation vanishes.

Other arguments may be a column label, a mathematical constant, or a value unique to that function.

Depending on the function, arguments may have to be entered with straight quotation marks. However, this requirement is not consistent. Otherwise similar formulas may differ only in this requirement, and no simple rule tells you which is which. You simply have to know or check the requirements in the online help.

The only exception to these structural rules are basic arithmetical functions entered with symbols. For example, instead of entering &lt;nowiki&gt;=SUM(2;3)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, you can enter &lt;nowiki&gt;=2+3&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

== Advanced structure ==
As well as being used on its own, a function can be an argument in a larger formula. A formula, however, is limited by the fact that it can only do one function at a time. You need to make sure that functions are done in the right order if the formula is going to work.

To help set the order for functions in a multiple-function formula, you use parentheses within parentheses. When the formula is run, Calc does the innermost function first, then works outwards. For example, in the simple calculation &lt;nowiki&gt;=2+(5*7)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Calc multiples 5 by 7 first. Only then is 2 added to the result to get 37.

The placement of functions within sets of parentheses is called ''nesting''. Basically, nesting reduces a function that could run on its own to an argument in the formula. For example, in =2+(5*7), the formula (5*7) is nested within the larger formula of =2+(5*7). In other words, the nested function becomes an argument of another function.

This relation is more obvious when doing a calculation using a function with a name. For all purposes,

 &lt;nowiki&gt;=SUM(2;PRODUCT(5;7))&lt;/nowiki&gt;

is the same formula as &lt;nowiki&gt;=2+(5*7)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. However, when SUM and PRODUCT are used, then the relation is clearer. The fact that the PRODUCT function comes after a semicolon and in a set of parentheses for the SUM function makes it clear that PRODUCT is an argument for SUM. In addition, the fact that the inner pair of parentheses is around (5;7) makes clear that this operation is done before the one defined by the outer pair of parentheses.

To get an idea of what nested functions can do, imagine that you are designing a self-directed learning module. During the module, students do three quizzes, and enter the results in cells A1, A2, and A3. In A4, you can create a nested formula that begins by averaging the results of the quizzes with the formula &lt;nowiki&gt;=AVERAGE(A1:A3)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The formula then uses the IF function to give the student feedback that depends upon the average grade on the quizzes. The entire formula would read:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;=IF(AVERAGE(A1:A3) &gt;85; &quot;Congratulations! You are ready to advance to the next module&quot;;
 &quot;Failed. Please review the material again. If necessary, contact your instructor for help&quot;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Depending on the average, the student would receive the message for either congratulations or failure.

Notice that the nested formula for the average does not require its own equal sign. The one at the start of the equation is enough for both formulas.

If you are new to spreadsheets, the best way to think of functions is as a scripting language. We've used simple examples to explain more clearly, but, through nesting of functions, a Calc formula can quickly become complex.

=== Formulas ===
See the more specific section: [[/Formulas/]].

== The database (preconditions) ==
The basis for work with the DataPilot is always a list with your data in raw format. Such a list is comparable to a database table. The table consists of rows (data sets) and columns (data fields). The field names are in the first row above the list.

Later we will explain that the data source could be an external file or database. The simplest use case is that your data is contained in a Calc spreadsheet. For such a list, Calc offers sorting functions that do not depend on the DataPilot.

For processing data in lists, the program must know in which area of the spreadsheet the table is. A Calc table can be anywhere in the sheet, in any position. It is also possible, that a spreadsheet contains several unrelated tables.

Calc recognizes your lists automatically. It uses the following logic:

Starting from the cell you’ve selected (which must be within your list), Calc checks the surrounding cells in all 4 directions (left, right, above, below). The border is recognized if the program discovers an empty row or column, or if it hits the left or upper border of the spreadsheet.

This means that the described functions can only work correctly if there are no empty rows or columns in your list. Avoid empty lines (for example for formatting). You can format your list by using cell formats. 



If you select more than one single cell before you start sorting, filtering or calling the DataPilot, then the automatic list recognition is switched off. Calc assumes that the list matches exactly the cells you have selected. This might be useful in only very few cases.



A relatively big source for errors is that you might declare a list by mistake and you sort your list. If you select multiple cells (for example, a whole column) then the sorting mixes up the data that should be together in one row.

In addition to these formal aspects, the logical structure of your table is very important for using the DataPilot.



When entering the data, do not add outlines, groups. or summaries. This becomes clear when we think about what we could have done wrong in our Sales list example. This will give you a list of bad ideas, that you can find very often among spreadsheet users who are not informed about the possibilities of processing lists within a spreadsheet.

First bad idea: You could have made several sheets. For example, you could have made a sheet for each group of articles. Analyses are then only possible within each group. Analyses for several groups would then be a lot of hassle.

Second bad idea: In the turnover list, instead of only one column for the amount, you could have made a column for the amounts for each employee. The amounts than had to be entered into the appropriate column. An analysis with the DataPilot would not be possible any more. In contrast, one result of the DataPilot is that you can get results for each employee if you have entered everything in one column.

Third bad idea: You could have entered the amounts in chronological order. At the end of each month you could have made a sum. In this case, a sorting of the list for different criteria is not possible, and you could not use the DataPilot. The rows with the sums would be treated by the DataPilot like any other amount you have entered. Getting monthly results is one of the very fast and easy features of the DataPilot.

You start the DataPilot with '''Data &gt; DataPilot &gt; Start'''. If the list to be analyzed is in a spreadsheet table, select one cell within this list. Calc recognizes and selects the list automatically for use with the DataPilot.

==Data Analysis==
Once you are familiar with functions and formulas, the next step is to learn how to automate the processes and perform useful analyses of the data.

Calc includes several tools to help you manipulate functions and formulas, ranging from features for copying and reusing data, to creating subtotals automatically, to varying information to help you find the answers you need. These tools are divided between the Tools and Data menus.

If you are a newcomer to spreadsheets, these tools can be overwhelming at first. However, they become simpler if you remember that they all depend on input from either a cell or a range of cells that contain the data with which you are working. 

You can always enter the cells or range manually, but in many cases, you can also use the Shrink/Maximize icon beside a field to change temporarily the size of the tool’s window while you select the cells with the mouse. Sometimes, you may have to experiment with which data goes into one field, but, once you have found out, the rest is simply setting a selection of options, many of which can be ignored in any given case. Just keep the basic purpose of each tool in mind, and you should have little trouble with Calc’s function tools. 

You don’t need to learn them, especially if your spreadsheet use is simple, but as your manipulation of data becomes more sophisticated, they can save time in making calculations, especially as you start to deal with hypothetical situations. Just as importantly, they can allow you to preserve your work and to share it with other people—or yourself at a later session.

===Subtotal===

SUBTOTAL is a function listed under the Mathematical category when you use the Function Wizard ('''Insert &gt; Function'''). Because of its usefulness, the function has a graphical interface accessible from '''Data &gt; Subtotals'''.

As the name suggests, SUBTOTAL totals data arranged in a array—that is, a group of cells with labels for columns and/or rows. Using the Subtotals dialog, you can select arrays, then choose a statistical function to apply to them. For efficiency, you can choose up to three groups of arrays to which to apply a function. When you click '''OK''', Calc adds subtotals and grand totals to the selected arrays, using the Result and Result2 cell styles for them.

To insert subtotal values into a sheet:

# Ensure that the columns have labels.
# Select the range of cells that you want to calculate subtotals for, and then choose '''Data &gt; Subtotals'''.
# In the Subtotals dialog, in the '''Group by''' box, select the column that you want to add the subtotals to. If the contents of the selected column change, the subtotals are automatically recalculated.
# In the '''Calculate subtotals for''' box, select the columns containing the values that you want to subtotal.
# In the '''Use function''' box, select the function that you want to use to calculate the subtotals.
# Click '''OK'''.

If you use more than one group, then you can also arrange the subtotals according to choices made on the dialog’s ''Options'' page, including ascending and descending order or using one of the predefined custom sorts defined in '''Tools &gt; Options &gt; OpenOffice.org Calc &gt; Sort Lists'''.

==Scenarios==

Scenarios are a tool to test “what-if” questions. Use '''Tools &gt; Scenarios '''to enter variable contents—scenarios—in the same cell. Each scenario is named, and can be edited and formatted separately, and chosen from a drop-down list in the Navigator and the title bar of the scenario. When you print the spreadsheet, only the contents of the currently active scenario is printed.

By adding a scenario, you can quickly change the arguments of a formula and view the new results. For example, if you wanted to calculate different interest rates on an investment, you could add a scenario for each interest rate, and quickly view the results. If you had another formula that calculated your yearly income and included the result of the interest rate formula as an argument, it would also be updated. If all your sources of incomes used scenarios, you could efficiently build a complex model of your possible income.

=== Creating scenarios ===
To create a scenario, select all the cells that provide the data for the scenario.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the cells that contain the values that will change between scenarios. To select multiple cells, hold down the ''Ctrl'' key as you click each cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose '''Tools &gt; Scenarios'''.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;On the Create Scenario dialog, enter a name for the new scenario. It’s best to use a name that clearly identifies the scenario, not the default name as shown in the illustration. This name is displayed in the Navigator and on the title bar of the scenario on the sheet itself.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Optionally add some information to the '''Comment''' box. The example shows the default comment. This information is displayed in the Navigator when you click the Scenarios icon and select the desired scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally select or deselect the options in the ''Settings'' section. See below for more information about these options.
&lt;li&gt;Click '''OK''' to close the dialog. The new scenario is automatically activated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Settings ===
The lower portion of the Create Scenario dialog contains several options. In most cases the default settings (shown selected in the example) are suitable.

'''Display border'''

Highlights the scenario in your table with a border. The color for the border is specified in the field to the right of this option. The border has a title bar displaying the name of the last scenario. The button on the right of the scenario border offers you an overview of all the scenarios in this area, if several have been defined. You can choose any of the scenarios from this list without restrictions.

'''Copy back'''

Copies the values of cells that you change into the active scenario. If you do not select this option, the scenario is not changed when you change cell values. The behavior of the '''Copy back''' setting depends on the cell protection, the sheet protection, and the '''Prevent changes''' settings.

'''Copy entire sheet'''

Copies the entire sheet into an additional scenario sheet.

'''Prevent changes'''

Prevents changes to the active scenario.

* You can only change the scenario properties if the '''Prevent changes''' option is not selected and if the sheet is not protected.
* You can only edit cell values if the '''Prevent changes''' option is selected, if the '''Copy back''' option is not selected, and if the cells are not protected.
* You can only change scenario cell values and write them back into the scenario if the '''Prevent changes''' option is not selected, if the '''Copy back''' option is selected, and if the cells are not protected.

=== Working with scenarios using the Navigator ===
After scenarios are added to a spreadsheet, you can jump to a particular scenario by using the Navigator, then selecting a scenario from the list. You can also color code scenarios to make them easier to distinguish from one another.

To select a scenario in the Navigator, click the '''Scenarios''' icon in the Navigator. The defined scenarios are listed, with the comments that were entered when the scenarios were created.

Double-click a scenario name in the Navigator to apply that scenario to the current sheet.

To delete a scenario, right-click the name in the Navigator and choose '''Delete'''.

To edit a scenario, including its name and comments, right-click the name in the Navigator and choose '''Properties'''. The Edit Properties dialog is the same as the Create Scenario dialog.

To learn which values in the scenario affect other values, choose '''Tools &gt; Detective &gt; Trace Dependents'''. Arrows point to the cells that are directly dependent on the current cell.
==Goalseeking==
'''Tools &gt; Goal Seek''' reverses the usual order for a formula. Usually, you run a formula to get the result when certain arguments are entered. By contrast, with Goal Seek, you work with a completed formula to see what values you need in an argument to get the results that you want.

To take a simple example, imagine that the Chief Financial Officer of a company is developing sales projections for each quarter of the forthcoming year. She knows what the company’s total income must be for the year to satisfy stockholders. She also has a good idea of the company’s income in the first three quarters, because of the contracts that are already signed. For the fourth quarter, however, no definite income is available. So how much must the company earn in Q4 to reach its goal? To answer, the CFO enters the projected earnings for each of the other three quarters and the projection for the entire year. Then she runs a goal seek on the cell for Q4 sales, and receives her answer.

Other uses of goal seek may be more complicated, but the method remains the same. To run a goal seek, at least one of the values for an argument must be a referenced cell or range. Only one argument can be altered in a single goal seek. After you get the result of a goal seek, you can replace the original value in the referenced cell with the result, or record the result elsewhere for later use, possibly as a scenario.

With the help of Goal Seek you can calculate a value that, as part of a formula, leads to the result you specify for the formula. You thus define the formula with several fixed values and one variable value and the result of the formula.

=== Goal Seek example ===
To calculate annual interest (I), create a table with the values for the capital (C), number of years (n), and interest rate (i). The formula is I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C*n*i.

Let us assume that the interest rate i of 7.5% and the number of years n (1) will remain constant. However, you want to know how much the investment capital C would have to be modified in order to attain a particular return I. For this example, calculate how much capital C would be required if you want an annual return of $15,000.

Enter each of the values for Capital C (an arbitrary value like $100,000), number of years n (1), and interest rate i (7.5%) in one cell each. Enter the formula to calculate the interest I in another cell. Instead of C, n, and i use the reference to the cell with the corresponding value. In our example, these are B1, B2, and B3.
==Solver==
'''Tools &gt; Solver''' amounts to a more elaborate form of Goal Seek. The difference is that the Solver deals with equations with multiple unknown variables. It is specifically designed to minimize or maximize the result according to a set of rules that you define. 

Each of these rules sets up whether an argument in the formula should be greater than, lesser than, or equal to the figure you enter. If you want the argument to remain unchanged, you enter a rule that the cell that contains it should be equal to its current entry. For arguments that you would like to change, you need to add two rules to define a range of possible values: the limiting conditions. For example, you can set the constraint that one of the variables or cells must not be bigger than another variable, or not bigger than a given value. You can also define the constraint that one or more variables must be integers (values without decimals), or binary values (where only 0 and 1 are allowed).

Once you have finished setting up the rules, you can adjust the argument and the results by clicking the '''Solve''' button.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the cursor in the formula cell (the cell containing the interest I), and choose '''Tools &gt; Goal Seek'''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Goal Seek dialog, the correct cell is already entered in the ''Formula cell'' field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the cursor in the ''Variable cell'' field. In the sheet, click in the cell that contains the value to be changed, in this example it is the cell with the capital value C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the desired result of the formula in the ''Target value'' field. In this example, the value is 15000. The figure below shows the cells and fields.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Click '''OK'''. A dialog appears informing you that the Goal Seek was successful. Click '''Yes''' to enter the result in the cell with the variable value. The result is shown below.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
==Sharing==
You can use several methods to keep track of changes you or others made to a document.

* Use change marks to show added or deleted material and changed formatting. Later, you or another person can review and accept or reject each change.
* Make changes to a copy of the document (stored in a different folder, under a different name, or both), then use Calc to compare the files and show the changes.
* Save versions that are stored as part of the original file.

Reviewers can leave notes in the document or make comments attached to specific changes.

=== Preparing a document for review (optional) ===
When you send a document to someone else to review or edit, you may want to prepare it first so that the editor or reviewer does not have to remember to turn on the revision marks. After you have protected the document, any user must enter the correct password in order to turn off the function or accept or reject changes.

# Open the document and make sure that the '''Edit &gt; Changes &gt; Record''' menu item has a check mark next to it, indicating that change recording is active.
# (Optional) Click '''Edit &gt; Changes &gt; Protect Records'''. On the Protect Records dialog, type a password (twice) and click '''OK'''.

=== Identifying copies of spreadsheets ===
When sharing documents, it is important to keep track of the different copies of the document. This can be done either in the file name or in the file title. If you have not provided a file title in the spreadsheet’s properties, the spreadsheet’s filename is displayed in the title bar. To set the title of the spreadsheet, select '''File &gt; Properties &gt; Description'''.

== Locking==
=== Cells==
You have to protect the sheet first.To protect cells go to Format &gt; Cells &gt; Cell protection. 
==Macros==
{{Main|../Macro/}}
A macro is a saved sequence of commands or keystrokes that are stored for later use. An example of a simple macro is one that “types” your address. The OpenOffice.org (OOo) macro language is very flexible, allowing automation of both simple and complex tasks. Macros are especially useful to repeat a task the same way over and over again. Macros can be in many different languages, but the default is BASIC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide OpenOffice.org BASIC Programming Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; This section briefly discusses common problems related to macro programming using Calc.

The following steps create a macro that performs paste special with multiply.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a new spreadsheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter numbers into a sheet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Select cell A3, which contains the number 3, and copy the value to the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the range A1:C3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use '''Tools &gt; Macros &gt; Record Macro''' to start the macro recorder. The Record Macro dialog is displayed with a stop recording button.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Use '''Edit &gt; Paste Special''' to open the Paste Special dialog.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Set the operation to '''Multiply''' and click '''OK'''. The cells are now multiplied by 3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Click '''Stop Recording''' to stop the macro recorder and save the macro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the current document. For this example, the current Calc document is ''Untitled''. Click on the + next to the document to view the contained libraries. Prior to OOo version 3.0, new documents were created with a standard library; this is no longer true. In OOo version 3.0, the standard library is not created until the document is saved, or the library is needed. If desired, create a new library to contain the macro (but this is not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Click '''New Module''' to create a module in the Standard library. If no libraries exist, then the Standard library is automatically created and used.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Click '''OK''' to create a module named Module1.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Select the newly created Module1, enter the macro name ''PasteMultiply'' and click '''Save'''. The created macro is saved in Module1 of the Standard library in the Untitled2 document (see Listing 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Listing 1. Paste special with multiply.''

&lt;code&gt;
 sub PasteMultiply
 
  rem --------------------------------------------------------------
  rem define variables
  dim document   as object
  dim dispatcher as object
  rem --------------------------------------------------------------
  rem get access to the document
  document   &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame
  dispatcher &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; createUnoService(&quot;com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper&quot;)
 
  rem --------------------------------------------------------------
  dim args1(5) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue
  args1(0).Name &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;Flags&quot;
  args1(0).Value &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;A&quot;
  args1(1).Name &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;FormulaCommand&quot;
  args1(1).Value &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3
  args1(2).Name &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;SkipEmptyCells&quot;
  args1(2).Value &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; false
  args1(3).Name &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;Transpose&quot;
  args1(3).Value &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; false
  args1(4).Name &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;AsLink&quot;
  args1(4).Value &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; false
  args1(5).Name &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &quot;MoveMode&quot;
  args1(5).Value &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; 4
 
  dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, &quot;.uno:InsertContents&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0, args1())
  end sub
&lt;/code&gt;
Calc can call macros as Calc functions. Use the following steps to create a simple macro:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Calc document named CalcTestMacros.ods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use '''Tools &gt; Macros &gt; Organize Macros &gt; OpenOffice.org Basic''' to open the OpenOffice.org Basic Macros dialog. The ''Macro from'' box lists available macro library containers. ''My Macros'' contains macros that you write or add to OOo. ''OpenOffice.org Macros'' contains macros included with OOo and should not be changed. All other library containers are currently open OOo documents.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Click '''Organizer''' to open the OpenOffice.org Basic Macro Organizer dialog.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Click the '''Libraries''' tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the document to contain the macro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click '''New''' to open the New Library dialog.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Enter a descriptive library name (such as AuthorsCalcMacros) and click '''OK''' to create the library. The new library name is shown the library list, but the dialog may show only a portion of the name.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Select AuthorsCalcMacros and click '''Edit''' to edit the library. OOo automatically creates a module named Module1 and a macro named Main.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Modify the code so that it is the same as that shown in Listing 2. The important addition is the creation of the NumberFive function, which returns the number five. The statement Option Explicit forces all variables to be declared before they are used. If Option Explicit is omitted, variables are automatically defined at first use as type Variant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Listing 2. Function that returns five.''

&lt;code&gt;
  REM  &lt;nowiki&gt;***** &lt;/nowiki&gt; BASIC  &lt;nowiki&gt;*****&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  Option Explicit
 
  Sub Main
 
  End Sub
 
  Function NumberFive()
    NumberFive &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; 5
  End Function 
&lt;/code&gt;

== HELLO!!! ==
Hi, I am Tim, I am a Developer of AegeanLinux (http://www.aegeanlinux.be). I hope to be able to provide many contributions, especially on Linux, but for the moment, I think the OpenOffice.org pages need editing. After all, how can we get people to move to &quot;Open Standards ... Open Source&quot;, if no one can even use OpenOffice?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tiger System Preferences Dock.png|800px|thumb|center|Fig. 1 - The Dock pane in System Preferences.]]When the  &gt; Dock menu is missing an option you want, you'll have to turn to the Dock pane of System Preferences. This pane gives you more fine-grained control over the Dock.

*Dock Size - This slider adjusts the size of the dock. You can also do this by dragging the thin line that separates the Dock into left and right sides.
*Magnification - When Magnification is on, the icons in your Dock “bulge” as you move your cursor over them. You'll either go gaga for this effect or find it distracting. The slider next door controls just ''how'' large the icons on the Dock will become when you move your cursor over them.
*Position on screen - This controls where the Dock is located on the screen. Most people prefer to have the Dock on the bottom, but on some small widescreen laptops, vertical space is more valuable than horizontal, and having the Dock running down the side of the screen saves a lot of space.
*Minimize using - The Genie Effect, the default setting, makes the window minimize like a genie going into a bottle. The Scale Effect is more modest, and goes faster.
*Animate opening applications - By default, application icons in the Dock bounce up and down while opening. Turning this option off makes the small triangle under the icon pulse instead.
*Automatically hide and show the Dock - When this option is turned on, the Dock will disappear completely unless you let your cursor rest right next to the edge of your screen where your Dock is. The Dock will then temporarily pop out so you can work with it. When you move the cursor away, it will dissappear again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Type 2 Verb Characteristics==

* These verbs have '''monosyllable stems ending in a long vowel or a diphthong, or have longer stems ending -oi and dictionary forms ending -da or -dä which do not belong to the stem''' .
: All Finnish verbs have a first infinitive (i.e. dictionary listed) form ending with the letter ''-a or -ä which is added to the stem''. But as no Finnish verb can have 3 consecutive vowels, the infinitve -a or -ä cannot be added directly to the stem of these verbs. Instead, an intervening -d is added after the stem and before the addition of the infinitive -a or -ä.  Hence this group of verbs has dictionary forms ending -da or -dä but the d is not part of the stem and only appears in the infinitive forms. 

Because of the long vowel stem ending, the third person singular does not extend the last vowel again (c.f. Type 1 verbs).

==Indicative==

 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Very many of the verbs that have single syllable stems ending in a long vowel or a dipthong are in this group (e.g. '''saada'''  ''to get'', '''löydä''' ''to find''). 

But there are also some longer verbs in this group that have often been formed from nouns. For instance '''imuroida''' ''to vacuum clean'' formed from a shortened form of the word '''pölynimuri''' ''vacuum cleaner'' (literally, sucker of dust).

==Formation of the simple past tense (imperfect)==

The imperfect ending marker is -i- but this cannot be added directly to the stem. This is because the stem already ends in two vowels and no Finnish verb can contain three consecutive vowels.

The solution to this problem is that Type 2 verbs is as follows.

* if the final vowel of the stem is an i then the i of the stem is dropped. 
: Thus the simple past tense form is identical to the present tense.
* however, if the last vowel is not an i, the FIRST of the two vowels in the stem is dropped. 
: Thus the dictionary form is not always easily apparent from the past tense form, especially for the short form verbs

===Distinguishing Past, Present and Future===

If present tense is also used as the future tense (as it is for all Finnish verb types), and the past tense in many Type 2 verbs forms is identical to these, why is this not confusing?

This is a good question (assuming you have already been wondering about this)!!

The answer will most likely be clear from the context. For example if it may includes a time clue like the word tomorrow, next week, last week etc.  But this may not be the case. 

An additional clue will come in the object form following the verb. Consider the following.

1. Imuroin auton

2. Imuroin autoa

'''Imuroida''' means ''to vacuum clean'' and '''auto''' is ''car'', but here appears in two forms. the accusative -n form and the partitive -a form. '''Imuroin''' could mean ''I will vacuum'' (future tense), or ''I am vacuuming'' (right now, present tense) or ''I vacuumed'' past tense.

If the meaning is ''present tense'', then the phrase has to be '''Imuroin autoa'''. Because the action is ongoing, object rules dictate that the object must be in the partitive case, indicating incomplete action. However '''imuroin autoa''' could also mean that ''I vacuumed part of the car some time ago'' (but perhaps this is unlikely) or ''I will vacuum part of the car, but not all of it'' (equally unlikely). If the car ''has been vacuumed and completely vacuumed'', then the phrase will be '''imuroin auton'''.  But equally if the job has not yet been started and the meaning is in the future ''I will vacuum (all of the car)'', it will equally be '''imuroin auton''', so one must rely on other contextual information to distinguish the meaning.

In practise, this is hardly ever a problem.


==Consonant Gradation==

The good news is that type 2 verbs are not affected by consonant gradation.


==Some Important Irregular Verbs==

There are two verbs in Type 2 that have slightly irregular forms.  As often happens with irregular verbs in many languages, they are also very common verbs, so its worth spending some time looking at them and committing them to memory.  Fortunately, Finnish has remarkably few irregular verbs.

===Similarity to Type 4 verbs===

Type 4 verbs are similar to Type 2 verbs in that both types of verbs have stems ending in long vowels or diphthongs and conjugate for person in exactly the same way.

The big difference is that Type 4 verbs do not have the -da or -dä infinitive endings and as a result have a variety of stem forms. Due to changes in the stems type 4 verbs are much more complex and consonant gradation effects. Type 4 verbs also form the past participle and past tense forms slightly differently.    

You can learn more about Type 4 verbs in the appropriate section of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This are lecture notes that I wrote for the University of Phoenix class on algebra.  They are under the GFDL. --[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 19:54, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

==Lecture 1==

Let me start by talking about ferrets.

When I was in graduate school, I had an office mate who wrote her doctoral disseration on how fluids behaved in magnetic fields.  The equations that she had to deal with were really long and nasty polynomial equations.  She also was a ferret lover.  So everytime I see a polynomial, I imagine the equation being a small furry creature.

Thinking of a polynomial as a small furry creature isn't a bad way of approaching this chapter.  Basically this chapter can be entitled the care and feeding of polynomials.  In this chapter, we are going to learn the different parts of these small furry equations.  We are going to learn how to what happens when you feed a polynomial some numbers and lets it digest it.  We are going to learn how to make these small furry polynomial do tricks (which might be useful), and finally we are going to learn how to breed polynomials.  We'll put two polynomials in a cage and let them give birth to new polynomials.

This is all going to be useful because you find polynomials all over the place.  Equations which describe how big something is (i.e. Length, volumes, and surface areas) tend to end up to be polynomials.  Polynomials are found in equations which describe temperatures, pressures, how long it takes for a computer program to run.  Just as a quick example of the use of polynomials is the Bezier curve.  I draw some dots have have the computer to connect them with a line

The line that it connects them by is a third-degree polynomial.  Notice that I just used a special word.  What is a third-degree polynomial you might ask?  Well that's what section one is about.
Section 5.1 defines some terms for polynomials.  Just as ferret lovers have special terms to describe different types and different parts of ferrets, polynomial lovers have different words to describe different types and different parts of polynomials.  

The next section is on adding polynomials.  Why would you want to add polynomials?  Well lets take a trip to the carnival and buy some ice cream.........

As I mentioned earlier, polynomials are often found in equations involving volume.  So let be go through a problem that involves adding, subtracting, and multiplying polynomials.  

So suppose we have an ice cream cone.  How much ice cream is in it.  You can figure this out by splitting the ice cream cone into the cap (which is a half a sphere) and the cone.

:(volume of ice cream) = ? * (sphere) + (cone)

now figure this out you need to add two polynominal expressions and you end up with something like where r is the radius of the cone and h is the height of the cone.  But I'm hungry, I want a double scoop.

:(volume of ice cream) = ? * (sphere) + (sphere) + (cone)


Or since I don't know how many scoops of ice cream I want.  I just have n scoops.

:(volume of ice cream) = (n ? ?) * (sphere) + (cone)

So we can figure out the volume of ice cream.  Well since there are a lot of business people out there, lets think about costs.  Let p be the cost of ice cream per cubic centimeter.  So we have

:(cost of ice cream) = (price per volume) * (volume)

But we've forgotten something.  We have the price of the ice cream, but what about the price of the cone......

:(price of ice cream cone) = (price of ice cream) + (price of cone)

Now the price of the cone is going to be

:(price of cone) = (price per area) * (area of cone)

We have get more complicated.  We can take into account inflation and so make p and q variables which change year to year.  Or we could try to figure out what fraction of the price of the ice cream cone is cone.

:(fraction of price of cone) = (price of cone) / ((price of cone) + (price of ice cream))

Now I have actually put in algebraic equations for any of these things, because you haven't read chapter 5 yet, and I wanted to show you what the point of chapter 5 was before actually going through the content.  But once you know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide polynomials, you should be able to start with the equations for the volume of a sphere and cone, and the area of a cone and work to the end and get the (fraction of the price of cone) in an algebraic equation.  I've worked through the equation in an appendix which you should read after you've gotten half way through chapter 5.

Now as far how do approach chapter 5.  Think of the ability to add, subtract, multiple, and divide polynomials as a skill, like riding a bicycle.  The best way of learning how to do it is to just keep practicing until its second nature.  Something that I find useful is to make up problems and start with really easy problems, and then make them progressively harder.  For example, an easy problem with adding polynomials is 
:2x + x
which is of course
:3x
You can then make it a bit harder
:(x+y) + 2x
which is
:3x + y
and just work your way up until you can deal with longer and longer polynomials without your mind going numb (and given a large enough polynomial, your mind will go numb).   

Something that has always helped me is to just think of the equations as squiggles on a page, and the lesson as rules for turning one set of squiggles into another set of squiggles.

One of the more important things that you will learn in this chapter are the product and quotient rules for exponents.  The way I think about them is that they turn multiplication and division into addition and subtraction.   Section 9.1 starts with radicals which is a different way of writing things.

Now I've saved what I think is the most important section for the end of the lecture.  Section 5.7 is about negative exponents and scientific notation, and I don't think that the author of the text quite realizes how important that section is.   Let me give an example of how important section 5.7 is with a money example.  A good salary for an experienced programmer is about $80,000 per year.  A good salary for a CEO is about $2,000,000 per year.  The revenue for the University of Phoenix is $300,000,000 per year.  The revenue for a state government is $10,000,000,000 per year.  The revenue for the federal government is about $2,000,000,000,000 per year.  Now if you are like me, your mind started to go numb somewhere along the way, and all you were seeing by the end were big numbers with lots of zeros.  Now lets write them in scientific notation.

:(salary for programmer) = $8 x 10^4
:(salary for CEO) = $2 x 10^ 6
:(revenue for UOP) = $3 x 10^ 8
:(state government budget) = $1 x 10^10
:(federal budget) = $2 x 10^12

Now I'm hoping that you notice that the last set of numbers is just easier to think about.  The federal budget rather than being a number with lots of zeros is now a number with 12 zeros as opposed to one's salary which has 4 zeroes.  

With the exponent rule we can do some more magic.  For example, what do you suppose is the average tax burden per person in the United States.  We'll we look up the population of the United States which is 200,000,000 or in scientific notation 2x10^7.

:(taxes per person) = (federal budget) / (people in the US)
:(taxes per person) = $2x10^12 / 2x10^7

with the magic of the quotient rule, this equals

:(taxes per person) = $2/2 times 10^(12-7) 
:(taxes per person) = $10^5.

Which means that on the average a person pays about $10,000 per year in taxes.

We can play some more games.  For example suppose UoP spend 10% of its budget on IT, how many programmers is that......

: (UoP IT budget) = 10% times $3 x 10^8
: (UoP IT budget) = $3 x 10^7
Now each programmers salary is about $10^5, and
: = $3 x 10^7 / $10^5
: = 3 x 10^2
which says that UoP probably has around about 100 ? 500 people in IT.  Notice that I did that with very little math.  I've found this to be really useful in reading corporate reports.   For example, if I know that a vacuum cleaner manufacturer made $10^6 a year last year, I can guess that each vaccuum cost between $10^2 and $10^3 and so they manufactured between 10^3 and 10^4 vacuums.

Rather than thinking in term of standard numbers and having my mind blank out from zeros, I rewrite the numbers in scientific notation, and then with the exponental and quotient rules can start making some quick calculations, like how many employees does the company have, what is its market capitalization, how does the size of this company compare with other companies, how many widgets did the company sell.

So rather than being called ¡°Negative Exponents and Scientific Notation¡± it should be called how ¡°You Can Handle Really Big and Really Small Numbers Without Going Crazy¡±

Hope that was useful.

==Lecture 2==

===Types of Polynomials===
In one of the questions last week, I asked about what to do if you have a large polynomial. One of the important things to look at the polynomial and look at how big the largest exponent (or order) is. In MTH 208, you dealt with order-1 polynomials, which were
linear equations.&amp;nbsp; These involved straight lines. Since we are in MTH 209, we now learn how to deal with more complex polynomials, mainly those of order 2. Where you see those polynomials can be shown in the following chart.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Order || Name || Number of bumps || Where found
|-
| 1 || linear || no bumps - straight line || straight line equations
|-
| 2 || quadratic || one bump || equations involving area and
vibrations
|-
| 3 || cubic || two bumps || equations involving volumes
|-
| 4 ||  || three bumps || some physics equations (melting ice)
|-
| n (5+) || || n-1 bumps || very rare
|}

===Factoring===

Now in order to solve these more complex equations, we need to take a short detour into factoring. Factoring is cool, and section 6.1 didn't explain how cool it is. 

The reason factoring is cool is that multiplication is easy but factoring is hard. Multiplying two numbers together is like scrambling eggs, and factoring is like trying to unscramble eggs. 

For example suppose I have two numbers say... 
: 3490529510847650949147849619903898133417764638493387843990820577 
and
: 32769132993266709549961988190834461413177642967992942539798288533 

If I multiply them together, I get this one big number... 
: 114381625757888867669235779976146612010218296721242362562561842935706935245733897830597123563958705058989075147599290026879543541 

Now the hard part comes if I give you this big number and then offer you money to figure out what two numbers I choose to get that big number. We can use the techniques we learned last week to figure out how long that will take. We want to factor a 110-digit number, and suppose we know that there are two factors. We then know that one of the numbers must be less than 55 digits. So we try all the numbers between 2 and 10**55. 

Suppose we have a computer that can process a billion (10**9) numbers per second. So to look at all the numbers 
:10 ** 55 numbers / 10 ** 9 numbers per second = 10 ** 46 seconds. 
Now there are 3 x 10 ** 7 seconds per year. Now 3 is almost the square root of 10 so it is about 10 ** (1/2). So we can express this
number as 10 ** (7.5). 

So 
:10 ** 46 seconds / 10 ** 7.5 seconds per year = 10 ** 39.5 years

Which poses a small problem since there has been 10 ** 10 years since the big bang. So factoring this number brute force will take 10 ** 29 times the lifetime of the universe. Note that getting a faster computer won't help you very much. If your computer is a million times faster, the time it will take to solve this problem is only 10 ** 23 times the lifetime of the universe. Now you can get somewhere if you find some mathematical shortcuts that identify possible factors, and that how they managed to factor that number, but without a basic breakthrough in mathematics, you can overwhelm those shortcuts by choosing an even bigger number to factor. 

But there is actually a use for this, and you use it every time you buy something from ebay or send your credit card number over the
internet. I can create a mathematical lock box and write a big number on it. Only the person who has a factor of that number can open the box, and the cool part is that you can create that big number without knowing the factor. This is what your web browser does when it sends a credit card number. It creates a big number that only Ebay or Microsoft or someone else knows how to factor, and mixes that number with your credit card number. 

Needless to say, there is some very big money involved in being able to factor big numbers. To give you some idea how big, take a look at [http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/challenges/factoring/numbers.html rsasecurity].

The reason it useful to factor polynomials is that it lets you solve polynomial equations. Suppose you have an equation 
:&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;x ** 2 + (something) * x + (something else) = 0&lt;/span&gt; 
if you can figure out a way of rewriting it so that it looks like 
:&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;(x - a) (x - b) = 0&lt;/span&gt; 
Then you know that a and b are solutions of the equation. One thing about polynomials is that if the highest term in the polynomial is x ** n, you should be able to split it into n factors, which means that there are n solutions to the equation. You can sort of see how this works by going the other way. 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)&lt;/span&gt; 
is going to end up with a polynomial with x ** 3 in front. 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)&lt;/span&gt;
is going to end up with a polynomial with x ** 4 in front and so forth.

Where this would be useful is if you have a business problem with an x**2 in it. Typically this be the case when you have a problem that involves area.&amp;nbsp; One example of this would be a situation where you are running a pizza parlor. The price of a pizza is typically a quadratic equation
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;($1.00 per square foot of dough) * (area of pizza) = (cost of pizza)&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;$1.00 * pi * r ** 2 = (cost)&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;$3.00 * r ** 2 = (cost)&lt;/span&gt;

So how big does the pizza need to be to cost $12.00?

&lt;div style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;
: $3.00 * r ** 2 = $12.00
: r ** 2 = $4.00
: r**2 - $4.00 = 0
: (r + $2) (r - $2) = 0 (Where did this come from?)
&lt;/div&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;r = $2 or -$2&lt;/span&gt;

Note that you end up with an extra root.&amp;nbsp; This is because you are dealing with a second degree polynomial and so the solutions to it will usually have two answers.

The good news is that if you can factor a polynomial you can solve it. The bad news is that as we have seen above factoring is
sometimes hard. Now scrambling an egg is straightforward. Unscrambling it is much harder. Chapter 6 has some techniques for
unscrambling a two egg polynomial omelet. Once you put another egg in there, it gets much harder.

Incidentally in terms of general usefulness, the formulas for squaring (a+b) and for reducing a**2 - b**2 are worth remembering.
Somehow they manage to turn up in all sorts of places. Actually solving a quadratic equation by factoring is something that is much
less useful. The problem is if someone hands you a quadratic equation in the real world, the odds that it will separate cleanly into nice numbers is small. 

In chapter 7, we are looking at rational expressions, which is another fancy way of saying fractions with polynomials. The first
section is on simplifying rational expressions. The result for this is that suppose you have a fraction 1/4 and someone else has a fraction 2/8. They are actually the same thing, and so it's nice to put all of them into one common format. Then there is more stuff with multiplying, adding, and subtracting polynomials (i.e. slicing and dicing numbers). 

I don't know why I have some many food metaphors this week. Maybe I can order online for some pizza and have Domino's factor some of my numbers.

== Lecture 3 ==

===Introduction===

This week's assignment there are three threads in this weeks assignment which all build on the work we did last week. In the last week, you learned to work with rational expressions. This week's work uses those rational expressions to solve word problems involving rates. Also in last week's lesson you learned to solve equations using factoring. This week we will learn another way to solve quadratic equations using a single formula. Finally, we are going to learn out to solve power equations.

===Rational Expression Word Problems===
There are two parts of solving a problem.  The first is writing the problem down as a equation, the second is solving the equation.
Generally the first part of the problem is the hardest part.  One you have an equation, solving it is usually easy using the techniques we've learned in the previous weeks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The hard part is setting up the problem. So I'd like into a bit more detail about how that works.&amp;nbsp; Also, I'd like to use as an example, a problem that is more relevant to business than the standard algebra textbook problem.

So let me work through a problem.The V Corporation is a dot-com with huge problems.  It has $40 million in the bank and it spending it at a rate of $8 million per month.  The venture capitalist is willing to fund $15 million if it can prove that the V Corporation will be around in two years. 

The question that faces the executives of the V Corporation how much do they have to cut their burn rate in order to survive two years when hopefully the economy will improve.

The first thing to do is to just write down, what you know and what you want to find out. 

I know
* $40 million in the bank now
* $65 million if VC funding goes through
* $8 million burn rat
* goal is 24 month survival

I want to find
* How much do I want to cut? Call this x

The next thing to do is to draw a chart

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  || Money || Burn || Time
|-
! Now 
| 40 || 8
|-
! Planned 
| 65 || 8-x || 24
|}

Since Burn = Time * Money 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;65 = (8-x) * 24&lt;/span&gt; 
I'll let you grind through the numbers and break the bad news to the employees of the V Corporation. 

Note that this is just a simple linear question, not a fancy rational one.  Let try something more complex. 

I have two plants that are produces 40 cars per month.  I know that one of the plants is producing 1 car every two days, and I want to see how this will impact production if I half the amount of time it takes to produce a car at the other plant. 

I know
* total production 30 cars per month 
* production at Plant #1 is 2 cars per day

I want to find out
* how long it takes to build a car at Plant #2 (?)

So I draw my chart

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  || Rate || Time || Cars
|-
! Plant #1
| 1 car / 2 days || 30 days
|-
! Plant #2
| 1 car / ? days || 30 days
|-
! Total 
|  || 30 days || 40 cars
|}

Since we know that cars = rate * times, we can fill out some more stuff 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  || Rate || Time || Cars
|-
! Plant #1 
| 1 car / 2 days || 30 days || 15 cars
|-
! Plant #2
| 1 car / x days || 30 days || 30 / x cars
|-
! Total
|  || 30 days || 40 cars
|}

We then can add together the number of cars we have each month to get the equation
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;15 + 30 / x = 40&lt;/span&gt; 
Multiplying each side by x we get 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;15 x + 30 = 40 &lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;15 x = 25 &lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;x = 25 / 15 &lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;= 5 / 3&lt;/span&gt;
So it takes a little more than a day to create a car at plant 2

We can then play some what if games.  Suppose we double production at plant #2 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  || Rate || Time || Cars
|-
! Plant #1 
| 1 car / 2 days || 30 days || 15 cars
|-
! Plant #2
| 1 car / 5/3 days *2 || 30 days
|- 
! Total 
|  || 30 days
|}

Filling in stuff in we get

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  || Rate || Time || Cars
|-
! Plant #1
| 1 car / 2 days || 30 days || 15 cars
|-
! Plant #2 
| 6/5 car / day || 30 days || 36 cars
|-
! Total 
|  || 30 days || 51 cars
|}

We can play some more games
* What happens if we add a third plant that produces a car every two days?
* We want to increase production to 100 cars a month and have two choices, we can increase production at plant one or build a new plant?  How much do we need to increase production at plant #1 to build 100 cars per month, plant #2, what about building a third plant?
* Alternatively the economy is bad, and there is now demand for only 30 cars a month.  We can either leave plant #1 idle for part of the month or leave plant #2 idle for part of the month?  How much do you have to idle plant #1 and how much to you have to idle plant #2? 
* Union rules say that you have to idle plant #1 and plant #2 the same   amount.  How many days do you have to idle both plants to cut production? 

As an exercise you can try to go through each of the above scenarios and see if you can handle it.  If you don't run an auto company, you can try replacing cars and plants with something in your own experience. 

One final thing.  You notice that I've put everything in nice neat rows. Mathematicians don't do problems that way, but you see these sorts of tables everywhere in business.  Part of the reason to put these sorts of problems in table format is that it helps you to also put those sorts of tables in Excel.  For example, with the above scenarios is something that you probably would use Excel to help you with. 

===The Quadratic Equation===

And now for for the second of the three threads in this weeks lesson.

You've seen three ways of solving quadratic equations 
* factoring
* completing the square
* the quadratic equation

One thing that will be useful for you do to know is that under normal circumstances, the quadratic equation is the only one that you
will ever use.  Factoring only works if you happen to have a problem that can be factored and those tend to occur only in math textbooks :-). Completing the square will work for everything, but you won't remember how to do it.  The quadratic equation, is easy to use because you just put the numbers in the formula and out pops the answer.  It's short enough to memorize and even if you don't memorize it, its something that you can know exists and look up if you ever need it.

One thing that helps a lot in dealing with quadratic equations is to visualize what a quadratic function looks like.

The equation
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;a x**2 + b x + c&lt;/span&gt;
is going to be a U shaped parabola if a is positive and an upside down parabola if a is negative.  Changing a changes how narrow the
parabola is.  Changing b moves it left and right and changing c moves it up and down.  If you imagine an intersection between a U and a straight line, you can see that some of the time, you get two intersections, some of the time, you get one intersection, and some of the time you get no intersections.

One equation you might have at this point is the quadratic equation is the most useful way to deal with quadratic equations, then why did we spend most of last week talking about them.

The reason that mathematicians are interested in factoring has to do mainly with higher order equations.  There are formulas for the cubic and quartic equations, but they take up two pages and no one ever uses them. What gets even more interesting are quintic and higher equations. A person named Galois proved in the early 19th century that there are *no* general formulas for 5th degree and higher polynomials.  He was 21 at the time, and shortly (i.e. days) after proving this and inventing an entire branch of mathematicians, he lost a pistol duel over a woman of questionable morals.&amp;nbsp; And his great legacy to the world was leaving the world the knowledge that solving the equation
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;0 = a + b x + c x ** 2 + d x ** 3 + ... + x ** n &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
is really, really hard when n is larger or equal to five. But there is good news, which comes in the section on power equations ....

===Power equations===
The bad news is that general polynomials are hard to solve. The good news you usually won't see a general polynomial often and that
a lot of the time you will see a subset that is much easier to solve.&amp;nbsp; If you see the equation
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;x ** n = b&lt;/span&gt;
You can solve it by taking the n-th root of both sides, giving you
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;x = b ** (1/n)&lt;/span&gt;

There is a subtlity though. If you multiply a number by itself, the negative signs disappear.&amp;nbsp; So the solution to
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;x ** 2 = 4&lt;/span&gt;
is both 2 and -2. By contrast, 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;2 ** 3 = 8&lt;/span&gt; 
but 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;(-2) ** 3 = -8.&lt;/span&gt; 

The consequence to this is that there are two solutions to a power equation if n is even and b is positive, and no real solutions if n is even and b is negative.&amp;nbsp; By contrast if n is odd, then you have one solution regardless of whether b is positive or negative.

===Conclusion===
If the three threads in this weeks lesson look unconnected, its because they are. At this point, you've mastered the basics of
manipulating equations, and what is left now is to teaching you mathematical tools which you can use to solve different classes of
equations. These tools are specialized , which means what works with one type of equation will completely fail for another type, but
the more tools you have in your toolbox, the more likely it is that something will fit the equation you are trying to solve.&lt;br&gt;

== Lecture 4 ==
My how time flies. We have one more week of new material and then a final week of review. This week there are three new concepts,
the first is graphing quadratic equations, the second is doing quadratic inequalities, and the third is doing rational inequalities.

===Graphing Quadratic Functions===

The first new concept is graphing quadratic functions. I've generally found graphing functions to be useful because it gives you
some visual idea of how that function behaves.&amp;nbsp; So lets start with the quadratic equation 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;y = a x ** 2 + b x + c&lt;/span&gt;

There are examples of what you get if you graph that equation in section 10.3. The thing that these graphs, particularly figure
10.4, should remind you of is a ball flying through the air. This is not a coincidence as the equation that describes a ball flying
through air is a quadratic equation. Now if you were to draw a picture of a ball flying through the air, you could do this if someone
gave you three points: 
* where the ball starts from the ground., 
* the highest point of the ball, and 
* where the ball hits the ground again 
So lets try to figure out where the ball hits the ground. The equation that describes where the ball hits the ground is
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;0 = a x ** 2 + b x + c &lt;/span&gt;
and you can find these points via the quadratic equation or by factor. Notice that there are usually two such points. Now
the highest point of the curve is midway between the points that the curve hits the ground. And that is at
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;x = -b / a &lt;/span&gt;

You can find the y value of the equation at that point by substituting back into the quadratic equation. This gives you three points, where the ball leaves the ground, where the ball is at its highest point, and where the ball hits the ground again. You can then connect the dots and draw a quadratic equation.

And now for the usual question. Why would you want to do this?

During last weeks discussion, we talked about a situation where a vendor would want to give a discount on their software depending on how many licenses one buys. Suppose the base price for a license is 200, but the vendor is willing to discount $5 for each license.
The equation that describes the total cost is 
: y = x * (200 - 5x)
:: = -5 x **2 + 200 * x

Now one might want to know how the cost of the software varies with the number of licenses, and this is a good example of where graphing this on a sheet of graph paper might be useful. I'll leave this as an exercise for you, and once you graph it, you should realize that this is probably not a good deal for the vendor if you want to buy a really large number of licenses.

===Quadratic Inequalities===
This leads to the next topic. You are a purchaser and you will consider the deal only when the total cost is less that $1000.&amp;nbsp;
This creates an equation
: 1000 &amp;lt; x * (200 - 5x)
or 
: 0 &amp;lt; -5 x ** 2 + 200 * x - 1000

There are two ways of solving this equation. If you can factor the equation, then you can find the signs of the factors. If they are the same, then the equation is greater than zero. If they are different, then the equation is less then zero. You can draw things on a number line similar to 10.15, and figure out where your equation is satisfied. The other way is to find the zero-crossings using the quadratic equation, you then pick a test point between the zero-crossings, and some test points outside the zero-crossings. This will tell you the sign of the equation, and you can see where your inequality is satisfied.

===Rational Inequalities===
The final topic for this week involves rational inequalities. An example where this would be the case is if you had a situation in which the total cost producing an item is $250 plus $5 per item. The unit cost of the item would be 
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;250 + 5 x&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;----------&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You want to know howmany items you need to produce so that the cost of each item is less than $10.
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;250 + 5 x&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;----------&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt; 10&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; x&lt;/span&gt;

The rule for doing rational inequalities is that you shouldn't multiply factors on both sides of the inequality, just add and subtract them. This gives you
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;250 + 5x &lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;---------- - 10 &amp;lt; 0&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; x &lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;250 + 5x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 10x&lt;/span&gt;
: &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;---------- - &amp;nbsp; ------ &amp;lt; 0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; x
: 250 - 5x
: ----------&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt; 0
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; x
&lt;/div&gt;

The numerator is positive if x &amp;lt; 50 and negative if x &amp;gt; 50. The denominator is negative if x &amp;lt;0 and positive if x &amp;gt; 0. Thus the signs are different if x &amp;lt; 0, the same if 0 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 50, and different if x &amp;gt; 50.&amp;nbsp; Thus the inequality is satisfied if x &amp;gt; 50.

===Conclusion===
I mentioned last week that you can think of algebra as a set of mathematical tools in your toolbox. This week we've added three
more tools in your toolbox.&amp;nbsp; That's all of the tools for this class. Once you get past this week, the next thing to do is to
review all of what we have covered.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Right now, my preoccupation is about learning languages from a Native English speaker's point of view. What does that mean? If you want to learn another Indo-European language, you need to understand how English differs from other languages in that family and what some common English idioms are. In particular:

# The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift| Great Vowel Sound Shift], which led to a massive change in pronunciation,
# The common every day words in English come from the Germanic core because Old English was a language similar to German.
# The invasion of England by the Vikings, who shared many words but had a different grammar led to the erosion of grammatical endings like two pieces of sandpaper rubbing against each other. Words like ''skin'', ''die'' and ''they'' come from the Vikings.
# English got a new layer of vocabulary from Norman French after the conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror. Some of the words in this layer were then later disguised to make certain words look like they had been derived directly from Latin. So ''parfait'' was transformed into ''perfect'', originally with a silent ''c'' and ''det'' became ''debt'', with a still silent ''b''.
# English has in more recent times indulged in massive borrowing of words from Latin and then Greek.

Some English idioms include:
* I am hungry.

Hi Albertde

Sorry for not answering on [[Talk:Dutch/Lesson 11]]. I haven't been here for a while. I do not agree with what you are saying about Dutch word order. To me the two versions:

:''ik dacht dat hij komen zou''
:''ik dacht dat hij zou komen''

are about evenly acceptable.

There may be some regional differences. The South probably more the latter (I'm from around Dordrecht).

[[User:152.1.193.137|152.1.193.137]] 21:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi Albert

I have written a new chapter [[Dutch/Lesson 18]] to address the @#$# word order problem. I have tried to cut it up in many little bits and pieces because for Anglophones it is really a big problem. If your mother tongue is German you start from the tenth floor up rather than from the basement and a lot of differences in details immediately strike you. (I have the same with German) Also: I really have to think how exactly we do these things... I do them automatically of course.
ciao
[[User:Iarlagab|Iarlagab]] 21:57, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

P.S. As far as north-south bias is concerned: I try to stay away from that as much as I can, because I think we speak one language within which a certain variability is an asset not a curse. Besides, who am I to decide what version of Dutch is better? Or impose that on others? But of course, I ''am'' a northerner and would need southern input to correct bias.</text>

One problem with astronomy textbooks is that they don't mention how
messy things really are.  Everything is packaged in nice neat packets
of information, and not much effort is spent describing the amount of
effort it takes to get some real data.  There is a lot of unglamourous
grunt work that is involved in doing experiments, and that needs to be
mentioned because most of astronomy doesn't consist of eureka moments,
but rather a large amount of it consists of things that are tedious
staring in front of a computer screen doing data reduction.

Getting data always starts with the instrument, and that usually means
a telescope of some sort.  You can think of a telescope as just a
giant light bucket which is catching light particles from the sky and
focusing them into a detector at the end of the telescope.

In ancient times (i.e. before 1980), what would be at the end of the
telescope would be likely be a camera.  The camera wouldn't use film
but instead would record everything on a glass plate.  Glass plates
were needed instead of plastic because they stored better and didn't
expand or contract as much over time.

Today, we are in a transition period between film cameras and digital
cameras.  However that transition happened in astronomy in the 1980's
and many of the reasons that astronomers started using digital cameras
are the same as the ones people are moving from film to digital
cameras.  The big one is that you can download the image onto your
computer and then have the computer do image processing.  This also
means that you can store pictures, transmit them over the internet,
and copy them to your friends.  You can also instantly look at the
picture and know if you took a picture of the right thing or if you
need to reshoot the picture rather than waiting for the pictures to
come back from the dark room.  Finally, one other thing that is very
important to astronomy is that digital cameras are far more sensitive
to light than film cameras are.  A film camera will catch about 5% of
the light hitting it, while a CCD digital camera typically catches
about 95% of the light which hits it.  This isn't immediately obvious
with a digital camera, but one thing that you can try if you have a
digital camera is to take a picture at night, and you'll find out that
it comes out much better than a film camera.

So when digital cameras first came out, plate photographs very quickly
became obsolete, and most older observatories today have dark rooms
and storage rooms for photochemicals, and these rooms are largely
empty.

The digital chips which are at the end of most telescopes are largely
the same as the ones in consumer digital cameras.  There is one big
difference in that the ones at the end of telescopes are generally
cooled by liquid nitrogen.  The reason for this is that a digital
camera will pick up some noise from heat, and you want to reduce that
noise as much as possible.

So you have a digital camera at the end of an instrument at the end of
a telescope.  Typically, in an observing run, you wake up at about 3
p.m.  During the day the technicians will have installed the
instruments that you need for a nights observing run.  You go to the
telescope at 3 p.m., check to see that everything is installed
correctly, since you don't want to wake someone up at 3 a.m. if
something breaks.  You then spend the next two hours before sunset
taking some calibration shots.  One image set that you take involves
closing the shutter, and taking an image of black.  Even though the
CCD chip is soaking in liquid nitrogen, there is still some noise in
the picture that you want to get rid of.  Another set of images you
take, involves pointing the telescope at a spot on the wall which has
been painted white.  The reason for the white picture is that the
different parts of the CCD chip will have different sensitivities.
There are also cracks and dust and other noise on the CCD that you
want to subtract from your observations.  About this time, its dinner
(or breakfast), so you head off and eat and come back when the sun
starts setting.

After the sun starts setting, your first goal is to find the object
that you are trying to photograph.  You can punch in the coordinates
into the computer, but that will only point the telescope in the
general area of the sky that you are interested in.  The next thing
that you have to do is to take out your star atlas, and look for a
pattern of stars that is close to the thing that you are looking for.
This is a lot like driving in an strange city when you are looking at
the monitor and then trying to match the patterns you see with the
patterns on the chart.

So you've now found the object you are looking for.  The next step is
what has been called the world's slowest video game.  The problem is
that you want to keep the shutter open for a long time (say thirty
minutes) to capture as much light from the object as possible.  The
trouble is that in that time, the sky moves.  The telescope is trying
to track the object, but the tracking isn't perfect.  So you have to
make adjustments to the telescope.  What that involves is to mark the
location of some stars on the television monitor with a grease pencil,
and then if the stars start to drift, you use the control panel to
move the stars back.  The annoying thing is that you have to keep your
eyes on the monitor.  In between these measurements, you take some
snapshots of a calibration device.  If you are looking at spectra, you
take picture of a flourscent lamp that has lines in certain known
positions.  If you are measuring brightness, then you need to take
some pictures of a star whose brightness is known.

So after a night of all of this, you now have some data on hard disk,
and you go to sleep.  The next few weeks is where the hard part comes
in.  You see you have a lot of raw data, but it's not very useful to
anyone.  The problem is that none of the data has been calibrated.  So
you spend the next few weeks taking the data, subtracting the black
leve, correcting the white levels, stretching and shrinking the
picture so that you know what the frequencies of your spectra are.
You might also be spending your time doing things like trying to
correct for the effects of dust in the galaxy.  Through it all, you
are probably using an astronomy package called IRAF, which you like
all big software packages has its cute bugs and idiosyncrasies.

After all of this, you now have tables and charts which the world is
interested in.  You then type up a paper, and then upload it to
www.archvix.org and then send it off to a journal.  The journal then
takes the paper submits it to three anonymous referees who then
evaluate the paper.  In some cases, they will give the go ahead to
publish.  In very rare cases, they will say that the paper is beyond
hope of publication.  In most cases, they will return the paper with

After all of this, you now have tables and charts which the world is

www.archvix.org and then send it off to a journal.  The journal then
takes the paper submits it to three anonymous referees who then
evaluate the paper.  In some cases, they will give the go ahead to
publish.  In very rare cases, they will say that the paper is beyond
hope of publication.  In most cases, they will return the paper with
some comments, questions, and suggestions, and there is usually some
back and forth before the paper is approved.

In the mean time, you are busy thinking up of experiments and
observations you want to do next, and are spending your time reading
up on what the latest data is, helping to design new instruments for
your telescope, or working on proposals to get telescope time or grant
money.

It's a very long slow process, and its full more of hard work than of
eureka moments.  But as things plod along, you get more and more data,
and slowly it becomes more and more clear what is going on out there
in the universe.

== Polaris location ==

The text states that Polaris is on the &quot;cup&quot; of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). This is incorrect- Polaris is at the end of the &quot;handle&quot; of the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor). May I correct this or can someone else do it please? That glaring mistake says a lot about the accuracy of the rest of the text. Perhaps the author meant to say that the cup of Ursa Major points to Polaris? That's how I learned to find it as a child, was by following a line from the cup of the big dipper.

:Yes, you may correct it.  That is the point of a Wiki. If you like, you can add a diagram as well.

=== Dark Matter and Dark Energy ===

Dark Matter is invisible, but has been postulated from its apparent influence on normal matter. It is one explanation for the lack of gravity needed to hold our universe together. The current estimations of the total mass in the universe wouldn't support the observations and given the current estimates of mass; our star systems would simply fall apart. The dark matter theory states that there is matter that doesn't emit radiation and therefore we cannot observe, as all of our methods rely on detecting electromagnetic waves of some sort.

This is an observation that has thrown everyone off guard. There is a certain type of supernova called type Ia. The nice thing about type Ia supernova is that they all have the same absolute brightness.
(We will discuss the mystery of ''why'' they have the same absolute brightness, and how they are used to measure distances, in a later chapter, [[General Astronomy/The Death of High Mass Stars]]). This makes them very useful for measuring distances. The thing that has everyone confused is that it seems that the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing.  This suggests that there is some sort of dark energy in space.  As space expands, this energy appears and causes space to expand even more.
As of now, one of the major research efforts is to gather data on fainter supernova in order to have more data points to define the expansion curve. The goal is to gain a more exact idea of how the universe is expanding so that we have some idea of what is causing the acceleration.

This is still confusing people. One of the problems is that we have some pretty strong arguments as to what dark matter isn't. It's probably not regular matter made of protons and neutrons. The reason why we believe that is that if it were ordinary matter, then when you calculate you get too little deuterium in the universe. Another problem is that the &quot;clumpiness&quot; of the galaxies and the cosmic
background radiation just doesn't look right. If you go through the properties of dark matter, it turns out that it doesn't correspond to any known particle.

Some other theories explaining dark matter deal directly with our way of thinking about gravity. There is speculation that there is another large-scale force that is keeping our universe together. {{fact}}
Another possible explanation is to think of space as a gas-and-space solid. If you place two objects apart from each other then pressurize the area, the two objects will be forced towards each other. This reverses our current ideas of gravity from an object having a pull on other object, to an object being pushed from all directions. (An object alone has no movement, but two objects create an uneven pressure pushing the objects together.)

[[Image:Dark_matter_pie.jpg|thumb|Dark matter]]

An estimated 23% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. Ordinary matter only makes up 4% of the universe. The remaining 73% is an even more mysterious, repulsive &quot;dark vacuum energy&quot;.

The most popular theory right now is that the repulsive force is actually a property of space itself: it is caused by waves of energy, created by particles and anti-particles popping into existence and then annihilating each other with no net effect. Early in the universe's life, when there wasn't much space, the effect was small compared to gravity. But as the galaxies moved apart, the effect became greater. [http://hetdex.org/dark_energy/what_is_it/vacuum_energy.html#]

'''History and Ideas of Composition'''

The term dark matter can be applied to solar objects that have a large mass to luminosity ratio. Dark matter cannot be seen or measured however it plays an essential part in our universe. First theorized in 1933 by Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky who attempted to find an explanation for the absence of matter between objects in space. He observed that there was more mass in a cluster of galaxies than there should be from the visible objects. So there was something unseen adding to the mass of the cluster.  Then in 1950 Vera Rubin discovered that contrary to Newton’s law that objects orbit around a center point move slower the farther away they are from the center. She found that in fact an objects speed remained the same regardless of the proximity to the center point. So in order for the speed to remain the same there had to be some extra matter, which was present on the outer rings of an objects orbit. Building off Zwicky’s work she concluded that this extra mass was dark matter. It was also discovered that dark matter explained the flat shape of rotational curves of the planets. The term dark matter represents matter that we perceive to be there because of its effect on the objects around it. While the exact make up of dark matter is still unknown scientist have theorized a list of possible components that dark matter could be. Possibly candidates or ingredients of dark matter are:

Ionized gas	Emits thermal free-free radiation which cannot be observed.
Dust	Emits radiation and is made up of elements heavier that helium.
Main Sequence Stars	Could be an ingredient but could not be sole property of dark matter because a great amount of them would be visible.
Black Holes are highly unlikely because they would disrupt the binary separations of dark matter. However not much is known about the explosions that produce black holes, so it is still an option.
White Dwarfs	When forming white dwarfs produce many intermediate-mass elements (He, N, Ne, C, O) or halo gas, which is not visible.
Neutrinos	Unlikely but they do have enough mass to be a candidate.
WIMPS or Cold Dark Matter	Weak interacting particles but move at nonrelativistic speeds.
A more in depth flow chart depicting how the above suggestions are connected is picture below taken from Modern Cosmological Observations And Problems (140).

=== Reionization ===

The cosmic background radiation was formed when protons and electrons combined to form atoms. The trouble is that we know
that the matter between galaxies today is ionized (i.e. it's separate protons and electrons) with clumps of hydrogen atoms. We know this because when we look at all but the most distant galaxies, we don't see the spectra lines of hydrogen. So at some point the hydrogen in the universe reionized. The notion was that starlight caused the hydrogen in the universe to reionize, but the latest observations seem to indicate that this reionization occurred before the first stars were there.

=== Galaxy Formation ===

The idea is that galaxies started from tiny fluctuations in density that formed after the big bang. By assuming that the universe consists mainly of cold dark matter, you can almost get the clumpliness that you see with the current galaxies. But there are still puzzles. There is an annoying lack of tiny galaxies, and the rotation curve that cold dark matter predicts, isn't quite the one
that we see.

=== Before the Big Bang ===

Now to get really speculative, there have been some papers written recently that try to figure out what happened before the Big Bang.  One of the strange ideas is that the universe is merely one plane in a multidimensional space, and that what happened was that two membranes in a multidimensional space collided causing a massive expansion in three of the dimensions. This is all really speculative, but the weird thing is that it isn't totally disconnected from observation. The idea is that you can use this model to predict the initial expansion of the universe, and this might have some effects on the ripples that you see in the cosmic microwave background. The big problem is that the matter that began expanding had to have always existed, yet, because of the predictable nature of the elements, it had to have had a definite, external force to set it in motion that could decide when to start the &quot;chain reaction&quot;. Something cannot just be in a stable form, or even an unstable form, forever and finally explode, it has to go in a cycle. In other words, consider the following. Out of nothing, a theretofore nonexistent dense mass spontaneously emerged, which erupted in an enormously powerful fireball by its own theretofore nonexistent energy to spontaneously and immediately create from this chaos the defined fundamental forces of physics and the subatomic fundamental particles, which eventually organized themselves into a variety of atomic species, then into molecules, and then into a diverse assortment of inorganic matter that gravitationally assembled itself into this highly structured and precisely ordered universe. We all know that this is ridiculous, but it is equally ridiculous to say &quot;a theretofore stable mass spontaneously became unstable&quot;.

With all of these puzzles, its not clear what is going to happen next. There is a lot of data coming in, and it may be that with new data, it will be possible to make our models of the universe work with minor tweaks here and there, and we can go on in the mode of what Kuhn calls &quot;normal science.&quot; It's also possible that one day there will be some observation which is like Galileo seeing the phases of Venus. Some observation that makes absolutely no sense in the current paradigm of things, and this will force people to fundamentally change how we view the universe.

=== Discussion Questions ===

1) Find an old astronomy textbook, and compare it with a very recent one.  What mysteries in the old astronomy textbook are now believed to be resolved, and what facts and statements in the old astronomy textbook are now believed to be incorrect?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The subject of extraterrestrial intelligence is one which has a
fascinating mix of fact and speculation.  In dealing with
extraterrestrial intelligence there is one important fact which was
first pointed out by Enrico Fermi, the scientist that built the first
nuclear reactor, and it's an obvious fact that is so obvious that one
doesn't realize how remarkable it is until one thinks about it.  This
is the fact that when one looks at the skies, there is no obvious sign
of extraterrestrial life.


== Where are they? ==

It's a remarkable fact, because even with our limited technology level, we've made the sun  look very strange
to an alien astronomer.  Type G stars simply do not emit much radio
radiation, and to any astronomer within a fifty light year radius of
the earth, there is something blindingly weird about the sun, in that
something is causing the sun to appear to emit vast amounts of radio
waves.  Once the sun has been identified as odd, it wouldn't take that
much effort to start looking into the characteristics of the radio
waves and through things like Doppler shift, quickly figure out that
the radio waves didn't come from the sun but rather from a planet in
orbit.  Once that gets figured out, you can look at the details of the
radio spectrum and piece together things like the rotation rate of the
Earth (the amount of radio waves you will see will be sharply reduced
when the Atlantic and Pacfic ocean are facing you in comparison to the
continents), and someone who is sufficiently clever might be able to
figure out how to decode the radio output of the earth.

The paradox becomes even more odd if you think ahead a thousand or two
thousand years.  Keep in mind that a thousand or two thousand years is
nothing astrophysically speaking.  If you can imagine what we ought to
be able to do, assuming that rates of technological growth don't slow
down, there ought to be many things that would be astrophysically
obvious.  For example, the ultimate answer to the energy resources is
to build a series of solar satellites that trap solar energy and beam
it to the earth or any other planet in the solar system.  If you trap
enough solar energy, this will start to become obvious in the solar
spectrum, in that if you plot many stars in the HR diagram then you
will soon find that there is something very odd about some of the
stars that don't fit on the main sequence at all.  Another technology
that might be astrophysically significant is that of nanotechnology
and self-replicating machines.  It shouldn't be too hard in the next
thousand years to produce autonomous robots that can feed off
asteroids and reproduce.  Once you have these robots roaming the
stars, exponential growth makes it very likely that you will run into
one of them.

So there is something odd to be explained.  The problem here is that
we have enough facts to establish that there is a puzzle, but not
nearly enough facts to figure out what the solution is.  There are
many ways of resolving the Fermi paradox, and given the lack of facts
to constrain the solution, we are more in the realm of science fiction
than of science at this point.

Some of the solutions are extremely depressing.  One solution is
simply that technological civilizations destroy themselves.  There is
no end to the number of ways we could destroy ourselves now, and it's
also possible that advancing technology could allow for ways of
self-destruction that we haven't thought about.  For example, what
would happen if nanotechnology made it possible for any human being to
create their own atomic bomb or a deadly virus?

There are also sociological explanations that are rather depressing.
We happen to live in a society that for the most part thinks that
technology and curiosity are good things.  However, even looking at
examples in our own history, it's not clear that the way that we look
at the world is the most natural or the most stable.  There are the
classics of dystopian fiction 1984 and Brave New World, and one would
imagine that these worlds aren't that conducive to stellar
colonization.  

It may be possible that when and
if we start exploring alien worlds, we'll find that at least in our
part of the galaxy, that some previous civilization managed to
extinguish, for whatever reason, all traces of life and then destroyed
itself. But then again maybe not.

Before one gets too depressing, let me just point out one other
obvious fact that is even more amazing when you think about it.  We do
know that somehow, someway, we've made it this far.  We don't know how
probable or improbable life and alien civilization is, but we do know
that somehow someway, it happened at least once on the Earth.  We
don't know what is the resolution of the Fermi paradox, but what we
do find remarkable is that first that we might someday figure this
out, and that somehow, at least to some people, it really matters.

Plus the sun is 93,000,000 miles away from earth.

;The Drake Equation
:Takes into account:
#Number of stars in a galaxy. (N*)
#Fraction of stars with planets. (fp)
#Number of planets in a system that reside within the life-zone for that system. (nLZ)
#Fraction of suitable planets on which life actully begins. (fL)
#Fractions of lifeforms which evolve to intelligence. (FI)
#Fraction of star's life during which lifeform is communicative. (FS)

The last factor is the hardest to estimate, along with the number of communicative civilizations per galaxy (NC). The probabilities cover several orders of magnitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A continuous statistic is a random variable that does not have any points at which there is any distinct probability that the variable will be the corresponding number. 

===General Properties===
====Cumulative Distribution Function====

A continuous random variable, like a discrete random variable, has a cumulative distribution function. Like the one for a discrete random variable, it also increases towards 1. Depending on the random variable, it may reach one at a finite number, or it may not. The cdf is represented by a capital F.

====Probability Distribution Function====

Unlike a discrete random variable, a continuous random variable has a probability density function instead of a probability mass function. The difference is that the former must integrate to 1, while the latter must have a total value of 1. The two are very similar, otherwise. The pdf is represented by a lowercase f.

====Special Values====
Let ''R'' be the set of points of the distribution.

The expected value for a continuous variable ''X'' with probability density function ''f'' is defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\int_{R} xf(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, the expected value of any continuously transformed variable ''g(X)'' with probability density function ''f'' is defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\int_{R} g(x)f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

The mean of a continuous or discrete distribution is defined as &lt;math&gt;E[X]&lt;/math&gt;.

The variance of a continuous or discrete distribution is defined as &lt;math&gt;E[(X-E[X]^2)]&lt;/math&gt;.

Expectations can also be derived by producing the Moment Generating Function for the distribution in question.  This is done by finding the expected value &lt;math&gt;E[\exp(tX)]&lt;/math&gt;.  Once the Moment Generating Function has been created, each derivative of the function gives a different piece of information about the distribution function.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d E[\exp(tX)]}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; = mean&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 E[\exp(tX)]}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt; = variance&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3 E[\exp(tX)]}{dt^3}&lt;/math&gt; = skewness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^4 E[\exp(tX)]}{dt^4}&lt;/math&gt; = kurtosis&lt;br&gt;

Astronomy like all sciences is a social activity in which people are constantly discussing new ideas, interpreting data, and arguing with each other over what observations mean.  Astronomers can broadly be divided into two groups.  '''Observational astronomers''' specialize in building instruments such as telescopes, and spacecraft, and take raw data and process them into meaningful results.  '''Theoretical astronomers''' often also known as '''astrophysicists''' take the results that observational astronomers provide and attempt to create physical models which explain the data that observers see and provide ideas of the directions that observers should go into.  Theoretical astronomers increasingly rely on computer models and often are skilled at programming.

Astronomy is rather unique in that a lot of the data is provided by '''amateur astronomers.'''  The data needed in some fields such as variable star astronomy or comet discovery can be gathered by instruments well within the budget of an interested hobbyist.

[[Image:Inside nih grant.jpg|thumb|200px|left|In a grant panel review, shown above, scientists examine and criticize proposals for new research.]]

=== Peer review ===

A central part of the scientific process is peer review which occurs at several stages in the process, and creates what H.H. Bauer calls a '''knowledge filter'''.  In the peer review process, a proposal or a journal article is given to a group of referees who anonymously submit their comments on the proposal.  While the referees will sometimes communicate with each other, they are not intended to reach a consensus on the quality of work.  In addition, the referees usually do not have the final authority to decide on the fate of a proposal, but instead given their opinions to an editor or project director who does have the final authority and on occasion overrides the opinions of the referees.

The opinions of the referees are usually made available to the submitter, and often contain suggestions for improvement to the submitter.  This is considered crucial for the scientific process as it allows the submitter to receive feedback on his or her proposal and improve it.  In some cases, the submitter is encouraged to resubmit their proposal after making changes, and this often develops into an anonymous communication between the referees and the submitter.

=== Getting what you need ===

A lot of the work in astronomy involves getting access to resources, which include:

* money
* for observers, telescope and equipment time
* for theorists, computer time

In order to get these resources, astronomers typically write grant proposals which outline the amount of money, telescope, and computer time needed.  

Grant proposals typically undergo peer review by the granting agency which includes feedback on how well it fits the priorities of the funding agency, how likely the committees think it is to advance the frontiers of knowledge, and how essential the resource being allocated is to the researcher.  Typically, a set portion of telescope or supercomputer time will be made available to the institution that hosts or funds the resource, giving scientists affiliated with that institution priority use over that resource.  The remaining time is then made open for research proposals from researchers from other institutions.  In the case of ground based telescope time, the most precious and highly sought after time is '''dark time''' during which the moon is new and the dimmest objects can be seen.

In some cases, such as building a new telescope, supercomputer center, or funding a new spacecraft, astronomers must lobby funders such as charitable foundations and legislators for money to finance a certain activity.  The lobbying for research facilities can be extremely intense as having a facility sited at your institution gives your institution priority access to the facility, as well as prestige, and makes your institution a destination for researchers.

=== The life of an observational astronomer ===

Typically, in an observing run, you wake up at about 3
p.m.  During the day the technicians will have installed the
instruments that you need for a nights observing run.  You go to the
telescope at 3 p.m., check to see that everything is installed
correctly, since you don't want to wake someone up at 3 a.m. if
something breaks, you then spend the next two hours before sunset
taking some calibration shots. 

After the sun starts setting, your first goal is to find the object
that you are trying to photograph.  You can punch in the coordinates
into the computer, but that will only point the telescope in the
general area of the sky that you are interested in.  The next thing
that you have to do is to take out your star atlas, and look for a
pattern of stars that is close to the thing that you are looking for.
This is a lot like driving in a strange city when you are looking at
the monitor and then trying to match the patterns you see with the
patterns on the chart.

So you've now found the object you are looking for. In between these measurements, you take some
snapshots of a calibration device.  If you are looking at spectra, you
take picture of a fluorescent lamp that has lines in certain known
positions.  If you are measuring brightness, then you need to take
some pictures of a star whose brightness is known.

So after a night of all of this, you now have some data on hard disk,
and you go to sleep.  The next few weeks is where the hard part comes
in.  You see you have a lot of raw data, but it's not very useful to
anyone.  The problem is that none of the data has been calibrated.  So
you spend the next few weeks taking the data, subtracting the black
levels, correcting the white levels, stretching and shrinking the
picture so that you know what the frequencies of your spectra are.
You might also be spending your time doing things like trying to
correct for the effects of dust in the galaxy.  Through it all, you
are probably using an astronomy package called IRAF, which like
all big software packages has its cute bugs and idiosyncrasies.  At the end of all of this you have a paper, and are ready to publish.

Observational astronomers are often at the mercy of things that are outside of their control.  Weeks if not months of effort at setting up an observing run can be destroyed if it happens to be cloudy or raining on the night of the run.

=== The life of a theorist ===

Unlike observers, theorists are creatures of the day.  The typical theorist spends their days reading papers trying to understand how to model a particular type of phenomenon.  Once they have a model, the goal then is to try to get testable predictions from that model, and this often means programming a computer to calculate the consequences of that model.  There are occasional flashes of inspiration, but most of the time is spent very slowly and methodically trying to understand the consequences of a model, and to slowly and methodically program the model into a computer and systematically remove the bugs from the model.  

There are also a lot of social interactions as theorists argue and debate what a particular observation means, and as theorists and observationalists share ideas about the latest data.

=== Letting people know about your research ===

There are a number of channels through which scientific results are made known.  The primary means that astronomers use to make others aware of current research are through '''preprints''' which are papers uploaded through web servers such as the Los Alamos Preprint Server at http://www.arxiv.org/ or through '''conference proceedings''' in which scientists announce their results either through lectures or poster papers.  Astronomers are also constantly travelling between departments to give talks on their research at seminars, astronomy lunches, and journal clubs. 

Although it has been supplemented by preprints, peer reviewed publication in the '''primary literature''' is still considered an essential part of publicizing research.  This literature consists of articles in journal such as '''Astrophysical Journal''' or '''Astronomy and Astrophysics'''.  Because of the length of time, typically several months, necessary to go through a peer review, research results are typically shared with the community through preprints before peer review is complete.  Nevertheless, astronomers still generally submit their papers to peer review even after the results have been released to the research community, because the interaction between anonymous referees and the paper submitter improves the quality of the work and insures the community that the paper does not have any obvious errors.

Once an astronomy paper is available for publication, it can be accessed through the Astrophysics Data System at http://adswww.harvard.edu/  Increasingly, raw data from sky surveys is being made available on the web.

One shortcoming of the primary literature is that it reports on individual research results without providing context.  As such it is difficult for someone who is not actively involved in research in a particular area to understand the relevance of the work.  To deal with this problem, primary literature is summarized and combined into the '''secondary literature''', where it will be read by a broader audience of scientists. The secondary literature is a synthesis of the results of recent research in a field. The body of secondary literature includes periodic reviews of progress, such as the ''Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics'', professional books, and other research summaries.

=== How to be an astronomer ===

Most astronomers major in either physics or astronomy as an undergraduate and then go to graduate school where they work on the Ph.D. under the supervision of a dissertation advisor.  The main challenges in becoming an astronomer are to master the language of mathematics and physics, and to gain experience in working through the scientific process.

After graduate school, an astronomer typically works as a post-doctoral fellow before getting a job either as a professor at a university or a researcher at a laboratory.  Because of the large number of graduates gaining Ph.D.'s, people with astronomy degrees are increasingly found outside academia. They work in science related fields, as computer programmers for software companies and even on Wall Street.

Astronomy also is open for amateur astronomers.  Most of the data for variable stars is accessible via a telescope which is affordable by hobbyists, and amateurs provide important observational data.

=== Notes ===

[2] There are some exceptions to the practice of releasing research results before peer review is complete, and this involves a trade-off between speed and completeness.  

When a result is believed likely to be controversial (such as the possible discovery of microfossils on Mars), the researchers may choose to keep the finding secret until peer review is complete so that the result will likely withstand challenges after it is released.  Another case where results are kept until peer review is complete involves releasing large datasets such as sky surveys.  In this case, the delay introduced by peer review is small in comparison to the benefits of having a through review before announcing the results.

=== Discussion questions ===

1) Visit either the Los Alamos preprint site or the Astrophysics Data Service and find a paper.  How is the paper structured and what concepts in this text book do you find in the papers?

2) Look at the schedule of several university astronomy departments on the web.  What is being discussed?  How are different astronomy departments different from each other and how are they the same?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Moved original text here and gradually rewriting.

I don't think that the original text accurately describes the process of astronomy at all.  Namely

* The process of grant writing, isn't and shouldn't be a filter for scientific merit.  The main criterion for whether a grant gets issued or not is whether or not the grant proposal meets the institutional priority of the grant writer. If the funding agency thinks that studying quasars is important, then you aren't going to get money to study Jupiter.

* Most of the communications in astronomy today effectively bypasses peer review.  Most of the real communications between astronomers takes place at conferences or via the Los Alamos preprint server.  By the time something is formally peer reviewed, months have passed and it is likely out of date.

* Review articles are important but it is incorrect to assert that the secondary literature is less error-prone that the primary.  Again this is  because things move fast and by the time a review article is written, it is likely out of date.

[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 00:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:I disagree with that.
:* The grant process ''is'' a filter for scientific merit. I was at the NSF town hall meeting at the last AAS meeting, and Eileen made exactly this point -- scientists shouldn't feel that the NSF isn't interested in their work just because there's no NSF program for their area. Any area of work is eligible and will be evaluated on the basis of merit.
:* It's true that communication usually bypasses the peer review system, but this has always been true. It's still considered necessary to go through the formal peer review process. Keep in mind that peer reviewed journals are as strong now as ever.
:* I'm taken aback by your claim that the secondary literature is no less error-prone than the primary literature, and I'm not really sure how to respond. Journals -- even peer reviewed journals -- are notoriously error prone. I recall reading in ''Nature'' some years ago that some 10% of 3-sigma results are eventually discredited. Review articles have the advantage of being written after some degree of consensus and concordance have developed in a field, and these types of problems have been sorted out. And that's exactly what I was getting at.
:I think the difference in our ideas is that you think of science as a process in which old ideas become obsolete, whereas I see science as a process of iterative clarification on ideas that were previously mostly correct. I'd encourage you read Kuhn's ''Structure'' if you haven't already, as well as Bauer's ''Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method'', which is where the peer review filter originates.
:The bottom line is that the material you're questioning is all grounded in [[w:WP:RS|reliable sources]]. I'm in favor of re-incorporating this.
:--Brian Brondel 15:44, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::I've read Kuhn and I'll take a look at Bauer, but most of my edits involve direct experience with how things work in the trenches.  One thing that is significant is that the internet has significantly changed the practice of astronomy.  The other thing that has changed is the *massive* amount of new data that is coming in as a result of WMAP and some of the spacecraft out there.

::: NSF Grants are open to all comers, but if you are at an institution with a telescope you will have priority access to telescope time for reasons that have nothing to do with scientific merit (it's still peer reviewed, but the standard is much lower.)  Also, NSF may accept grant proposals for non-program grants, but if the infrastructure isn't there, there isn't much of a chance of getting the proposal funded.

::: Also telescope time (and spacecraft budgets) is so precious that a lot of very good scientific proposals aren't funded for essentially political reasons.  The situation is much less bad in astronomy than in particle physics, because the dollar amounts are lower, but I strongly disagree with the idea that the grant process is (or should be) an effective filter for scientific merit because of the high level of politics that inherent in the process.  This isn't a bad thing.  The decision as to whether to risk a space shuttle mission to fix Hubble or how much to fund planetary exploration is essentially a public policy decision, that IMHO shouldn't (and isn't) be made by scientists alone.  It's also the case that the bigger the decision, the less the decision does resemble (or should resemble) the standard peer review process, and the more the decision process resembles (and IMHO should resemble) the legislative process.

::: It is necessary to go through the peer review process for reputation sake, but the primary communications between astronomers is no longer peer reviewed.  Things really changed in the 1990's with the Los Alamos Preprint Server.  People have always exchanged preprints, but the Los Alamos server changed things is that now it is impossible for someone in astronomy to do anything useful if they only thing that they read is peer-reviewed articles.

::: In astronomy, the secondary literature is notoriously unreliable because the latest information is not in the secondary literature.  In the six months it takes to write a decent review article on the accelerating universe, it is very likely that there is going to be some significant piece of new data that totally invalidates much of the review article.

::: The other thing is that I can point to some review articles that clearly aren't functioning in the way Bauer mentions.  There are some very nice articles in Annual Reviews which summarize &quot;non-standard cosmologies&quot; in either neutral or sympathetic ways.  They are excellent introductions to a different way of looking at things (which most astronomers think is nuts), but &quot;error-correction&quot; and &quot;consensus-building&quot; they are not.

::: The problem that I had with article was that it just doesn't fit with what I am seeing, and gives an impression of science that is far more authoritarian than what is actually the case.  I do think that Kuhn is very valuable, and I'll need to read Bauer before commenting on his statements.

[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 16:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

-------
Given the methods by which scientific progress happens and the potential vulnerability of science to faulty reasoning, it isn't hard to understand why scientific work has sometimes remained in error for many years &amp;mdash; sometimes even centuries &amp;mdash; before finally being corrected. Paradigms are very valuable to the scientists who work under them, and scientists rarely do their work with complete disinterest and neutrality, but with the specific goal of affirming their own ideas. This inherent and unavoidable bias is the reason an individual cannot successfully engage in science in isolation. The philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, who is known for his study of the role of the paradigm in science, remarked that &quot;once [a paradigm] has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed.&quot; Progress in science requires practitioners with a variety of viewpoints so that paradigms will be truly tested rather than uncritically reaffirmed.

(...)


To protect against bias in our understanding of the universe, an elaborate system of '''peer review''' has become established as a mechanism by which sloppy or incorrect work can be removed. The particular mechanisms of peer review used by modern scientists, named the &quot;Knowledge Filter&quot; by the chemist Henry Bauer, work by applying progressively higher standards to new research.

Unfiltered research begins as an idea. The idea is founded in previous research and the training and world-view or the researcher. The first stage of the filter is the scientist's desire for a good reputation and need for a job. Research must be approved by a panel of respected scientists in order to receive funding. In astronomy, large observatories have committees to allocate telescope time to the projects they perceive to be the best. This first step eliminates obviously wrong ideas from the body of scientific knowledge and allows other ideas to proceed towards acceptance.

Once research has progressed, it is presented to the scientific community again. This is the second filter. As the research is organized into a presentable from, errors are ironed out. The work is again subject to feedback by the community. Before a research paper can be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, it must be submitted to a knowledgeable scientist for criticism. In this step, scholarly publication is protected against poor experimental methods and incorrect conclusions. Work that progresses to this stage appears in '''primary literature''', which reveals the very recent progress and direction of scientific work. The content of the primary literature is, to quote Bauer, &quot;mostly not obviously wrong.&quot; It is still subject to scrutiny by the community for correctness and repeatability. The next filter ensures that research lives up to a standard of usefulness. Other scientists apply the results from publication to their own work. As they do this, they also test and extend the original work.

Research that proves itself as useful and influential will be incorporated into the '''secondary literature''', where it will be read by a broader audience of scientists. The secondary literature is a synthesis of the results of recent research in a field. The body of secondary literature includes periodic reviews of progress, such as the ''Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics'', professional books, and other research summaries. In this filter, the opinions of many scientists about the merit of an idea are taken together. Since secondary literature is built upon research that has had time to mature and be tested, the ideas it expresses is more reliable than the primary literature.

As more time passes, the research described in the secondary literature is further corrected of errors.  The work is used and reproduced by other scientists, and it begins to show concordance with other fields. When this has happened, the ideas have high credibility. This is the next filter, which brings the work into the realm of textbook science. The result of textbook science is a collection of ideas that are mostly very reliable. These ideas are slowly built up from a consensus among sciences, founded on agreement between theory and experiment and concordance with other theories.

== H.H. Bauer ==

Looking through a summary of book, I'm pretty impressed by it, and I've got it on order.  My main objection is that I'm not sure a description on how science was done in 1957 can be taken at face value in 2006.  There have been some huge changes since then.  There have been some pretty huge changes since 1990.  Kuhn I think is different because he talked in terms of principles which have been the same since the time of the Greeks.  Bauer's work seems to be less timeless.

The thing that I object the most to the original text was the statement of &quot;textbook science.&quot;  One of the reasons that I'm interested in Wikibooks is that I think it is likely to fundamentally change the way science is done from the way Bauer describes it.

[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 16:58, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:I hope you enjoy Bauer's book.

:I take a different view of this whole thing. Science is, despite any pluralist or democratic ideals, in a sense an authoritarian endeavor, with peer review very much central to the whole thing. Peer review is what stands between crackpottery, silliness, individual conceit, etc., of scientists, and the popular media and textbooks. I consider this very much the leading opinion.

:I'd also like to note that I wrote the text here on the basis of a survey of reading I undertook so that I could better understand the landscape of thought on method specifically for writing this module. This text is based on writings on method that have been very carefully thought out and well received by scholars of the philosophy of science. Those writings in turn are based on research combining the writings of a variety of scientists ranging from the Revolution to the present day on how they did their thing. And each step was filtered through the personal experiences of each writer &quot;in the trenches.&quot; I consider this a much better way of producing knowledge. Wikibooks is just another medium.

:--Brian Brondel 17:33, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:: Then we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement here since I think science is one of the most anti-authoritarian institutions out there.  One of the reason that I enjoy science so much is that you can go to a room full of people who are older and more senior than you are and say *YOU GUYS ARE ALL WRONG*, *THE TEXTBOOKS ARE WRONG*, *EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IS WRONG*, and if you have your logic and facts on your side, they'll start nodding their heads.

:: In the case of astronomy, the leading journals &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; in the US, &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot; in Europe, have a policy of basically publishing anything that isn't obviously stupid.  ApJ has a 70% acceptance rate for manuscripts and some pretty nutty stuff makes it in there (the big bang never happened!!! black holes don't exist!!!!).  One reason that peer reviewers make their feedback transparent is so that you can judge the judges.  It has happens that a submitter looks at the referee comments, concludes that the referees are idiots and then resubmits the proposal in another journal.  You will get your work in the primary literature unless it is so bad that no one will publish it.

:: Also, my opinions on peer review are colored by the fact that I've been a referee for grant proposals.  One thing that happens is that you quickly find out is that there so so many good proposals coming in, and so little money available that the grant process weeds out a lot of really good projects that you hope that someone else will fund. 

:: Politics also rears its head in the process.  This is a *GREAT* proposal.  Too bad our program budget doesn't cover this area, and what programs do get funded and to what amounts is generally a political decision in which there is little peer review (because it is ultimately not a scientific question).

[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 18:19, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Those are good points. As you say, we're more discussing theory than book content right now, so I'll keep it brief.

:::My perspective is that textbooks should have the best science, rather than the latest science. If you go to tell a roomful of people how wrong they are, they might act polite while you give your speech, but they aren't going to go home and teach your ideas to their 101 class until you've gotten to the other side of the peer review process, which probably won't be so polite. You're certainly right about peer review of journals. That's part of Bauer's point, though -- each step in the process is successively stronger. Bauer describes primary literature as &quot;mostly not obviously wrong.&quot; Politics does come into the review process, but I think of &quot;we'd like to but we can't&quot; to be separate from &quot;we shouldn't at all.&quot; There's nothing wrong with setting an agenda when not all good science can be done.

:::It's been fun having this conversation with you. I'll let you have the last word if you like, but then I should be getting back to work. I hope to see you more at [[Astronomy]] in the future. --Brian Brondel 18:58, 18 June 2006 (UTC).

== added section on peer review ==

I created a separate section on peer review which makes reference to Bauer's knowledge filter.

I agree that peer review is still central to science, and one thing that I wanted to do is to go into some detail about the process.  One thing that I like about the peer review process is that it is very transparent.  In other selection systems, you get a &quot;NO!!!! GO AWAY&quot; but in the peer review, the response is &quot;well, we think that there are these problems, can you check A, B, and C, change the statement on B, and resubmit.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ptolemy used this concept. He may have acquired it from earlier astronomy in Sumer (Iraq today)which was being developed as early as 2600 B.C.E. There is evidence on a copper bowl acquired by Prof. Clyde Hostetter in Riyadh in September 1976. It has non-verbal symbology about eclipses and also about the movements of the planet Venus, the manifestation of the sky-goddess Inana, who was an important part of Sumerian religion. Some of the symbols etched in the bowl indicated that Venus could be seen (without optics) as a thin crescent just before and just after inferior conjunction -- when Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun. Included in the symbology are a circle of loops suggesting that during the retrograde motion of Venus the planet came closer to the Earth. This could have suggested to Ptolemy the concept of epicycles, since he had access to the astronomical records of the Sumerians.  Details and photos of the symbology on the bowl can be obtained on request from Professor Hostetter at chostett@verizon.net.

Maybe you can address what other drawbacks there were to the epicycle theory, other than inefficiencies, if there were any...</text>

Another science which would perhaps be the most comprehensive way to not only use
analytical skills, but teach the general population that are not scientists
how to methodically cook almost anything by learning simple facts and concepts.


Unlike Home economics, the commonly referred to class in high school about cooking food,
the aim of this book is to use a hopefully illustrative style to teach about the basic chemical
and physiological composition of food. Using the Alton Brown &lt;u&gt;Guide to Molecular Gastronomy&lt;/u&gt;, we aim
to teach you how food is generally made.

Of course, our mission is to 

'''''&quot;Teach you how to cook, not simply teach you how to read recipes&quot;'''''

In this tutorial, we will be making a simple skirt, and using the cloth physics system to make it fall in realistic-looking folds.

==Making the Skirt Mesh==
# Open Blender and delete the default cube, if you aren't looking down on the scene, press '''NUM7'''.
# '''SHIFT+A''' &amp;rarr; ''Add &amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; Circle''
# The circle will be created, and in the Tool Shelf on the left you should see a panel appear for adjusting its settings. Set the number of vertices to about 12.
# Switch to Edit Mode with '''TAB'''. All the circle’s vertices should be initially selected; if not, use '''AKEY''' to select them all.
# Press '''EKEY''' to extrude a second copy of the vertices; press '''SKEY''' '''SHIFT+ZKEY''' to scale the extruded vertices in the X and Y directions. These will make up the hem of the skirt; scale it out to as large as you like. Note that this is positioning the skirt out flat horizontally, instead of hanging down as you would expect; Blender’s cloth animation system will take care of that, and this positioning gives maximum opportunity for the skirt to fall in dramatic folds.
# Now we will need to subdivide the mesh. The physics can only act on actual vertices, so the more of these we have, the more realistic the cloth effect will be. Select all vertices in the skirt, press '''WKEY''' and select the “Subdivide” option. A panel will appear in the Tool Shelf for controlling the settings for the subdivision operation; set the number of cuts to, say, 4.
# While you’re at it, look in the upper (scrolling) part of the Tool Shelf for a pair of “Shading” buttons titled “Smooth” and “Flat” [[File:Blender263ShadingButtons.png]], and click on “Smooth”.

==Creating the Vertex Group==
# Now we have to specify that the waist of the skirt will stay fixed in place as it falls: deselect all vertices, and select the innermost ring of vertices. The quickest way to do this is to hold down '''ALT+SHIFT''' and click with '''RMB''' on one of the edges bordering the hole in the middle. With the entire ring of vertices selected, go to the mesh data tab in the Properties window, find the “Vertex Groups” panel, and click the '''+''' sign to create a new group. This will initially be called “Group”; perhaps give it a more meaningful name (like “Waist”), and click “Assign” to put the selected vertices into the new group.

==Animating the Skirt==
# Tab out of Edit Mode into Object Mode. The skirt should still be selected.
# Go to the Physics tab [[File:Blender255PhysicsContextButton.png]] in the Properties window (last icon in the row at the top). This will just show a few buttons to begin with [[File:Blender263InitialPhysicsTab.png]].
# Click the “Cloth” button; a whole lot of other settings should appear, most of which can be left at their default values (make sure the checkbox at the top of the “Cloth Collision” panel is checked). However, check the box titled “Pinning”; now you can click in the field just below it to bring up a popup menu of all the vertex groups in the mesh; this should just contain the one entry named “Waist” you created earlier, so select that.
# Now the magic happens ... rotate the view to an oblique one to give yourself a good view of the process, and hit '''ALT+AKEY'''. You should now see the skirt fall from its horizontal position to a more natural vertical one, developing some folds in the process.
# After the animation has run through at least one complete cycle, hit '''ESC''' to stop it.

==Prior to Keeping the Folds==
Before doing the next step, we need to enable one of the standard addons that come with Blender. This will let us make a copy of any stage of the physics simulation into a separate object.

Go into the User Preferences window and bring up the “Addons” tab. Look for the “Animation Corrective shape keys” addon (typing “shape k” into the search box should be enough to find it).

{{Template:B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender263CorrectiveShapeKeysEnabled.png
|imageWidth=800px
}}

Enable it. Now back to the 3D view...

==Keeping the Folds==
# Use the left- and right- arrow keys to step through the animation one frame at a time, until you find a position for the skirt that you like.
# When the 3D view is showing a nice shape for the skirt, go to the mesh data tab in the Properties window, and look for the “Shape Keys” panel. Click with '''LMB''' on the down-arrow just below the '''+''' and '''-''' signs, and in the menu that appears, you should see the item “Create duplicate for editing” [[File:Blender263SaveAsShapeKey.png]]. Select that.
# It looks like nothing has happened, but in fact you now have a second copy of the skirt mesh, “baked” into the position corresponding to the current frame of the animation. Try using the arrow keys to move through the animation, and you will see the baked copy remain in the chosen position.
# At this point, you can delete the original animated skirt mesh (or move it to another layer for future reuse), leaving the nicely-folded copy.

[[File:BlenderSimpleSkirt.png]]

==Extra Practice==
# You will notice at some points during the animation, the folds of cloth pass right ''through'' each other, which is of course impossible with real cloth. To prevent this, you could go to the “Cloth Collision” panel in the Physics tab, and click the “Self Collision” checkbox. Rerun the animation ('''ALT+AKEY''') to see the difference; what other effects does it have?
# Maybe the folds don’t look realistic enough. Go back to the original mesh, bring up “Subdivide” again and subdivide it by a couple more levels. Rerun the animation ('''ALT+AKEY'''). It should take a bit longer for the first cycle, but do the results look better?
# This YouTube tutorial might also help: http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=mgYhZ3hWwTQ happy animating!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Upright Piano: When a key is depressed by one's finger, the capstan button on the back of the key pushes up the wippen. Wippen raises and the jack escapes from the butt then the hammer get leaned towards the string.  When the felt hammer strikes the string it causes it to vibrate.  This energy is transferred through the bridge into the soundboard, which resonates.  Pianos can be played softly (piano) and loudly (forte), unlike previous keyboard instruments which produced sound by plucking the string--instead of striking like pianos do today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Marinades==
Of courses it doesn't mean we should save ourself from the flavor enhancing powers of marinades.
Basically what it does it that softens the texture of the meat or vegetables you are marinating
and usually add infused flavors into the food.

In this case, sos means:

Seasoning
Oil-Something that is oil/fat
Spice-Things like salt and pepper

The things about marinades, unlike brines, is that typically the flavor is concentrated on the
surface of the food source.

It works on the principles of how acids denature or breakdown proteins, resulting in a more tender texture.

==Brines==
Though the science of brining is not fully understood, it works on the concept of osmosis and since it has more
salt on the inside of it, it is more likely to hold moisture in during frying, baking, and grilling. Basically it is a salt/Water mixture in which other spices can be added to add flavor.

In order to get maximum marks in this coursework it is vital that you discuss all factors which affect the rate of a reaction. These include:
*Temperature. The higher the temperature the more energy there is within the reaction. When there is energy in the reaction more reactants hit each other and then there are more successful reactions.
*Surface area. Smaller substances react better then large substances because the small substance has a larger surface area and if there are more reactants exposed there is more successful collision.
*Concentration. The more molecules in a chemical the more concentrated it is. When a chemical has a greater concentration of molecules the chances of successful collisions increases and therefore speeds up the reaction.
*Catalyst. Adding a catalyst will speed up a reaction by decreasing the energy needed to break the bonds. A catalyst is not chemically consumed by the reaction so does not have an effect on the final products.
*Pressure. Pressure results in there being more particles of each reagent in a smaller area, resulting in more reactions. 

==Skill P: Planning - the theory and your experiment design! ==

First, you can start by describing the reaction situation you are intending to investigate. For example, with the word and symbol equation, short description about the reaction, and so on. This sets the scene. 
If you are confident and chosen the VARIABLE you want to investigate you should try to make a prediction and maybe justify it with some theory if you can. 
You can continue in a broader context by introducing some background theory and descriptions of the factors or VARIABLES which may have an effect on the rate of the reaction you are studying (include briefly factors which might not apply). In your 'method' description use the correct units or descriptors. 
The factors to discuss might be ...  amount of limestone?, temperature of reactants?, acid concentration?, volume of acid?, size of limestone pieces? (relate to surface area?), stirring of the reacting mixture, size of reaction vessel, volume of thiosulphate, any added water to dilute etc. Example of the theory is the factors will increase the molecules inside the chemical and it will eventually increase the rate of reaction. 

Is there any other factor for the reaction you are studying?, will any of the reactants or products be affected by change in temperature or pressure? e.g. there are several reasons why the same acid should be used if its a reactant in the investigation, e.g. (1) its the hydrogen ion, H+(aq), is the active ingredient that actually 'attacks' the metal or carbonate, and acids can ionise to different extents, (2) 1 molar or 1 mol dm-3 (1M) H2SO4 is twice as acid as 1M HCl because each H2SO4 provides 2 H+'s whereas each HCl just 1. 
If you have decided, for example, to investigate the effect of acid concentration on the speed of a reaction, then everything else should be kept constant for a fair test, and this should be obvious in your plan for the reasons discussed above! 
If you haven't already chosen the VARIABLE, do so now, and make a prediction and justify it with some theory which you may have previously described and should refer to. 
Next you should describe initially, but briefly, some methods for following the reaction = measuring the speed of the reaction. If a gas is formed, there are at least two ways of collecting a gas e.g. initially empty gas syringe or a measuring cylinder/burette full of water inverted over water with appropriate tube connections and there is one other very different method available for 'following' the reaction using a balance to record the mass loss. 
The hydrochloric acid - sodium thiosulphate reaction depends on the time for a certain amount of sulphur precipitate to form and obscuring a marked black X on white paper. 
Briefly explain how the method can be used to measure the speed - the results of the first few minutes is usually the most crucial - you can discuss (briefly) other methods, but perhaps better in evaluation as a means of further evidence. 
When you have decided on the method, give a detailed description of how you might carry it out. Include details of the amounts of chemicals you might use mass, volumes, dilutions + UNITS etc. etc. 
Clearly indicate why the method would be expected to produce precise and reliable evidence - the results! 
Include 'health and safety' points. 
If you are looking at changing the reaction temperature, its not easy to accurately vary and control the temperature of the reactants without a thermostated water bath to hold the reaction flask in. Even with a thermostated water bath (normally only available to advanced level students), all the reactant solutions should be pre-warmed in the bath before mixing and start the timing and recoding of results.  
If you are varying temperature, you need to heat up the reactant solutions separately and take their temperatures, mix, start stopwatch. However, they will cool a little standing out in the laboratory, so not completely satisfactory solution to the problem. In the case of the sodium thiosulphate - acid reaction, you can leave the thermometer in the flask and take the temperature at the end, then use an average for the temperature of the reaction. 
If temperature isn't a variable, it must be kept constant. The simplest solution here, is to make sure all the chemicals have been standing in the laboratory prior to the lesson. Then, they will all be at the same temperature, which should be recorded. If more experiments are conducted at another the time, the temperature must again be checked and recorded. 
Refer to any previous laboratory experience with 'rate of reaction' experiments which may have helped you decide and design the experimental method. 
A clearly labelled diagram of the method with a brief outline of how you intend to carry out the experiments - this  cuts down on the writing and makes the scene clear! 
You must give details of  how long you might time the experiment as well as the time interval between experimental readings 
REMEMBER you can change your 'recipe' or way of doing the experiment. If you have to change anything, describe and explain the changes you have made to the procedure (some of this might count as valuable marks for the EVALUATION skill) 
AND DON'T FORGET AT ALL TIMES QUOTE THE CORRECT UNITS in P, O, A or E. 


==Skill O: Obtaining evidence ==

Observations, measurements, in other words the results! (Possibly some data you might have been given)

These must be clearly recorded in neat tables showing all the units e.g. 

Run 3: acid concentration? temperature ???? 
Time? Gas volume???? Gas volume??? (Repeat) corrected gas volume???  
0??? ??? ??? 
1 5 3??? 
2 11 9??? 

You can produce a summary table with the average/corrected (if necessary) gas volumes v time for all the different acid concentrations or whatever variable 
For the hydrochloric acid - sodium thiosulphate reaction you are recording just the reaction time for different thiosulphate or acid concentrations or temperatures, so the data gathering and subsequent processing is 'simpler'. 
All experiments should be repeated where time allows checking for accuracy and consistency; this may become more necessary after you have done a preliminary analysis 
The 'bung effect'! - look up about dead volumes and its correction when dealing with gas volumes! 
Your recorded results should indicate the accuracy of the measuring equipment e.g. 0- 2 decimal places. 
Some of the work done here in presenting the results, e.g. working out averages etc. actually counts towards the mark for analysing (described below). 
Have you got enough results, do they seem ok? Starting the analysis as soon as possible will help you decide whether further, wider ranging or repeat  experiments  - best decided after examining the graphs of results (see below) - difficult to decide just looking at tables of data.

==Skill A: Analysing and considering the evidence==
What do the results mean in terms of your prediction and theory! 

The results are initially processed into graphical form ('graphing') for several reasons for both the analysis and evaluating the experimental  .... they can clearly show the general trend of the effect of changing that factor or variable, highlighting experimental 'runs' that don't seem to fit the pattern of the other sets of results for the other runs, individual points that don't seem the pattern of a particular sets of results - BUT ITS UP TO YOU 
Ideally you should plot the average(*) corrected gas volumes on the y axis and time on the x axis - what should the origin be? (* May depend on the consistency of your results). 
For the hydrochloric acid - sodium thiosulphate reaction you can plot either (i) reaction time, or (ii) 1/time versus a concentration or temperature (1/time = relative rate of reaction). 
It is best, if possible,  to have all the average results points plotted on the same graph for easy comparison - take care because this may involve 4 or 5 lines for 4 or 5 different acid concentrations 
Make sure you use a clear KEY for the different line points and a clear title for the graph AND clearly label the axis including the units  or whatever .. 
Use smooth 'best curves' for as many of the points as possible, though some parts of the graph might be linear, watch out for the 'scatter' - the experiment is not that easy to get good results. 
See Rates of Reaction Notes. 
From the graph you can then describe in words what the results mean, always refer to the graph lines and gradients directly - don't make vague comments. 
So what we are after is the main 'trend(s)' or 'pattern(s)' describing with reference to the graphs. 
Does the 'trend' of all the graph lines support you're your prediction, are all the results consistent with your prediction AND theory? 
For different the acid concentrations you can do a 2nd and more advanced graphical analysis of the limestone results. This involves measuring from the graph, the speed of the reaction at the start. Explain why best data at the start? (i.e. first 3-5 mins?). 
What graph could you then plot?...   where does the graph line start?, origin?, what is the 'shape' of the graph? is it a better way of showing consistency (or inconsistency!) in your results? 
We are basically talking about plotting the initial rate versus e.g. acid concentration. 
If you are doing something like the hydrochloric acid - sodium thiosulphate reaction, your reaction time measures the formation of a fixed amount of sulphur per 'time'. So the rate is 'x amount of sulphur per time', which means the speed or rate is proportional to 1/time, then plot this 1/time against the concentration of the acid. 
From this graph re-discuss your findings in a more mathematical way and relate this to the particle collision theory of reactions! It's all about chance!  and explain why/why not the results support your prediction. 

==Skill E: Evaluating==

How good are your results then? error sources? can we improve the existing method? are there other experimental methods? 

Do your results seem consistent and accurate - always refer directly to the graph or graphs in your analysis ... do any of the sets of results not fit in with the others?, do most/all sets of results fit a pattern?, are there any particular points that don't fit the pattern? (anomalies), can some results be ignored in drawing your conclusion(s)? if so, which results and why? QUOTE DIRECTLY - WITH REFERENCE TO YOUR GRAPH(s) 
Discuss possible sources of error which might lead to inconsistent results i.e. points or sets of results that don't fit the pattern AND how could the method be improved to minimise these sources of error ... e.g. chip size? ,temperature or pressure checks for each experiment? dead volume?, ? gas syringe operation? draughts? where these or any other factor OK? in other words how suitable was the method overall? Do think the results are reliable bearing in mind any anomalies? 
For the hydrochloric acid - sodium thiosulphate reaction think about the precipitate, observing it etc. 
What further experiments, using the same method or another method, could be done to support your prediction or conclusion? In other words give some detailed ideas on further work that would provide additional relevant evidence. 
e.g. in the case of the sodium thiosulphate - hydrochloric acid experiment , you can use a light gate to detect the precipitate formation. The system consists of a light beam emitter and sensor connected to computer and the reaction vessel is placed between the emitter and sensor. The light reading falls as the sulphur precipitate forms. 
Keeping the temperature constant is really important for a 'fair test' if you are investigating speed of reaction/rate of reaction factors such as concentration of a soluble reactant or the particle size/surface area of a solid reactant. On the advanced gas calculations page, temperature sources of error and their correction are discussed in calculation example Q4b.3, although the calculation is above GCSE level, the ideas on sources of errors are legitimate for GCSE level.
Note that if the temperature of a rates experiment was too low compared to all the other experiments, the 'double error' would occur again, but this time the measured gas volume and the calculated speed/rate of reaction would be lower than expected.

      <comment>/* The stem form and consonant gradation is not predictable from the dictionary form */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Note to editors'''.  Please note also that this book takes a different view of the verb formation than many other grammar books take, although Daniel Abondolo takes a similar approach in his book &quot;Colloquial Finnish&quot;. This is done for a very good reason. Editors should not to revise this section regarding stems and first infinitive endings without first understanding why this approach has been taken.  The approach taken here reduces the number of rules that needs to be learned regarding verb conjugation and explains some phonetic effects better than some traditional grammar books. The treatment of the t in the verb endings such as osata as being part of the stem of the word and not as part of an infinitive marker is the approach taken by Lingsoft which has developed the most successful Finnish morphological analyzer FINTWOL on the market today. This is accessible on the net at [http://www2.lingsoft.fi/cgi-bin/fintwol FINTWOL]. The theoretical foundation for FINTWOL (The Finnish Two Level morphological analyzer) is based on research done by Kimmo Koskenniemi and is the foundation of the spelling tools used by Microsoft for Finnish which were develoed by Lingsoft.

==Type 4 Verb characteristics==

*Type 4 verb '''stems''' all '''end in a long vowel or a dipthong''' in the present tense or in the third person imperative and have past tense stems ending -si-. 

*Type 4 verbs all '''have dictionary forms ending in -ota -uta -ata -ätä'''. This is because the first infinitive needs to end in a or ä and this a or ä cannot be simply added to a stem if there are already two vowels present. Therefore the last vowel from the stem is dropped and a t is added followed by the infinitve a or ä.  
:This is the key recognisor from the first infinitive forms.

*Type 4 verb stems have core stems in the present tense ending at least two syllables (single syllable stem vowels are all in Type 2). No Type 4 stem ends in OI- (those verbs that do are also in Type 2) 

* Type 4 verbs '''have many different stem forms'''.
:The past tense STEM '''drops the a or ä''' that was in the present tense and substitutes '''si'''
:The first infinitive STEM '''drops the a or ä''' that was in the present tense and substitutes '''t''' 
:The past participle STEM '''drops the a or ä''' that was in the present tense and substitutes '''N''' before adding the participle -NUT or -NYT, so in practice one always sees '''-NNUT or -NNYT''' at then end of these verbs.

* The personal endings are just added on to the correct stem form.
 
::Because in Finnish, no verb infinitive form can ever have 3 adjacent vowels, the third person singular for is the same as the basic stem form. In this sense Type verb forms follows the rule we have already seen for Type 2 verbs when forming the first infinitve (dictionary) form.

* Type 4 verbs are '''sometimes''' subject to '''consonant gradation'''

:The a &gt; t transformation in the infinitive stem will reduce vowel space for any preceding hard consonants. This causes the dictionary form to be weak if the stem consonant is strong.

:The consideration of whether the verb will experience consonant gradation '''is only predictable by knowing the stem of the verb'''. One cannot predict the stem or the consonant gradation by only knowing the dictionary form. However, the dictionary form is always predictable from the stem so '''it is essential to learn the basic stem of these verbs'''. Because of this, most bi-lingual dictionaries do not meet the needs of the student learner of Finnish. 

::So '''the starting point for this understanding is always the VERB STEM never the VERB'S FIRST INFINITIVE FORM'''. This in an important thing to understand. Thus the dictionary form of these verbs cannot predict the conjugated forms in all cases. It explains why the verb TAVATA &quot;to meet&quot; has the form TAPAAN &quot;I will meet&quot; but the verb AVATA has the form AVAAN &quot;I will open&quot;. Similarly the verb PELATA &quot;to play&quot; has the form PELAAN &quot;I will play&quot; but PELÄTÄ &quot;to be afraid&quot; has the form PELKÄÄN, &quot;I am afraid&quot;. The K in the stem PELKÄÄ is weakened by the addition of the t in the infinitive, whereas PELAAN never had a K in the stem to begin with. One has to remember that the language forms did not evolve from the first infinitive form. We will discuss this in more detail below.

::'''The a &gt; s transformation''' that happens when forming the simple past tense before the plural -i- is added '''does NOT cause the stem to weaken.''' (Contrast this with the a &gt; t transformation which DOES cause the stem to weaken. '''This is an exception to the general rule that consonants that close a syllable can weaken a preceding hard grade consonant.'''

==Forming the First Infinitive (Dictionary form)==

You will see in the table below that the congugation for person is identical to that we saw in Type 2 verbs which also have a long stem ending. Type 4 verbs however differ because they have an a or ä as the last vowel in the stem. This causes some changes in the way the first infinitive or dictionary form is formed. 

We begin by re-iterating the fact that '''all Finnish verbs have a first infinitive (i.e. dictionary listed) form ending with the letter ''-a or -ä''.''' 

Consider the verb stem '''holhoa-'''  ''to take care of''

Making the first infinitive or dictionary forms from this verb stem is tricky because to add another -a as the infinitve marker would mean creating a verb form with 3 vowels (theoretically, holhoaa) but that is not allowed in Finnish. What happens therefore is that the final -a of the stem holoa- is transformed into -t (this becoming holot-) and then the infinitve marker a is added. This gives us the dictionary form '''holota''' (holhot-a) ''to take care of''. 

Lets tabulate another, more common verb, '''osata''' ''to have the skill or ability to do something''

bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;they can&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Note that the word ''can'' in English can mean both have the power or freedom to do something (which in Finnish has the verb stem '''voi-''') as well as the ability or skill to do something (which in Finnish has the verb stem '''osaa-''').  So one has to be careful to choose the right Finnish verb when expressing the word ''can''.

===The dictionary form is sometimes weak grade===

If one of the consonants or consonant clusters affected by consonant gradation appears immediately before the long -aa in the verb stem, then the long -aa causes it to be heard as Strong Grade when conjugated for person. This is according to the normal rules. However, the transforming t which replaces the final a in the stem when forming the first infintive or '''dictionary form''' is sufficient to weaken any preceding consonants in the stem, also according to the standard rules of consonant gradation. '''IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. '''

For instance the words '''me hankaamme''' means ''we rub'', but the dictionary form of the verb is '''hangata'''. The present tense stem is '''hankaa-''' but the dictionary stem is hangat-, '''the t in the stem weakens the nk to ng according to standard rules of consonant gradation'''.


'''hangata''' - ''to rub ''

'''These consonant changes make it very hard for the novice Finnish student to trace for example the meaning of the Finnish verb in a dictionary unless he or she understands how the dictionary form is constructed. '''

===The stem form and consonant gradation is not predictable from the dictionary form===

This is best illustrated by comparing two verbs in Finnish, the verb meaning &quot;to meet&quot;  and the verb meaning &quot;to spell out, letter by letter&quot;.

Lets start with the verb meaning &quot;to meet&quot;.

''I meet'' or ''I will meet'' in Finnish is '''minä tapaan'''. Similarly

''He meets'' or ''He will meet'' in Finnish is '''hän tapaa'''


So we can say that the verb &quot;to meet&quot; has a present tense stem form '''tapaa-''' followed by the relevant personal endings according to normal convention.

Note that the p in the stem is not strong pp but p, yet this p is followed by a long vowel space. This long vowel space normally preceeds strong form consonants, so in fact, this p could, in theory become weaker still if closed out by a consonant at the end of the syllable. We known that a single p can be weakened to v.

The dictionary form or first infinitive marker is a or ä according to front/back vowel conventions. But this is a problem for stem tapaa- .... how can we add an extra a to tapaa- because that would make tapaaa, and by convention no Finnish word contains 3 adjacent vowels. The solution adopted by Finnish is to contract the long vowel to a short vowel by dropping the final a of the stem, adding t as new separator, then adding the a marking the infinitive.  That leaves us with tapata..... but because we have reduced the vowel space, the P is indeed weakened according to normal consonant gradation rules to V so we get the correct form for this verb which is '''TAVATA'''.

&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;we (will) meet&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;te tapaa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;tte&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;you (will) meet&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;he tapaa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;vat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;they (will) meet&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



Let's now consider the verb  meaning ''to spell out letter by letter'', or simply ''to spell''. This verb has a '''present tense stem tavaa-''' probably ia related to the noun '''tavu''' meaning ''syllable''

''I spell'' or ''I will spell'' in Finnish is '''minä tavaan'''. Similarly

''He spells'' or ''He will spell'' in Finnish is '''hän tavaa''' according to standard rules.

Making the infinitive of this verb leads us to the same problem we had with tapaa-, so the same solution is adopted. We effectively drop the last a from the stem, and separate the stem and the infinitive marker a with a letter to to make '''TAVATA'''.

&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;they (will) spell&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


So, rather amazingly, we have two identical verbs with a dictionary form '''TAVATA''' with different stem forms depending on the meaning, whether it is ''TO MEET'' or to ''TO SPELL OUT LETTER BY LETTER''.  In practice, this is no different to English homonym verbs such as TO RAIN and TO REIGN ... context will always help us distinguish which word is intended.

Use the [http://www.verbix.com/languages/finnish.shtml Verbix verb conjugator] to enter the verb tavata to compare all the possible forms of these two verbs.

But the important thing to note is that '''one cannot predict the stem just knowing the verb from the dictionary.''' 

Thus knowing that the verb '''tavata''' ''to meet'' can become '''tapaan''' ''I will meet'' does not mean that '''avata''' ''to open'' will become ''apaan'' because it does not. It does in fact become '''avaan''' ''I will open''. 

'''Learning tip:'''  Do not learn these verbs from a dictionary, but do learn them as you meet them in real life. Foucus on learning the stem form(s) and the translated meanings and rather less on learning the dictionary forms. The  dictionary forms will come to you with practice. Try also to understand the root meaning in the stem forms as with tavaa- and its related words such as tavatus.

'''TAPAN versus TAPAAN'''.  It is worth contrasting the verb '''tavata''' ''to meet'' with another verb altogether which is '''tappaa'''  ''to kill or slaughter''. If you say '''tapan lapseni''' instead of '''tapaan lapseni''' you could get some rather odd looks from your Finnish friends.  Make sure the long vowel is present when you want to meet people instead of slaughter them!!

==Simple Past Tense (Perfect Tense) Formation==

The past tense marker '''-i-''' in Type 4 verbs is added to the verb stem, but the final but cannot be added to the stem without modification because otherwise the verb would contain 3 adjacent vowels and we know that this is not allowed. Finnish gets around this problem by '''modifying the final a of the stem into s.'''

Note: The past tense '''a to s transformation DOES NOT close the vowel space''' so the verb stem remains '''strong'''.  This is in direct contrast to the '''a to t transformation''' in the dictionary form which '''DOES close the vowel space''' making the '''infinitive stem WEAK''' .

:
For instance, '''tavata''' - ''to meet '' has a  basic strong grade stem '''tapaa-''' in the present tense, a weak grade stem '''tavat-''' in the dictionary form (the a &gt; t transformation weakening the p to v according to standard rules) but strong grade stem '''tapas-''' in the simple past (imperfect) tense (the a &gt; s transformation is NOT able to weaken the p consonant).

bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;they met&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Past Participle==
Just as there is an a &gt; t transformation in the formation of the infinitive stem, and an a &gt; s transformation in the past tense stem, the past participle stem has a similar a &gt; n transformation. 

Because the past participle has the ending -nut or -nyt, the a &gt; n transformation in the stem causes Type 4 verbs to have participle forms ending -nnyt or -nnut.  '''Because Finnish cannot tolerate have two strong consonant clusters separated by a vowel or a dipthong, if the stem contains a strong final consonant, the stem's final consonant is weakened.'''

Lets see how all these transformations we have see so far work

'''Minä hyppään''' ''I'll jump'' The first person form, long vowel stem with strong grade hyppää-.

'''Hypätä''' ''to jump'' The dictionary form with ä &gt; t stem transformation. The t moves the stem hypät- to weak grade.

'''Me hyppäsimme''' ''We jumped'' The past tense with ä &gt; s transformation. The s is followed by past tense -i-. The s does not, however, move the stem hyppäs- to weak grade

'''He ovat hypänneet''' ''They have jumped''  The participle stem is now hypän- following ä &gt; n transformation. The stem contains weak p because the following consonant is a stong nn. 
: Note nn is usually a weak form of the cluster nt, but this -nn- is not derived from -nt-, but is stronger than single n and therefore weakens the preceding consonant pp to p.

==Conditional formation==

The conditional marker is -ISI- and is added between the stem and the personal ending. But Type 4 verbs have rather a lot of stem forms as we have seen.  Which is the right stem form to use?

The simple answer is that it attaches to the present tense stem, but as the present tense stem ends in two vowels and the conditional marker begins with another vowel, we have a problem, because we know that no verb form in Finnish can have 3 consecutive vowels.  

What happens is that the last vowel of the present tense stem is dropped.

'''Han hyppää''' ''he jumps''

'''Hän hyppäisi''' ''he could jump''

'''Minä hyppäisin''' ''I could jump''

The standard vowel space rules for consonant gradation apply and the stem remains strong grade.

==Summary of Stem Modifications==

As we have seen, Type 4 verbs can have several stem forms. 

For example HANGATA has the following stem forms

'''HANGAT-''' for the dictionary form, the passive, and certain imperative forms

'''HANKAA-''' for the present tense

'''HANKAS-''' for the past tense

'''HANGAN-''' for the past participle

'''HANKAI-''' for the conditional forms (this is arguably HANKA-, but HANKAI- is how Lingsoft morphology shows this form)

It is a good idea when learning verbs to practice forming these various stems forms at the same time. Your attempts can be checked from the [http://www2.lingsoft.fi/cgi-bin/finstems Lingsoft] web site, or from on-line verb conjucators such as that at [http://www.verbix.com/languages/finnish.shtml verbix], or [http://www.logosconjugator.org/owa-v/verba_dba.verba_main.create_page?lang=en logos], or in certain printed dictionaries (e.g. the Nykysopmen Keskeinen Sanasto) that show all these forms. With some practice, and trial and error the formation of the right stems will become easier. 


==Similarity to Type 2 verbs==

Type 4 verbs are similar to Type 2 verbs in that both types of verbs have stems ending in long vowels or dipthongs and conjugate for person in exactly the same way.

The main difference is that Type 2 verbs do not have the consonant gradation effect and Type 4 verbs form the first infinitive form, the past tense and past particple forms very differently, and of course have the infinitive separator d instead of t.

You can learn more about Type 2 verbs in the appropriate section of this book.

== How to make a ball bounce convincingly! ==

'''This tutorial assumes basic Blender awareness and some knowledge of using Blender Lattices as well as keyframes basics regarding the Blender Panels. Knowledge of IPO curves will prove useful later as we progress to more advanced techniques.'''

== How hard can it be to move a ball? ==
It would be easy to just put a sphere on the screen and animate it to move up and down but in all honesty, it would not look like a bouncing ball. It would not be convincing in any way. 

To be believable, the ball must use some of the most fundamental principles of good animation. In particular, the ball must '''squash''' and '''stretch''' and change '''speed''' as it falls, hits the floor, bounces and rises ready to fall again. With a little effort we can make that boring sphere look alive!

== Why use a lattice? ==

It is possible to make a simple bouncing ball animation without using a Lattice object but with the Lattice we can do more than just bounce the ball. For example, once we have a ball that bounces how we'd like it, we can later add rotation to the ball so it spins through the air and bounces then, as the bounces decrease, the ball can roll to a halt. Doing this without lattice would be a far more complex exercise as a rotating squashed and stretched sphere would look like it was wobbling in space ''(like having the flat part of a flat tire spin around the tire instead of staying on the bottom, even while the wheel is turning)''.

== Let's begin then ==
&lt;!--
For this tutorial, the lattice not need the UVW settings to be changed from the default.

Note that this is not intended to be a tutorial on Lattice. It is assumed that users will have covered that topic elsewhere. If you believe readers need more information, then please add a link to a separate tutorial rather than filling this tutorial with superfluous information.
--&gt;

To begin, add a UVSphere (SPACE ''add&gt;mesh&gt;UVShere'') in '''Top View''' (NUM7). It is important to add the objects in top view to keep their '''Z-Axis''' aligned upwards. Set Smooth and Sub-surf on the sphere if desired. Tab back into '''Object Mode''' then immediately add a Lattice(SPACE ''add&gt;Lattice''). Resize (SKEY) it so it closely surrounds the sphere. Make the edges of the lattice align with the circumference of the sphere as this will make animation easier. 

''(By default the Lattice Object Name is &quot;Lattice&quot;. It is good to give all your objects unique and sensible names, especially if you are planning a complex scene. So you might call the Sphere &quot;Red_Ball&quot; and the Lattice &quot;Red_Ball_Latt&quot; or something similar for easy reference and recognition later.)'' 
''(Noob Tip:  I have formed the habit of naming everything in ALL CAPS.  As the scene gets more complicated I can easily keep track of what I have named and what needs naming.)''

=== Make the lattice deform the sphere ===
&lt;!--
Note that this is not intended to be a tutorial on Lattice. It is assumed that users will have covered that topic elsewhere. Thanks 
--&gt;
Prior to Blender 2.4, objects were parented to Lattices with a Lattice Deform option. In version 2.4+ you can select the object (the sphere) and apply a Lattice Modifier to it (Ob: Lattice). However, if you use this new method then the ball will not move where the Lattice moves and will not squash when the Lattice squashes and we want it to do both of these things.

Luckily you can still use the good old '''Parent option''' then use the Modifier palette to make the Lattice Deform &quot;Real&quot; . So select the sphere and THEN SHIFT SELECT the Lattice then '''CTRL-P''' to make parent and choose the &quot;'''Lattice Deform'''&quot; option. If you now select just the sphere, press '''F9''' and look in the Modifiers palette, you'll see a listing for &quot;'''Lattice parent deform'''&quot; with a button for &quot;'''Make Real'''&quot;. You can either ignore this button or press it. It really won't matter for now. If we wanted to do some weird things to our ball, like kicking it or deforming it in other complicated ways, then we would have to use the &quot;real&quot; Lattice modifier option. 

So, this may not be the purist approach to using a Lattice but it is a convenient way to achieve the results we're after. Basically, it works and is reasonably intuitive. 

[[Image:Bouncelattmod2SS.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
''Lattice Modifier screen using parenting option.''

[[Image:Bouncelattmod1SS.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
''If you press &quot;Make Real&quot; you enable the full Lattice Modifier''

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}''(None of this seems to be necessary in later versions.  The full Lattice screen comes up as soon as you Parent it.)''

&lt;!--
I fully understand that Lattices can be applied as modifiers in Blender 2.4+ - however, as stated in the text, it isn't really being used that way in this tutorial. I don't believe the modifier needs further explanation here. This is not a tutorial on lattices, it is assumed that knowledge will have been gained before the reader gets this far. A link to a Lattice Tutorial has been added.
--&gt;
You can easily check if the Lattice is working the way we want it to by selecting the Lattice and resizing, moving or rotating it. '''The ball should do everything the Lattice does.''' I don't wish this to be a full lesson in Lattices so if you don't understand any of the above, or you're certain your Lattice is not working as it should, then please learn a bit about [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Basic_Animation/Lattice|lattices]] before proceeding.

=== Time to animate! ===
For our basic animation, we'll use just 23 frames starting with the ball high then falling, squashing, bouncing and ending up back where it started. When this is played back in the 3D window, it will loop and we'll see the ball bounce forever in one place.

This part is easier done in &quot;SCR:1 - Animation&quot; Viewport configuration. It is also useful to have multiple orthographic views open in the viewport by right clicking on the resize viewport arrow and choosing &quot;split area&quot; then making a top view, side, etc...

Go to '''Front View''' (Num1)
Press F10 and set your start (Sta) frame to Frame 1 and your end frame to Frame 23. Then make sure you're on '''Frame 1''' (Shift+Left Arrow) to start animating. Note that we are '''animating the Lattice''', not the ball. Everything we do to the lattice will directly affect the ball too.

Note: all the modifications to the lattice must be done in 'Object' mode. If not, they will affect all the frames.

Select the Lattice ('''NOT''' the ball) then do the following on the corresponding frames:
*'''FRAME 1:''' Press IKEY and set a '''key''' for LocRotScale - the ball's start position (high).
*'''FRAME 11:''' Move the Lattice to ground level and '''key''' LocRotScale again ''(keep the fall distance small for now)''.
*'''FRAME 13:''' Leave Lattice in same position as frame 11 and '''key''' LocRotScale again.
*'''FRAME 23:''' Move Lattice back to start position (use Num (N) Panel if you need to)and '''key''' LocRotScale again.
(Noob note- This may seem obvious, but move the lattice BEFORE you insert the keyframe.)

These four frames give a basic up and down animation with a pause at the bottom. We can add squash on Frame 12 to finish off.

*'''FRAME 12:''' Place the cursor at the base of the Lattice then set the Rotation/Scaling Pivot to &quot;3D Cursor&quot; [[Image:BouncepivotSS.jpg]] Scale the Lattice down along the Z-Axis '''SKEY-ZKEY''' and see the ball squash. '''IKey''' LocRotScale again.

When you have set all five keys, you can cycle through the frames and you should see the following result on the Key frames we just set.
[[Image:BouncebasekeysSS.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
''Screenshots of the 3D window, front view, on each of our five key frames.''

If you press '''Alt-A''' now in the '''3D window''', you should see the ball bounce. Even though the squash happens on just one frame, it still reads properly in our minds and is a vast improvement over an animation with no squash at all. ''(Press '''RMB''' or '''ESC''' to stop the animation playback)''.

If you have a camera and lighting suitably set up you could render the animation out and use Blender's &quot;PLAY&quot; button to loop the rendered animation. See the bottom of the page for an OpenGL render made from the steps above. Add material to the ball and a ground plane for a more interesting result.

=== Looking at the IPO Curves ===
If you want the ball to bounce three times then you could repeat the above instructions three times over - if you have the patience - but Blender has a better, easier way.

Select the Lattice then open up an IPO ('''I'''nter'''PO'''lation) window and zoom into the group of keys. If you select LocZ and SizeZ from the channel list on the right, you should see something like this (I've added labels to the screenshot):

''Note the the IPO Type here is &quot;Object&quot;. Purists may be disturbed or perplexed by this but if you remember,  we're not really using our Lattice in the purist, Lattice Modifier form. Don't worry about it though. It works.''

[[Image:BounceipoSS.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
''IPO curve for Lattice, showing LocZ and SizeZ channels.''

This shows the relative position on the Z-Axis and size in the Z-Axis of the Lattice. You can see that the Size remains constant until frame 11, then reduces, then goes back and remains constant until frame 23. Similarly, the LocZ curve shows how the ball starts high, falls then stops before rising again. The rounded bottom of the LocZ curve occurs because the IPO curve maps the centre point of the Lattice and when we squash it, the centre point lowers slightly.

Of special interest is that by default, Blender uses Bézier curves for IPOs and this gives us rounded tops on the curve. This means the ball starts moving slowly downward then moves faster until the reaches the bottom. Also, as it nears the top, it slows down again. This is good because this is exactly what happens in reality when a ball rises and falls ''(It could be better - but it's a good start)''.

While in the IPO window, select both curves then press '''KKEY''' and you'll see each key frame indicated by a vertical line. (Note: You can also press ''View-&gt;Show Keys'' if you can't remember this shortcut - this has helped me in the past.)

[[Image:BounceipokeysSS.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
''IPO window set to show key frames''

[[Image:Bouncewiki.gif|right|Bouncing ball animated GIF]]

Press '''AKEY''' to select all key frames then duplicate (Shift-D) them. The curves will seem to deform but when you drag the frames to the right, they will sort themselves out. Position them so the &quot;first&quot; frame is at Frame 24 and the new end frame is now Frame 46. Reset the End Frame in the Scene (F10) window then watch the animation again. It's not bad. You can repeat this process for more bounces. (To have it bounce forever throughout a long animation, ignore the above procedure and just set the &quot;Extend Mode&quot; to &quot;Cyclic&quot; in the Curve menu. You'll have to adjust the curve a little on the first and last frame but you only do it once and Blender repeats the change for all other cycles.)

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}
'''Noob Note:'''  Instead of IPO window, go to Graph Editor.  I was not able to find any way to get yellow lines at each Keyframe, as above, but using {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} put Bezier handles at each keyframe.  I need to experiment to find out how to use them.  {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|DKEY}} worked as above.

It's not bad for a start but there's a lot more to do to this ball before applying for that animation job.

== Saving The Animation ==
How do you tell Blender where to save the animated frames? The answer is in the “Output” mini-window that you see in the Render settings (F10). Near the top of this are two editable text fields, the first of which is initially set on my Linux system to “&lt;TT&gt;/tmp/&lt;/TT&gt;” and the second to “&lt;TT&gt;//backbuf&lt;/TT&gt;”. The first one is the output pathname or directory prefix used to save the generated frames as JPEG files when you press the “ANIM” button. If it has no “#” characters in it, then it is used as a directory prefix; thus, the default will be to save the animation frames as &lt;TT&gt;/tmp/0001.jpg&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;/tmp/0002.jpg&lt;/TT&gt; etc. Alternative, if you put in a filename spec with “#” characters in it, the hashes will be replaced with the frame number. Thus, if I set the field to “&lt;TT&gt;/home/ldo/Documents/BlenderTuts/ball####.jpeg&lt;/TT&gt;”, then the frames will be saved to that &lt;TT&gt;/home/ldo/Documents/BlenderTuts&lt;/TT&gt; directory and be named &lt;TT&gt;ball0001.jpeg&lt;/TT&gt;, &lt;TT&gt;ball0002.jpeg&lt;/TT&gt; etc.

== So what next? ==
In real life and in a typical cartoon, balls don't just bounce forever in one spot. They move along and slowly lose their bounce before rolling to a halt. And they have more character than our bouncing ball.

'''Things to consider next:'''
*Perfecting the squash - maintaining volume
*Adding stretch
*Look at acceleration and deceleration
*Rotate the ball as it bounces
*Reduce the bounce height over time
*Move the ball around as it bounces

See this [http://members.westnet.com.au/andydolphin/blender/bounce.avi ANIMATION LINK] (580kb, AVI-DivX) for an idea of how you can achieve interesting results with just a little more effort.

Validation method checking is described as 'check digits, range checks, picture/format checks, and data type checks', however there is no description of each of these checks individually, which may be desirable to add at a later stage. (e.g. Range checks are used in numeric data so that the value entered falls into a certain range of values, data checks take place when data values are compared to an expected data type, etc.) The explanation of weighted and unweighted check digits can also be included. 

This section may be referenced with Chapter 1.1.7 Testing which include what type of data are tested for (normal, abnormal, and extreme, and the explanation of these).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
ERIMAdaptor provides an Instant Messenger interface to your application using standard WOComponents.  The architecture of this adaptor is somewhat different than the normal HTTP adaptor, because of inherent limitations in the IM interfaces like AOL IM:

* WOSessions are tracked by buddy name.  When a buddy contacts the server's IM account, a Conversation is initiated.  A Conversation associates a buddy name with the WOSession ID.  Conversations have a configurable expiration, but the default is to expire after 5 minutes of inactivity.  The WOSession will have the same expiration as they normally would, but the connection between the buddy name and that session will go away, effectively expiring the session's usefulness.
* Different IM networks may impose additional restrictions on your components.  For instance, most networks limit the number of bytes that can be transferred in a message.  Currently the framework doesn't auto-split, but that's an  obvious enhancement that will probably be added in.
* Some features of WORequest and WOResponse may not behave exactly like the HTTP counterpart.  For instance, there are no normal HTTP headers in the WORequest.
* The buddy name and message appear as form values and in the request userInfo dictionary -- use whichever is more convenient.
* The Conversation object is accessible via the request userInfo dictionary if you need direct access (to force expiration, etc).
* The implementation is TEMPORARILY single threaded for all conversations.  This will change soon, I just haven't had time to test it.

Currently there are implementions of the IInstantMessengerFactory for AIM using the jaimbot and daim libraries.  Jaimbot is available from http://jaimbot.sourceforge.net and daim is available from http://daim.dev.java.net if you're interested in getting more information on either library.

=== How to use it ===
ERIMAdaptor is a custom adaptor, so it can be added using the WOAdditionalAdaptors option on your WO:

  -WOAdditionalAdaptors ({WOAdaptor=&quot;er.imadaptor.InstantMessengerAdaptor&quot;;})

==== Properties ====
There are several new settings that can (or must) appear in your Properties file as well:

* IMFactory (optional, default er.imadaptor.AimBotInstantMessenger$Factory) - the factory class for creating IM connections.  If you want to provide a new type of IM network, you should implement the IInstantMessengerFactory interface for whatever class you provide here.
* IMScreenName (required) - the screen name of the IM account that the server should login with
* IMPassword (required) - the password of the IM account that the server should login with
* IMTimeout (optional, default 5 minutes) - the conversation timeout time in milliseconds
* IMAutoLogin (optional, default &quot;true&quot;) - whether or not the adaptor should autologin to AIM.  If false, you must call adaptor.connect()
* IMConversationActionName (optional, default &quot;imConversation&quot;) - the name of the DirectAction to call when a Conversation is initiated, the default is that you must create a public WOActionResults imConversationAction() { .. } method in your DirectAction class
* IMWatcherEnabled (optional, default &quot;false&quot;) - whether or not you want to have a second AIM account login and watchdog the first.  Most of the AIM libraries can have issues with getting kicked off after a period of time.  If you have two AIM accounts, they can keep each other alive.
* IMWatcherFactory (optional, default same as IMFactory) - if IMWatcherEnabled, the factory class to use
* IMWatcherScreenName (optional, required if IMWatcherEnabled) - the screen name of the watcher IM account
* IMWatcherPassword (optional, required if IMWatcherEnabled) - the password of the watcher IM account

==== Request ====
In your code, the following request headers are available:

* IsIM - Boolean.TRUE if the current request is an IM request (you can call InstantMessengerAdaptor.isIMRequest(WORequest) also)
* IMConversation - the Conversation associated with this request
* BuddyName - the name of the buddy that initiated the request
* Message - the message sent by the user

The following form values are available in the request:

* BuddyName - the name of the buddy that initiated the request
* Message - the message sent by the user

=== DirectAction ===
To kick things off, you must have a direct action method that matches the value of IMConversationActionName (which defaults to &quot;imConversation&quot;).  This method should return the the first &quot;page&quot; of the IM conversation.

For example:
  public WOActionResults imConversationAction() {
    return pageWithName(SayHelloPage.class.getName());
  }

=== IMAction ===
For each request, the IM Adaptor needs to know what action to call when the subsequent request comes in.  In a normal WOComponent, think of this as each page having a &quot;Next&quot; button on it that is clicked each time a request comes in.  Instead of using a WOSubmitButton or a WOHyperlink, you instead use the IMAction element.  This element has one attribute -- &quot;action&quot; that points to the action method to call on your component.  Because of inherent limitations in an instant messenging interface as an interaction method, only one IMAction can be triggered per-page (the last one that is evaluated on the page, specifically).  This makes sense when you think of the user's response as the action being performed.  There is no semantic equivalent of &quot;multipleSubmit&quot; on WOForm.

IMAction is the simplest action you can use, though there are several common response actions, and ERIMAdaptor provides default action implementations for them.  Here is an example of a very simple conversation that uses IMAction (that will just continue to say the same thing over and over again):

Your Java component would look something like this:
  public class IMComponent extends WOComponent {
    public boolean userResponded;
    	
    ...

    public String buddyName() {
      return InstantMessengerAdaptor.buddyName(context().request());
    }
    
    public WOActionResults processResponse() {
      userResponded = true;
      return null;
    }
  }

The HTML would be:
  &lt;webobject name = &quot;FirstContactConditional&quot;&gt;
    Hi &lt;webobject name = &quot;BuddyName&quot;&gt;&lt;/webobject&gt;!
  &lt;/webobject&gt;
  &lt;webobject name = &quot;UserRespondedConditional&quot;&gt;
    Welcome back &lt;webobject name = &quot;BuddyName&quot;&gt;&lt;/webobject&gt;!
  &lt;/webobject&gt;
  &lt;webobject name = &quot;IMAction&quot;&gt;&lt;/webobject&gt;

And lastly the WOD file would contain:
  FirstContactConditional : WOConditional {
    condition = userResponded;
    negate = true;
  }
  
  UserRespondedConditional : WOConditional {
    condition = userResponded;
  }
  
  BuddyName : WOString {
    value = buddyName;
  }
  
  IMAction : IMAction {
    action = processResponse;
  }

Here's what an example conversation transcript might look like:
  Mike&gt; Hey server!
  Server&gt; Hi Mike!
  Mike&gt; How's it going?
  Server&gt; Welcome back Mike!
  Mike&gt; Uh. OK.
  Server&gt; Welcome back Mike!
  ...

=== IMConfirmationAction ===
IMConfirmation has a single binding &quot;confirmed&quot;.  If the response from the IM buddy matches any of a set of common &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, etc words, confirmed is set to the appropriate value.  If neither a yes nor a no word is found, confirmed is set to null.  You should bind this to a Boolean rather than a boolean so that you can detect the third state properly and re-ask the question.  Note that this is not internationalized, so it currently has &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;yep&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;nope&quot;, &quot;nah&quot; as known values.

==== Bindings ====
* confirmed = three-state Boolean, when Boolean.TRUE the response was affirmative, when Boolean.FALSE, the response was negative, and when null, the response did not match one of the known true/false values
* action = the action method to execute when the response is received

==== Example ====
  AreYouSureAction : IMConfirmationAction {
    confirmed = yesOrNo;
    action = nextStep;
  }

In the above example, the binding &quot;yesOrNo&quot; is a Boolean that will contain whether or not the user's response was a confirmation.  After processing the response, the &quot;nextStep&quot; action will be called so that you can evaluate the &quot;yesOrNo&quot; value and respond accordingly.

=== IMSearchMessageAction ===
IMSearchMessageAction allows you to map substrings that appear in AIM message responses to other objects.  For instance, you can pass in an options dictionary that maps the word &quot;hi&quot; to the object Greeting, or the word &quot;bug&quot; to the object BugReport.  If the word &quot;hi&quot; appears in the aim response, it will return the matching object as its value.

==== Bindings: ====
* value = the binding to write the first matching value into
* values = (at least one of &quot;value&quot; or &quot;values&quot; must be specified, but you can use both as well) the binding to write the array of all matching values into
* optionsDictionary = a mapping of substrings to look for in the response to arbitrary objects those substrings are associated with
* optionsArray = a list of known substrings to look for
* optionKeyPath = (only applicable for optionsArray) instead of looking for the values in optionsArray, look for the value of this key path on each value in the optionsArray; for instance, optionsArray might contains Person objects, and optionKeyPath might be &quot;firstName&quot;, so this would match the first names of the list of the people.
* quicksilver = match like Quicksilver matches (&quot;NPE&quot; matches &quot;NullPointerException&quot;)
* action = the action method to execute when the response is received

==== Example ====
  PickRequestTypeAction : IMSearchMessageAction {
    value = selectedOption;
    optionsDictionary = options;
    action = nextStep;
  }

In the above example, &quot;optionsDictionary&quot; contains a mapping where the keys are the substrings to look for in the response and the values are objects to associate them with.  For instance, the dictionary from our bug tracking system looks like { &quot;bug&quot;=&gt;BugReportType object, &quot;request&quot;=&gt;ServiceRequestType object }.  &quot;action&quot; is the method to fire when the user's response comes back, and &quot;value&quot; will contain the value that matched the user's response.

When the user responds, the response will be interpreted by the provided action, the &quot;selectedOption&quot; field will contain whatever object matched their response, or null if there was no match, and the &quot;nextStep&quot; action method will be called.  &quot;nextStep&quot; is a normal action method like any other, except it has access to the additional AIM-only request parameters as described in the Request section.

=== IMSearchOptionsAction ===
IMSearchOptionsAction, IMSearchMessageAction's evil twin, allows you to search your options for the AIM response that is received (as opposed to SearchMessage that searches the AIM response for your options -- the other way around).  For instance, you can pass in an options dictionary that maps the word &quot;Company XYZ&quot; to the object CompanyXYZ, or the word &quot;Company ABC&quot; to the object CompanyABC.  If the word &quot;XYZ&quot; is aimed, it will return the matching CompanyXYZ object as its value.

==== Bindings ====
* value = the binding to write the first matching value into
* values = (at least one of &quot;value&quot; or &quot;values&quot; must be specified, but you can use both as well) the binding to write the array of all matching values into
* optionsDictionary = a mapping of substrings to look for in the response to arbitrary objects those substrings are associated with
* optionsArray = a list of known substrings to look for
* optionKeyPath = (only applicable for optionsArray) instead of looking for the values in optionsArray, look for the value of this key path on each value in the optionsArray; for instance, optionsArray might contains Person objects, and optionKeyPath might be &quot;firstName&quot;, so this would match the first names of the list of the people.
* quicksilver = match like Quicksilver matches (&quot;NPE&quot; matches &quot;NullPointerException&quot;)
* action = the action method to execute when the response is received

==== Example ====
  PickCompanyAction : IMSearchOptionsAction {
    optionsArray = companies;
    optionKeyPath = &quot;name&quot;;
    value = company;
    values = companies;
    quicksilver = true;
    action = nextStep;
  }

The above example from our bug reporting system allows a user to select a company to associate with a bug.  &quot;optionsArray&quot; contains an array of Company objects.  &quot;optionKeyPath&quot; specifies that the response should be compared against the value of the &quot;name&quot; keypath on the Companies.  The resultant first Company object that matched will put stored in the &quot;company&quot; binding (as defined by &quot;value&quot;), and if there were multiple matches, they would all appear in the &quot;companies&quot; list.  Quicksilver matching is enabled above, and after the response is processed, and the bindings set, the &quot;nextStep&quot; action will be called.

=== IMPickListAction ===
A very common case is that you want to present the user with a list of options and have the user pick from that list.  IMPickList provides a handy implementation of this behavior.  Whereas the previous actions were &quot;headless,&quot; IMPickList actuals renders the list on its own entirely.  A typical use case is to continue rendering the IMPickList until the selection is whittled down to one by the user.

An example conversation might look like:
  Server&gt; Pick a company:
  Server&gt; 1) Company XYZ
  Server&gt; 2) Company VWX
  Server&gt; 3) Company ABC
  User&gt; X
  // note this matches #1 and #2
  Server&gt; Pick a company:
  Server&gt; 1) Company XYZ
  Server&gt; 2) Company VWX
  User&gt; V
  // Company VWX is now selected
  Server&gt; ...
or
  Server&gt; Pick a company:
  Server&gt; 1) Company XYZ
  Server&gt; 2) Company VWX
  Server&gt; 3) Company ABC
  User&gt; 1
  // picking by number uniquely identifies Company XYZ
or
  Server&gt; Pick a company:
  Server&gt; 1) Company XYZ
  Server&gt; 2) Company VWX
  Server&gt; 3) Company ABC
  User&gt; XYZ
  // XYZ uniquely matches Company XYZ

==== Bindings ====
* displayStringKeyPath = The key path of the string to use to display each object in the list.  The value should be in &quot;quotes&quot;.
* list = an NSArray of the list of options to pick from
* quicksilver = whether or not to use Quicksilver-style matching on the user's response (&quot;NPE&quot; matches &quot;NullPointerException&quot;)
* selections = the list of selections that matched
* selection = the single matching selection (if there was only one)
* action = the action method to execute when the response is received

==== Example ====
  PickProductAction : IMPickListAction {
    list = products.@sort.name;
    selection = product;
    selections = products;
    displayStringKeyPath = &quot;name&quot;;
    quicksilver = true;
    action = nextStep;
  }

The above example has the user selecting from a list of Products (from the &quot;list&quot; binding).  The &quot;displayStringKeyPath&quot; binding specifies that the &quot;name&quot; keypath of the Product should be displayed in the list.  When the user uniquely identifies a single Product, the Product object will be bound to the &quot;product&quot; variable.  If there are multiple matches, the NSArray of the matches will be bound to the &quot;products&quot; variable.  Quicksilver matching is enabled.  After the response is processed, the &quot;nextStep&quot; method will be called.  Notice in this example, the &quot;products&quot; array is both the &quot;list&quot; binding AND the &quot;selections&quot; binding.  When the page is first loaded, the &quot;products&quot; NSArray is initialized with all the products.  The nextStep method keeps returning the same page until there is only one product selected.  Until that point, the list is reset with the products that matched the user's partial response (like in the example transcript of IMPickList above).

=== IMTextAction ===
IMTextAction is one of the simplest IMAction implementations.  It stores the user's response in a String binding and calls an action method.

==== Bindings ====
* value = the variable to store the user's response into
* allowBlanks = if false, empty strings (response.trim.length == 0) are turned into nulls
* action = the action method to execute when the response is received

==== Example ====
  AskNameAction : IMPickListAction {
    value = userName;
    allowBlanks = false;
    action = nextStep;
  }

The above example stores the user's response in the &quot;userName&quot; variable and does not allow blank values (i.e. they turn into nulls).  The &quot;nextStep&quot; action method is called when the response is processed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am adding text to this module from an old history text: Myers, Philip van Ness.  ''General History for Colleges and High Schools''.  Ginn &amp; Co. New York.  Copyright 1890 &amp; 1906.

This work is public domain, and I have a text.  There are no scans of it, so I can't just e-mail the original or copy and paste.  I'm using [[Template:Myers1906]] to mark this fact.

The text itself is full of dubious stuff.  Racist, sexist, Eurocentric - it was a late edition Dead White Men version of history.  I am modifying the text as I enter it to reflect modern tastes and writing styles.  To wit &quot;race&quot; is replaced by &quot;people&quot; in most cases, or &quot;nation&quot;.  It's not a carbon-copy of the original.  I'm typing it in by hand, so there will probably be faults.

The intent is to provide an initial text to stimulate more work, not to provide a perfect copy of this elderly text.  It has not been fact checked and its contents probably do not fully reflect the modern view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Louis Daguerre worked with Joseph Niepce, developing the heliograph. 

After Niepce's death, Daguerre invented the daguerreotype. It used mercury gas. The pictures it produced had to be viewed at an angle.
The wet-plate process was developed from calotype. It created crisp images on glass plates with collodion. It was used to make the first photos of Egypt. Wet-plate was very difficult to travel with, however. The materials would freeze in cold climates, and boil in hot ones.

William Henry Jackson used wet-plate to photograph Yosemite and other national parks. Edward S. Curtis used it to document Native American culture.

Alfred Stieglitz, after studying engineering, studied photography in Berlin. One of his favorite subjects was New York cityscapes.

He was part of the &quot;photo-secession&quot;, with Edward Steichen. He published ''Camera Work'' magazine. His salon, 291 Galleries, showed work by Rodan, Cézanne, and Picasso. He popularized the work of Georgia O'Keefe through his gallery.

Steichen joined the US Air Corps to protect France during World War II. Stieglitz went bankrupt and considered quitting photography. However, his correspondence with O'Keefe kept him going. Stieglitz and O'Keefe married later. After coming back from the war, Steichen was made curator for the Museum of Modern Art's &quot;Family of Man&quot; exhibit, which toured the world and was the basis for an art book.

===Photo Journalism===
The press is known as the &quot;fourth estate.&quot; In the US, print isn't restricted, but TV and radio are.

Emmett Till was a black boy who was lynched for whistling at a white woman. Photos of the body were published in the black press.

The Students Non-violent Coordinating Committee is an anti-segregation group. They were victims of police brutality. This was not covered by the media, until the Birmingham riot. Photos of the riot caused difficulties for the US in foreign affairs.

Famous photos taken during this era include the burning monk Quang Duc, a Vietnamese policeman executing a suspect, napalm victims fleeing a village, and a girl crying over a student shot at Kent State.


===Modernist Photography===

Styles of modernist photography championed a sharp, crisp focus in the images and generally leaned toward realism in the images.


===Surrealist Photography===

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Desserts|Desserts]]

A very simple recipe for plain churros. Makes one plateful, suitable for about 4 people. It can easily be doubled or halved, but be warned that attempting to mix more than double this recipe at once is very hard work.

==Ingredients==
* 400g [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]] (~3¼ cups)
* 400ml boiling water (~1⅔cups)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|bicarbonate of soda]] (baking soda)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

If you like, you can also add

* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

==Procedure==

#Sift the flour, bicarb (baking soda) and salt into a large mixing bowl.
#Add the boiling water gradually to the flour, mixing constantly until you get a very thick, smooth paste.
#Allow to stand for about an hour.
#Heat up a deep frying pan of oil until it shimmers.
#Using an icing bag, or a freezer bag with the corner cut out to give a hole about the size of your little finger, squeeze the paste into the pan. Use a pair of scissors to cut the sausage shaped pieces off after about 10cm.
#Fry these until golden brown and crunchy. If the pieces are too thick and are still raw in the middle, cut them in half lengthways and fry again.
#Serve dusted liberally with sugar or hot chocolate sauce (or both!).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Rise of Babylon=

From the remotest times, the city-states of southern Mesopotamia were enemies of the kings of Elam, a country to its east.  For centuries at a time, the Elamite kings held the cities of the plain in a state of more or less complete vassalage.  Their dominion was finally broken by a king of Babylon, a city which had been rising in prominence and eventually gave its name to the entire area.  This king was named '''Hammurabi''' (reigned circa 1780 BC – 1750 BC).  He united under his rule all the cities of Babylonia and became the founder of what is known as the '''Old Babylonian Empire'''.

Hammurabi has been called the Babylonian Moses because he promulgated a code of laws which in many respects resembles the Mosaic code attributed to Moses.

=The Old Babylonian Empire eclipsed by the Rising Assyrian Empire=
For more than a millennium after Hammurabi. Babylon continued to be the political and commercial centre of changing dynasties and shifting frontiers.  Meanwhile, a Semitic power had been slowly developing in the north.  This was the Assyrian Empire, eventually to be centered on its capital Nineveh.  For a long time Assyria was practically a province of the lower kingdom; but in 726 BC, Babylon was conquered by an Assyrian king and passed under Assyrian control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Run MINIX 3 on Windows XP Bochs ==

The recipe below was successfully tried with Minix versions 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.2a. The Bochs ver. 2.2.6 was running under (or over?) Windows XP.It also may work on other operating system that support Bochs Environment.

* Download a Minix 3 bootable CD ISO image&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MINIX3.org/ Official MINIX 3 Operating System site]&lt;/ref&gt;. You'll download an archive, unpack it - you'll get the file with name like IDE-3.1.1.iso.

* Download Bochs - in my case,I have used Bochs 2.2.6 released for Windows XP but should work higher verion&lt;ref&gt;[http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ Bochs Development Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Install WinPCap, downloadable from &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winpcap.org/install/bin/WinPcap_3_1.exe Official site for WinPcap]&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Install Bochs - when asked for options, add DLX Linux. 

* In the directory where the default installed Bochs will be in ('''C:\Program Files\Bochs-2.2.6''') , you'll find dlxlinux directory. 

* You need to make a copy of '''dlxlinux''' in the same parent directory with different name '''minix3'''. This new directory will be your Minix OS versions.

* Go to the new minix3 directory and edit bochsrc.bxrc file.

 # NOTE: In Bochs 1.4, keyboard mapping is only 100% implemented on X windows.
 # However, the key mapping tables are used in the paste function, so

 #keyboard_mapping: enabled=1, map=$BXSHARE/keymaps/x11-pc-es.map
 &lt;br/&gt;
* Run Boch's NIC Lister. For a few ordinary Windows XP machines with one network card NIC Lister mentions three interfaces, and some of them usually works.

* Put the IDE-3.1.1.iso file with Minix 3 bootable CD image into minix3 directory.

* Edit the run.bat file in the minix3 directory - replace dlxlinux with minix3 on the first line in the path.
 # Run.bat
 cd &quot;C:\Program Files\Bochs-2.3\'''minix3'''&quot;
 ..\bochs -q -f bochsrc.bxrc

* Run run.bat - you'll get Minix 3 booting in the virtual Bochs PC.

== Install Minix onto a Virtual Hard Drive ==
The step below work on any Bochs Environment and doesn't depend on the operating system
* Create the file for that drive first. Launch the Disk Image Creation Tool, which is included into Bochs distribution. The interface is very simple - the program just asks a few questions and does the job, but just in case, you'll wand a hard drive (hd) disk image, of flat (flat) type, sized, for example, 2048 megabytes (2048) - it will actually be 8192 bytes less than that - named hd2gig.img.

* You'll need to edit bochsrc.bxrc again. The line in hard disk section, related to disk - if you took the bochsrc.bxrc from dlxlinux, it will contain
 # hard disk
 &quot;ata0-master: type=disk, path=&quot;hd10meg.img&quot;, cylinders=306, heads=4, spt=17&quot;
should contain the line, which Disk Image Creation Tool put into clipboard, namely,
 # hard disk
 &quot;ata0-master: type=disk, path=&quot;hd2gig.img&quot;, mode=flat, cylinders=4161, heads=16, spt=63&quot;

* Relaunch Minix booting from cdrom, login as root, run &quot;setup&quot;, which will install Minix on the virtual hard drive. The network will get installed as well. 

* After installation is complete, run &quot;shutdown&quot;, in boot monitor run &quot;off&quot; so Bochs will turn down, and change &quot;boot: cdrom&quot; to &quot;boot: disk&quot;, so you'll boot next time from virtual disk instead of cdrom.

'''Xató''' is a typical Catalan dish.

==Ingredients==

===Dish===

* 2 pieces [[Cookbook:Endive|Curly Endives]]
* 12 pieces [[Cookbook:Anchovy|Anchovies]]
* 100 g [[Cookbook:Tuna|Salty Tuna]]
* 100 g [[Cookbook:Cod|Salty Ripped Cod]]
* 100 g arbequine [[Cookbook:Olive|Olives]]

===Sauce===

* 100 g toasted [[Cookbook:Almond|Almonds]]
* 60 g toasted [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|Hazelnuts]]
* 2 pieces Anchovies
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* 4 pieces scalded [[Cookbook:Nyore|Nyores]]
* 1/2 piece [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Chili Pepper]] (optional)
* 2 or 3 slices fried or toasted [[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive Oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]

==Procedure==

#In a mortar, crush the following ingredients for the sauce: the almonds, the hazelnuts, the anchovies from which salt has been removed, the garlic cloves, the nyores pulp, the chili (optional), the salt, the fried bread slices (you can soak them in vinegar or put the vinegar separately), vinegar, and salt.
#Mix the result with olive oil.
#Wash and soak the curly endives in water.
#Take the salt off the anchovies, the salty tuna, and the cod – rip the last two out – and mix them with the curly endive in a bowl.
#Add the olives.
#Add the sauce.
#Mix it up well, so all the ingredients are impregnated with sauce and serve trying to build up some sort of curly endive castle (château).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because of its strategic location at the intersection of Asia and Europe, Anatolia has been a cradle for several civilizations since prehistoric ages, with Neolithic settlements such as Çatalhöyük (Pottery Neolithic), Çayönü (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A to pottery Neolithic), Nevali Cori (Pre-Pottery Neolithic B), Hacilar (Pottery Neolithic), Göbekli Tepe (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A) and Mersin. The settlement of Troy starts in the Neolithic and continues forward into the Iron Age. Major civilizations and peoples that have settled in or conquered Anatolia include the Colchians, Hattians, Luwians, Hittites, Phrygians, Cimmerians, Lydians, Persians, Celts, Tabals, Meshechs, Greeks, Pelasgians, Armenians, Romans, Goths, Kurds, Byzantines, Seljuk Turks, and Ottomans. These peoples belonged to many varied ethnic and linguistic traditions. Through recorded history, Anatolians have spoken both Indo-European and Semitic languages, as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages have radiated. Other authors have proposed an Anatolian origin for the Etruscans of ancient Italy. Today the inhabitants of Anatolia are mostly native speakers of the Turkish language, which was introduced with the conquest of Anatolia by Turkic peoples and the rise of the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century. However, Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see Rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire). The last population exchange &quot;Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey&quot;, as result of the Treaty of Lausanne, between Turkey and Greece eliminated the majority of Turks in Greece and Greeks in Turkey. A significant Kurdish ethnic and linguistic minority exists in the south eastern regions, while Armenians and Georgians used to have a presence in the northeast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Combating Spyware=

In this chapter you will get a good understanding of what computer spyware and adware are, what do they do, and how to fight back.

==What is Spyware?==
In simplest terms, '''spyware''' is a type of '''''malware''''' (malicious software) that watches what users do with their computer and sends this information to the creator (or occasionally a hacker) over the internet. Generally, different types of spyware collect different information about a user. Less harmful programs attempt to track what websites a user visits, sending this information to an advertisement agency. More malicious programs may try recording what a user types to intercept passwords or credit card numbers,sometimes referred to as '''''keyloggers'''''. Other spyware programs simply launch popups with advertisements. This type of malware may also be referred to as '''''adware'''''.

Originally, spyware just referred to malicious software (malware) that spied on (or monitored) the user, sending information back to its creator. More recently users have come to use the term spyware regarding any software that does any sort of spying to benefit a third party. This includes adware and keyloggers, amongst other types of malware that monitors the user or allows full or partial control of a computer system's operation to a remote user without the consent of the machine user (such as '''''trojan horses''''' and '''''rootkits''''')

Unlike viruses and worms, spyware does not usually self-replicate. Spyware may exploit known weaknesses in computer security or be installed by free software (freeware), infecting computers for commercial gain. Spyware typically does this by displaying unsolicited pop-up advertisements (sometimes to goad the user into buying an anti-spyware product created by the same person(s) that made the spyware), theft of personal details (such as stealing usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers), monitoring of Web-browsing activity (for marketing purposes), or simply routing HTTP requests (requests to web-server(s) to GET a webpage so it can be viewed) to advertising sites.

Spyware is currently one of the major security threats to computers running Microsoft Windows '''''OSs''''' (Operating Systems). As Microsoft's internet browser, Internet Explorer, is closely tied in with the OS, when a security vulnerability is exploited through Internet Explorer, the operating system itself may be exploited. Microsoft often patch vulnerabilities in Windows (usually caused by a bug in Internet Explorer) because if unpatched it may &quot;allow remote code execution&quot;. Due to the Microsoft Windows series of OSs being widely used, the vulnerabilities found in windows systems are often exploited as there is usually more chance of finding an unpatched system running Windows at random than finding, for example, an unpatched OS/2 system.

==Fighting back==
===What is an anti-spyware program?===
There are many different types of anti-spyware programs, each with their own strong points. The main purpose of an anti-spyware program is to detect and remove spyware as well as adware. Some programs that are not free, such as Ewido, have higher detection rates than their free counterparts, although a combination of free anti-spyware programs will do just as good a job. The main thing to be careful of when choosing anti-spyware programs are a class of programs known as '''''rogue anti-spyware'''''. 

===What is a rogue anti-spyware program?===
Typically, a rogue spyware program is one that claims to be able to detect and delete spyware although is inadequate at doing so. This may simply be because it's definition files (usually shortened to defs) are not updated often enough. More suspicious ones may actually contain spyware themselves, sometimes attempting to persuade the user that buying the rogue product will completely eradicate all spyware threats. Probably the most-updated and accurate site listing rogue anti-spyware programs is Spyware Warrior's rogue list (http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm).

===Do I need an anti-spyware program?===
If you are running Microsoft Windows, the answer is most likely to be yes if you have internet access. This is because some internet browsers may allow bad code to execute on your machine infecting it with spyware, and some freeware programs - especially some '''''p2p''''' (peer-to-peer) programs. Unlike viruses, spyware is dangerous because it may send personal information over the internet to a remote user, rather than replicating and having a high payload.

===Where can I get an anti-spyware program, and how much will it cost me?===
As has already been mentioned, there are many anti-spyware programs on the market - including some rogue ones. If you are running Microsoft's Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, or Vista operating systems you can download Microsoft's Windows Defender Beta 2 (currently free) from Microsoft's download page (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=435BFCE7-DA2B-4A6A-AFA4-F7F14E605A0D&amp;displaylang=en).

===If an anti-spyware program doesn't work, is there an alternative?===
The usual recommendation in removing spyware on Microsoft Windows is to update all the anti-spyware and anti-virus programs first, then disable system restore and reboot into safe mode.
*To disable system restore, right-click ''My Computer'' and click on ''Properties''. This should open up the ''System Properties'' window. Click on the ''System Restore'' tab, and check the ''Turn off system restore on all drives'' checkbox. Click on ''OK'' and you may be presented with a message box asking if you wish to restart your computer to apply the changes. Save any changes you have made in other programs, then click ''Yes'' or ''Restart Now''.
*Once your computer starts to reboot, start hitting the ''f8'' button (about twice per second) until the ''Boot Options'' screen is displayed. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to highlight ''Boot to safe mode'' and hit the Enter/Return key.

Once in safe mode run the programs one at a time, and delete / quarantine any detections. The majority of anti-spyware programs backup the objects deleted (usually by encrypting them) in case they are a '''False Positive''' (the program detected something which in fact did not need to be deleted).

After running all the programs, restart the computer normally (from the shutdown menu). It should automatically boot back into normal mode. Login and check that the existing problems are no longer present. Occasionally the anti-spyware programs are unable to detect or delete some spyware. In this case there are some anti-spyware forums with people that specialise in spyware removal. Experts in spyware removal forums normally ask for a ''HiJackThis Log''. HiJackThis is a program that displays all the settings that spyware and ''hijackers'' (software that &quot;hijacks&quot; the internet browser, usually changing it's homepage and preventing it from being changed back) and is also able to save these settings in to a log file that can be uploaded or pasted to a website or forum.

==Overview of this FAQ==

 This FAQ is a work in progress and is in '''beta mode'''. It has been founded by the [http://www.blepharitisforum.com Blepharitis Support Forum]and is intended to be a comprehensive FAQ for blepharitis. Anyone may contribute so long as improvement is intended, and information is factual. Please cite references when needed.

'''Refrain from using this FAQ as a source of reference until it is released from beta.'''


==What is Blepharitis?==

 Blepharitis is chronic inflammation of the eyelids. It is characterized by white, flaky skin near the eyelashes. It usually causes redness of the eyes, itching, and irritation of the eyelids.

 'Blepharitis' is a term for a very generic problem. It is very commonly diagnosed when any prolonged problems exist with the eyelids, with causes, symptoms, and solutions varying between individuals. In effect, there is a level of uncertainty in 
dealing with the problem. There are 2 types of blepharitis, with 3 main causes (See chart below):

&lt;!--graphic--&gt;
&lt;insert chart&gt;


 Anterior blepharitis affects the outside of the eyelids, and posterior blepharitis affects the meibomian glands, the inner part of the eyelids.

===Pseudonyms===

 Blepharitis is also known as granulated eyelids.

===Signs\symptoms===

Itching eyelids&lt;br&gt;
Flaking&lt;br&gt;
Swollen eyelids&lt;br&gt;

===Treatment===

 The broad principal treatment for blepharitis is good eyelid hygiene. Although a complete cure is not known, it has shown that treatment results may vary due to the generic nature of blepharitis. Keeping it under control, or sending it into remission, is the most realistic treatment expectation.

==Related eye diseases==

 In no particular order, the following eye diseases can contribute to blepharitis (and vice versa):

Conjunctivitis&lt;br&gt;
Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis&lt;br&gt;
Dry Eye Syndrome&lt;br&gt;
Rosacea&lt;br&gt;
Uveitis&lt;br&gt;
Droopy Eyelid Syndrome&lt;br&gt;
Keratitis&lt;br&gt;

==Alternative treatments==

1.  Allergy treatments- some sufferers of Blepharitis have had success treating Blepharitis as an allergic response.  Patanol, a prescription ocular antihistamine used by allergists, has shown some success treating blepharitis symptoms, particularly in the higher dosage prescribed under the name &quot;Pataday.&quot;  Suffers whose blepharitis is controlled by antihistamines should also consider allergy testing and allergy inoculations, as well as oral antihistamines such as Allegra.

2.  Antifungal shampoos- some early research suggested that antifungal shampoos such as Selsun blue were successful at curing blepharitis.  http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1312591

And at least one case report suggests a cure using antifungal cremes:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16249768

Similar claims have appeared on internet forums:

http://www.lasermyeye.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-740.html

However, these products have not been approved for use on the eyelashes and the directions for use indicate that they should not be used in the eye.

3.  Saline rinse- some sufferers have found that rinsing the eyes regularly with preservative free saline is helpful.  Very few saline solutions are entirely preservative free, but Alcon's Unisol 4 is preservative free.

===Drugs===

===Homeopathy===
Washing the eye with anti-bacterial soap or baby shampoo is supposed to help.

===Other===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Hertzsprung-Russell diagram''' - usually referred to by the abbreviation '''H-R diagram''' - is a diagram that illustrates the properties of stars. As stars progress through their lives, they move around on this diagram since their properties change over time.

The original form of the H-R diagram consists of the absolute magnitude of the star graphed against the color of the star.  It was this form that was first created around 1910 by Danish astrophysicist [[w:Ejnar Hertzsprung|Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and American astrophysicist [[w:Henry Norris Russell|Henry Norris Russell]], and represented a huge leap forward in understanding stars because once one graphs stars against these axes, it becomes obvious that stars fall into different categories. The diagram plots luminosity and spectral type (which also plots temperature). On the vertical plane, stars are brighter if they are higher up on the diagram. In the horizontal plane, the leftmost stars are the hottest. 

[[Image:HRDiagram.jpg|frame|Stars fall into different groups when plotted by luminosity and temperature. The vertical axis is in units of the sun's luminosity while the horizontal axis is measured in terms of temperature in Kelvins. Note that this is a self-made diagram and is not plotted exactly.]]

When all the known stars are placed in this diagram according to luminosity and temperature, many of the stars - even our Sun - appear along a diagonal line that stretches from the top left of the diagram to the bottom right. This diagonal line is what is known as the '''main sequence'''. Stars spend the majority of their lifetimes here. It is the phase in which stars burn hydrogen into helium. At this point in a star's life, its size and luminosity remain about constant because the forces within the star have reached a near-equilibrium. The gravity of the star pointing inwards balances the internal thermal (gas) pressure which pushes outwards. The time that a star spends in the main sequence is determined by its mass. Smaller, cooler stars have slower fusion reactions rates and therefore will remain in the main sequence longer. 

Stars which lie along the top right of the diagram are luminous and cool and are known as '''supergiants'''. Fainter, hotter stars - which appear at the bottom left of the diagram - are known as '''white dwarfs'''. Hot and bright stars are located at the top left of the diagram, and cool, dim stars at the bottom right.

The HR diagram is a powerful tool in astronomy that allows us to probe stellar evolution and even cosmology.  Knowing a star's location on the HR diagram allows us to find its mass, its evolutionary state (and age), and its physical size.  We can date individual star clusters by using the main sequence turn off, the point where main sequence stars start evolving (i.e., cease to be hydrogen burning, the initial stellar condition). 

The first version of the diagram is often known as the '''observer's version''' of the H-R diagram as it can be drawn from data taken directly from a telescope.  The second version of the diagram is often known as the '''theorist's version''' as it is the version against which the output from computer models can be plotted.

Unlike in English, a noun is not preceded by an article (i.e., &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot; in English). There are no articles in Tagalog. For example, the word ''pusà'' means &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;a cat&quot;, or &quot;the cat&quot;, depending on the context.

To form the plural, precede the noun by ''mgá'' (pronounced ''mangá''). For example, &quot;cats&quot; in Tagalog is ''mgá pusà''.

==Focus==

Every sentence has something or someone to talk about. We call it the '''focus''' of the sentence. Basically, a focus can be a noun, a noun phrase or a pronoun.

*In general, a focus is preceded by the particle &lt;strong&gt;''ang''&lt;/strong&gt;. So if you want to talk about a cat, you say &quot;''ang pusà''&quot;. If you want to talk about houses, you say &quot;''ang mgá bahay''&quot;. If you want to talk about the United States, you say &quot;''ang Estados Unidos''&quot;.

*If the focus is '''someone in particular''', you use &lt;strong&gt;''si''&lt;/strong&gt; instead of ''ang''. So if you want to talk about Judy, you say ''si Judy''. On the other hand, if the focus is '''a list of people's names''', use &lt;strong&gt;''siná''&lt;/strong&gt; instead of ''si'', and join the last two names with the word &lt;strong&gt;''at''&lt;/strong&gt; (&quot;and&quot;). For example, if you want to talk about Judy and Mitch, you say &quot;''&lt;strong&gt;siná&lt;/strong&gt; Judy &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; Mitch''&quot;. If you want to talk about Judy, Mitch and Ralph, you say &quot;''&lt;strong&gt;siná&lt;/strong&gt; Judy, Mitch &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; Ralph''&quot;.

*If the focus is one of the '''pronouns''' listed below, then it is '''never''' preceded by a particle. The pronouns are:
**akó (I)
**ka   (you, singular)
**siyá (he, she)
**kamí (we, excluding the listener)
**kitá (we, including the listener, referring to only two people)
**tayo (we, including the listener, referring to three or more people)
**kayó (you, plural)
**silá (they)
**itó (this)
**iyán (that)
**iyón (that)

The pronoun &lt;strong&gt;''ka''&lt;/strong&gt; is actually a special form of the pronoun &lt;strong&gt;''ikáw''&lt;/strong&gt;. Use ''ikáw'' instead when it begins a sentence or when it is preceded by the particle &lt;strong&gt;''ay''&lt;/strong&gt; in an &quot;equation sentence&quot; (a sentence of the general form A is B, where A and B are nouns, noun phrases or pronouns) expressed in the ''ay''-form.

For the difference between &lt;strong&gt;''iyán''&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;''iyón''&lt;/strong&gt;, see the topic [[Tagalog/Lesson_2|Itó, Iyán at Iyón (This and That)]].

==Adjectives: Describing The Focus==

If you want to describe the focus, you can use adjectives. The format of the Tagalog sentence is shown below:

 &lt;adjective&gt; &lt;particle&gt; &lt;focus&gt;

Where '''&lt;particle&gt;''' is the appropriate particle for the focus, if applicable (see the topic [[Tagalog/Lesson_4#Focus|Focus]] above).

For example, if you want to say that a certain house (''bahay'') is big (''malakí''), you can say

 '''Malakí''' ang bahay.

If you want to say that Albert is kind (''mabaít''), then you can say

 '''Mabaít''' si Albert.

In addition, if he (''siyá'') is tall (''matangkád''), then you can say

 '''Matangkád''' siyá.

Finally, if you want to say that roses (''rosas'') are beautiful (''magagandá'', plural), then you can say

 '''Magagandá''' ang mgá rosas.

To negate an adjective in the sentence, place the word &lt;strong&gt;''hindî''&lt;/strong&gt; before the adjective. For example, if you want to say that Albert is '''not''' tall (''matangkád''), then you can say

 '''Hindí''' matangkád si Albert.

However, if the sentence has a '''pronoun focus''', then you '''cannot''' just negate the adjective by placing &lt;strong&gt;''hindî''&lt;/strong&gt; before the adjective. There is an additional rule to follow in this case: &lt;strong&gt;Place also the pronoun after the word ''hindî''&lt;/strong&gt;.

For example, to say that you (''ka'') are beautiful (''magandá''), you can say

 '''Magandá''' ka.

However, to say that you are '''not''' beautiful, it's '''not yet correct''' to say

 '''Hindí''' maganda ka.

The focus is ''ka'', which is a pronoun. Therefore, '''you perform the additional rule''', that is, place ''ka'' after ''hindî''. The Tagalog sentence now becomes

 '''Hindí ka''' maganda.

The above sentence is now correct.

To say that she is '''not''' quiet (''tahimik''), you must say

 '''Hindí siyá''' tahimik.

For more details about adjectives, see the topic [[Tagalog/Adjectives|Mgá Pang-urì (Adjectives)]].

==Equation Sentences: A Focus Is Something==

Equation sentences in English are usually of the form '''A is B''', where '''A''' and '''B''' are nouns, noun phrases or pronouns.

In Tagalog, to say that &quot;Focus is Something&quot;, you use the following format:

 &lt;something&gt; &lt;particle&gt; &lt;focus&gt;

Where '''&lt;particle&gt;''' is the appropriate particle for the focus, if applicable (see the topic [[Tagalog/Lesson_4#Focus|Focus]] above). This type of sentence is also called a '''nominal sentence'''.

For example, the sentence &quot;A dog (''aso'') is an animal (''hayop'')&quot; in Tagalog is

 '''Hayop''' ang '''aso'''.

If you want to say that Albert is a carpenter (''karpintero''), then you can say

 '''Karpintero''' si '''Albert'''.

If you want to say that you (''ka'') are a visitor (''bisita''), then you can say

 '''Bisita ka'''.

If you want to say or emphasize that the focus is something or someone '''in particular''', you must put an appropriate focus particle in front of '''&lt;something&gt;'''. In other words, the sentence format becomes

 &lt;particle&gt; &lt;something&gt; &lt;particle&gt; &lt;focus&gt;

For example, if the thief (''magnanakaw'') is '''that man''' (''lalaki'') (e.g., the man sitting beside you, and not any other man), then you can say

 '''Ang lalaki''' ang magnanakaw.

Or if the driver (''drayber'') is Andy (and not your friend John, for example), then you can say

 '''Si Andy''' ang drayber.

Or if the cleaner (''tagá-linis'') is '''you''' (''ka'') (because you're the one in charge of cleaning today), then you can say

 '''Ikáw''' ang tagá-linis.

&lt;strong&gt;''Ikáw''&lt;/strong&gt; is used instead of ''ka''. See the topic [[Tagalog/Lesson_4#Focus|Focus]] for the explanation.

To negate an equation sentence, follow the rules stated in the topic [[Tagalog/Lesson_4#Adjectives:_Describing_The_Focus|Adjectives: Describing The Focus]], only this time the word ''hindî'' is placed in front of a noun, not an adjective . So if you want to say that a human (''tao'') is '''not''' an animal, then you can say

 '''Hindí''' hayop ang tao.

To say that birds (''ibon'') are '''not''' humans (''tao''), you can say

 '''Hindí''' mgá tao ang mgá ibon.

However, if you want to say that '''you''' (''ka'') are '''not''' a visitor (i.e., the focus is a '''pronoun'''), then you must say

 '''Hindí ka''' bisita.

==Relationship Between Two Nouns: The Particle ''Ng''==

Before we proceed to the rest of the lesson, let's discuss first how to express the relationship between two nouns in Tagalog.

In Tagalog, two related nouns are connected by the particle &lt;strong&gt;''ng''&lt;/strong&gt; (pronounced ''nang''). The syntax is as follows:

 &lt;specific-word&gt; ng &lt;general-word&gt;

Where '''&lt;specific-word&gt;''' is the more specific of the two nouns, and '''&lt;general-word&gt;''' is the more general of the two.

Some relationships that use this syntax are:

*'''Part &lt;==&gt; Whole'''
:;Examples:
::''gulóng '''ng''' kotse'' (the wheel of a car)
:::''gulóng'' - wheel, ''kotse'' - car
::''bubóng '''ng''' bahay'' (the roof of a house)
:::''bubóng'' - roof, ''bahay'' - house


*'''Member &lt;==&gt; Group'''
:;Examples:
::''kawaní '''ng''' kompanyá'' (employee of a company)
:::''kawanî'' - employee, ''kompanyá'' - company
::''lider '''ng''' grupo'' (leader of the group)
:::''lider'' - leader, ''grupo'' - group


*'''Thing owned &lt;==&gt; Owner'''
:;Examples:
::''kuwaderno '''ng''' estudyante'' (a student's notebook)
:::''kuwaderno'' - notebook, ''estudyante'' - student
::''kotse '''ng''' pangulo'' (the president's car)
:::''kotse'' - car, ''pangulo'' - president


*'''Specific location &lt;==&gt; Place or Object'''
:;Examples:
::''tuktók '''ng''' bundók'' (the top of a mountain)
:::''tuktók'' - top, ''bundók'' - mountain
::''ibabaw '''ng''' mesa'' (on the table)
:::''ibabaw'' - on, ''mesa'' - table


*'''Agent &lt;==&gt; Patient or Field'''
:;Examples:
::''manggagawa '''ng''' sapatos'' (maker of shoes)
:::''manggagawa'' - maker, ''sapatos'' - shoes
::''diyosa '''ng''' pag-ibig'' (goddess of love)
:::''diyosa'' - goddess, ''pag-ibig'' - love


If '''&lt;general-word&gt;''' is a person, then use &lt;strong&gt;''ni''&lt;/strong&gt; instead of ''ng''. On the other hand, if '''&lt;general-word&gt;''' is a '''list''' of persons, then use &lt;strong&gt;''niná''&lt;/strong&gt; and separate the last two names with &lt;strong&gt;''at''&lt;/strong&gt; (&quot;and&quot;).

Examples:
:''kotse '''ni''' Anthony'' (Anthony's car)
:''bahay '''niná''' Angel, Lucy '''at''' David'' (the house of Angel, Lucy and David)


==Location Sentences: Where The Focus Is==

To state the location of the focus, you use the following pattern:

 Nasa &lt;location&gt; &lt;particle&gt; &lt;focus&gt;

Where '''&lt;location&gt;''' is a noun or a noun phrase indicating a location, and '''&lt;particle&gt;''' is the appropriate particle for the focus, if applicable (see also the topic [[Tagalog/Lesson_4#Focus|Focus]]). The particle &lt;strong&gt;''nasa''&lt;/strong&gt; signals the relationship of the focus to '''&lt;location&gt;''': that the focus is located at '''&lt;location&gt;'''.

For example, if you want to say that Anthony is in the office (''opisina''), you can say

 Nasa '''opisina''' si '''Anthony'''.

If you want to say that the car (''kotse'') is in the garage (''garahe''), you can say

 Nasa '''garahe''' ang '''kotse'''.

Or if she (''siyá'') is in the market (''palengke''), then you can say

 Nasa '''palengke''' '''siyá'''.

If you want to be more specific about the location, you can use a noun phrase consisting of a '''location word''' and a more general location, joined by the particle &lt;strong&gt;''ng''&lt;/strong&gt; (see also [[Tagalog/Lesson_4#Relationship_Between_Two_Nouns:_The_Particle_Ng|Relationship Between Two Nouns: The Particle ''Ng'']]). Here are some location words:

*''tuktók'' (top, summit)
*''itaás'' (above, top)
*''ibabá'' (below, bottom)
*''ibabaw'' (on)
*''ilalim'' (under,beneath)
*''loób'' (in, inside)
*''labás'' (outside)
*''haráp'' (front)
*''likód'' (back, behind)
*''gilid'' (side)
*''tagiliran'' (side)
*''tabí'' (beside)
*''paligid'' (around)
*''palibot'' (around)
*''kaliwâ'' (left)
*''kanan'' (right)
*''gitnâ'' (middle, center)


In English, most of the location words are prepositions, but in Tagalog, all of them are '''nouns'''.

Some examples:

:''&lt;strong&gt;ibabaw&lt;/strong&gt; ng mesa''  (on the table)
:''&lt;strong&gt;ilalim&lt;/strong&gt; ng mesa''  (under the table)
:''&lt;strong&gt;loób&lt;/strong&gt; ng opisina''  (inside the office)
:''&lt;strong&gt;haráp&lt;/strong&gt; ng aklatan'' (in front of the library)
:''&lt;strong&gt;tabí&lt;/strong&gt; ng silya''  (beside the chair)

Here are some example sentences:

:''Nasa &lt;strong&gt;ibabaw ng mesa&lt;/strong&gt; ang kutsara.'' (The spoon is on the table.)
:''Nasa &lt;strong&gt;ilalim ng mesa&lt;/strong&gt; ang bola.'' (The ball is under the table.)
:''Nasa &lt;strong&gt;loób ng opisina&lt;/strong&gt; si Wilma.'' (Wilma is inside the office.)
:''Nasa &lt;strong&gt;haráp ng aklatan&lt;/strong&gt; ang opisina ng prínsipal.'' (The principal's office is in front of the library.)
:''Nasa &lt;strong&gt;tabí ng silya&lt;strong&gt; ang laruán ni Tommy.'' (Tommy's toy is beside the chair.)


However, if '''&lt;location&gt;''' is a '''noun phrase''' and the focus is a '''pronoun''', then there is an '''additional rule''' to follow: '''Place the pronoun beside the location word.'''

If you want to say that she (''siyá'') is in the office (''opisina''), you can simply say

 Nasa '''opisina''' siyá.

However, if you want to say that she is '''outside the office''' (''labas ng opisina''), then you '''cannot''' simply say

 Nasa '''labás ng opisina''' siyá.

You must perform the additional rule: Place the pronoun ''siyá'' beside the location word ''labás''. Then the Tagalog sentence now becomes

 Nasa '''labás ''siyá'' ng opisina'''.

The above sentence is now correct.

If you want to say that that (''iyón'') is behind the house (''likód ng bahay''), then you must say

 Nasa '''likód ''iyón'' ng bahay'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= What is P2P ? =
[[Image:P2P-network.svg|150px|right|This is a diagram of a Peer-to-Peer computer network.]]
[[Image:Server-based-network.svg|150px|right|A diagram of a server-based computer network.]]

Generally, a '''peer-to-peer''' (or '''P2P''') computer network refers to any network that does not have fixed clients and servers, but a number of autonomous ''peer'' nodes that function as both clients and servers to the other nodes on the network. This model of network arrangement is contrasted with the client-server model (that was unable to scale up to todays necessities). In the P2P model any node should be able to initiate or complete any supported transaction. Peer nodes may differ in local configuration, processing speed, network bandwidth, and storage quantity. This is the basic definition any p2p system.

The term P2P may mean different thing to different people in different contexts. For instance, although the term has been applied to Usenet and IRC in all their incarnations and is even applicable to the network of IP hosts known as the Internet, it is most often used restricted to the networks of peers developed starting in the late 1990s characterized by transmission of data upon the receiver's request instead of the sender's. Such early networks included Gnutella, FastTrack, and the now-defunct Napster which all provide facilities for free (and somewhat anonymous) file transfer between personal computers connected in a dynamic and unreliable way to a network in order to work collectively towards a shared objective.

Even those early Networks did work around the same concept or implementation. In some Networks, such as Napster, OpenNap or IRC, the client-server structure is used for some tasks (e.g. searching) and a peer-to-peer structure for others, and even that is not consistent in each.  Networks such as Gnutella or Freenet, use a peer-to-peer structure for all purposes and are sometimes referred to as true peer-to-peer networks, even though some of the last evolution are now making them into a hybrid approach were each peer is not equal in its functions.

When the term peer-to-peer was used to describe the Napster network, it implied that the peer protocol nature was important, but in reality the great achievement of Napster was the empowerment of the peers (ie, the fringes of the network). The peer protocol was just a common way to achieve this.

So the best approach will be to define peer-to-peer, not as a set of strict definitions but to extend it to a definition of a technical/social/cultural movement, that attempts to provide a decentralized, dynamic and self regulated structure (in direct opposition to the old model o central control or server-client model, that failed to scale up to today's expectations), with the objective of providing content and services. In this way a computer programs/protocol that attempts to escape the need to use a central servers/repository and aims to empower or provide a similar level of service/access to a collection of similar computers can be referred to as being a P2P implementation, and it will be in fact enabling everyone to be a creator/provider, not only a consumer. Every P2P system is by definition self feeding, the more participants it has the better it will satisfy it's objectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= P2P Networks and Protocols =
This chapter will try to provide an overview of what is Peer-to-Peer, it's historical evolution, technologies and uses.

== P2P and the Internet: A &quot;bit&quot; of History ==
P2P is not a new technology, P2P is almost as old as the Internet it started with the email and the next generation were called &quot;metacomputing&quot; or classed as &quot;middleware&quot;. The concept of it took the Internet by storm only because of a general decentralization of the P2P protocols, that not only gave power to the simple user but also made possible savings on information distribution resources, a very different approach from the old centralization concept.

This can be a problem for security or control of that shared information, or in other words a &quot;democratization&quot; of the information (the well known use of P2P for downloading copies of MP3s, programs, and even movies from file sharing networks), and due to it's decentralizing nature the traffic patterns, are hard to predict, so, providing infrastructures to support it is a major problem most ISPs are now aware.

P2P has also been heralded as the solution to index the [[w:deep Web|deep Web]] since most implantations of P2P technologies are based and oriented to wired networks running [http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TheTCPIPGuideIntroductionandGuideToTheGuide.htm TCP/IP]. Some are even being transfered to wireless uses (sensors, phones and robotic applications), you probably have already heard of some military implementation of intelligent mines or robotic insect hordes.

Ultimately what made P2P popular was that it created a leveled play field, due to the easy access to computers and networking  infrastructures we have today in most parts of the world. We are free to easily become producers, replacing the old centralized models where most of the population remained as consumers dependent on a single entity (monopoly, brand, visibility) for the distribution or creation of services or digital goods. This shift will undoubtedly reduce the costs of production and distribution in general as the price of services and products that can be digital transfered, the cost is now also becoming evident the quality will also be downgraded until a new system for classification emerges, this can be seen today in relation to the written media after the Internet impact.

== FIDO net ==
{{TODO|Add missing information}}

== eMail ==
[[w:E-mail|Electronic mail]] (often abbreviated as e-mail or email), started as a centralized service for creating, transmitting, or storing primarily text-based human communications with digital communications systems with the first standardization efforts resulting in the adoption of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), first published as Internet Standard 10 (RFC 821) in 1982.

Modern e-mail systems are based on a store-and-forward model in which e-mail computer server systems, accept, forward, or store messages on behalf of users, who only connect to the e-mail infrastructure with their personal computer or other network-enabled device for the duration of message transmission or retrieval to or from their designated server.

Originally, e-mail consisted only of text messages composed in the ASCII character set, today, virtually any media format can be sent today, including attachments of audio and video clips.

{{TODO|Complete}} 

=== Peer2Mail ===
Peer to Mail ( http://www.peer2mail.com/ ) is a FreeWare application for Windows that lets you store and share files on any web-mail account, you can use Web-mail providers such as Gmail (Google Mail), Walla!, Yahoo and others, it will split the shared files into segments that will be compressed and encrypted and then sends the file segments one by one to an account you have administration access. To Download the files the process is reversed.

==== Security ====
The ecryptation was broken in Peer2Mail v1.4 (prior versions are also affected) - [http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/0501-exploits/peer2mail.c Peer2Mail Encrypt PassDumper Exploit].

== Usenet ==
Usenet is the original peer to peer file-sharing application. It was originally developed to make use of UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy) to synchronize two computers' message queues. Usenet stores each article in an individual file and each newsgroup in its own directory. Synchronizing two peers is as simple as synchronizing selected directories in two disparate filesystems.

Usenet was created with the assumption that everyone would receive, store and forward the same news. This assumption greatly simplified development to the point where a peer was able to connect to any other peer in order to get news. The fragmentation of Usenet into myriad newsgroups allowed it to scale while preserving its basic architecture. 'Every node stores all news' became 'every node stores all news in newsgroups it subscribes to'.

Of all other peer-to-peer protocols, Usenet is closest to Freenet since all nodes are absolutely equal and global maps of the network are not kept by any subset of nodes. Unlike Freenet, which works by recursive pulling of a requested object along a linear chain of peers, Usenet works by recursive pushing of all news to their immediate neighbors into a tree.



== FTP ==
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP), can be seen as a primordial P2P protocol. Even if it depends on a client/server structure the limitation is only on the type of application (client/server) one run since the roles are flexible.

=== File eXchange Protocol (FXP)  ===
{{TODO|Add missing information}}

== Zero configuration networking ==
Zero configuration networking (zeroconf), is a set of techniques that automatically creates a usable Internet Protocol (IP) network P2P fashion, without manual operator intervention or special configuration servers. 

=== Bonjour ===
'''[[w:Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]]''', formerly '''Rendezvous'''. A [[w:service discovery|service discovery]] protocol by [[w:Apple Inc.|Apple Inc.]]'s. Bonjour locates in a P2P fashion, devices such as printers, as well as other computers and the services that those devices offer on a [[w:local area network|local network]] using [[w:multicast|multicast]] to maintain a [[w:Domain Name System|Domain Name System]] record. The software is built into Apple's [[Mac OS X]] [[w:operating system|operating system]] from version 10.2 onward, and can be installed onto computers using [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] operating systems. Bonjour also supports components that included other software, such as [[w:iTunes|iTunes]].

'''Bonjour for Windows''' ( http://support.apple.com/downloads/Bonjour_for_Windows )&lt;br&gt;
Bonjour for Windows includes a plugin to discover advertised HTTP servers using Internet Explorer. If you have Bonjour devices on your local network with embedded HTTP (Web) servers, they will appear in the list.

The '''Summer Squashes''' are a group of plants in the species ''Cucurbita pepo'', which are grown for their fruits. They come in many varieties among several major groups including: Yellow Summer, Zucchini, Crookneck, and Cousa. While there are some differences in flavor between these groups, their cultivation is essentially the same. 

Summer squashes grow on short vines, appearing bushy in the field. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and usually variegated with white or pale green.

These plants are highly productive, particularly when the fruits are harvested while young: gardeners growing these plants often have plenty of produce to share with friends. The flowers are also edible and both male and female flowers are harvested for this purpose.

==Growing Conditions==
Summer Squashes grow in full sun or light shade. They require a rich soil for good fruit production.

==Planting==
===Direct Seed===
Summer Squashes grow easily from seeds sown ''in situ''. Plants should be thinned to 18 to 36 inch (45-90 cm) centers. Seeds can be sown as soon as the soil warms up.

===Seedlings in Containers===
For growing transplants, sow 2 seeds per 3 or 4 inch pot. Seedlings grow quickly in warm weather, so should not be started before the planting area is prepared.

===Transplanting===
Transplants should not be broken up or have their roots cut unless severely rootbound. Soil may be mounded up to the lowest set of leaves.

==Maintenance==
===Early Spring===
Enrich planting area with composts, but not with manures, as too much nitrogen may reduce the fruiting.

===Summer===
Pick regularly to avoid over-ripening and encourage further fruit set.
If small fruits appear wrinkled or discolored, remove them (they may not have been pollenated).
Monitor for Squash vine borer.
Hill up composts to the lowest leaf set, adding more as the lower leaves yellow off (the small early leaves will die off naturally as the upper leaves shade them out). This provides both nutrients and some protection for SVB. 
Keep the growing area free of weeds, but maintain nectar sources nearby to ensure an ample supply of pollenating insects.

===Fall Cleanup===
Burn borer-infected vines, and till area to disturb any coccoons. 
If rotation is not possible, use a winter cover crop such as rye, vetch, or pea to enrich the soil.

==Harvesting==
Cut the stems with a sharp knife. Summer squashes are best harvested well before the fruit matures, as the seeds become hardened in large fruit. Fruits can be harvested even before the flowers fully open if desired.

==Propagation==
By seed, from the mature fruits. If collecting seed, allow the most productive plants to produce a single mature fruit towards the end of the season, picking it after the plant is frost-killed.

==Pests and Diseases==
===Fungal Diseases===
Powdery Mildew

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Libraries Reference}}

The '''Maybe''' data type is a means of being explicit that you are not sure that a function will be successful when it is executed. 

== Motivation ==
Many languages require you to guess what they will do when a calculation did not finish properly. For example, an array lookup signature may look like this in pseudocode:

 getPosition(Array a, Value v) returns Integer

But what happens if it ''doesn't'' find the item? It could return a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value, or the integer '-1' which would also be an obvious sign that something went wrong. But there's no way of knowing what will happen without examining the code for this procedure to see what the programmer chose to do. In a library without available code this might not even be possible.

The alternative is to explicitly state what the function ''should'' return (in this case, Integer), but also that it might not work as intended &amp;mdash; Maybe Integer. This is the intention of the Maybe datatype. So in Haskell, we could write the above signature as:

 getPosition :: Array -&gt; Value -&gt; Maybe Integer

If the function is successful you want to return the result; otherwise, you want to return an explicit failure. This could be simulated as a tuple of type &lt;code&gt;(Bool, ''a'')&lt;/code&gt; where ''a'' is the &quot;actual&quot; return type of the function. But what would you put in the ''a'' slot if it failed? There's no obvious answer. Besides which, the Maybe type is easier to use and has a selection of library functions for dealing with values which may fail to return an explicit answer.

== Definition ==

The Standard Prelude defines the Maybe type as follows, and more utility functions exist in the Data.Maybe library.

 data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

The type ''a'' is polymorphic and can contain complex types or even other monads (such as IO () types).

== Library functions ==

The module &lt;code&gt;Data.Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, in the standard [[../../Hierarchical libraries|hierarchical libraries]], contains a wealth of functions for working with Maybe values.

=== Querying ===
There are two obvious functions to give you information about a Maybe value.

==== &lt;code&gt;isJust&lt;/code&gt; ====
This returns True if the argument is in the form &lt;code&gt;Just _&lt;/code&gt;.

 isJust :: Maybe a -&gt; Bool
 isJust (Just _) = True
 isJust Nothing  = False

==== &lt;code&gt;isNothing&lt;/code&gt; ====
The dual of &lt;code&gt;isJust&lt;/code&gt;: returns True if its argument is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;.

 isNothing :: Maybe a -&gt; Bool
 isNothing (Just _) = False
 isNothing Nothing  = True

=== Getting out ===
There are a handful of functions for converting Maybe values to non-Maybe values.

==== &lt;code&gt;maybe&lt;/code&gt; ====
&lt;code&gt;maybe&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes a default value to use if its argument is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, a function to apply if its argument is in the form &lt;code&gt;Just _&lt;/code&gt;, and a Maybe value.

 maybe :: b -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; b
 maybe _ f (Just x) = f x
 maybe z _ Nothing  = z

==== &lt;code&gt;fromMaybe&lt;/code&gt; ====
A frequent pattern is to use the &lt;code&gt;maybe&lt;/code&gt; function, but not want to change the value if it was a &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;. That is, call &lt;code&gt;maybe&lt;/code&gt; with the second parameter being &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;. This is precisely &lt;code&gt;fromMaybe&lt;/code&gt;.

 fromMaybe :: a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
 fromMaybe z = maybe z id

==== &lt;code&gt;fromJust&lt;/code&gt; ====
There are certain occasions when you ''know'' a function that ends in a Maybe value will produce a &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;. In these cases, you can use the &lt;code&gt;fromJust&lt;/code&gt; function, which just strips off a &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; constructor.

 fromJust :: Maybe a -&gt; a
 fromJust (Just x) = x
 fromJust Nothing  = error &quot;fromJust: Nothing&quot;

=== Lists and Maybe ===
Lists are, in some ways, similar to the Maybe datatype (indeed, this relationship will be further explored when you learn about monads). As such, there are a couple of functions for converting between one and the other.

==== &lt;code&gt;listToMaybe&lt;/code&gt; ====
This function, and the following one, makes a lot of sense when you think about Maybe and list values in terms of computations (which will be more fully explained in the section on [[../../Advanced monads|Advanced monads]]).

With lists, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; represents a failed computation. With Maybe, &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; does. &lt;code&gt;listToMaybe&lt;/code&gt; converts between the list and Maybe monad. When the parameter (in the list monad) indicated a successful computation, only the first solution is taken to place in the Maybe value.

 listToMaybe :: [a] -&gt; Maybe a
 listToMaybe []    = Nothing
 listToMaybe (x:_) = Just x

==== &lt;code&gt;maybeToList&lt;/code&gt; ====
The obvious opposite of &lt;code&gt;listToMaybe&lt;/code&gt;.

 maybeToList :: Maybe a -&gt; [a]
 maybeToList Nothing  = []
 maybeToList (Just x) = [x]

=== Lists manipulation ===
Finally, there are a couple of functions which are analogues of the normal Prelude list manipulation functions, but specialised to Maybe values.

==== Continue on some failures (like 'or') ====
===== &lt;code&gt;catMaybes&lt;/code&gt; =====
Given a list of Maybe values, &lt;code&gt;catMaybes&lt;/code&gt; extracts all the values in the form &lt;code&gt;Just _&lt;/code&gt;, and strips off the &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; constructors. This is easily defined with a list comprehension, as we showed in the [[../../Pattern matching|pattern matching chapter]]:

 catMaybes :: [Maybe a] -&gt; [a]
 catMaybes ms = [ x | Just x &lt;- ms ]

===== &lt;code&gt;mapMaybe&lt;/code&gt; =====
&lt;code&gt;mapMaybe&lt;/code&gt; applies a function to a list, and collects the successes. It can be understood as a composition of functions you already know:

 mapMaybe :: (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
 mapMaybe f xs = catMaybes (map f xs)

But the actual definition may be more efficient and traverse the list once:

 mapMaybe :: (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
 mapMaybe _ []     = []
 mapMaybe f (x:xs) = 
   case f x of
     Just y  -&gt; y : mapMaybe f xs
     Nothing -&gt; mapMaybe f xs

==== Stop on failure ====
===== &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt; =====
Sometimes you want to collect the values if and only if all succeeded:

 sequence :: [Maybe a] -&gt; Maybe [a]
 sequence []           = Just []
 sequence (Nothing:xs) = Nothing
 sequence (Just x:xs)  = case sequence xs of
   Just xs' -&gt; Just (x:xs')
   _        -&gt; Nothing

      <text xml:space="preserve">Judaism is a monotheistic religion, or a religion believing that one God exists, the Source of all.  It has three essential elements, found in all historical forms of Judaism, namely, Torah revelation, God and Israel.  Each needs definition.  

The Torah (&quot;Teaching,&quot; in Hebrew) is not only the revelation of God to Israel, explicitly described as the eternal covenant that links both to each other, it also presents the fundamental paradigms for all later historical interaction of God and Israel.  The Torah consists first of all of the Five Books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy), and secondly the entire Hebrew Scriptures (the Mosaic books of &quot;Teaching&quot; to which are added the &quot;Prophets&quot; and associated historical books, and the &quot;Writings&quot; of wisdom: Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim).  These works are together traditionally termed the &quot;Written Torah.&quot;  There is also thirdly the &quot;Oral Torah&quot; or interpretative tradition, said to extend from the time of Moses with further elaborations down through the ages (even up to the present time) by sagely and inspired exegetes.  These oral teachings were eventually consolidated, according to mainstream Judaism, in the Talmud and later Rabbinic writings and commentaries including the mystical writings of the Kabbalah.  However, Ethiopian Jewry never knew of the Talmud and followed its own exegetical traditions, and Karaite Judaism quite intentionally developed its own separate oral traditions.  

God is understood as the one source of the entire universe, transcendent of both space and time, but, although undifferentiated unity in itself, ever present and sustaining every moment and place in the universe, past, present and future, as Creator, Loving Ruler and ultimate Savior.  Creation, i.e., the entire universe, arises out of divine wisdom and mirrors its Creator, God; humanity is also in the divine image, insofar as human beings can actualize the divine attributes of wisdom, love and mercy, justice, etc., in their own lives.  In particular the nuclear family is stated in the first chapter of the Bible to reflect the divine image as a whole, since it unites male and female to each other with sustaining love, and creates out of this and nurtures together new life in their children.   

Israel consists of the &quot;kingdom of priests&quot; instituted by God to be a blessing and intercessor for all humanity its laity (in accordance to his promise to Abraham, Gen. 12:1-3, 18:17-33, and to Moses and Israel, Exod. 19:6) at Mt. Sinai.  At Sinai God created again an entire people and community dedicated to the service of God on earth, and gave them commandments aiming at actualizing holiness in all aspects of ordinary society and life.  As mentioned, this they are to do not just as a society themselves, but also as intercessors for all humanity, although humanity in general is already linked to God through the Covenant with Noah and can already attain to true righteousness through obedience to that covenant (Gen. 9:1-17).  Since a people needs a land, God appointed them the land of Israel as their own.  Although subsequently exiled from there for their sins (in ca. 586 B.C.E.; the Dispersion or Diaspora dates from this time), they were also enabled to return in part soon afterward and rebuild their Temple. The Torah teaches that their link with their land will always be unbroken, and ultimate complete restoration is guaranteed by God.  This final massive ingathering of all Jews to their land will even be one of the chief early signs of the coming of the Messianic Age promised in the Torah, a time when all humanity shall know God and live in peace.

{{TOC}}
'''Userboxes''' (commonly abbreviated as '''UBX''') are small colored boxes that allow users to add small messages on their user pages. They generally include one or two small graphics and a few short lines of text. Often they also include wiki markup that places the user in a [[Wikibooks:Categories|category]]. Userboxes are generally created as [[Help:Templates|templates]] and [[Help:Glossary#transclusion|transcluded]] onto userpages, although their markup may be substituted  directly onto user pages instead. Userboxes should not be used in articles.

The primary purpose of userboxes and user categories should be to alert other Wikibookians to ways you might aid them in editing. For instance, if you speak a second language or have professional expertise in a technical field, other users will know they can contact you for assistance.

'''Acceptable uses for boxes''' include user interests, user skills, technical information, or Wikibooks activities. Do not create or use boxes that do not add to the Wikibooks community.  Userboxes should themselves be filed in a category, but they should not always file those that use them in a category. Keep in mind the [[:Category:Users|existing categories]] when determining whether a userbox should do so or not.
{{clear}}

==Using existing userboxes==
Userboxes are for the use of users on their own user pages. It may be considered uncivil to place any userboxes on any other user's page(s) without their permission.

The standard syntax for adding a userbox to your user page (also known as [[Wikipedia:Transclusion|transclusion]]) is: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{user &lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;nameofbox&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

==Creating a new userbox==
Any userbox, especially those of a more personal nature, should be created as a sub-page of your user page rather than placing it in the &lt;tt&gt;Template:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace.

Userbox names in the Template: namespace must begin with &quot;User &quot; (for example, ''Template:User nameofbox'').  Those in Template: namespace may be expected to adhere more tightly with the ''acceptable uses'' illustrated above compared to ones that are subpages to your user page, which is given more leeway than content in other namespaces.

=== Content restrictions ===
**Userboxes '''must not''' include blatant incivility or personal attacks.
**Userboxes '''must not''' be intentionally inflammatory or divisive. 
**Wikibooks is not an appropriate place for political campaigning.
** Userboxes which imply a negative attribute of some person or group to which the userbox creator then expresses objection, are not usually acceptable.

Simply: If content is not appropriate on a user page, it is not appropriate within userboxes.

=== Caution about image use ===
*The Wikimedia Commons has a [[:commons:Category:Icons|large range of icons]] for use within boxes. However, if you wish to select a different image to put in a userbox, make certain the image license is free. WikiBooks policy does not allow templates (which includes userboxes) or user pages to contain any copyrighted content not under free license; so, for example, &quot;fair use&quot; images are explicitly forbidden. This clause is to be interpreted strictly and without exception, for legal reasons.

=== Caution about user categories ===
*Userboxes that include Category markup which adds the bearing userpage to a category must only categorize within subcategories of [[:Category:Wikibookians]].
*Names and descriptions of subcategories are subject to the same rules and restrictions as userbox content.
*Userboxes should not automatically include categories by default. Consider how useful the category would be to other editors before adding it to your userbox. 
*Do not create categories which could potentially include all Wikibookians. For example, userboxes such as: &quot;This user is a Wikibookian.&quot;; &quot;This user is human.&quot;; &quot;This user uses the internet&quot;; etc., should not include category markup based on such criteria.
*'''Avoid''' categorizing &quot;not&quot;-based userboxes. For example: &quot;This user does not like ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''.&quot;

===Content examples===
Typical userbox content examples:

*This user ''&lt;verb phrase&gt;'' ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user is ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user is a member of ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user is a fan of ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user supports ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user contributes to ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user is interested in ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''
**This user is fascinated by ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;''

Other combinations are obviously possible.

Other typical verbs (again, others are possible): drives, eats, edits, enjoys, favors, likes, loves, plays, prefers, reads, speaks, understands, uses, and watches.

'''Avoid''' the following verbs: considers, finds, knows, and thinks.

Also '''avoid''' compound sentences which are positive and negative, such as:
*This user likes ''&lt;noun phrase&gt;'', but does not like ''&lt;another noun phrase&gt;''.

== Constructing a userbox ==
There are a number of box types to select from when deciding to make a userbox. The most commonly used design is the &quot;'''Standard box'''&quot;. It has one square shaped area on the left (&quot;''id''&quot;) and a rectangular area on the right (&quot;''info''&quot;).

For ease of use, userboxes are made using maker-templates that have a number of parameters. Once the maker-template is saved, it is automatically transformed to [[HTML]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plug-in modules, or '''plugins''' are small electronic modules that fulfil a (usually simple) function that are capable of being plugged directly into a breadboard. Their purpose is to allow common parts of a circuit to be &quot;plugged in&quot; to reduce time spend breadboarding common parts. Common plugins are [[Practical_Electronics/Astables|astables]], switch debouncers, etc. They can be highly customised, and can be as simple or as advanced as you like.

==Construction==

They are often made from [[Practical_Electronics/Stripboard|stripboard]] and use 0.1&quot; [[Practical_Electronics/Other components#Headers|headers]] to make the connection to the breadboard. These headers are usually parallel to the stripboard, so the plugin stands vertically.

They are usually made as small and narrow as possible to avoid making unnecessary clutter on the breadboard. This menas that resistors are often mounted &quot;vertically&quot; to save space, at the expense of ruggedness. Beware of this when inserting and removing plugins, as these components can easily be damaged or damage the track they are soldered to.

===Modifying the headers===

[[image:0.1in Straight Header.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Striaght 0.1&quot; header]]
The least expensive headers available are the straight variety. They cost a few pence each for headers with only a few pins, to up to about 50 pence each for up to 15 pins.

To make the plugins, these need a 90° bend in them. This is best done by using a pair of long-nosed pliers to bend the shorter end (the end normally put through the board) over towards the front of the header (the side without the backing plate). The length the pins come at is ideal for this application, so they do not need pushing of pulling through the plastic body yet.

When the required pins are bent over (you may not need all of the pins on a given header), then you can push them through the body so that only half the previous length remains above the plastic. Then, place the bent ends through the holes (they shoould project about 1mm past the copper strips), and solder in place. Use the pliers to pull of the plastic body, and discard.

==Plugin plans==

===Power Supplies===

*[[/5V Supply|5V 1A Regulated Power Supply]]

===Signals and Amplification===

*[[/Astable|555 Astable]]. Includes optional mark-space variance.

*[[/1Hz Oscillator|1Hz Crystal Oscillator]]. Uses a 32.768KHz crystal to provide a precise 1Hz output to drive timers, etc.

*[[/Audio amplifier|Audio Amplifier]]. Good for listening to signals.

===Input===
*[[/Switch debouncer|De-bounced tact switch]]

===Decoding, DACs, ADCs===
*[[/R2R DAC|R2R DAC]]. 8-Bit, but can be easily expanded.

      <comment>deprecating prettytable, replaced: prettytable → wikitable</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This plugin consists of a single [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/555|555 Astable]]. This plugin is very versatile, and can be used for any number of things, but it often is used to give a clock to run a circuit. The plugin below gives a pulse of about 2Hz with a very low mark-space ratio. The circuit diagram is given below.

[[image:555_Mk-sp_Diagram.svg|center|300px]]

This circuit obeys the following formulae with regards to its frequency and mark space ratio.

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::''This is different to the [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/555#Design equations|design equation]] for the standard 555 Astable. (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of 2R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=R_{ms}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The values below give a frequency of about 2Hz, with a mark-space ratio of about 1:50.

The stripboard layout is as shown below with a component list.

|}

==Variations==

===Enable pin===

To give this plugin an enable pin, replace the wire link from Pin 4 to +V with a 10K resistor going from Pin 4 to ground (Pin 1). Then add a header pin to Pin 4. A high signal on this pin will cause the astable to function, a low will disable it, locking the output low.

Yorkshire pudding is a serving popular across the UK but originating in the county of Yorkshire in England.  It's traditionally eaten with beef or lamb with vegetables.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup (240g) unbleached white flour
* 1 cup (240g) whole wheat pastry flour
* 1 tsp. salt
* Ener-G egg replacer equivalent of 2 eggs
* 1 cup (240ml) soy milk
* 1 cup (240ml) very cold water
* 2 Tbsp. margarine, melted (note, use a margarine like Vitalite that contains no extracts of cow's milk)

== Procedure ==
# Preheat the oven to 425°F/210°C. 
# In a mixing bowl, combine the flours and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg replacer mixture. Stir together until just combined, then add the soy milk and water, a bit at a time. Stir until smooth, but don’t overbeat. 
# Swirl the melted margarine around a shallow, 9x13-inch (22-32cm) baking pan. Pour out any excess and reserve. Pour the batter into the pan and pour any remaining margarine over the top. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden on top and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool, then cut into squares to serve. 

Makes 4 servings

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
In October of 2005, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs took the stage and dropped the video iPod bomb on the world. But he also introduced another product; the first Mac with a ''built-in'' iSight camera. This camera let users video chat with friends right out of the box using Apple's iChat AV software. But to offset the productivity gained by simple videoconferencing capabilities, a second iSight-enabled application made its debut. This application was dubbed Photo Booth.

Photo Booth lets you take your picture. While it sounds simple, and it is, Photo Booth comes with some fun extras that make it hilariously fun, including fourteen special effects that are applied in real-time ''before'' your picture is actually taken. (The real-time effects are applied using Core Image, a new technology in Tiger which makes it possible to apply multiple &quot;halfway&quot; complex effects to images using the graphics card.)

=Taking a Photo=
When Photo Booth loads, you're greeted by a picture of yourself. Taken live from the iSight camera in your Mac, this gives the effect of looking in a mirror. The large red camera button directly below this picture starts the 3-second timer for taking a photo. At the end of the countdown, your screen flashes white and the photo appears in the &quot;tray&quot; below the camera button.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Beef|Beef]]

==Ingredients==
;For the beef and broth
*3-4 lb. [[cookbook:beef|beef]] roast
*2 cans beef [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
*2 cups [[cookbook:water|water]]
*4 small beef [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cubes]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*some dried minced [[cookbook:onion|onion]]
*some [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*[[cookbook:pepper|pepper]] and [[cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste

;For the roux
*1 stick of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Flour|all purpose flour]]

;For the final assembly
*additional [[cookbook:flour|flour]], for dredging
*2 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*[[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|Bread crumbs]], for dredging
*[[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] or [[Cookbook:shortening|shortening]], for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]]

==Procedure==
# Add the first set of ingredients to a [[cookbook:Slow Cooker|slow cooker]]. Cook overnight on low, or until the meat starts to fall apart.
#This should yield about 1 quart (1 liter) of broth. Chill it in the fridge until the fat solidifies on the surface. Scoop off the fat.
#Use 2 forks to tear apart the meat. You can use a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] if you don't want big chunks of meat in the final product.
#In a deep [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], prepare a light brown [[Cookbook:roux|roux]] with the butter and flour.
#While stirring the roux, slowly start adding the broth. It should accept all the broth to make a real thick sauce. 
#Season with salt &amp; pepper to taste. Pour it into a bowl or container and chill it for a couple of hours, or better, overnight.
#Prepare 3 stations, one deep plate with flour, one with 2 beaten eggs, one with plain bread crumbs. Start rolling the meat into small balls, about 1 1/2 in diameter. Roll each ball into flour, then egg, then plain breadcrumbs.
#[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep fry]] in 350 °F vegetable oil or shortening until golden brown.
#Serve hot with the sauce.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Instead of balls, you can roll &quot;cigars&quot;, about 4 inches long and about 1-1/4&quot; in diameter.
*Croquettes can be prepared ahead of time and frozen in a freezer zipper bag. When ready to continue, they may be added to the heated oil without being defrosted.

'''Loukoumades''' 

Makes about 8 servings

==Ingredients==

* 1 pinch cinnamon to taste
* 2 cup flour
* A little oil
* 1 (light) teaspoon salt
* 4 teaspoons yeast 

==Procedure==
# Thin the yeast in 1/2 cup of warm water. 
# Mix the flour with the salt and put it in a deep bowl. 
# Add the yeast and an extra cup of warm water and mix well until you make a uniform thin paste. 
# Cover and leave in the shade for 1 1/2 hour until it rises and forms bubbles under the surface (about 2 hrs). 
# Heat the oil in a deep frying pan and pour your mix in, one large spoonful at a time. Turn the balls as they puff-up, fry till golden brown(3-5 minutes per ball)
# The mix will form round dumplings. 
# Drain on paper towels or remove with a strainer or ladle; keep warm.

===Topping===

#Drizzle and sprinkle, honey (preferably of the thyme variety), cinnamon and walnut or sesame seeds, to your heart's content.


Callimachus called these &quot;honey tokens&quot; some time during the 3rd century B.C.Loukoumades were the 1st prizes awarded to winners of the ancient Olympics. Now they are the perfect Greek cafe dessert celebratory piece of decadent, or mid-morning snack. They’re especially good on cold wintry afternoons with a nice cup of coffee. Bon appetit!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book was originally written by Thomas David Kehoe and published in 2002. In June 2006 he released it under the GFDL licence so that Wikibooks could reproduce it.

The original book included this information written by the author, Thomas David Kehoe, about himself in 2002:

Five years ago, I wrote ''Stuttering: Science, Therapy &amp; Practice''. No one would publish it, so I published it myself. I must have done some things right, because my book became the #1 bestseller about stutter-ing (according to Amazon.com). 

But over these years I learned more about books many mistakes.

My next book was ''Hearts And Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired For Relationships''. I wanted to design the book myself. The few books about book design were written before computers, when bookmaking was an obscure art. A reader wrote the following review of one such book, on Amazon:

''…the book was written long before computers revolutionized the publishing industry, so it has a distinctly archaic — even obsolete — aura. Vast portions of the text are no longer relevant to modern publishing, and readers who rely on them will be very seriously misled… Unfortunately, students will ﬁnd that there is no modern alternative to this book…Proceed at your own risk, and bear in mind that many other books—none of them wholly satisfactory — must also be consulted for supplementary guidance within this sadly under-documented field.''

What I found more useful were LATEX manuals, as well as the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' (I picked it over other style manuals be-cause I'm a University of Chicago alumnus). But LATEX was too hard to learn. The ''Chicago Manual of Style'' is 900 pages long and doesn't tell you how to design a book. I wanted a little book like the ''Elements of Style'', by William Strunk and E.B. White, to quickly tell me the basic rules of book design.

I wrote &quot;Basic Book Design&quot; using Microsoft Word. I don't have time to reformat it as a wikibook but I welcome anyone who volunteers to do that. You can download my MS Word file from 
[http://www.casafuturatech.com/Personal/BasicBookDesign.doc my website]. The file is 1.9MB. Pick a chapter you want to work on, pull it from the MS Word file, put it into the wikibook and clean up the formatting.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 03:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

==Who is this book for==

This book is for those wishing to learn about Basic Book Design. It is pitched at an American audience. Many elements of book design - typesetting, copyediting, etc. - are different in North America from the rest of the English-speaking world, so this book may not be suitable for non-American readers.

==Traditional Rules vs. &quot;Keep Out Of Trouble&quot; Rules==

Often in this book you'll see two, or even three, rules regarding an issue.
For the traditional rules of book design, we refer to the ''Chicago Manual of Style''. When we refer to such a rule, we list the chapter and paragraph number from the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' (e.g., 12.34), so you can look up the rule. (We're using the 14th edition.)

We also explain what word processors — in particular Microsoft Word — do. Sometimes word processors follow rules different from traditional rules.
And often we present novice or &quot;keep out of trouble&quot; rules. These are rules that novices should follow to avoid making awful, obvious, knock 'em dead mistakes. And, usually, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' lists 14 pages of exceptions to our rule. Professional book designers shouldn't follow our &quot;keep out of trouble&quot; rules. 

The rules for choosing between the rules is, if you understand the traditional rules, follow them. If you don't understand the traditional rules, follow our &quot;keep out of trouble&quot; rules.

If you follow our &quot;keep out of trouble&quot; rules, 99.9% of your readers won't notice that you didn't follow traditional rules. Many of the traditional rules are arcane, and known only by book industry professionals. But remember that you may have to &quot;sell&quot; your book to key book industry professionals — e.g., book reviewers — who'll notice amateur typesetting.

In a few places we'll suggest new ideas that we thought of. These aren't rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Choosing the right software application is perhaps the most important book design decision. Different software applications are better for different books.

==LaTeX, ConTeXt — For Academic Books and Other Long or Structured Documents==

You're writing your Ph.D. dissertation in physics. You appreciate the efficiency afforded by being able to define commands like 

\newcommand{\sumvec}[4]{\anvec{#3}{#4}=#1_1+2#2_1,\ldots,#1_#4+#2_#4}

and then use them by typing \sumvec{1}{2}{3}{4}.

You know who [[w:Donald Knuth|Donald Knuth]] is (he's right up there with Einstein for hard-core computer science types). 

LaTeX is a document markup language, while ConTeXt is more of a typesetting system. Both are created on top of the older TeX typesetting language. They'll produce the most professional-looking books. They run on Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX computers. They run reasonably well on the oldest, slowest computers. The source files never crash or become corrupted. They're free (although you can choose to spend as much money as you might wish on books). 

The defaults are set for professional typesetting. If you don't know what you're doing, LaTeX and ConTeXt will automatically produce a professional-looking book. They'll put chapter numbers on all your chapters and section numbers on all your sections. They'll give you a choice of three basic fonts—Roman, Sans-Serif, and Typewriter while also allowing one to use special fonts for mathematics. 

Of course you can change these default settings. You can install other fonts. While font installation is now well-documented for LaTeX and ConTeXt, newer tools such as XeTeX and Lua(La)Tex make accessing fonts (including TrueType ttf and otf), using utf-8 features for other alphabets, and OpenType (otf) font features like ligatures, much easier.. 

There are even packages for embedding videos behind pictures for the electronic (screen readable) versions of your printable book pdfs.

If this sounds like you, download the software (yes, for free) from http://www.tug.org or http://www.latex-project.org/ or http://www.pragma-ade.nl/.

Nicola Talbot, among many others, freely offers helpful getting started information, and even packages for making newspaper or magazine formats which can also help with special book layouts, and provides an  application (Jpgfdraw) and lists others for making native drawings for LaTeX.  http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/latex/

These OpenSource (Linux/Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X) Editors can help as well--- LyX which is a bit more WYSIWYG http://www.lyx.org/Screenshots,  and --- 

TeXworks, which is a typesetting LaTeX editor, which has a pdf output previewer (with editing synchronisation  built in) http://www.tug.org/texworks/ --- most up to date Developer version: http://code.google.com/p/texworks/downloads/list). 
TeXworks can  be customised with JavaScript http://twscript.paulanorman.info or Lua (Python on the way), and so extra interfaces (forms with buttons and drops downs and so on), can also be made by a user, to extend the editor's functionality.  

==Adobe FrameMaker, Corel Ventura Publisher—For Long, Structured Documents==

You're a technical writer working for ABC Company. Your team of tech writers is working on operations and repair manuals that will need to last for many iterations. You want a clean translation for conversion to Adobe Acrobat. The manuals will also be available on CD-ROM, and on your company's website. The manuals will be translated into sixteen languages, including Japanese, and be converted to XML at some point. 

The manuals have many files that need to be compiled into large manuals, as well as text that can be hidden or displayed based on conditions you set. You have multiple level indices, multiple cross-references that link to other files (&quot;see page 234 in Chapter 16, Book 1&quot;). You would also like to publish the book online in a completely different format without rebuilding all the tags and page formats from scratch. The modest $800 price tag doesn't concern your company.

==Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, Microsoft Publisher—For Advertisements, Brochures, and Websites==

You're a graphic designer working for an advertising agency. You create colorful ads, brochures, catalogs, and webpages.

For the Beagle Boy jeans catalog, you put a little dog in the corner of each recto (right-hand) page. Then you get an idea: let's change the dog's tail on each page, so that when readers ﬂip through the catalog, they see the dog wagging its tail!

You do creative stuff with type. You love to go through your collection of 5000 fonts, pick out just the right one, twist and turn the letters to follow a complicated graphic, change the size and shape of each letter, color the letters with a rainbow of hues (subtly shifting with a gradient), and, finally, adjusting the kerning to make the words read smoothly. By lunchtime, you've written three words.

You don't do footnotes or references. You don't care about typesetting conventions—you break the rules, not follow them! 

You use the latest Windows or Macintosh computer, with the fastest processor, zigabytes of memory, and big, beautiful monitor.

(Adobe Pagemaker is in this category, but is obsolete.)

==Microsoft Word, Corel WordPerfect, OpenOffice.org —For Writers==

You write books. You make your books easy to read. You want a word processor that's easy to use. 

You know that ''easy to read'' means looking conventional, like other books, not breaking new ground.

You use graphics and tables, but you try to keep these simple. You expect your work to look professional, but learning arcane typesetting conventions isn't your hobby.

You use footnotes and references. You use indices and tables of contents. Your book will be printed on paper, not on a CD-ROM or posted onto a website. Your final book will hopefully be properly typeset using a professional desktop publishing (DTP) application such as InDesign, QuarkXPress, or a typesetting system such as TeX or LaTeX. Word processors are for processing words, not laying out pages.

You need to send your work to your editor, who uses the same software you use.

You can afford to buy a middle-of-the-line computer every two or three years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reading is a habitual skill. What you read most often is easiest for you to read. This is why newspapers, magazines, and books are more or less standardized. ''Basic Book Design'' will teach you to make your document look conventional.

Breaking these rules usually makes your book harder to read. I.e., a book that looks &quot;distinctive&quot; and artistic is usually hard to read. Conversely, easy-to-read books usually look boring and conventional.

A good compromise is to design a distinctive and artistic cover, chapter titles, running headers, etc.; and make your text boring and readable.

#Use 11-point Palatino for text. 
#Use 14-point Helvetica for chapter titles and 12-point Helvetica for section headings.
#Never use monospaced (a.k.a. “typewriter”) fonts, e.g., Courier, except when mocking up documents, i.e., reports, that actually use such a font.
#Use unusual fonts only for short items, e.g., the title and author's name on the cover, or for chapter titles.
#Don't use too many fonts. Three should be enough for almost any book.
#Check books you like the look of, and see which fonts they use. Half an hour in a bookstore looking at fonts can be very useful and enlightening.
#Don't forget that it can only take up less than a quarter of a page

==Advanced Rules==

''The Elements Of Typographic Style'', by Robert Bringhurst (2001), contains some useful rules about font selection.

DEFINITIONS:
serif &lt;br&gt;
sans-serif&lt;br&gt;
proportional&lt;br&gt;
monospaced&lt;br&gt;
x-height&lt;br&gt;
points&lt;br&gt;
picas&lt;br&gt;
subheads&lt;br&gt;
large-print book

===Serif vs. Sans-Serif===

Fonts are, in general, divided into ''serif'' and ''sans-serif'' designs. Serif fonts have little curlicues on the ends of the letters. Sans-serif fonts don't. E.g.,

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times Roman,Nimbus Roman,Times New Roman; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Times Roman&lt;/span&gt; is a serif font.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica, Nimbus Sans L, Arial; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/span&gt; is a sans-serif font.

People don't read words one letter at a time. They recognize entire words at once. Words are, in general, easier to recognize in a serif font, for three reasons:

•	The curlicues give the letters a more distinctive shape.&lt;br&gt;
•	The lower-case letters are relatively smaller (and the upper-case letters relatively larger). This is called ''x-height''.&lt;br&gt;
•	Readers are used to reading serif fonts. What you read most often is easiest for you to read.&lt;br&gt;

Smaller x-height makes serif fonts use less horizontal space. I.e., your book will be shorter if you use a serif font. E.g., the following two sentences are the same font size:

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times Roman,Nimbus Roman,Times New Roman; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (12-point Times)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Helvetica, Nimbus Sans L, Arial; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (12-point Helvetica)&lt;/span&gt;

In 1931, the ''London Times'' hired typographers to design a highly readable, compact font. Times Roman is now the most widely used font. It's chicken-and-egg: Times Roman is easy to read, so it's widely used; and it's widely used, so it's easy to read.

===Points And Picas===

72.27 ''points'' make one inch. A point is 0.3515 millimeters. A point is neither metric nor imperial.

Microsoft Word uses exactly 72 points to the inch. This is known as a &quot;Postscript point&quot; since it was the first computer design system to use the 72-per-inch convention. Postscript points aren’t technically typesetting points; i.e. two typesetters, one using PS points and the other using real points, will discover that one's fonts are slightly too big and the other's points slightly too small. Slightly means the round-off error is insignificant for all but the largest fonts. 

TeX and METAFONT use 72.27 points to the inch. They support other units, like Didot point used in European typography. One Didot point is equal to 1238/1157 points.

A ''pica'' is twelve points, or about one-sixth of an inch, or about four millimeters. 12 Didot points are one cicero.

===Chapter And Section Titles===

Use a different font for chapter titles. Helvetica is a good choice. It's the most popular sans-serif font. It's the most distinctive font from Times Roman that is still relatively easy to read. It also looks good in bold.

''The Chicago Manual of Style'' (18.28-29) advocates using the same font for text and for section and subsection headings (called ''subheads''). The Chicagoans recommend using ALL CAPS, ''italics'', &lt;small&gt;SMALL CAPS&lt;/small&gt;, etc., to differentiate the levels of headings.

Don't use small caps in a heading unless you buy a small caps font. The Small Caps feature that word processors offer you (scaling down capitals) isn't really small caps. More about this later. If you use a small caps font, make sure the heading font isn't smaller than the text font. That would confuse readers.

ALL CAPS are harder to read. This is OK for short chapter titles, but not for long subheads.

Instead, consider using the chapter title font (e.g., Helvetica) for the A-level subheads, and then switching to the text font (e.g., Times Roman) for the B-level subheads. E.g., this book has chapter titles in 14-point Helvetica Neue bold ALL CAPS, section heads in 12-point Helvetica Neue bold Title Case, and subheads in 12-point Times New Roman ''italic'' Title Case.

Subheads should never be the last item on a page. In Microsoft Word, use Format…Paragraph…Line and Page Breaks…Keep with next to prevent this.

===Monospaced Fonts===

A third type of font should be used rarely or never. These are ''monospaced'' or typewriter fonts. The most common example is Courier. In contrast, Times Roman, Helvetica, etc. are ''proportionately-spaced'' fonts.

Monospaced fonts were designed for type-writers. Each letter is the same width. E.g., compare Courier with Times Roman:

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:Courier, Courier New, Monospace; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; iii	mmm 	(Courier)	&lt;/p&gt;		
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:Times, FreeSerif, Times New Roman, Serif; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;iii	mmm 	(Times Roman)&lt;/p&gt;
{|border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:Courier, FreeMono, Courier New, Monospace; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Courier&lt;/p&gt;
|&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:Times, FreeSerif, Times New Roman, Serif; font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Times Roman&lt;/p&gt;

Notice that in Courier, the ''i'' and the ''m'' are the same width. In Times Roman, the ''i'' is narrow and the ''m'' is wide.
Monospaced fonts are hard to read and take up more space.

NOTE: If your computer does not have these fonts installed, similar ones will be displayed.

===Low-Res Fonts===

If you use a Macintosh running Mac OS 9 or earlier, your font library will include several fonts Apple developed in 1984 for the original Macintosh and its Image-Writer printer. These fonts include New York, Geneva, Monaco, and Chicago. These were designed to look good at the low 80 dpi resolution of the original Macintosh and its Image Writer printer. Modern printers are at least 360 dpi. Don't use these fonts unless you're trying to make your document have that authentic 1984 birthplace-of-desktop-publishing look.

===Font Size===

Too-small fonts are hard to read, especially for older people or people who don't read much.

Too-large fonts look like a children's book. Your eyes have to move more, and you have to turn more pages. This gets tiring.

Compact-width fonts, e.g., Times Roman, look best in 11 or 12 points.
Wider fonts, e.g., Palatino, look best in a smaller font size, usually 10 or 11 points.

&quot;Large print&quot; books are at least 14 points.

#When using book-length lines (65-70 characters per line, including spaces), don't use single-spaced or double-spaced settings. Instead, use &quot;At Least&quot; settings.
#When using book-length lines, use two or three points of leading, e.g., 15 points leading with a 12-point font. 
#When using wider lines, e.g., in a letter, use wider leading. Use double-spacing or one-and-a-half spacing.

===Leading===

''Leading'' (pronounced like ''lead'', the metal, not ''lead'', what your dog does when walking you) is the space between lines of text. It's also called spacing, as in single-spaced, double-spaced, etc.

Fonts and leading are referred to as two numbers. E.g., &quot;12/13&quot; or &quot;12 on 13 points&quot; is a 12-point font with 13 points of leading.

===Solid===

Single-spaced can be the same as the font size (called ''solid''), e.g., a 12-point font on 12-point leading. Or it can be the font size plus one point, e.g., a 12-point font on 13 points of leading is single-spaced. Check what your word processor does.

A 12-point font with one-and-a-half spacing is 18 points of leading, or 12/18.

A 12-point font with double spacing is 24 points of leading, or 12/24.
Use two or three points of leading. E.g., 11/13, or 12/15. This is easier to read than single-spaced (one point of leading). 

More than three points of leading is usually unnecessary. Your book will be longer, increasing printing costs. Readers will have to move their eyes more, and turn more pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Keep Out Of Trouble Rules==

Use justified paragraphs.

Justiﬁed text has even left and right margins. Unjustiﬁed text has an even left margin and a &quot;ragged right&quot; margin.

This paragraph is justiﬁed. This sentence is in a justiﬁed paragraph. This sentence is also in a justiﬁed paragraph. This sentence is—you guessed it!—also in a justiﬁed paragraph.

This paragraph is ragged right. This sen-tence is in a ragged right paragraph. This sentence is also in a ragged right para-graph. This sentence is—you guessed it!—also in a ragged right paragraph.

Typeset books use justiﬁed text. Justified text looks nicer. Readers are used to reading justiﬁed text, so justiﬁed text is easier to read.

&quot;Ragged right&quot; text improves retention. I.e., if you want readers to remember what you wrote, and especially to return and ﬁnd items they'd read earlier, use of &quot;ragged right&quot; may be justified (sorry, I couldn't resist the pun). Just as readers recognize words by their shape, they also remember ideas by the shape of the paragraph.

&quot;Ragged right&quot; text should be used in one other situation. If the column is very narrow, or the font size is very big, or the words are very long (e.g., website URLs), justified text can produce huge white spaces between words, called ''open'' lines. Open lines are a sign of amateur typesetting. 

Instead, set a website URL centered on its own line. If you're forced to use a narrow column (e.g., ﬂowing text around an illustra-tion), look at it both justiﬁed and &quot;ragged right,&quot; and choose what looks best.

Text is always justiﬁed by increasing white space between words, never between letters within words. The latter (called ''letterspacing'') would make word shapes difﬁcult to recognize. Text should always be justified by adding equal amounts of space between all words on a line. Early word processors (in the 1980s) put two spaces between some words and one space between other words. That looked awful.

#For books printed on offset printers, use a 6&quot;x9&quot; page size.
#For books or anything else printed on laser printers (including Xerox Docutech printers), use 5.5&quot;x8.5&quot; or 8.5&quot;x11&quot; page size mf.

The standard book size is six inches wide and nine inches tall (6&quot;x9&quot;). Your book will probably be cheapest to print, easiest to read, and easiest to sell (e.g., it'll fit on bookstore shelves) in this size.

Larger books are harder to hold, carry, or put on a shelf.

Smaller books lose disproportionately more space to margins, increasing the cost. A 6&quot;x9&quot; book has nearly 20% more text space. But a 6&quot;x9&quot; book costs only about 5% more than a 5.5&quot;x8.5&quot; book. The result is a 15% cost savings.

The cover of a 6&quot;x9&quot; book is 15% larger than a 5.5&quot;x8.5&quot; book. The cover is your best advertising space. In a bookstore window, passersby are more likely to see a larger book.

Setting up your software applications for 6&quot;x9&quot; pages can be tricky. In Microsoft Word, go the File…Page Setup…Settings… Custom Paper Size.

===Inkjet Printer Limitations===

If you have an inkjet printer connected to your computer, Microsoft Word usually won't allow a 0.5&quot; bottom margin. Depending on the printer, it may require a minimum 0.56&quot; or 0.67&quot; bottom margin. 0.06 inches may not sound like much, but in a 224-page book, that's two extra pages.

To get around this limitation, tell Microsoft Word you're using a laser printer. Word should then allow a bottom margin up to 0.2&quot;.
 
Alternatively, use the default paper size, e.g., 8.5&quot;x11&quot;. Save your document as a PDF file, and use Adobe Acrobat to crop the pages.

#For bound books 6&quot;x9&quot; or smaller, use 0.5&quot; margins on the top, outside and bottom of books, and a 0.75&quot; inside margin.
#For 8.5&quot;x11&quot; documents (bound or unbound), use 1-inch margins.
#Adjust margins, font size, and columns to produce 65-70 characters per line (including spaces).

==Definitions==
===Mirror margins===
Printers usually require minimum one-half-inch margins. Narrower margins risk smearing wet ink as the printing press’s rollers move the paper.

Increasing margins (e.g., to one inch) makes your book longer and costlier to print. However, I recommend increasing the inside margin (the margin closest to the binding). This makes the book easier to read. Pages tend to curl near the binding. Less light gets into the center of a book. Increase your inner margin to three-quarter-inch.

''The Chicago Manual of Style'' (18.17) advocates printing 65 to 70 characters on each line (including spaces). In Microsoft Word, select a line and use Tools…Word Count to count the number of characters. E.g., in the last paragraph, the full lines varied from 63 to 69 characters.

If your lines have substantially more than 70 characters, consider using two columns.

Make your three outer margins equal. This makes the text look square on the page. E.g., set your margins at three-quarter-inch for the inside, one-half-inch for the outside, one-half-inch for the top margin, and one-half-inch for the bottom margin.

Professional book designers will object that books traditionally have a narrower top margin and a wider bottom margin. This looks good if you have a running header but no running footer. I prefer equal margins, to maximize use of the page and reduce page count. As noted above with font choice, using equal margins is a rule to keep novices out of trouble. If you understand traditional book design don't follow this rule.

Use ''mirror margins'' with unequal inner and outer margins, if your document will be bound (e.g., a book).

===Header and Running Header===

To a typesetter, a ''header'' means a chapter or section title. What your word processor calls a header is called a ''running header'' by a typesetter.

===Folios===

Page numbers (called ''folios'') should start with the ﬁrst page of text as page 1. If you have excessive front matter (e.g., a six-page foreword), use lower-case roman numerals (i, ii, iii…) to number the front matter.

Page numbers should be placed at the outer margin of the running header. Use a font family distinctive from the text font family, e.g., Helvetica for the running header if your text is Times Roman. Also use a font size distinctive from the text font size, e.g., 10 points for the page number, if the text is 12 points.

''The Chicago Manual of Style'' (1.94) advocates not putting the book title in the verso (left hand) running header. They reason that your readers don't need to be reminded what book they're reading. However, if a reader photocopies your book and the title is in the left hand header  the title will show on each copy.

Put the chapter title in the recto (right-hand) running header. Tab in one-half inch from the verso left margin to start the book title. Tab back one-half inch from the recto right margin to end the chapter title. 

Use the same font for the running header and the page number. Leave a space between the header and the text. A large space is unnecessary if your running header looks distinctive from the text.

I guarantee that at least once you'll change a chapter title, and then forget to change the running header (i.e., at least one running header won't match the chapter title). To avoid this problem, insert the running header as a cross-reference. In Microsoft Word, open View… Header and Footer. Click in the running header. Open Insert…Cross-Reference. Select Header and Header Text. Select the appropriate chapter title and insert. 

Don't use a footer if you want to minimize printing costs. Put all the necessary info into the header.

===First Page of Chapters===

The ﬁrst page of each chapter should not have a header. 

In Microsoft Word, at the start of each chapter, don't use a page break. Instead use Insert&gt;Break&gt;Section Break (New Page) to start a new section. Then use View…Header and Footer… Different First Page (the icon has a numeral 1 in it) to remove the header from, and possibly add a footer to, the ﬁrst page of each section. 

On the ﬁrst page of each chapter, the page number is centered in the footer. This is called a ''drop folio''. Don't put anything else in this footer.

In Microsoft Word, this puts a page number at the bottom of your title page. To remove it, select the first footer after your title page and turn off &quot;Same as Previous.&quot; Then delete the page number on the title page.

I said that the bottom margin should be one-half inch. The drop folio is an exception to the rule. Put a drop folio a quarter-inch from the bottom of the page.

#For books printed on offset presses, total pages must be multiples of 8, 16, or 32, (e.g., 224 pages, not 220 pages). Ask your printer if you save money by using a multiple of 32.
#For documents printed on laser printers (including Xerox Docutech printers), any number of pages is possible.
#Minimize front and back matter, e.g., titles pages. Don't include items such as half-title pages unless you know the right way to design them.
#Ask your printer to use recycled paper and soy-based ink.

==Traditional Rules==

See the Chicago Manual of Style (1.4-58, 1.82-91) to design the front and back matter pages.

==Commentary==

Offset presses print books in signatures of eight, sixteen, or thirty-two pages. E.g., a book can be 224 pages, but not 220 pages. Ask your printer what their presses do. 

It may be cheaper to print a 224-page book instead of a 216-page book. 224 pages is seven thirty-two-page signatures (a ''signature'' is a set of pages printed together). 216 pages is eight signatures: six thirty-two-page signatures, one sixteen-page signature, and one eight-page signature. I.e., the printing press needs to be set up only seven times for a 224-page book, but has to be set up eight times for a 216-page book. Each set-up costs money.

Xerox Docutech printers (used for small runs of under 500 books) don't print in signatures, so can print any number of pages.

===Excessive Front and Back Pages===

Why books start with sixteen pages of title pages, contents, acknowledgements, dedication, quotations, etc. makes no sense to me. Every page costs money. Do readers want to spend an extra dollar for pages they don't read?

Ten pages of forewords and introductions will confuse the reader—is he or she supposed to read all that? Or can the reader skip all that and start with Chapter 1?

Nobody reads the acknowledgements, except the handful of people you acknowledge. Put it on the copyright page. 

Nobody reads the excerpted reviews sometimes included in the front of paperbacks. The reader knows that all the excerpts will praise the book, so why read them?

Don't stretch a small book by using a large font size, wide leading, wide margins, blank pages at the end, etc. Small books can be just as good as big books. Many of the best books ever written are under 100 pages.

===Environmental Issues===

Ask your printer to use recycled paper and soy ink. Some printers will do this for no extra cost. Put the recycled logo on your back cover or title page. You could also ask for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Stewardship_Council FSC]-certified paper.

I’ve never used Microsoft Word in master document mode. Several people have told me that it's a &quot;bug-ridden monstrosity.&quot; If this is true, and you need to make master documents, consider another software application, e.g., Adobe InDesign.

      <comment>/* How Much To Indent? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Don't indent the ﬁrst paragraph of a chapter or section. Only following paragraphs are indented.

:LaTeX automatically does this. Microsoft Word doesn’t.
:If you use Microsoft Word, you'll have to create a new style for &quot;First Paragraph&quot; and manually set all these ﬁrst paragraphs into that style.

==How Much To Indent?==

If you choose to indent paragraphs (as opposed to setting them with a small space between each), set your indentation in as far as the font is high. E.g., if you’re using a 12-pt font, indent your paragraphs about 12 points, or 0.17 inches. Visually, 12-pt Helvetica is quite different than 12-pt Times New Roman, so you might want to make adjustments based on the visual appearance.

Indent no more than the leading (space between lines within a paragraph). E.g., with 15-pts leading, indent no more than 15-pts indentation, or 0.21 inches.

Microsoft Word's default indentation is set to 0.5 inches. This comes from the days of creating a manuscript on a monospaced typewriter (five spaces was about one-half inch) and from the half-inch automatic tab stops made popular by the first word processing software.

Spacing between paragraphs is a related consideration. If you choose the more modern digital design of having space denote a paragraph break, then paragraph indentation is overkill—unless you want it for design aesthetics. Indentation exists because it was cheaper for early printers to do that than to add strips of lead between paragraphs, thus increasing the total number of pages required per book and increasing costs per unit. As a design element, indentation raises questions, such as the questionable need for indentation of running dialogue.

'''''As e-reader devices overtake paper book sales, book design aesthetics will evolve as well. There is little reason to maintain the printer’s status quo when there is no longer a printer involved. As with all good design, use common sense, have a reason for your choices, keep things consistent, and don't be afraid to break a few so-called rules.'''''

      <text xml:space="preserve">A ''widow'' is a ''short'' line (one or two words) ending a paragraph at the top of a page. Widows should be avoided.

An orphan is the first line of a paragraph ending a page.

Microsoft Word has automated widow/orphan control, in Format…Paragraph…Line and Page Breaks. I suggest not using it, for two reasons. First, Microsoft Word doesn't count the number of words in a widow. According to the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' (19.40), a ten-word line isn't a widow, and is acceptable.

Second, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' doesn't say anything about orphans, so I presume these are acceptable. Orphans are always full lines (never one or two words).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Illustrations, tables, charts, etc. should have captions or legends. 

The &quot;keep out trouble&quot; rule is to use Microsoft Word's In-sert…Caption function.

The &quot;traditional&quot; rule is in the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' sec-tion about this (11.24-43).

===Bulleted Lists===

Use a tab between the bullet and the first word. A space will vary in width, if your list has justified text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Type one space between sentences.

LaTeX automatically puts in a wider space between sentences. One LaTeX manual says that this is traditional for English and American typesetters, and that French typesetters don't use the wider space between sentences. The ''Chicago Manual of Style'' doesn't say anything about this issue.

I.e., the &quot;keep out of trouble&quot; rule is one space. I'm not certain of the traditional rule. The &quot;word processor rule&quot; is easy: Microsoft Word can't put wider spaces between sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Microsoft Word autocorrects many mistyped words. It underlines in red words that it doesn't recognize. This is helpful.

Microsoft Word doesn't recognize ligatures (two letters joined, usually ﬁ or ﬂ). E.g., it thinks that ofﬁce is misspelled.

Microsoft Word underlines grammatical errors in green. If you don't understand why your grammar checker ﬂagged a sentence, click on Tools…Spelling and Grammar and it will tell you. If you don't understand its explanation, look it up in a grammar book (e.g., ''The Chicago Manual Of Style'').

The Grammarian grammar checker (made by Casady &amp; Greene, http://www.casadyg.com) is more powerful than Microsoft Word’s built-in grammar checker. If your writing is worth money, it’s worth $19.95.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Amateur writers emphasize words with CAPITAL LETTERS, underlining, bold, or larger letters.

Professional writers instead use italics to emphasize words.

Amateurs go on and on with really long emphasized sentences. 
Sometimes they emphasize entire paragraphs.

Professionals emphasize only one word, or a few words.

What about emphasizing a word in an emphasized sentence? The standard form is that in an italic sentence, the emphasized word is not in italics. Instead consider using bold italics to emphasize a word in an italic sentence.

==Modiﬁers==

Don't use ''very'', ''really'', or ''just''. These words are just never really necessary, and always make you sound very amateurish. (Read that sentence again, removing ''just'', ''really'', and ''very''.)

The compound word ''sky-rocketing'' means that the speaker is reporting a problem someone should do something about—as in, someone other than the speaker. E.g., “Dog poop in parks is sky-rocketing!”

      <text xml:space="preserve">''The Chicago Manual of Style'' (8.3) advocates spelling out whole numbers from one through one hundred. However, this makes text less readable (and also longer). Few people see ''ninety'' spelled out, but everyone sees ''90'' often. E.g., advertisements say &quot;90 Days Same As Cash!&quot;

I suggest spelling out whole numbers one through twelve, and multiples of ten, through one hundred. Use numerals for all other numbers.

Where you switch from written numbers to numerals is unimportant. What counts is being consistent. E.g., don't write &quot;thirteen&quot; on one page, and &quot;13&quot; on another.

Exceptions include quotations (use what was written in the original), money, percentages (e.g., ''70%'' is easier to read than ''seventy percent''), and when a sentence has two or more numbers (e.g., &quot;The average woman moves in with a man at age 20 or 21.&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Avoid mentioning yourself when writing. We naturally talk about ourselves in conversation, so it's easy to write this way. But it doesn't sound professional.

Use Find to search for &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;. Rewrite the sentences without mentioning yourself. Or take out the material—it probably doesn't add anything.

Using the phrase &quot;the author&quot; sounds stuffy.

Avoid telling personal stories. Stories take up more room than simply stating the point.

Like unusual fonts, break this rule if you have a good reason. E.g., your book is a memoir, or a book of personal essays.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Invasion of privacy has three forms.

==Intrusion Upon Seclusion==

You may not take photographs or record a person in his or her home without his or her consent. This legal concept sometimes extends to other private places, to photos of the inside of the person’s home, or to &quot;hidden camera&quot; or &quot;hidden microphone&quot; use anywhere.

==Private Facts==

Details of an individual's sexual relationships, personal hygiene, contents of personal letters, etc., are off limits to the news media, except when such facts are &quot;newsworthy.&quot;

==False Light Publicity==

Inventing quotes or ﬁctional events to portray a person falsely to the public, or using photos out of context to imply scandalous activity, is unlawful.

* Search for &quot;there are&quot; and rewrite these sentences.
* Search for &quot;, and&quot;. Consider breaking these sentences into two sentences.
* Search for just, very, really, and actually, and remove.
* Search for &quot;ly-&quot; and remove the hyphen.
* Consistently use either &quot;for example&quot; or &quot;e.g.&quot;
* Consistently use either &quot;in other words” or &quot;i.e.&quot;
* Search periods following quotations marks.
* Search for two spaces after periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.
* No hidden index entries in the front or back matter (e.g., title page, table of contents).
* Use a grammar checker to ﬁnd passive voice sentences, and rewrite in active voice.
* Check capitalization in all chapter and section titles.
* Search for repeated carriage returns, and remove.
* Replace ﬁ and ﬂ with ligatures (also ff, ffi and ffl if you have access to the expert set).
* M-dashes breaking at line breaks.
* Ellipses breaking at line breaks.
* Automated hyphenation on. No too-short or too-long word divisions.
* First paragraph of chapters, sections, and subsections not in-dented.
* Chapter titles in running headers correct.
* First page of chapters don't have headers, instead have drop folios (page number in footer).
* Title page, ﬁrst page, etc. on recto (right-hand) pages.
* No widows.
* Number of pages fits into signatures (e.g., 224 pages).
* Graphics neither too dark not too light.
* Table of contents page numbers correct.
* Index page numbers correct.
* Crop PDF ﬁle pages to page size.
* Bar code price correct. The price is the smaller bar code to the right. Above you'll see a number. It will start with a 5, if your price is in American dollars. Ignore the ﬁrst digit. The rest of the number is your price. E.g., “51995” means US$19.95. 
* Canadian Price. Use the latest exchange rate to check this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''In this &quot;bite&quot;''', we're looking at biological and molecular structure, which, in other words refers to '''what living things are made of'''. The main idea of this area is to help you understand what these particular biological parts do, and why they're important.

== Motivation ==
The reason why biological molecules are interesting, is because when you're in real world, you see lots of things around you which work incredibly well. Most of the time, we use our body and don't even notice that we're using some incredibly fine-tuned mechanisms which are crammed together into our body. In this area, we're looking at what different types of molecules there are when we come to look at multi-cellular organisms, and how abouts they work.

So, the main questions we will be answering in this area will be...:
* What makes up the main substances our body uses?
* Why are these substances so important?
* How harmoniously do these work with each other?

And.. the main things you should learn from this are:
* Learn to use formula to calculate the processes of:
:* Condensation
:* Hydrolysis
* Learn the usage and importance of:
:* Chromatography
:* Biochemical Tests

== Carbohydrates ==

&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hydr&lt;/font&gt;ogen&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;pink&quot;&gt;Ate&lt;/font&gt; the suffix -ate means there is a hidden oxygen group
|}

As you may know, carbohydrates are the things we get when we eat non-meat stuff like potatoes. They can be as simple as table sugar and as complex as amylopectin and other starches. Now, what's with the name? Carb-o-hydrates? Well, as you can see in the figure on the left, carbohydrates are made up of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.

Now, there's more to these carbohydrate things. There are usually '''3 different forms of carbohydrates''', and they sound suspiciously like the things found in in butter. If you're having trouble remembering these, try to think of them as a sack race between Polly (poly), Disa and Mono (Sack-a-rides - saccharides); {{-}}

*'''Mono'''saccharides - simple one sugared molecules
*'''Di'''saccharides - two sugared molecules
*'''Poly'''saccharides - many sugared molecules

Now, the reason WHY there are these types of carbohydrate, and it's because they are formed in '''different circumstances''', and they're named due to their molecular structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Fun with Types}}

Existential types, or 'existentials' for short, are a way of 'squashing' a group of types into one, single type. 

Firstly, a note to those of you following along at home: existentials are part of GHC's ''type system extensions''. They aren't part of Haskell98, and as such you'll have to either compile any code that contains them with an extra command-line parameter of &lt;code&gt;-XExistentialQuantification&lt;/code&gt;, or put &lt;code&gt;{-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}&lt;/code&gt; at the top of your sources that use existentials.

== The &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; keyword ==
The &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used to explicitly bring type variables into scope. For example, consider something you've innocuously seen written a hundred times so far:

{{HaskellExample|A polymorphic function|
 map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
}}

But what are these &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;? Well, they're type variables, you answer. The compiler sees that they begin with a lowercase letter and as such allows any type to fill that role. Another way of putting this is that those variables are 'universally quantified'. If you've studied formal logic, you will have undoubtedly come across the quantifiers: 'for all' (or &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;) and 'exists' (or &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;). They 'quantify' whatever comes after them: for example, &lt;math&gt;\exists x&lt;/math&gt; means that whatever follows is true for at least one value of ''x''. &lt;math&gt;\forall x&lt;/math&gt; means that what follows is true for every ''x'' you could imagine. For example, &lt;math&gt;\forall x, \, x^2 \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists x, \, x^3 = 27&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; keyword quantifies ''types'' in a similar way. We would rewrite &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;'s type as follows:

{{HaskellExample|Explicitly quantifying the type variables|
 map :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
}}

So we see that for any &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; we can imagine, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; takes the type &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt;. For example, we might choose &lt;code&gt;a = Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b = String&lt;/code&gt;. Then it's valid to say that &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;(Int -&gt; String) -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [String]&lt;/code&gt;. We are ''instantiating'' the general type of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; to a more specific type. 

However, in Haskell, as we know, any use of a lowercase type implicitly begins with a &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; keyword, so the two type declarations for &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; are equivalent, as are the declarations below:

{{HaskellExample|Two equivalent type statements|
 id :: a -&gt; a
 id :: forall a . a -&gt; a
}}

What makes life really interesting is that you can override this default behaviour by explicitly telling Haskell where the &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; keyword goes.  One use of this is for building '''existentially quantified types''', also known as existential types, or simply existentials. But wait... isn't &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; the ''universal'' quantifier? How do you get an existential type out of that? We look at this in a later section. However, first, let's dive right into the deep end by seeing an example of the power of existential types in action.

== Example: heterogeneous lists ==
The premise behind Haskell's typeclass system is grouping types that all share a common property. So if you know a type instantiates some class &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, you know certain things about that type. For example, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; instantiates &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;, so we know that elements of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; can be compared for equality.

Suppose we have a group of values, and we don't know if they are all the same type, but we do know they all instantiate some class, i.e. we know all the values have a certain property. It might be useful to throw all these values into a list. We can't do this normally because lists are homogeneous with respect to types: they can only contain a single type. However, existential types allow us to loosen this requirement by defining a 'type hider' or 'type box':

{{HaskellExample|Constructing a heterogeneous list|&lt;pre&gt;
 data ShowBox = forall s. Show s =&gt; SB s
 
 heteroList :: [ShowBox]
 heteroList = [SB (), SB 5, SB True]
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

We won't explain precisely what we mean by that datatype definition, but its meaning should be clear to your intuition. The important thing is that we're calling the constructor on three values of different types, and we place them all into a list, so we must end up with the same type for each one. Essentially this is because our use of the &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; keyword gives our constructor the type &lt;code&gt;SB :: forall s. Show s =&gt; s -&gt; ShowBox&lt;/code&gt;. If we were now writing a function to which we intend to pass &lt;code&gt;heteroList&lt;/code&gt;, we couldn't apply a function such as &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; to the values inside the &lt;code&gt;SB&lt;/code&gt;, for their type might not be &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;. But we do know something about each of the elements: they can be converted to a string via &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, that's pretty much the only thing we know about them.

{{HaskellExample|Using our heterogeneous list|&lt;pre&gt;
 instance Show ShowBox where
  show (SB s) = show s        -- (*) see the comment in the text below
 
 f :: [ShowBox] -&gt; IO ()
 f xs = mapM_ print xs

 main = f heteroList
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

Let's expand on this a bit more. In the definition of &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ShowBox&lt;/code&gt; – the line marked with &lt;code&gt;(*) see the comment in the text below &lt;/code&gt; – we don't know the type of &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. But as we mentioned, we ''do'' know that the type is an instance of Show due to the constraint on the &lt;code&gt;SB&lt;/code&gt; constructor. Therefore, it's legal to use the function &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, as seen in the right-hand side of the function definition. 

As for &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, recall the type of print:

{{HaskellExample|Types of the functions involved|&lt;pre&gt;
 print :: Show s =&gt; s -&gt; IO () -- print x = putStrLn (show x)
 mapM_ :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m ()
 mapM_ print :: Show s =&gt; [s] -&gt; IO ()
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

As we just declared &lt;code&gt;ShowBox&lt;/code&gt; an instance of &lt;code&gt;Show&lt;/code&gt;, we can print the values in the list.

== Explaining the term ''existential'' ==
{{Side note|side=right|Since you can get existential types with &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt;, Haskell forgoes the use of an &lt;code&gt;exists&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which would just be redundant.}}

Let's get back to the question we asked ourselves a couple of sections back. Why are we calling these existential types if &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; is the universal quantifier?

Firstly, &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; really does mean 'for all'. One way of thinking about types is as sets of values with that type, for example, Bool is the set {True, False, &amp;perp;} (remember that bottom, &amp;perp;, is a member of every type!), Integer is the set of integers (and bottom), String is the set of all possible strings (and bottom), and so on. &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; serves as an intersection over those sets. For example, &lt;code&gt;forall a. a&lt;/code&gt; is the intersection over all types, which must be {&amp;perp;}, that is, the type (i.e. set) whose only value (i.e. element) is bottom. Why? Think about it: how many of the elements of Bool appear in, for example, String? Bottom is the only value common to all types.

A few more examples:

# &lt;code&gt;[forall a. a]&lt;/code&gt; is the type of a list whose elements all have the type &lt;code&gt;forall a. a&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. a list of bottoms.
# &lt;code&gt;[forall a. Show a =&gt; a]&lt;/code&gt; is the type of a list whose elements all have the type &lt;code&gt;forall a. Show a =&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. The Show class constraint limits the sets you intersect over (here we're only intersecting over instances of Show), but &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; is still the only value common to all these types, so this too is a list of bottoms.
# &lt;code&gt;[forall a. Num a =&gt; a]&lt;/code&gt;. Again, the list where each element is a member of all types that instantiate Num. This could involve numeric literals, which have the type &lt;code&gt;forall a. Num a =&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;, as well as bottom.
# &lt;code&gt;forall a. [a]&lt;/code&gt; is the type of the list whose elements have some (the same) type a, which can be assumed to be any type at all by a callee (and therefore this too is a list of bottoms).

We see that most intersections over types just lead to combinations of bottoms in some ways, because types don't have a lot of values in common. 

Recall that in the last section, we developed a heterogeneous list using a 'type hider'. Ideally, we'd like the type of a heterogeneous list to be &lt;code&gt;[exists a. a]&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. the list where all elements have type &lt;code&gt;exists a. a&lt;/code&gt;. This '&lt;code&gt;exists&lt;/code&gt;' keyword (which isn't present in Haskell) is, as you may guess, a ''union'' of types, so that &lt;code&gt;[exists a. a]&lt;/code&gt; is the type of a list where all elements could take any type at all (and the types of different elements needn't be the same).

But we got almost the same behaviour above using datatypes. Let's declare one.

{{HaskellExample|An existential datatype|&lt;pre&gt;
 data T = forall a. MkT a
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

This means that:

{{HaskellExample|The type of our existential constructor|
 MkT :: forall a. a -&gt; T
}}

So we can pass any type we want to &lt;code&gt;MkT&lt;/code&gt; and it'll convert it into a T. So what happens when we deconstruct a &lt;code&gt;MkT&lt;/code&gt; value?

{{HaskellExample|Pattern matching on our existential constructor|&lt;pre&gt;
 foo (MkT x) = ... -- what is the type of x?
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

As we've just stated, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; could be of any type. That means it's a member of some arbitrary type, so has the type &lt;code&gt;x :: exists a. a&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, our declaration for T is isomorphic to the following one:

{{HaskellExample|An equivalent version of our existential datatype (pseudo-Haskell)|&lt;pre&gt;
 data T = MkT (exists a. a)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

And suddenly we have existential types. Now we can make a heterogeneous list:

{{HaskellExample|Constructing the hetereogeneous list|&lt;pre&gt;
 heteroList = [MkT 5, MkT (), MkT True, MkT map]
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

Of course, when we pattern match on &lt;code&gt;heteroList&lt;/code&gt; we can't do anything with its elements&lt;ref&gt;Actually, we can apply them to functions whose type is &lt;code&gt;forall a. a -&gt; ''R''&lt;/code&gt;, for some arbitrary &lt;code&gt;''R''&lt;/code&gt;, as these accept values of any type as a parameter. Examples of such functions: &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;const k&lt;/code&gt; for any &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;. So technically, we can't do anything ''useful'' with its elements, except reduce them to WHNF.&lt;/ref&gt;, as all we know is that they have some arbitrary type. However, if we are to introduce class constraints:

{{HaskellExample|A new existential datatype, with a class constraint|&lt;pre&gt;
 data T' = forall a. Show a =&gt; MkT' a
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

Which is isomorphic to:

{{HaskellExample|The new datatype, translated into 'true' existential types|&lt;pre&gt;
 data T' = MkT' (exists a. Show a =&gt; a)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

Again the class constraint serves to limit the types we're unioning over, so that now we know the values inside a &lt;code&gt;MkT'&lt;/code&gt; are elements of some arbitrary type ''which instantiates Show''. The implication of this is that we can apply &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to a value of type &lt;code&gt;exists a. Show a =&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn't matter exactly which type it turns out to be.

{{HaskellExample|Using our new heterogenous setup|&lt;pre&gt;
 heteroList' = [MkT' 5, MkT' (), MkT' True, MkT' &quot;Sartre&quot;]
 main = mapM_ (\(MkT' x) -&gt; print x) heteroList'

 {- prints:
 5
 ()
 True
 &quot;Sartre&quot;
 -}
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

To summarise, the interaction of the universal quantifier with datatypes produces existential types. As most interesting applications of &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt;-involving types use this interaction, we label such types 'existential'. Whenever you want existential types, you must wrap them up in a datatype constructor, they can't exist &quot;out in the open&quot; like with &lt;code&gt;[exists a. a]&lt;/code&gt;.

== Example: &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt; ==
One monad that you may not have come across so far is the ST monad. This is essentially the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; monad on steroids: it has a much more complicated structure and involves some more advanced topics. It was originally written to provide Haskell with IO. As we mentioned in the [[../Understanding monads/]] chapter, IO is basically just a State monad with an environment of all the information about the real world. In fact, inside GHC at least, ST is used, and the environment is a type called &lt;code&gt;RealWorld&lt;/code&gt;.

To get out of the State monad, you can use &lt;code&gt;runState&lt;/code&gt;. The analogous function for ST is called &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt;, and it has a rather particular type:

{{HaskellExample|The &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt; function|
 runST :: forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -&gt; a
}}

This is actually an example of a more complicated language feature called rank-2 polymorphism, which we don't go into in detail here. It's important to notice that there is no parameter for the initial state. Indeed, ST uses a different notion of state to State; while State allows you to &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; the current state, ST provides an interface to ''references''. You create references, which have type &lt;code&gt;STRef&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;newSTRef :: a -&gt; ST s (STRef s a)&lt;/code&gt;, providing an initial value, then you can use &lt;code&gt;readSTRef :: STRef s a -&gt; ST s a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;writeSTRef :: STRef s a -&gt; a -&gt; ST s ()&lt;/code&gt; to manipulate them. As such, the internal environment of a ST computation is not one specific value, but a mapping from references to values. Therefore, you don't need to provide an initial state to runST, as the initial state is just the empty mapping containing no references.

However, things aren't quite as simple as this. What stops you creating a reference in one ST computation, then using it in another? We don't want to allow this because (for reasons of thread-safety) no ST computation should be allowed to assume that the initial internal environment contains any specific references. More concretely, we want the following code to be invalid:

{{HaskellExample|Bad ST code|&lt;pre&gt;
 let v = runST (newSTRef True)
 in runST (readSTRef v)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

What would prevent this? The effect of the rank-2 polymorphism in &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt;'s type is to ''constrain the scope of the type variable &lt;code&gt;s&lt;code&gt;'' to be within the first parameter. In other words, if the type variable &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; appears in the first parameter it cannot also appear in the second. Let's take a look at how exactly this is done. Say we have some code like the following:

{{HaskellExample|Briefer bad ST code|
 ... runST (newSTRef True) ...
}}

The compiler tries to fit the types together:

{{HaskellExample|The compiler's typechecking stage|
 newSTRef True :: forall s. ST s (STRef s Bool)
 runST :: forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -&gt; a
 together, forall a. (forall s. ST s (STRef s Bool)) -&gt; STRef s Bool
}}

The importance of the &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; in the first bracket is that we can change the name of the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. That is, we could write:

{{HaskellExample|A type mismatch!|
 together, forall a. (forall s'. ST s' (STRef s' Bool)) -&gt; STRef s Bool
}}

This makes sense: in mathematics, saying &lt;math&gt;\forall x. x &gt; 5&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the same as saying &lt;math&gt;\forall y. y &gt; 5&lt;/math&gt;; you're just giving the variable a different label. However, we have a problem with our above code. Notice that as the &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; does ''not'' scope over the return type of &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt;, we don't rename the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; there as well. But suddenly, we've got a type mismatch! The result type of the ST computation in the first parameter must match the result type of &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt;, but now it doesn't!

The key feature of the existential is that it allows the compiler to generalise the type of the state in the first parameter, and so the result type cannot depend on it. This neatly sidesteps our dependence problems, and 'compartmentalises' each call to &lt;code&gt;runST&lt;/code&gt; into its own little heap, with references not being able to be shared between different calls.

== Quantification as a primitive ==
Universal quantification is useful for defining data types that aren't already defined.
Suppose there was no such thing as pairs built into haskell.
Quantification could be used to define them.
 newtype Pair a b=Pair (forall c.(a-&gt;b-&gt;c)-&gt;c)

== Existential/Universal ==

We ought to do more to clarify the difference between a universal type and an existential type.  The fact that we use &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; to express existential types is super-confusing, and so a few gentle words about that would be quite useful. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:23, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

I still can't understand the difference between the standard version of existential datatype wrapper:
   &lt;code&gt;data Opaque = forall a. O a &lt;/code&gt;

and this version with the forall inside:
   &lt;code&gt; data Opaque = O (forall a. a) &lt;/code&gt;

Is the second version non existential, but isomorphic to a rank-2 universally quantified type instead?  

That is my guess. With this in mind, terms of the datatype:
  &lt;code&gt; data Test = Test (forall a . [a -&gt; a]) &lt;/code&gt;
would contain only lists of functions that are fully parametric in a, like the id function

Whereas terms of the datatype:
  &lt;code&gt;data Test = forall a . Test [a -&gt; a]&lt;/code&gt;
would contain heterogeneous lists of functions that folllow the regular type scheme:
&lt;code&gt;forall a . a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;

Is that by any chance right? --[[User:Pepe|Pepe]] 17:22, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

== Superfluous Stuff == 

This code in the middle section...
&lt;code&gt;
 main = mapM_ print hetroList

 print :: Show s =&gt; s -&gt; IO () -- print x = putStrLn (show x)
 mapM_ :: (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m ()
 mapM_ print :: Show s =&gt; [s] -&gt; IO ()
&lt;/code&gt;

...seems overly verbose and distracts from the main point.  It should be changed to...

&lt;code&gt;
 main = print hetroList
&lt;/code&gt;

== Heterogeneous list example doesn't work ==

Hi, i've tried to implement an heterogeneous list example: (as in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell/Existentially_quantified_types&amp;oldid=787859 that version of the page])

 instance Show ShowH where
  show (SH s) = show s
 

The problem is that GHC complains that it doesn't know if the 2nd &quot;show&quot; on the line is the one of Prelude or the one of SH. I've fixed the problem by using a function with another name for SH, but is there a more elegant solution ? [[User:Gh|Gh]] 22:49, 24 March 2007 (UTC)


You just need to indent the second line properly.

== Attribute lists (wxhaskell) ==

I thought I should note down the [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1017472.1017483 wxHaskell article] as a potentially good example for using existential types (for lists of attributes, section 6.2) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] ([[User talk:Kowey|talk]]) 15:05, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

== Makes no sense / is pointless! ==

The example shows something, that exists, but in reality, I've yet to see a ''keyword'' “forall”, because that what is explained works without any such keyword:&lt;br/&gt;
Or in other words: '''It is not shown to be any difference between…'''
 map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
'''and'''
 map :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
'''.''' What’s the point of that keyword? That most important part is completely missing.&lt;br/&gt;
People who did never use Haskell might think, that it does something different. But as all the examples show something that works just like that without the forall keyword (first line above), what would that be? Fancy words like it being &quot;universally quantified&quot; don't mean anything, because from what we are shown, and what is explained everywhere in standard Haskell tutorials and books, the version without the forall does exactly that. So it is not showing any point of the forall keyword.

The whole article needs a major overhaul. It missed the only point of its existence completely. My guess is, that the writer did not understand normal polymorphism in the first place.

:The versions with and without forall do indeed mean the same. However, the latter is best thought of as an abbreviation of the former. More details in [[Haskell/Polymorphism]] (unfinished).
:I agree that the chapter on existentially quantified types needs an overhaul. In particular, I intend the beginning of [[Haskell/Polymorphism]] to serve as prerequisite.

==[[WB:NP|Naming convention]] and some comments==
Book pages should be titled &quot;Book Title/Chapter Title&quot; and Wikiversity course pages should be titled &quot;Wikiversity:School of.../Course Title.&quot; See [[WB:NP]] for more. If you [[Special:Userlogin|sign up for a free account]], you will be able to rename pages via a &quot;move&quot; link at the top of each page. Also note that textbooks are part of Wikibooks' domain, not Wikiversity's. Your page titles seem to indicate that you are writing chapters of a textbook, rather than Wikiversity courses. If that's the case, I suggest that you start a textbook after reading [[WB:NEW]]. One final suggestion I have is that you link to pages that are not chapters of a book to Wikipedia. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Propeller|Propeller]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives [[w:Propeller|Propeller]], for example. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on this page. Good luck on your project, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 18:11, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[w:Heinrich Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] showed that in an infinite and uniform universe the sky at night would be exceedingly bright, whereas we know perfectly well that this is not the case.

Thanks to [[Wikibooks]] and the [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/About_Wikimedia Wikimedia] foundation. The whole idea of having a book on orthopaedic surgery was possible due to the ideas espoused by the founder of [[Wikipedia]], [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees#Jimmy_.28Jimbo.29_Wales Jimmy Wales]. But the whole project would not have been possibe without the help of the software, [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki Mediawiki] developed by a German student, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Magnus_Manske Magnus Manske]. Thanks to all these bunch of ''nice'' guys for providing us the platform to build this book on.&lt;/br&gt;

Contributions to Wikibooks, and this module, [[Orthopaedic Surgery]] in particular come from several volunteers who have directed their efforts at providing content to the rest of us. With the numerous edits and revisions that many other volunteers have made the contents of this textbook has made sense and been useful to everyone else. Many of the ideas regarding structure and content placement have been borrowed form other modules in wikibooks. Without the [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|community]] this book would not have been possible and we will always remain grateful to them. We have made a modest attempt to list the contributors of this book in the [[Orthopaedic Surgery/Authors|Authors]] page.&lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most word processors will automatically generate a table of contents.

A table of contents should be one or two pages. Readers should be able to glance through it and see what the book is about. If your table of contents is too short, increase the number of levels. If it's too long, reduce the number of levels. You can put a ''detailed table of contents'' after the primary table of contents if necessary. The detailed table of contents can be as long as you wish.

==Chapter Summaries==

A table of contents should include a one- or two-line chapter summary after each chapter title. The summary makes readers want to read the chapter (like the title and subtitle of the book). E.g.,

:Chapter 3: The Announcement………..…....……36
:Brad and Carol always wanted kittens—but ''for lunch''?

Microsoft Word can't do chapter summaries automatically. You'll have to run your table of contents, and then type in each chapter summary. This is tedious, if you have to run your table of contents several times (e.g., you add or move a chapter).

Before sending your book to the printer, check the table of contents page numbers. Nothing makes a book look more amateurish than a table of contents that doesn't match the page numbers. E.g., Chapter Three is supposed to start on page 36, but actually starts on page 37.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Elementary Haskell}}

In the previous modules, we introduced and made occasional reference to pattern matching. Now that we have developed some familiarity with the language, it is time to take a proper, deeper look. We will kick-start the discussion with a condensed description, which we will expanded upon throughout the chapter:

''In pattern matching, we attempt to '''match''' values against '''patterns''' and, if so desired, '''bind''' variables to successful matches''.

{{body note|1=
'' '''Pattern matching on what?''' ''

Some languages like Perl and Python use the term ''pattern matching'' for matching regular expressions against strings. The pattern matching we referg to in Haskell is something completely different. In fact, you're probably best off forgetting what you know about pattern matching for now.&lt;ref&gt;If you came here looking for regex pattern matching, you might be interested in looking at the Haskell {{Haskell lib|package=regex-compat|v=0.95.1|Text|Regex}} library wrapper.&lt;/ref&gt; Haskell pattern matching is used in the same way as in other ML-like languages: to deconstruct values according to their type specification.
}}


== Analysing pattern matching ==
Pattern matching is virtually everywhere. For example, consider this definition of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

At surface level, there are four different patterns involved, two per equation.

* &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a pattern which matches ''anything at all'', and binds the &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; variable to whatever is matched.
* &lt;code&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/code&gt; is a pattern that matches a ''non-empty list'' which is formed by something (which gets bound to the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; variable) which was cons'd (by the &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; function) onto something else (which gets bound to &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;).
* &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is a pattern that matches ''the empty list''. It doesn't bind any variables.
* &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is the pattern which matches anything at all, but doesn't do any binding.

In the &lt;code&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/code&gt; pattern, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; can be seen as sub-patterns used to match the parts of the list. Just like &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, they match anything - though it is evident that if there is a successful match and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; has type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; will have type &lt;code&gt;[a]&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, these considerations imply that &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; will also match an empty list, and so a one-element list matches &lt;code&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/code&gt;.

From the above dissection, we can say pattern matching gives us a way to:

* ''recognize values''. For instance, when &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is called and the second argument matches &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; the first equation for &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is used instead of the second one.
* ''bind variables'' to the recognized values. In this case, the variables &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt; are assigned to the values passed as arguments to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; when the second equation is used, and so we can use these values through the variables in the right-hand side of &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. As &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; show, binding is not an essential part of pattern matching, but just a side effect of using variable names as patterns.
* ''break down values into parts'', as the &lt;code&gt;(x:xs)&lt;/code&gt; pattern does by binding two variables to parts (head and tail) of a matched argument (the non-empty list).

==The connection with constructors==

Despite the detailed analysis above, it may seem a little too magical how we break down a list as if we were undoing the effects of the &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; operator. Be careful: this process will not work with any arbitrary operator. For example, one might think of defining a function which uses &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; to chop off the first three elements of a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
dropThree ([x,y,z] ++ xs) = xs
&lt;/source&gt;

But that ''will not work''. The function &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt; is not allowed in patterns. In fact, most other functions that act on lists are similarly prohibited from pattern matching. Which functions, then, ''are'' allowed?

In one word, ''constructors'' – the functions used to build values of algebraic data types. Let us consider a random example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Foo = Bar | Baz Int
&lt;/source&gt;

Here &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Baz&lt;/code&gt; are constructors for the type &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. You ''can'' use them for pattern matching &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; values and bind variables to the &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; value contained in a &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; constructed with &lt;code&gt;Baz&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f :: Foo -&gt; Int
f Bar     = 1
f (Baz x) = x - 1
&lt;/source&gt;

This is exactly like &lt;code&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;showDate&lt;/code&gt; in the Type declarations module. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Date = Date Int Int Int   -- Year, Month, Day
showDate :: Date -&gt; String
showDate (Date y m d) = show y ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show m ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show d
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;(Date y m d)&lt;/code&gt; pattern in the left-hand side of the &lt;code&gt;showDate&lt;/code&gt; definition matches a &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; (built with the &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; constructor) and binds the variables &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; to the contents of the &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; value.

===Why does it work with lists?===

As for lists, they are no different from &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;-defined algebraic data types as far as pattern matching is concerned. It works as if lists were defined with this &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; declaration (note that the following isn't actually valid syntax: lists are actually too deeply ingrained into Haskell to be defined like this):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data [a] = [] | a : [a]
&lt;/source&gt;

So the empty list, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; function are constructors of the list datatype, and so you can pattern match with them. &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; takes no arguments, and therefore no variables can be bound when it is used for pattern matching. &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments, the list head and tail, which may then have variables bound to them when the pattern is recognized. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; :t []
[] :: [a]
Prelude&gt; :t (:)
(:) :: a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Furthermore, since &lt;code&gt;[x, y, z]&lt;/code&gt; is just syntactic sugar for &lt;code&gt;x:y:z:[]&lt;/code&gt;, we can achieve something like &lt;code&gt;dropThree&lt;/code&gt; using pattern matching alone:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
dropThree :: [a] -&gt; [a]
dropThree (_:_:_:xs) = xs
dropThree _          = []
&lt;/source&gt;

The first pattern will match any list with at least three elements. The catch-all second definition provides a reasonable default&lt;ref&gt;Reasonable ''for this particular task'', and only because it makes sense to expect that &lt;code&gt;dropThree&lt;/code&gt; will give &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; when applied to a list of, say, two elements. With a different problem, it might not be reasonable to return ''any'' list if the first match failed. In a later chapter, we will consider one simple way of dealing with such cases.&lt;/ref&gt; when lists fail to match the main pattern, and thus prevents runtime crashes due to pattern match failure.

{{body note|
From the fact that we ''could'' write a &lt;code&gt;dropThree&lt;/code&gt; function with bare pattern matching it doesn't follow that we ''should'' do so! Even though the solution is simple, it is still a waste of effort to code something this specific when we could just use Prelude and settle it with &lt;code&gt;drop 3 xs&lt;/code&gt; instead. Mirroring what was said before about baking bare recursive functions, we might say: ''don't get too excited about pattern matching either...''
}}   

=== Tuple constructors ===

Analogous considerations are valid for tuples. Our access to their components via pattern matching...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fstPlusSnd :: (Num a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; a
fstPlusSnd (x, y) = x + y

norm3D :: (Floating a) =&gt; (a, a, a) -&gt; a
norm3D (x, y, z) = sqrt (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
&lt;/source&gt;

... is granted by the existence of tuple constructors. For pairs, the constructor is the comma operator, &lt;code&gt;(,)&lt;/code&gt;; for larger tuples there are &lt;code&gt;(,,)&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;(,,,)&lt;/code&gt; and so on. These operators are slightly unusual in that we can't use them infix in the regular way; so &lt;code&gt;5 , 3&lt;/code&gt; is not a valid way to write &lt;code&gt;(5, 3)&lt;/code&gt;. All of them, however, can be used prefix, which is occasionally useful.

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; (,) 5 3
(5,3)
Prelude&gt; (,,,) &quot;George&quot; &quot;John&quot; &quot;Paul&quot; &quot;Ringo&quot;
(&quot;George&quot;,&quot;John&quot;,&quot;Paul&quot;,&quot;Ringo&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Matching literal values ==

As discussed earlier in the book, a simple piece-wise function definition like this one

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f :: Int -&gt; Int
f 0 = 1
f 1 = 5
f 2 = 2
f _ = -1
&lt;/source&gt;

is performing pattern matching as well, matching the argument of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; literals 0, 1 and 2, and finally with &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; . In general, numeric and character literals can be used in pattern matching on their own&lt;ref&gt;As perhaps could be expected, this kind of matching with literals is not constructor-based. Rather, there is an equality comparison behind the scenes&lt;/ref&gt; as well as together with constructor patterns. For instance, this function

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
g :: [Int] -&gt; Bool
g (0:[]) = False
g (0:xs) = True
g _ = False
&lt;/source&gt;

will evaluate to False for the [0] list, to True if the list has 0 as first element and a non-empty tail and to False in all other cases. Also, lists with literal elements like [1,2,3], or even &quot;abc&quot; (which is equivalent to ['a','b','c']) can be used for pattern matching as well, since these forms are only syntactic sugar for the (:) constructor. 

The above considerations are only valid for literal values, so the following will '''not''' work:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
k = 1
--again, this won't work as expected
h :: Int -&gt; Bool
h k = True
h _ = False
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Exercises|1=
# Test the flawed &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; function above in GHCi, with arguments equal to and different from 1. Then, explain what goes wrong.
# In this section about pattern matching with literal values, we made no mention of the boolean values &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, but we can do pattern matching with them as well, as demonstrated in the [[../Next steps#Introducing pattern matching|Next steps]] chapter. Can you guess why we omitted them? (Hint: is there anything distinctive about the way we write boolean values?)
}}


== Syntax tricks ==
=== As-patterns ===

Sometimes, when matching a pattern with a value, it may be useful to bind a name to the whole value being matched. As-patterns allow exactly this: they are of the form ''&lt;code&gt;var@pattern&lt;/code&gt;'' and have the additional effect to bind the name &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; to the whole value being matched by &lt;code&gt;pattern&lt;/code&gt;. For instance, here is a toy variation on the map theme:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
contrivedMap :: ([a] -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
contrivedMap f [] = []
contrivedMap f list@(x:xs) = f list x : contrivedMap f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;contrivedMap&lt;/code&gt; passes to the parameter function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; not only &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; but also the undivided list used as argument of each recursive call. Writing it without as-patterns would have been a bit clunky because we would have to needlessly ''reconstruct'' the original value of &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. actually evaluate &lt;code&gt;x:xs&lt;/code&gt; on the right side:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
contrivedMap :: ([a] -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
contrivedMap f [] = []
contrivedMap f (x:xs) = f (x:xs) x : contrivedMap f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Introduction to records ===

For constructors with many elements, ''records'' provide a way of naming values in a datatype using the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Foo2 = Bar2 | Baz2 {bazNumber::Int, bazName::String}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using records allows doing matching and binding only for the variables relevant to the function we're writing, making code much clearer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
h :: Foo2 -&gt; Int
h Baz2 {bazName=name} = length name
h Bar2 {} = 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, the &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; pattern can be used for matching a constructor regardless of the datatype elements even if you don't use records in the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; declaration:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Foo = Bar | Baz Int
g :: Foo -&gt; Bool
g Bar {} = True
g Baz {} = False
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; does not have to be changed if we modify the number or the type of elements of the constructors &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Baz&lt;/code&gt;.

There are further advantages to using record syntax which we will cover records in more detail in the [[../More on datatypes#Named Fields (Record Syntax)|Named fields]] section of the More on datatypes chapter.

== Where we can use pattern matching == 

The short answer is that ''wherever you can bind variables, you can pattern match''. Let us have a glance at such places we have seen before; a few more will be introduced in the following chapters.

=== Equations ===

The most obvious use case is the left-hand side of function definition equations, which were the subject of our examples so far.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

In the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; definition we're doing pattern matching on the left hand side of both equations, and also binding variables on the second one.

=== let expressions and where clauses ===
Both &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; are ways of doing local variable bindings. As such, you can also use pattern matching in them. A simple example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
y =
  let 
    (x:_) = map ((*) 2) [1,2,3]
  in x + 5
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, equivalently,

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
y = x + 5
  where 
  (x:_) = map ((*) 2) [1,2,3]
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; will be bound to the first element of &lt;code&gt;map ((*) 2) [1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, therefore, will evaluate to &lt;math&gt;2 + 5 = 7&lt;/math&gt;.

=== List comprehensions ===
After the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; in list comprehensions you can pattern match. This is actually extremely useful, and adds a lot to the expressiveness of comprehensions. Let's see how that works with a slightly more sophisticated example. Prelude provides a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; type which has the following constructors:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
&lt;/source&gt;

It is typically used to hold values resulting from an operation which may or may not succeed; if the operation succeeds, the &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; constructor is used and the value is passed to it; otherwise &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; is used.&lt;ref&gt;The canonical example of such an operation is looking up values in a ''dictionary'' - which might just be a &lt;code&gt;[(a, b)]&lt;/code&gt; list with the tuples being key-value pairs, or a more sophisticated implementation. In any case, if we, given an arbitrary key, try to retrieve a value there is no guarantee we will actually find a value associated to the key.&lt;/ref&gt; The utility function &lt;code&gt;catMaybes&lt;/code&gt; (which is available from Data.Maybe library module) takes a list of Maybes (which may contain both &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot; Maybes), and retrieves the contained values by filtering out the &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; values and getting rid of the &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; wrappers of the &lt;code&gt;Just x&lt;/code&gt;. Writing it with list comprehensions is very straightforward:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
catMaybes :: [Maybe a] -&gt; [a]
catMaybes ms = [ x | Just x &lt;- ms ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Another nice thing about using a list comprehension for this task is that if the pattern match fails (that is, it meets a Nothing) it just moves on to the next element in &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;, thus avoiding the need of explicitly handling constructors we are not interested in with alternate function definitions.&lt;ref&gt;The reason why it works this way instead of crashing out on a pattern matching failure has to do with the real nature of list comprehensions: They are actually wrappers for the list monad. We will eventually explain what that means when we discuss monads.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== do blocks ===

Within a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block like the ones we used in the [[../Simple input and output|Simple input and output]] chapter, we can pattern match with the left-hand side of the left arrow variable bindings:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
putFirstChar = do
    (c:_) &lt;- getLine
    putStrLn [c]
&lt;/source&gt;

Furthermore, the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks are, as far as pattern matching is concerned, just the same as the &quot;real&quot; let expressions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Practical_Electronics/555|555 timer IC]] provides a very versatile, effective, and easy-to-use astable mode. By changing component values, one can get frequencies from a maximum of about 300KHz to as low as limited by the leakage of the capacitors used in the circuit. It can also have the mark-space ratio altered almost limitlessly.

==Basic Circuit==

The basic 555 astable circuit is set up like this.

[[image:555 Astable Diagram.svg|300px|center]]

*At higher frequencies and loads, it is advisable to put a 100nF capacitor between Pin 5 and 0V.

The frequency and mark-space ratio are defined by the values of R1, R2 and C1 only. For a roughly even (1:1) mark-spce ratio, R1 is usually set at 1K, and the other resistor (R2) and capacitor are changed to alter the frequency. If better control over the mark-space ratio is required, use the next circuit.

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + 2R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 \times \left( R_1 + R_2 \right) \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Variable duty cycle==

This variation allow much easier control of the duty cycle without too much impact on the frequency. The only difference is a diode between Pins 6 and 7, with the cathode at Pin 6. The effect of this is to [[Practical_Electronics/Glossary#S|shunt]] resistor R2 when charging C1. This means that C1 charges though R1 only. This removes R2 from the &quot;high-time&quot; equation, and make calculating the duty cycle easier and prevents the frequency from being altered excessively by changes in the duty cycle ( although this still happens to a certain extent).

[[Image:555 Mk-sp Diagram.svg|300px|center]] 

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::''This is different to the [[#Design equations|design equation]] for the standard 555 Astable. (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of 2R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 \times R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mark-space ratio}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Mini-astable==

This astable uses fewer components than the basic astable, and requires only the IC, one resistor and one capacitor, plus the Pin 5 capacitor for final versions.

[[Image:555 Mini Astable Diagram.svg|300px|center]]

This astable has a MSR of approximately 1:1, but this tends to increase under heavy current load, as the output does not swing fully to the power supply. This astable is not a reliable source of frequency, and should never be used where an accurate, stable clock is needed.

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{0.72}{R_1\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

==Pin 4 Enable==
Pin 4 is normally held high, and in this state it does nothing. However, when Pin 4 is brought low, the 555 is disabled, and the output is held low. This can be used to turn an astable on when desired. An example of this is the [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/Double Astable|double-astable bleeper]], which uses the output from one astable to enable another, faster astable.

Pin 8 should '''not''' be used as the enable pin, as this will draw all the current needed to run the device from the triggering circuit.

==Other astable circuits==

*[[Practical_Electronics/Frequency Modulation/555|Frequency Modulation]]
*[[Practical_Electronics/Astable/Diminishing Frequency|Diminishing Frequency]]

==Units of Design Equations==

The units that the components values and frequency are measure in are the standard base units: ohms, farads and hertz. This are often inconvenient, as the value for componets are usually several orders of magnitude away from the base unit. It is possible to use more conveninet units to calculate the frequency, and the common combinations are given below:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Resistance!!Capacitance!!Period!!Frequency
|-
|&amp;Omega;||F||s||Hz
|-
|M&amp;Omega;||&amp;mu;F||s||Hz
|-
|k&amp;Omega;||&amp;mu;F||ms||kHz
|}

I went ahead and deleted the module, because the deletion had not been contested since 31 May 2006.

I should mention that Wikibooks is a reference-textbooks development site, and things like reviews of TV shows (which show is good or bad) break our [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy.

You are still welcome to participate in Wikibooks. I suggest that you find an existing textbook to work on, instead of starting a new one: there are many books here that might need your help! Maybe the [[Wikibooks:Language and literature bookshelf]] might give you some ideas. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think unicycling could become an Olympic competition soon, both as racing and rink categories.

Who has ever seen an ice-unicycling performance? I haven't, but I suppose it could be quite creative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reading this as a Biology major I am wondering why a picture of a punnett's square isn't present. Another problem is that the letters T and t might be better choices than S and s.  I might just decide to change it but wanted some feedback.

Agreed, I was wondering the same thing.  Also there seems to be some confusion - the upper and lower case letters are chosen before the explanation of one being dominant - it's almost as if it's just luck that S is chosen for tall  and tall is also dominant.  Needs clarifying I think.  I may change it myself.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Textbooks that never say how to do anything ==

I have never quite understood the movement on this wiki to delete all how-tos or move them to another wiki. Does it mean that how-tos and textbooks are always distinct, and ''no textbook can describe how to do anything''? I started thinking about calculus books that do not say how to differentiate, programming-languages books that do not say how to program loops, introductory chemistry books that do not explain how to cancel units in calculations, and exam preparation books that do not suggest how to pass the exam. So I thought that my guess was unlikely to be the correct interpretation.

Now I understand that not everyone here dislikes how-to books. Some only want to target the worst books (how to cheat, misbehave, act criminally, be unproductive...). However, some want users seem to be against all how-to books, and this proposed policy was apparently intended to mitigate their concerns.

Perhaps what I should ask first: what distinguishes a how-to textbook from other textbooks? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

:Due to the simply overwhelming activity on this policy guideline and huge number of comments on this talk page, as well as comments about it on the Staff Lounge, I can tell there is a huge movement to really address the concerns of how-to books in general :)

:I agree that the &quot;How to become a klan member&quot; and &quot;How to rape&quot; are things that we perhaps want to avoid here on Wikibooks, but that doesn't seem to be the case with those that want to delete this kind of content.  I would also agree here that there really isn't that huge of a distinction about how-to books and textbooks, and you can find commonly accepted defintions of a textbook that would cover how-to books as well.  Furthermore, I'm still not convinced that Wikibooks should be about only textbooks.  This goes back to the &quot;Wikibooks is about any non-fiction book you can find in a bookstore&quot;.  I have yet to see a clear type of book that can be found in the non-fiction section of a bookstore that would not be on Wikibooks, other than for copyright reasons alone.  I would challenge that game walk-throughs in the incarnation that were the worst offenders would not have been in the non-fiction section of a bookstore either.   --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

==Worksheet==

Is anyone watching here? I've been working on a rewrite, if anyone would like to comment ([[User:SBJohnny/howto guidelines worksheet|here]]). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
:Frankly, I don't see any real effort or even concern that How-to book have been doing lately, and I created this page mainly as a political statement to prove that it wasn't really a problem.  I asssert that there are a couple of individuals who are trying to force a content move of how-to books to Wikia and other non-Wikimedia websites under the guise of it being a requirement by Jimbo.  He (Jimbo) has not required this to happen, nor are How-to guides really a violation of the Wikibooks charter or even against any enumerated policies on this project.
:This is more a move on the part of textbook purists, who I have openly defied and fought claiming that Wikibooks is more than just textbooks.  While textbooks certainly are an important part of the Wikibooks mission, How-to books clearly can and should be a part of this project as well unless they become so numerous and productive that they deserve to be on their own independent project.  And that is indeed a major policy change, and not something to be done on the whim of a few admins gone wild.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:: Out of curiosity, which individuals are you referring to? I can't think of anyone who's done what you have described. The Wikibooks community is only about 10 people, so it would help to know who you are referring to. Thanks, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
:::My concern is mainly the group that is strongly pushing the [[wikia:howto|Wikia How-to project]].  It started out originally as a project suggestion on Meta and grew into an alternative Wikicity (now Wikia) project.  I have long asserted that the participants there were delibertately trying to move all of the How-to content from Wikibooks to their project, indeed in a fashion very similar to how the Strategy Wiki has captured Wikibooks content.  Mind you, I'm not opposed to moving content to alternative sites when it is being deleted here with a rational discussion, but I object to people trying to take Wikibooks content as a seed to a new project, leaving behind big links as advertising to that project behind.  I also suspect, particularly with the How-to project, of there being project participants there that are trying to specifically make policies on Wikibooks to promote their project, and delete the content here on Wikibooks specifically to make their project look like a Wikibooks sister project.
:::I will say, however, that the distinction between Wikia and the Wikimedia Foundation is blurred and often many participants don't understand that this is two very different and distinct organizations.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:19, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
::::Huh, hadn't thought of that, though conspiracies do happen. There is also a com-wiki called wikihow, which I have seen linking on wikipedia where links to how-to class wikibooks are found. For details, see discussion on Wikipedia (spam project) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam/2006_Archive_Jul#.22wikihow.22 ]. I'll start watching (on WP) for this sort of thing with wikia as well if you think this is really what's going on. [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:22, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

:::: Yes, I completely agree with you, Robert. Howto books are perfectly fine under existing policy and are acceptable by Jimbo, as you have stated. But I can't recall anyone advocating what you have described here on Wikibooks. Has it only occured on the Wikia? Could you please link to a discussion on this (here or on the Wikia)?
:::: Secondly, you have already stated this but I think it bears repeating to make sure we're on the same page. There are a few pages here that do not comply with our existing community agreed-upon policies. If possible, that content should be adapted in order to be acceptable. Sometimes these pages cannot be changed to become acceptable. If something falls into this category, it must be deleted from Wikibooks if we are to enforce policies that have the word &quot;enforced&quot; in bold type at the top and have been accepted by the community. (Again, nearly everything including howto books does not fall into this category.) The existance of any other projects is irrelevant. In order for the content itself to still be usable, we should add it to an alternate location where it ''is'' acceptable. Some pages ([[How To Build A Pykrete Bong]] for example) had some good material but were simply deleted without any attempts to find a suitable alternate location for the content. Why just delete valuable content? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 19:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

{{EM_Editors}}  [[KW]]

There are three levels of participation in OCTEM, the WikiBook of Emergency Medicine.
* Readers - those who use the pages of OCTEM by browsing links or jumping into the middle of the pages by a Google search or bookmark or using Wiki tools to search for particular content.
* Writers  - those who contribute by editing the content of OCTEM.
* Editors - those who (later) monitor and certify the correctness and accuracy of edits to the content of OCTEM.

=Readers=
Readers use simple browsing skills and a few Wikibook tricks and tools to find what they need to support the practice of emergency medicine. The reader must beware and ultimately take responsibility to understand OCTEM - just as he/she must understand how to use any source from the PDR to textbooks to publications.

=Writers=
The WIki process allows for anyone to add to and edit the content of the Wiki Stuff. OCTEM in this early phase allows any user to edit the content of any page/article. It tracks all changes. THrought WatchLists, it allows potential editors to monitor changes in content and to roll back erroneous or malicious or inappropriate changes to any article.

All readers have access to all past versions of each article by way of the history tab above the article, although this can be laborious. All changes are retained by the Wiki system software.

=Editors=
This is a planned role, not physically implemented yet. For now, I suggest that each user interested in taking credit for an article, add your user name as and editor as a link to your User Page. You should fill in your User Page abou yourself. Add it to your WatchList as well and figure out how this works. See [[EM_X_EditorWatchList|Using WikiBook WatchLists in OCTEM]].

Editors should be active in Talk pages regarding an article, especially when you intervene with negative feedback - correcting or removing undesirable content.

Others may certainly contribute to an article, but the idea of an editor is to monitor and try to maintain a certain level of reliability to the OCTEM content. Editors should be very familiar with the topic covered to be able to quickly judge the accuracy of added content.

Ultimately, I anticipate a software-supported mechanism to control the presented content by the editors. I see it as a simple extension of the Wiki Software whereby an approval step occurs between &quot;save this Page&quot; and its update on the Web version. This is currently instantaneous. It would not be hard, from a software persspective, to add a step where the editors approve or veto or modify the changes online.
An improved user-identification for editor-users would certify the identity and credentials of the editor users.

Is this really an assembly language, considering that it is portable and interpreted? &quot;assembly&quot; implies that the language is &quot;assembled&quot; directly into machine code, rather than being interpreted by a compiler.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an Existential Clause?==

An existential clause is one using the verb to declare the existence or place (or movement to or from a place) of some SUBJECT not previously spoken about.  So it would be impossible to use a pronoun in an existential clause because pronouns require that we know what the noun is.


==Format of an Existential Clause==

Existential clauses always begin with the declaration of place, followed by the verb (usually OLLA but not necessarily).


So typically the format is  
*ADVERB VERB SUBJECT
*'''MISSÄ ON MIKÄ''' (or '''MITÄ''')   
::''At some place'' IS ''something''

Note: There is never an object in an existential statement.

==Learning examples==

'''Pihalla on kaksi polkupyörää'''
:Literally ''On the yard there is two bikes''  
:Standard English ''There are a couple of bikes in the yard''

Equally the existential sentence can be negative in meaning, in which case the verb is negative

'''Asunnossamme ei ole saunaa'''
: Literally ''In our apartment not is sauna'' 
: Standard English ''There is no sauna in our apartment''

And the verb does not have to be OLLA

'''Kouluun tulee pari vierailijaa'''
: Literally ''To the school comes two visitors''
: Standard English ''There are two visitors coming the school''



==Some Important Things to Note==

Despite the similarity to English, there are several strong difference here.

1. '''The strong preference in English for SUBJECT to come before the VERB means that English puts the adverbial aspect at the end, whereas Finnish ALWAYS puts the adverbial place first when the sentence is introducing a new subject in an existential clause. So although Finnish is often more relaxed than English about word order, the existential clause word order is always ADVERB-VERB-SUBJECT. 

2. '''English moves the verb according to the subject (IS or THERE ARE according to number). Finnish existential sentences the verb is ALWAYS IN THE THIRD PERSON SINGULAR even when there is more than one SUBJECT.''' 

:Hence the use of the verbs form ''ON'' and TULEE not '''OVAT''' and '''TULEVAT''' in the examples above.

*IGRT is a step forward of IMRT in which various biological and anatomical imaging techniques are integrated into the radiation therapy process. The overall goal of IGRT is to target tumors more accurately while better sparing the normal tissues. The definition of target volume is undergoing a change on account of advancements in imaging modalities.

I really think that the tips should be referred to by the names of their corresponding postulates/definitions. For example, instead of saying &quot;when parallel lines are cut by a transversal corresponding angles are congruent,&quot; I think it should read &quot;Corresponding Angles Postulate,&quot; with a link to wherever that postulate is explained.[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 12:10, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Pictures from Space==

I'm not too keen on those rather dull pictures taken from space. Should we remove them? [[User:Hauskalainen|Hauskalainen]] 12:11, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
: I agree --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|talk]]) 14:27, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

==Organisation==
I really have a headache reading this book, and I have a good tolerance for disorganisation and weird colour choices. Perhaps choose a more basic and easier read colour like, I don't know, maybe '''black?'''. Green just is annoying. And why can't you design a cover to cover instruction book, then include grammar references? Is it really necessary to have 3 different books and projects of Finnish giving the same thing? This book needs massive reorganisation I think. Maybe you can use some of my books as examples ([[Chechen]], [[Manx]], or [[Icelandic]])? Or even the [[Latin]], [[French]], or [[Spanish]] books here. It is a shame because Finnish is a great language to learn and growing popularity. I'd adjust it accordingly myself but I don't speak enough Finnish yet nor do I have the time to take on another project. --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|talk]]) 14:27, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

OK. Now it's all black (which truelly is easier to read). I hope I didn't step on anyones toes by deleting that green colour. --[[User:Mikaell|Mikaell]] ([[User talk:Mikaell|talk]]) 18:12, 15 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
==How many people speak this language?==
About two million people speak Yoruba as their native language.

==Where is this language spoken?==

Yoruba is a language spoken by one of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria.  An estimated 20 million speak it in that country as well as a few more millions in a diaspora that spans no fewer than 10 countries, including Republic of Benin (Nigeria's next door neighbour), Sierra-leone, Togo, Cuba, Brazil and the United States.  The incumbent Nigeria's president Mr Olusegun Obasanjo is a Yoruba.

==What is the history of this language?==
Yoruba was first spoken by the Yoruban Indians who arrived in Africa many years ago. The Yorubans live in southern African and ruled it from 79 BC though to 1786. In that year the Netherlands claimed southern Africa and declared war on the Yorubans. The Dutch were too strong and powerful for them and in 1787 they won the war and sent the many Yorubans on ships as slaves to Amsterdam. Today modern Yoruba is spoken in parts of southern Africa.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Ross Hellman (1768-1843) was a Yoruban slave. He wrote the first newspaper in Yoruba for the other slaves and wrote the first book too. Another famous Yoruban is Jacob Seman a play write and actor.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==

*hello: ''Ba wo ni''
*good-bye: ''O da bo''
*please: ''E jo''
*thank you: ''O se/E se''
*that one: ''Iyen''
*how much?: ''E lo?''
*English: ''Oyinbo''
*yes: ''Be ni''
*no: ''Be ko''

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==

: '''Warning''': This recipe is experimental and may require refinement.


A '''Paprika Bratwurst''' is similar to a [[Cookbook:Seitan Bratwurst|Seitan Bratwurst]]. 

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* Water, [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|Soy sauce]]. [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|Bell pepper]], [[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]] and [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Chili pepper]] 
* additional spices, e.g.: [[Cookbook:Coriander|Coriander]], [[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]] and [[Cookbook:Oregano|Oregano]]
* optional: [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]]

==Procedure==
* see [[Cookbook:Seitan Bratwurst|Seitan Bratwurst]]
* Cut onions and bell peppers in small chunks. Frying onions and bell peppers lightly adds to the taste.
* Mix bell peppers, paprika powder and chilies or chili powder into the dry gluten powder. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
* To fry the sausages an oiled non-stick pan is recommended. To fry the sausages on a grill they must be cooked first in order to make the gluten dough less rubbery.

== Attention ==
If you use tofu, onions and bell peppers generously the consistency of the sausages may not be sticky enough for the sausages to hold together.

Maybe you could process/blend these items to a puree with the liquid you are using to hydrate the gluten and that would solve the problem.

A '''breading''' is a coating for a piece of meat, poultry, fish, [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]], [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], or [[Cookbook:Textured Vegetable Protein|textured soy]], etc., made from [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|breadcrumbs]] or a breading mixture. Breading is ideal for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] because it lends itself to creating a crispy coating around the food.  Breading mixtures can be made from [[Cookbook:Flour|wheat flour]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]].

In some countries, the term ''crumbed'' is applied to breaded foods.

Breading can also refer to croutons.

Download and install the [http://www.openssl.org/ OpenSSL] runtimes. If you are running Windows, grab the [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] package.

OpenSSL can generate several kinds of public/private keypairs.
RSA is the most common kind of keypair generation.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.opensslfoundation.com/index.php/Command_Line_Utilities#Key_Generation Key Generation]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular ways of generating RSA public key / private key pairs include PuTTYgen and ssh-keygen.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael Stahnke.
[http://books.google.com/books?id=cVralfgghuMC &quot;Pro OpenSSH&quot;].
p. 247.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sf_doc&quot; /&gt;

===Generate an RSA keypair with a 1024 bit private key===

Execute command: “openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 1024”

e.g.
 $ openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 1024
 Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus
 .............................++++++
 ................................................................++++++
 e is 65537 (0x10001)

===Extracting the public key from an RSA keypair===

Execute command: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

e.g.
 $ openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
 writing RSA key

A new file is created, public_key.pem, with the public key.

It is relatively easy to do some cryptographic calculations to calculate the public key from the prime1 and prime2 values in the public key file.
However, OpenSSL has already pre-calculated the public key and stored it in the private key file.
So this command doesn't actually do any cryptographic calculation -- it merely copies the public key bytes out of the file and writes the Base64 PEM encoded version of those bytes into the output public key file.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.devco.net/archives/2006/02/13/public_-_private_key_encryption_using_openssl.php &quot;Public – Private key encryption using OpenSSL&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewing the key elements===

Execute command: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;openssl rsa -text -in private_key.pem&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

All parts of private_key.pem are printed to the screen. This includes the modulus (also referred to as public key and n), public exponent (also referred to as e and exponent; default value is 0x010001), private exponent, and primes used to create keys (prime1, also called p, and prime2, also called q), a few other variables used to perform RSA operations faster, and the Base64 PEM encoded version of all that data.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://etherhack.co.uk/asymmetric/docs/rsa_key_breakdown.html &quot;OpenSSL 1024 bit RSA Private Key Breakdown&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
(The Base64 PEM encoded version of all that data is identical to the private_key.pem file).

== password-less login ==

Often a person will set up an automated backup process that periodically backs up all the content on one &quot;working&quot; computer onto some other &quot;backup&quot; computer.

Because that person wants this process to run every night, even if no human is anywhere near either one of these computers, using a &quot;password-protected&quot; private key won't work -- that person wants the backup to proceed right away, not wait until some human walks by and types in the password to unlock the private key.
Many of these people generate &quot;a private key with no password&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Automatic_Backup#Password-less_login &quot;DreamHost: Personal Backup&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these people, instead, generate a private key with a password,
and then somehow type in that password to &quot;unlock&quot; the private key every time the server reboots so that automated tools
can make use of the password-protected keys.&lt;ref&gt;
Troy Johnson.

==This Page needs to be reconstructed==
I don't know how to do this but someone should flag this page for cleanup; it is sub-standard and confusing.

== What's an IPO? ==

I found this tutorial incredibly useful...up until a single point.  What's an IPO?  The use of the term makes it impossible for me to continue the tutorial after the point that it is mentioned, as I have no idea what it is that I am meant to do.  Otherwise, it's great.  Thanks so far!  [[User:64.4.109.139|64.4.109.139]] 12:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

== Confused ==

Hi! I'm a bit confused with this tutorial. I did the entire tutorial and it didn't work.  
Under &quot;The Fluid&quot; do I need to put the fluid IN the domain or does it go somewhere else?  
Is an IPO a animation? 
Under &quot;Baking Fluids&quot; it says to go to F10 which is scene/render buttons and to change the total number of frames. I couldn't find where you do that.
It would be easer to understand if it had a few screen shots.

--[[User:Domtron|Domtron]] ([[User talk:Domtron|talk]]) 02:04, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

@Domtron:
The domain is the area in which fluid simulation is allowed to occur, so yes, the fluid object goes inside the domain.
To change the total number of frames go to the &quot;Anim&quot; tab in the Scene &gt;&gt; Render Buttons panel, then change the &quot;End&quot; value to the desired number. The total number of frames is equal to the difference between the &quot;Sta&quot; (STArt) and &quot;End&quot; values.
My impression of IPO is that it's the data connected to an object that governs the way it is animated.

--[[User:Mindbulletmatrix|Mindbulletmatrix]] ([[User talk:Mindbulletmatrix|talk]]) 18:22, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

==Help==

I did everything by the book, but no splashy effect. What's next?

== Hiding the 'Fluid' Object ==

One issue with following the steps above is that you end up with the 'fluid' object (representing the water you are dropping the obstacle cube into) superimposed on the animated domain when baking/rendering.  As Transcendant pointed out on #Blender@irc.freenode.net you need to hide the 'fluid' object in the Outliner window type: switch from 3D to Outliner in one of your open areas.  Enjoy!</text>

1. I suggest that some or all of this very comprehensive and interesting description of the processes of consecutive also appear on the wikipedia page for interpreting which currently contains a fairly poor definition.

2. Seleskovitch is rightly considered the parent of the profession and the academic study of interpreting, however, &quot;dropping form&quot; and &quot;deverbalisation&quot; have now been largely discredited. (Sorry that I am not able to give specific references, I am no academic, but I think much of what Daniel Gile has written, for example, demonstrates that the theory doesn't hold water. )

== The five elements in a garden location ==
===Soil===
Good soil is essential; most soil problems can be amended with good homemade compost.  A garden will need at least one foot of good soil to grow in, more if you're planning to grow deep-rooted plants such as potatoes, tomatoes, rye, radishes, etc. 

===Wind Circulation===
A nice brisk wind will strengthen your plants, keep diseases scarce, and bring numerous beneficial insects.  Too much wind will flatten your garden though, so try for a good balance and plant windbreaking trees if necessary. 

===Sunlight===
Sunlight duration throughout the year in a garden will determine success or failure.  Most (90%) of vegetable plants need at least 8 hours of full sunlight a day, though less can be workable with excellent soil and watering.  Watch the sun's path through the course of a day, throughout the year, so your plants can be placed to not overshadow a sun-needy neighbor. 

===Water availability===
Deep, irregular watering is the key to strong roots for your plants.  If you water a little bit often, the roots of your plants will spread out along the surface of the soil (thatch) and be susceptible to diseases, insects, and drought.  Watering deeply (drenching) but not often forces the roots to grow deep into the soil, finding nutrients and any water tables.  With good mulching, most established vegetable gardens can be watered once a week, barring heat or other extenuating circumstances.  Because heavy watering will be necessary, make sure that a good source of water is near your garden location. 

===Location===
Before starting any design it's important to study views and traffic patterns so that you can enjoy vistas, aren't gawked at by passing motorists, and have enough room for both growing and maneuvering space.  A garden should be someplace easily accessible.  Visit your garden often, once a day or many times a week, to catch problems, harvest young vegetables, and perform regular tasks.  The closer your garden to your front or back door, the better -- and the better it will look and produce.

== Deciding on what to grow ==
=== Planting zones ===


=== Types of plants ===
====Annuals====
These plants usually germinate, flower and die within one year. Unless prevented from setting seed, true annuals will not live longer than this. Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not flower.

Examples of true annuals include corn, lettuce, pea, cauliflower, watermelon, bean, zinnia and marigold.

====Biennials====


====Perennials====


====Shrubs====


====Trees====


====Vines====


=== What not to grow ===


== Work with what you've got ==


== Planning Plant Placement ==


== Seed Starting and Transplanting==

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many patterns visible in the Arabic language.

Arabic words are composed of root consonants. Most words usually have 3 root consonants. For example the word كتاب (kitaab) shares the same ordering of root consonants with مكتب (maktab). Words that share the same ordering of root consonants are usually obviously related in meaning. The root consonants for the two mentioned words were k-t-b (note: order matters).

Templates are diagrams used to show where root consonants are in a word, it is a tool used to understand Arabic. The template for كِتاب (kitaab) is فِعال (CiCaaC). Note that كِتاب means book, while فِعال (CiCaaC) does not mean anything and is simply a tool used to understand Arabic morphology.

Notice that  مَكْتَب (maktab) does not start with a root consonant, we know this because we know that it does not start with ك (k). The template for it is مَفْعَل (maCCaC).

Templates are an important tool for the learner of Arabic because it allows them to use a good Arabic dictionary. Using knowledge of templates can allow you to figure out the meaning of an unfamiliar word, without a dictionary.  By understanding the relationship between words a dictionary is not needed. Much like a person learning English does not need to look up the word &quot;cleaner&quot; once they know the word &quot;clean&quot;.

Arabic words are composed primarily of root consonants and a template. The root consonants contain the abstract meaning of the word, while the templates specify the meaning. For instance:( ك ـ ت ـ ب) k-t-b gives the abstract meaning of writing, because كَتَبَ ((kataba)) means &quot;he wrote&quot;. With the template مَفْعَل (maCCaC), the consonants occupy the places reserved for them and make a word meaning &quot;office&quot;:  مَكْتَب (maktab).

Arabic uses this principle for verbs, nouns, and forming plurals. Notice that there are many different templates. The most useful ones are the noun templates. The template of place     مَفْعَل (maCCaC), which we used to make a word meaning &quot;office&quot;, can be seen used on signs of places in the Arab world. For exampe: مَطْعَم (maT`am) which means &quot;restaurant&quot;.

Another advantage of templates is that words do not necessarily derive directly from other words. This prevents forming a noun from a verb unconventionally which happens in English (Best example: use of &quot;presentate&quot; instead of &quot;present&quot;).

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: pronunced → pronounced using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Arabic like many languages uses grammatical cases. Arabic only has three cases: nominative, genitive, and accusative. 

However, they are for the most part not written. When Arabic is not written fully vowelled the only cases visible are dual nouns, and sound masculine plural nouns, and indefinite accusative case. Because short vowels, and tanween are not pronounced at the end of sentences cases usually go unpronounced at the end of the sentence. However, in fully vowelled text they are still written when they are not pronounced. Most cases can be avoided by  pronouncing each word in its pausal form, however most view that pronouncing each word pausally is incorrect, at the very least it is not considered eloquent.
&lt;br&gt;
=Cases in the singular and in all irregular plurals:=
Nominative:ُ u&lt;br&gt;
Genitive: ِ i &lt;br&gt;
Accusative:َ a&lt;br&gt;

==For indefinite nouns:==
N: ٌ uN&lt;br&gt;
G: ٍ iN&lt;br&gt;
A: ً aN/aa&lt;br&gt;



=Cases in the regular masculine plural=
N: ـونَ uuna&lt;br&gt;
G:ـِينَ iina&lt;br&gt;
A:ـِينَ iina&lt;br&gt;

=Cases in the regular feminine plural=
==Definite==
N: ـاتُ aatu&lt;br&gt;
G: ـاتِ aati&lt;br&gt;
A: ـاتِ aati&lt;br&gt;

==Indefinite==
N: ـاتٌaatuN&lt;br&gt;
G: ـاتٍ aatiN&lt;br&gt;
A: ـاتٍ aatiN&lt;br&gt;


==Cases on Names==
Putting case endings on names is something to be avoided, because it is really tricky. Most names never take case endings. In news broadcasts, names of people, and cities are not given case endings if they are composed of only one word.

Most names that do take cases instead of taking &quot;a,i,u&quot; like most normal words instead use &quot;a,a,u&quot; some even take tanween.

=Queen's Gambit=
===2.c4===
2.c4 is the Queen's Gambit. White immediately responds to Black's attempt to gain a foothold in the center by striking out with his c-pawn. Though this pawn is not defended and Black can capture it with ...dxc4, doing so will remove Black's d-pawn from the center and give White more opportunities for central control. Therefore, Black often chooses to decline the gambit, which he can do in several ways.

Unlike many gambits in King's pawn openings, the Queen's Gambit is not intended to be a true material sacrifice in exchange for a quick attack or rapid development. In fact, even if Black accepts the gambit pawn, he will almost always find it unacceptably difficult to retain it. The purpose of the gambit is to gain a more subtle positional advantage by undermining Black's control of the center.

Accepting the gambit with [[/2...dxc4|2...dxc4]] is by no means a risky decision, but most Black players choose to decline it with [[/2...e6|2...e6]] or [[/2...c6|2...c6]] (the Slav defence). More exotic alternatives include the Chigorin defence [[/2...Nc6|2...Nc6]] or the Albin Countergambit [[/2...e5|2...e5]].

=Queen's Gambit Declined=
===2...e6===
With 2...e6, Black declines the Queen's Gambit in the traditional fashion. 2...e6 bolsters the d5 pawn and opens a diagonal for the development of Black's dark-squared bishop. However, 2...e6 also blocks the c8-h3 diagonal for Black's light-squared bishop. Finding a way to productively develop this piece is a perennial challenge for Black players in the QGD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:new}} is a Java keyword. It creates a Java object and allocates memory for it on the heap. &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; is also used for array creation, as arrays are also objects.

Syntax:
 &lt;JavaType&gt; &lt;variable&gt; = {{java:new}} &lt;JavaObject&gt;();

For example:
{{java|code=
LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
int[] intArray = new int[10];
String[][] stringMatrix = new String[5][10];}}

= Dutch Defence =
===1...f5===
The Dutch Defence has a character all of its own. Black usually plays either for a Classical setup with a ...e6 ...d6 ...Be7, a Stonewall with ...e6 ...d5 ...c6, or for the Leningrad with ...g6 ...Bg7 and ...d6. White usually plays 2. c4 here, though  many moves are playable. One interesting, though often considered dubious, option is to play the Staunton Gambit with 2. e4 leading to more tactical positions rather than the positional grinds and straightforward attacks the Dutch usually provides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While not being a wikibooks member, may I make a casual observation about this page?

It's poor in quality. The author(s) don't know what they are talking about, and the article contains factual errors (Boy bands were not first introduced in the 90s for example) The whole thing really doesnt contribute to the wikibooks project. This short thing isn't of any use to anyone, and someone should really work on this page. But not me. An expert.

:Agreed. &quot;Motown is one example, which was a group of black singers &amp; songwriters on the Motown record label&quot;?? Motown is a group on the Motown label? The 80s &quot;gave birth&quot; to bubblegum? (Tell that to the 1910 Fruitgum Co.). And so on. This is beyond poorly written: there are typos, nonsense text, factual errors. Editing it would mean deleting all the text and starting again. Oy. [[User:Freshacconci|Freshacconci]] 18:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== DID NOT START IN THE 1950's ==

&lt;nowiki&gt;Insert non-formatted text here&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Insert non-formatted text here&lt;/nowiki&gt;


Who wrote this? And how did they get their information? Pop music definately didn't start in the 1950's it started YEARS before that. In fact the first person we could give recognition to in terms of starting Popular american music was Stephen Foster in the mid 19th Century around 140-1860. 

Pop music was dissiminated in the forms of sheet music and started a LONG time before 1950. In fact, if you think that Pop started in the 50's what of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby? They were certainly considered to be in the pop music mainstream 20 and 10 years earlier.

== 1970's and onward ==

I will continue to work on this article later from the 1970's onward, as I did not write those, and they contain factual errors and are poorly written, even though a lot of the previous stuff needs some editing as well. I'll get back to it when I am not so busy.

This is a terrible wikibook.  Green Day is not a band from the 2000's, sure, they are still around, but they are a nineties band.  Would you say that Bob Dylan is a 2000's performer because he is still around?  Pop music has existed since music.  Its changed a lot, but its always been around.  A powerchord is a chord that only has the 1 and 5 intervals.  The exclusion of the 3rd does not constitute a powerchord.  A suspended chord has no third, and is not a powerchord.  Instead of working on this article, I would recommend deleting it altogether, and maybe doing some serious research on this topic.  Berklee College of Music offers a great class called the history of pop music, which goes back to the early 1800's.  You might want to consider taking it if you want to write this article.

== Lots of history, not much theory ==

Heading says all.

Also, the article seems to be about mainstream music ('popular music') more than it is about the simple-melody four-chords genre of music which as far as I can tell did in fact start in the 50s or 60s (and I am very willing to be shown to be wrong here). Jazz... isn't pop. Folk... isn't pop. [[Special:Contributions/143.92.1.33|143.92.1.33]] ([[User talk:143.92.1.33|discuss]]) 09:08, 7 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

= Indian Defence =
=== 1...Nf6 ===
Black's 1...Nf6 in response to 1.d4 is characteristic of the various &quot;Indian&quot; defences. Unlike 1...d5, which fights for the center in traditional fashion by occupying it with pawns, Indian systems reflect the hypermodern approach to opening theory. In such openings, Black often allows White to construct a classical pawn center, but then attempts to attack it with pieces and undermine it with timely pawn advances. By delaying the movement of his own central pawns, Black retains a certain degree of flexibility at the cost of ceding the center to White.

It should be noted that while 1...Nf6 often leads to Indian systems, transpositions back into other openings such as the Queen's Gambit are not uncommon. As in any opening, both players should remain aware of these possibilities.

The main continuation for White is [[/2. c4|2. c4]]. In fact, there are many playable moves at this point, but most of them either transpose back into a typical 2. c4 position or into other more or less orthodox 1. d4 openings. Some lines such as 2. Bg5 may lead to strange positions, but even these may transpose or become similar to other mainstream 1. d4 openings.

Hopefully this gives some background as to why 2. c4 is the main move discussed in opening books. Feel free to play 2. Nf3, 2. Nc3, or even 2. c3, 2. Bf4, or 2. Bg5. Even so, learning the main positions (and, more importantly, the strategies) arising from 2. c4 will not be time wasted.

=== Statistics ===
Estimated next move popularity: c4 62%, Nf3 28%, Bg5 5%, Nc3 2%, g3 1%, e3 1%, Bf4 and other moves less than 1%

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ChessProject|importance=High|class=B}}
I just created this page on 2. c4, but I wrote a fairly long intro. When I was a beginner, I was always confused as to why there were never any other options to 2. c4. I found it hard to believe 2. Nf3 could be so bad, or maybe 2. g3. I felt 2. c3 and 2. e3 were too passive, but I still wanted to know why 2. c4 was always played.

As I wrote, some of my material became an advertisement for why 1. d4 is a good choice. I realize this may not be the best place for it, but maybe I can move it over later.--[[User:JECompton|JECompton]] 03:21, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== Tone is incorrect for a wiki ==

This article needs to be revised and the conversational tone eliminated.  That way, it would conform to the rest of the wiki.

===2. c4===
2.c4 strengthens White's control of the center, particularly the important d5 square. It also allows White's queenside knight to develop to the active c3 square without blocking the c-pawn. 

Black has a number of possibilities at this point:
* [[/2...e6/]] - This move is solid and flexible. Depending on how white plays, black will end up in a Queen's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian, Queen's Gambit Declined, or a Benoni.
* [[/2...g6/]] - This tends to be more aggressive (and riskier), though still solid if one knows the important strategic points. Black has the choice to move into a King's Indian Defence (KID) (regardless of white's play) or possibly a Grünfeld if white plays 3. Nc3 and black wishes.
* [[/2...c5/]] - This will likely end up being a Benoni (often aggressive, risky), Benko-gambit (positional pawn sacrifice by black on queenside), a symmetrical English (a bit quieter, but active pieces), or even a Tarrasch QGD (active for both sides).
* [[/2...d6/]] - This is the so-called &quot;Old Indian,&quot; and it can either transpose into a KID or follow less popular lines with a strategy similar to the KID.
* [[/2...e5/]] - The Budapest Gambit. It has a unique character and often allows black active play. White usually gives the pawn back eventually, and usually gets a slightly better position, but black can do well against the ignorant white player.
* [[/2...d5/]] - The Marshall Defence. This is not the best idea, though not an absolute trap. Several opening encyclopedias give this a clear advantage to white if played right.

===2...e6===
2...e6 is a move with several purposes. First, it opens a diagonal for the development of Black's dark-squared bishop. It also challenges White's ambition in the center by attacking the d5 square. By doing so, Black prepares to play ...d5 while discouraging White from playing d5 himself. 

A disadvantage for Black of systems with ...e6 is that the pawn on e6 blocks the c8-h3 diagonal on which Black's light-squared bishop may wish to operate. Finding a useful way to develop this piece, either through a queenside fianchetto or a future reopening of the c8-h3 diagonal, is a perennial challenge for Black players after ...e6. However, the inactivity of the light-squared bishop, while sometimes problematic, is rarely fatal in the early going, and should not discourage Black players from choosing 2...e6 or ...e6 on a later move.

White has three main choices here:
* [[/3. Nc3/]] - more aggressive in trying to establish a center via e2-e4, but also allows the 3...Bb4 pin (Nimzo-Indian). Black may also play a Benoni or QGD.
* [[/3. Nf3/]] - Less aggressive but solid. White may face a Queen's Indian, Benoni, or QGD.
* [[/3. g3/]] - This usually leads to a Catalan, or sometimes a Symmetrical English or Benoni. The Catalan offers good chances for white to obtain powerful piece play in a more open game than the typical 1. d4 openings.

With 3.Nc3, White develops a piece and continues to fight for the center of the board. On c3, the knight controls the important d5 and e4 squares. Black can choose from four main continuations:

= Queen's Gambit Declined =
This is the classical main-line of the QGD. White has several options, though some of these may transpose into each other at some point:
* 4. cxd5 - The exchange variation. Unlike other exchange variations notorious for yielding a quiet game (e.g. French, Caro-Kann), this exchange has several aggressive plans including the &quot;minority attack&quot; on the queenside or a preparation for an all-out assault by seizing the center by an eventual e2-e4 or e3-e4.
* 4. Nf3 - This is the solid classical option.
* 4. Bg5 - Since this move is usually played anyway, it is both constructive while keeping options open.

=Queen's Gambit Declined=
===3.Nc3===
After building a pawn center with his first two moves, White begins the development of his minor pieces with 3.Nc3. On c3, the knight controls the d5 and e4 squares. White would like to play e4 at some point to gain even more presence in the center, and 3.Nc3 facilitates this break.

White's dark-squared bishop will likely go to g5 after Black plays Nf6, but of course this is not possible immediately because of 3...Qxg5. Moving the bishop to a different square on move 3 would simply lose a tempo if it later went on to g5, so it is best to develop a knight here instead.  There are sound systems involving Bf4, but it is not wise to commit to a Bf4 system so early. Thus 3.Nc3 and 3.Nf3 are the most sensible options.

:No problem at all. :) --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 05:29, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

Good to see you at the Opening Theory wikibook, my friend! This is the first time two people working on this project have been active at the same time. I had great visions for this wikibook a few months ago: I was responsible for it detaching from the Chess wikibook, and I was doing the content single-handed for a short while (basic e4 lines) until university exams left me short of spare time. But I'm back! 

You've been doing a lot of work on the d4 openings. Are you keen to carry on with that? The simplest division of labour, until we get more people showing an interest, would be: I do e4, you do d4/c4. 

I had a convention going that the only links leaving a page should be to moves immediately following that position, and that each move should appear only once as a link and thereafter as plain text. E.g. on your 1. d4 page, 2. e4 is not a move immediately playable, it's just something White is thinking about (and probably won't play), so it should not be linked. I don't feel that I've explained that very well... the point is that the user must select the Black response before selecting the White response to the Black response, otherwise the user doesn't know where the Black response has come from. That still doesn't explain it very well. Can you see what I'm getting at? As for each move appearing only once as a link, I feel it helps to impose some sort of visible structure on the information (I have tended to indent the links too) and it is consistent with Wikipedia. I prefer for example one paragraph discussing 1...Nf6 followed by one paragraph discussing 1...d5 etc. This isn't as important and we can come to a consensus.

It is imperative that White moves contain a space: 2. e4. This is because otherwise the page title is an unbroken string of characters, and as I discovered, once you get to about the fifth move you start descending into side-scrolling hell. I had to rename every page in the wikibook, in a long afternoon, for that reason. It's a bit of a fudge, but so is the Universe.

I generally can't be bothered with the theory tables, and have left them out of the e4 pages I've done. Maybe someone new will come along and fill those in. I think being able to see the board position is much more important. But I admire your persistence with them. 

What I'm keen for us to do is keep a rough diary of our contributions on the main discussion page, because with the labyrinthine structure of this wikibook, newly written pages may not be noticed otherwise. 

I want to rewrite the main page as a priority. Right now it's a rambling mess full of jargon. I want to include a quote from Chernev. Watch this space...

Hope to get some work done with you in the near future. [[User:Chi Sigma|Chi Sigma]] 23:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Indian Defence with e6, Nf3==
3.Nf3 develops a piece and contributes to White's fight for the center of the board. This move strengthens the d4 and e5 squares and brings White a move closer to castling kingside. Nf3 blocks the f-pawn, which can be a powerful lever for White in some lines, but White has many other options as well. This continuation is often chosen by White players who are trying to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defence, 3.Nc3 Bb4. 3...Bb4+ is still possible after 3.Nf3, but this usually leads to the Bogo-Indian Defence, which has a much poorer theoretical reputation for Black than the Nimzo-Indian.

Because it blocks the f-pawn, does not support the e4 pawn break, and does not fight for the d5 square, 3.Nf3 is a little more passive on White's part than 3.Nc3. Nevertheless, it is solid, and there are many ways for White to get a quiet, positional advantage. Apart from the Bogo-Indian, Black can aim for the Queen's Indian or Benoni as well as the usual transpositions:
* 3...b6 - The Queen's Indian (QID). This move is quiet and aims at equality via active piece play, trades in the center, and freeing pawn breaks such as ...c5, ...d5 or even ...e5 (usually utilizing ...d6 as preperation for this)
* 3...d5 - as always, the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) transposition is in the air.
* 3...c5 - is the Benoni... This is one of the more appealing paths to the Benoni as it avoids the dangerous f2-f4 lines.

=Queen's Gambit Declined=
With 3.Nf3, White commences the development of his minor pieces after establishing a pawn center on the first two moves. 3.Nf3 controls important central squares, but unlike 3.Nc3, it does not immediately help to prepare the e4 pawn break. However, it does bring White close to castling kingside, something 3.Nc3 does not. In most QGD lines, White will play both Nc3 and Nf3 anyway; the order is important only if White desires to avoid specific variations.

White's dark-squared bishop will likely go to g5 after Black plays Nf6, but of course this is not possible immediately because of 3...Qxg5. Moving the bishop to a different square on move 3 would simply lose a tempo if it later went on to g5, so it is best to develop a knight here instead.  There are sound systems involving Bf4, but it is not wise to commit to a Bf4 system so early. Thus 3.Nc3 and 3.Nf3 are the most sensible options.

= Queen's Gambit Declined =
==3...Nf6==
Here white can take an interesting departure from the typical QGD lines by playing 4. g3, transposing into a main line of the Catalan Opening. This colorful opening can be very aggressive, especially if black opens the long diagonal with ...dxc4 at some point. The piece play white obtains from such an opening of lines is often dangerous for black.

At this point, white's other main continuations are 4. Nc3 and 4. Bg5, though 4. cxd5 is certainly possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Featured book concept ==

I think having a featured book concept would be useful (and I was going to propose one myself before you jumped in ).

I would, however, make the following suggestions/questions:

#Set a start date - say 1 August - to allow for discussions on the criteria and what books should initally be listed.
#Drop the minimum page criterion. What's wrong with a great, complete book being 90 pages long? Or 80 pages long? Or 48 pages long (which is meant to be the target length or a Wikijunior book)? Does it matter as long as it does not look unfinished?
#Drop the pdf requirement. Instead adopt the approach of encouraging pdfs for books that become featured.
#Where did your proposed starting list come from? Having all books of the monthas potential founding members seems sensible. As does having current hotpicks. Perhaps if we do set a start date, allow being to raise objections to these books by then, otherwise deem them to be adopted. Then have a positive voting/discussion system to allow other nominations.
#If it works well, we could end up replacing book of the month (why not book of the week, or day, even?).

[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:01, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldn't object to any of your changes, so feel free to make any revisions you like. But here's my reasonong for my version: 

:I chose a 100 page limit in order to not include short guides. It seems unreasonable to me that a ''textbook'' would be less than 100 pages. Wikijunior may be an exception, or maybe we should leave it out altogether, since it's a separate project. I chose the proposed list from {{tl|highlighted}} and its talk page. Feel free to remove any books you do not deem worthy of featured status (or vice versa). 

:I chose PDFs as a requirement because they are very easy to create, but add a lot to Wikibooks' functionality and appeal. The ability to download a textbook is very important, in my opinion, and it'll be easier on browsers if they know that all featured book could be downloaded.

:I also didn't want long discussions or voting on whether a book should be listed or not, so I decided to go with simple, general criteria. Anyone can add any book that meets the requirements. I think the &quot;official voted-upon featured status&quot; should only be to bolded books, and the rest of the list should remain unofficial (as long as books reasonably meet the criteria). We can switch to voted-upon books only when Wikibooks grows to a certain point.

:But again, this is all trivial, so feel free to change anything or create policies. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 06:44, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

::Regarding your last suggestion, one possibility is to display a different non-BotM featured book each day of the month on the main page. Since there are 27 of these books at the moment, that works out rather nicely. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 06:49, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== Small featured marker template ==

I've been toying around with a small template, similar to {{tl|Botm Winner Short}} that will post a small image after a book, for use on a bookshelf to denote books that are featured. This is just more advertising, of course, but it's an easy analog to those BOTM templates. The template is {{tl|Featured}}, and is used like this:

*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{featured|Ada Programming}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*{{featured|Ada Programming}}

It just creates a link to the book, and that little star graphic at the end. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 22:08, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

:This would also be handy for interwiki links, like what wikipedia use -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:15, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal for new Featured Books logo ==

I noticed that the Featured Books logo ([[Image:Featured book en.svg|32px]]) looks a little awkward, text-positioning wise, so I was wondering if something like the one below would be better suited. 

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Featured book en.svg|Current logo
Image:Temp fb logo proposal.svg|My proposal
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Suggestions? I'd be glad to change the font, add shading, and so on. [[User:Doodledoo|Doodledoo]] 21:03, 25 October 2007 (UTC)
:The current logo uses a retro font, layout and colour scheme - whether that was intended, I'm not sure. I like it a lot more than most logos used around here. While there may be a better option, I don't think this is it. I welcome your efforts to find us a new logo. Perhaps something more along the lines of the [[commons:Category:Nuvola icons|Nuvola]] theme would fit in better (especially now that we're using those icons for many major templates.

== Special RSS / Atom feed ==

After looking around the site for about 10 minutes, I could not find a feed with just the new featured books, like the one for [http://jeays.net/wikipedia/featured.xml featured articles on Wikipedia]. This would be a nice addition.

:You're right, this would be a nice addition, and is something that maybe we could work on. There are relatively few featured books on Wikibooks (compared to featured articles at wikipedia), and we promote new books relatively infrequently. One thing that you could do is to check out the history feed for the featured books page [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Featured_books&amp;action=history&amp;feed=rss HERE]. This feed will show you all the changes to the page, and the page is changed every time a new featured book is added. Of course, it will also show you other edits, such as formatting, spelling, grammar, and organization edits, but it's the price you need to pay for this. Thanks for the suggestion! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:33, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

== print and pdf versions ==

When people look at the list here,
some wikibooks have &quot;(PDF) (print)&quot; links after them:
* ... — Algorithms (PDF) (print) — ...
while others don't:
* ... — Consciousness Studies — ...

How do I fix this list to show links for the print and pdf versions of the [[Consciousness Studies]] wikibook?
And other wikibooks that have print and pdf versions?
I'm guessing we need to move the print and pdf versions somewhere else where the {{tl|PDF}} template can find them?
Is this something that needs to be mentioned in the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]?

== Inconsistent Featured Books listings ==

== Make it neater? ==

I know this is not a problem in browsers where collapsing is OK, but on IE, it looks irritating. Will it be possible to decrease the size of the cover pictures and arrange the books one book on each row, rather than three cells per row? Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) 04:05, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

:Collapsing works for me in IE 8.  One per row will make the page extremely tall; even worse if collapsing ''isn't'' working for someone.  I made an attempt to drop the thumbnail size on this page, however.  It works for the non-SVG images. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:08, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

::I reread my comment and realised that the collapsing part makes no sense at all. I still find the current state very irritating because of the odd arrangement, especially social sciences and computing. I don't think arranging in rows will make it taller since the size of the pictures can be further reduced.

The wording below as shown on the front page is absolutely incorrect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">RE: Time to animate!:FRAME 12

If you go into edit mode to shrink the ball then the ball retains the deformation throughout the animation cycle.  Perform lattice deformations in object mode for results.

---------------------------
Andy,

&quot;With the lattice selected you will want to go into edit mode.&quot;

Are you sure that isn't  '''Object''' mode?

I tried it in both 2.41 and CVS and both say 'Unable to perform function in Edit Mode'
when I try to change the U/V/W  settings.

--[[User:Mstram|Mstram]] 08:45, 22 June 2006 (UTC)


''&quot;It is important to add the objects in top view to keep their Z-Axis aligned upwards.&quot;
''
Hmm,  I added a sphere in every view (top,left,right ...etc) and even with a randomly rotated view, the Z axis always pointed in the same direction.

---------------------------
--[[User:Mstram|Mstram]] 09:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

''&quot;Right click your Ball and go into edit mode.&quot;''

It didn't seem to matter if I was in Edit or Object mode when I added the Lattice Modifier

--[[User:Mstram|Mstram]] 09:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

''In version 2.4x you can select the object (the sphere) and apply a Lattice Modifier to it or you can still use the parent option then use the Modifier palette to make the Lattice Deform &quot;Real&quot; (In my version of Blender, I have to use the second option as the first simply doesn't work :( )''

(Only) applying a lattice modifier doesn't do anything in 2.41 or CVS.  I needed to CTRL-P 
(lattice deform).  Does the Lattice Modifier even do anything ?

--[[User:Mstram|Mstram]] 10:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, thanks Mstram. It appears a couple of people added edits that were either poorly worded or unnecessary. As clearly stated in my original text, the Lattice modifier does not work the way we need it to work for this tutorial. I've edited the text to make it clearer what we're doing. Someone apparently felt it was worth re-mentioning it anyway. My original text also stated that if the Lattice information wasn't clear, then the reader should learn the lattice basics anyway. I did this because I didn't want to delve deep into lattice principles.

For the same reason, I ignored the U,V,W settings as frankly, they just aren't needed for this exercise. We're not going to twist the ball or kick it with a boot. It's only squashing (and later stretching). I know it works as originally written because I've got a fully working animation done this way.

On the Z-Axis orientation issue, what you'll find if you add objects in different views is that their local axes will be out of whack. This may go un-noticed until you start creating IPO channels manually (try it with a SizeZ IPO for example... SizeZ Channel - CTRL-LMB in IPO window). Then it becomes a problem. &quot;CTRL-A&quot; doesn't appear to solve this problem with Lattices as it does with Meshes.

Anyway, thanks for pointing this out. I've re-edited so hopefully the rest is okay. PLEEEEASE let me know if you find more problems. You know where to find me :)  --[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 13:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

-------------------
Hi Andy, just tried the lattice modifier in 2.42Rc2, and it doesn't work following the instructions in your tutorial.  According to your tutorial the lattice is moved/deformed in OBJECT mode, right ?    When I add a lattice modifier in any version of blender from 2.41 -&gt; 2.42RC2 / CVS , the lattice only affects the sphere when in EDIT mode, and only with a ''Lattice'' type key frame.

.. Also I'd love to see more info on rotating the squashed sphere, and how a lattice makes it easier to do. I presume you mean that the sphere rotates, while the squashed flat part remains in contact with the ground?   Have you done this? ... I'm experimentating with that now.

Mike
--[[User:Mstram|Mstram]] 13:55, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
----------------------

Thans Mike. I've re-worded the entire section on applying the lattice. Hopefully it works as expected now... for everyone. --[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 17:26, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Not for everyone :) Tried this in 2.44 and had same problems as Mike. Lattice didn't animate as well. --Harkonnen2. 19.08.2007

== Comment ==

Nice work!
Things that could be explained a bit better:

'''Arcs and timing''': 
This is more important then squash and stretch.
 http://www.exploratorium.edu/sports/ball_bounces/index.html
Notice how gravity speeds the ball down, (greater spacing between fames when going faster) then immediately after impact, the ball comes back up at nearly the down velocity, then slows down as it's overtaken by gravity again...  Balls do not slow before hitting a surface as currently shown.   You have the major keys right, but a little more work in the graph editor is needed.

'''Squash and stretch''':  Squash and stretch is rarely seen in real bouncing balls, but we exaggerate this for animation.  Stretch helps prevent the strobing due to finite frame sampling in tv and film... If our eyes opened and closed 24/30 fps everything would be strobing...  We prevent that by adding motion blur (longer exposure time) or stretching objects as they're moving across the screen.

Currently the article focuses on the Blender technical how-to.
More exploration into the simple physics, or at least links to articles that do would make this complete.
Suggestions:
http://www.idleworm.com/how/anm/01b/bball.shtml
http://www.exploratorium.edu/baseball/bouncing_balls.html

For a simple ball bounce like you are doing, I'd parent the ball to an empty instead of using a lattice.  The empty can be moved, squashed, and stretched while the ball itself is only rotated.
Lattices are nice when you need the ball to warp, dent in the side etc... but is rarely needed for a simple realistic ball bounce and rotations.  If you're going to expand this exercise more then the lattice is fine.

--[[User:AddZero|AddZero]] 20:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the comments. You're correct that this was more of an introductory Blender &quot;how to&quot; than an investigation of physics or animation but your points are well made. Although I will say the curve editor shows the speed of the centre point of the ball and as such, the bottom curvature and central-bottom key reflects the slowing of the centre-point AFTER contact, during squash and before recoil rather than the air speed of the ball itself. Could the curve be a little more exponential? Maybe but it's a pretty short distance being covered in the example.

:The lattice is a personal preference and admittedly almost anything could be used as the controller since for this exercise it really is nothing more than a parent object. I find empties hard to see once you have a few objects, lamps, camera and other stuff happening in a scene while a lattice is easy to see and recognise and can also be sized to the dimension of the ball and gives a better visual indication of the state of squash and stretch at any point (imho). 

:I've added the idleworm link to the page as it looks like a '''very''' useful resource. Thanks again and, as with any wiki, feel free to rework bits that you feel strongly about. --[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 16:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Genitive Prepositions==

The locatative case endings -lla, -ssa, -lle, are used to describe absolute place. (e.g. '''se on pöydällä''' ''it's on the table''. But sometimes we need to express location of one object relative to some other object. To do this we use of the many relative locatative words in the Finnish Language which are often used prepositionally, i.e. they come after the words that they relative to.  In English , many of the equivalent words are prepositional, i.e. the come before the word that they are relative to. Postpositions are virtually non-existant in English, whereas in Finnish they are very common indeed.  Most postpositions in Finnish govern the use of the genitive case.

Pallo on &lt;em style=&quot;color:red;font-style:normal&quot;&gt;  sohva'''n'''&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em style=&quot;color:blue;font-style:normal&quot;&gt;'''alla'''&lt;/em&gt;
:The ball is &lt;em style=&quot;color:blue;font-style:normal&quot;&gt; under &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em style=&quot;color:red;font-style:normal&quot;&gt;  the sofa &lt;/em&gt;
::Note the different sequencing of the words and the fact that sofa is in the genitive form sohvan.



These postpositional words may be expressed statically, but sometimes also with movement.

Often these words are associated with location (in front of, behind, below, above, etc.)

Sometimes they express...(to be continued)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:import}} is a Java keyword. 

It declares a Java class to use in the code below the import statement.  Once a Java class is declared, then the class name can be used in the code without specifying the package the class belongs to.  

Use the '*' character to declare all the classes belonging to the package.

Syntax:
{{java|code=import package.JavaClass;
import package.*;
}}

The static import construct allows unqualified access to static members without inheriting from the type containing the static members:

    import static java.lang.Math.PI;

Once the static members have been imported, they may be used without qualification:

    double r = cos(PI * theta);

Caveat: use static import very sparingly to avoid polluting the program's namespace!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:package}} is a Java keyword. It declares a 'name space' for the Java class.  It must be put at the top of the Java file, it should be the first Java statement line.

To ensure that the package name will be unique across vendors, usually the company url is used starting in backword.

Syntax:
 {{java:package}} package;

For example:
{{java|code=package com.mycompany.myapplication.mymodule;}}

#You cannot edit the UVW values of a Lattice in &quot;Edit Mode&quot;.

A flexible developing move. While this move usually leads to a Queen's Gambit, it is also used to go into a Colle System--a solid line that prepares e2-e4 earlier and can be more aggressive than the usual lines.

Black can develop a number of ways though 2...Nf6 is most common.

= Queen's Gambit Accepted =
=== 2...dxc4 ===
The Queen's Gambit Accepted has a rich heritage in chess, both sides played by many of the world champions through the years. It is not really much of a gambit since white can recover the pawn immediately with 3. Qa4+, though unless white wants the Q placed on c4, this is unnecessary. 

Black does better not to hold on to the pawn. Attempts to immediately support it with either 3...b5 or 3...Be6 are not advisable. 3...b5 is countered by 4. a4, threatening black's pawn chain at its base, and 3...Be6 allows 4. e4, with white grabbing a large share of the center and threatening a later d5 to kick away the bishop.

Black's biggest concern is to take advantage of the time it takes white to recover the pawn to get the pieces active and prepare for key pawn breaks in the center (usually ...c5 or ...e5). White usually has better control of the center and has an easier time developing an advantage, but must play well to achieve this. Major continuations:
* 3. Nf3 - The classical main line. White develops while maintaining some flexibility.
* 3. e4 - A newer, but explored continuation. It tends to be more immediately tactical than 3. Nf3 and puts the question to black on which plan regarding the center black wishes to pursue.
* 3. e3 - Not as aggressive as 3. e4, but otherwise similar in intention. This often transposes into 3. Nf3 lines since white ends up playing e2-e3 anyway.
* 3. Qa4+ - This is a more modern continuation. While classical theory shied away from developing the queen early, this line aims at posting the queen in an active role, similar to lines of the Catalan.

=Queen's Gambit Accepted=
==3.e4==
In this line, white moves immediately to reclaim the &quot;gambit&quot; pawn. The rationale is simple. In most lines of the QGA, white allows black to play ...Nf6 which usually means white has to play f2-f3 in preparation for e3-e4. By playing e2-e4 now, white establishes broad control of the center without losing time. This also has the potential advantage of allowing the c1-bishop to develop unhindered. Also, black is forced to choose a central strategy now or else face being dominated by white's center and development. Black is no worse in these lines, though, than in the classical QGA's, and can obtain counterplay in these lines as well as the others. Here are several options:
* 3...e5
* 3...c5
* 3...Nf6 - Playing this now can lead to Alekhine-like positions.
* 3...Nc6 - Takes advantage of the fact white has not played 3. Nf3 to pressurize the d4 pawn.

'''Nuked Nachos''' are an easy to prepare quick side dish, great with a quick-made lunch or such.

==Ingredients==
*About 1/3 to 1/2 (per serving) [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (80g to 120g) of cheese (Whatever works, cheese-dip, pre-melted cheese, diced cheese, grated cheese...)
*How ever many servings you want of corn chips (other chips that are good as nachos will work too.)

==Procedure==
#Spread cheese (or whatever you use) over the chips.
#Add any other microwave-safe ingredients. Taste great with hamburger, or peppers.
#Make sure that the plate/bowl that the chips are in is '''microwave-safe''', and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds.
:Cheese may have melted onto the plate, do not worry. Just rip it off the plate and put it on the plate!
:Eat while its hot!

Serve, and eat!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:protected}} is a Java keyword. 

This keyword is an access modifier, used before a method or other class member to signify that the method or variable can only be accessed by elements residing in its own class or classes in the same package (as it would be for the default visibility level) but moreover from subclasses of its own class, including subclasses in foreign packages (if the access is made on an expression, whose type is the type of this subclass).

Syntax:
 {{java:protected}} &lt;returnType&gt; &lt;methodName&gt;(&lt;parameters&gt;);

For example:
{{java|code=protected int getAge();

protected void setYearOfBirth(int year);
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first come, first served (commonly called FIFO ‒ first in, first out) process scheduling algorithm is the simplest process scheduling algorithm.  It is rarely used in modern operating systems, but is sometimes used inside of other scheduling systems.

== Analogy ==
A FIFO acts like any normal queue whether, it is a line in a cinema, a checkout line in a store, or a queue for a ticket booth.  The first person or process to arrive (First In) is the first one to be dealt with (First Out).  If one person goes through the line and then decides they forgot something then they have to go back through.  

This is exactly how OS's with this design let programs conduct their business. One person (aka: process) at a time.

==Implementation==
To implement this, you can create a queue, an abstract data type (ADT) that can be constructed from a linked list data structure. The system can dequeue the next process from the front of the queue, run the process until completion (or enqueue the process at the end of the line in more complex schemes), then enqueue the process at the end of the line, allowing the next process to use the CPU.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
Advantages:
* simple
* easy to understand
* first come, first served

Disadvantages: 
* This scheduling method is nonpreemptive, that is, the process will run until it finishes.
* Because of this nonpreemptive scheduling, short processes which are at the back of the queue have to wait for the long process at the front to finish

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:if}} is a Java keyword. It starts a branching statement.

The general syntax of a {{java:if}}, using {{Java:EBNF}}, is

 branching-statement ::= {{java:if}} ''condition-clause'' 
                                     ''single-statement'' | ''block-statement''
                        &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{java:else}} 
                                     ''single-statement'' | ''block-statement'' &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  
 condition-clause    ::= '''&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;''' Boolean Expression '''&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;'''
 single-statement    ::= [[Java Programming/Statements|Statement]]
 block-statement     ::= '''&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;''' [[Java Programming/Statements|Statement]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Java Programming/Statements|Statements]] &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;'''

For example:
{{java|code=
if ( boolean Expression )
{
   System.out.println(&quot;'True' statement block&quot;);
}
else
{
   System.out.println(&quot;'False' statement block&quot;);
}
}}

= Slav Defence =
===2...c6===
Originally considered a less-orthodox defence in the Queen's Gambit, this opening has long stood as an entire opening system in its own right for decades.

The idea behind this defence is straightforward: instead of locking in the light squared bishop on c8, why not support the center with the c-pawn instead? Black tends to be more active in this variation than the QGD.

White's main lines:
* 3. Nf3 - The main line. As with the QGD, white makes a useful developing move while maintaining some flexibility.
* 3. Nc3 - Sometimes provocative, this move may lead to variations where black overextends by trying to hold on to the pawn on c4.
* 3. cxd5 - The exchange variation. This relieves the central tension early on and tends to allow black equality. One of the main drawbacks of having the Slav as a main opening repetoire is that it is hard for Black (or White) to win in the exchange variation. According to chess365, 83% of Masters games ended in a draw after this move. Even so, it is important for both sides to know.

=Queen's Pawn Game=
This move is not played as much, at least on the master level, since the knight blocks the c-pawn from pressuring the center. Black usually responds with 2...Nf6, but a number of other moves are safe.

==1. List at least three different ways to dry foods.==
===Sun Drying===
Food can be dried in the sun, but only if the temperatures are near 100°F (38°C) and the humidity is low.  The fruit must be covered with cheesecloth (or something similar) to protect it from insects. If it is dried on a table, the table legs should be set in cans of water to prevent insects from crawling up the legs and getting into the fruit.  The fruit will take several days to dry, and the humidity and other weather conditions must be monitored.  If the temperature drops significantly during the night, dew may form, and the fruit will absorb it quickly.  Because of this, it may be necessary to take the fruit indoors at night.

===Oven Drying===
This is the fastest way to dry food, but only small quantities at a time can be dried this way.  The oven is preheated to about 140°F (60°C) and the food is placed on racks in the oven.  The door must be held open about two inches (5cm) for a gas oven, or about 4 inches (10cm) for an electric oven.  A thermometer is placed in the center of the rack to make sure the temperature stays near 140°F (60°C).  A fan should be placed near the open oven door so that air inside the oven can circulate and allow the moisture to escape.

The food trays must be rotated every 30 minutes because the heat inside the oven will not be distributed evenly.  Rotate the trays from front to back, top to bottom, and left to right.

===Food Dryer===
Food dryers can be purchased or home-built.  They can dry more food than an oven but it takes a little longer.  They also use less electricity than an electric oven.  A food dryer is an enclosed box with a heat source, a fan, and a set of racks upon which the food is placed.  Most home-built food dryers use a 100 watt light bulb as the heat source.  It takes four to six hours to dry a batch of food in a food dryer, and like ovens, they operate at about 140°F (60°C).

You can build your own food dryer by lining a cardboard box with Styrofoam insulation, and then covering the Styrofoam with aluminum foil.  Alternately, you can use insulation board with the foil already attached (this is available at most home improvement stores).  It is very important that you line the insulation with foil, as this reflects the heat away from the insulation which would otherwise melt.  Make an insulated lid for the box as well, but leave a gap at one end for moisture to escape.  

The next thing you will need is a light fixture.  Use a simple porcelain base, and mount it to a steel ceiling box (both of these are available in the electrical section of a hardware store).  If desired, you can also use the thermostat from a water heater to control the temperature.  These thermostats are generally settable between {{units|40°C- 65°C|100°F-150°F}} - you will want to set it to {{units|60°C|140°F}}.  If you buy a deep ceiling box, you can mount the thermostat inside it, but make sure it makes good contact with the ceiling box so that heat is conducted to it.  If you cannot mount the thermostat inside the box you will need to cover the terminals, as they will both carry household voltage (which is enough to kill a person who comes in contact with it).

The last item you will need is an extension cord.  Cut the &quot;female&quot; end of it off and throw it away.  Make a hole in box and poke the cut end through.  Then run it through an opening in the ceiling box.  Strip the ends of the wire and connect them to the porcelain light fixture.  Tighten the clamp on the ceiling box to hold the extension cord in place.  Screw in a 100 Watt bulb and plug in the cord.  If the light does not turn on, unplug and check your wiring.

If you opt to use a thermostat, wire the &quot;hot&quot; wire on the extension cord (this is the one that connects to the narrower of the two blades on the plug) to either terminal of the thermostat.  Run a wire from the remaining terminal of the thermostat to the light fixture.  The neutral wire (connected to the wide blade of the plug) should be connected to the remaining terminal on the light fixture.

Finally, mount the fixture inside the insulated box and rig up a rack to hold your food trays.  Keep a close eye on it the first time you use it.

If you do not use a thermostat, place a thermometer inside the box and keep an eye on it.  You can control the temperature by varying the width of the gap in the lid, or by using a different wattage light bulb.

==2. Why and how do you sulphur fruits?==
Commercially prepared dried fruit may contain sulfur dioxide which can trigger asthma in sensitive individuals, though dried fruit without sulfur dioxide is also available, particularly in health stores. The sulphur is added to &quot;fix&quot; the colour of the product. &quot;Organic&quot; dried fruit is produced without sulphur which results in dark fruit and the flavor is much more characteristic of the fresh fruit. The color of some fruits can also be &quot;fixed&quot; to some extent, with minimal impact on flavor, by treating the freshly cut fruit with a preparation rich in Vitamin C (e.g., a mixture of water and lemon juice) for a few minutes prior to drying.

Sulphuring fruit is accomplished by burning a block of sulphur in an enclosed box (such as a dehydrator) with the fruit inside.  The burning sulphur gives off sulphur dioxide which fixes the color of the fruit.  This should only be done outside.

==3. How is dried fruit stored and protected from insects?==
As soon as it cools, dried fruit should be packed into insect-proof containers, such as glass jars or metal cans with tight-fitting lids.  Do not let sulphured fruit touch metal, as this will cause the fruit to become discolored.  You can pack fruit into plastic bags and then place that in a metal container.  Plastic bags are not 100% insect (or rodent) proof, so make sure you store the fruit in a place where they cannot get to it.  A cool, dry place is best.

==4. How are dried foods reconstituted?==
Just add water.  You can also simmer them in boiling water for 15 minutes.

==5. What is important in selecting fruit to be used in making fruit leather?==
The fruit must be ripe, or slightly overripe.  Be sure to use good quality fruit, as it will make good quality fruit leather.  Select fruit that is fresh, and fully sound - basically, the same things you look for when selecting fruit for the table.  Cut out any bad parts of the fruit.  The saying, &quot;one bad apple spoils the whole lot&quot; applies to fruit leather, as a bad piece of fruit can impart a bad flavor to any of the fruit it comes into contact with.  In making fruit leather, the fruit is pureed before drying, so the bad fruit will come into contact with ''all'' the fruit.

==6. How are dried nuts stored?==
Dried nuts must be stored in a cool, dry place in air-tight containers to prevent reabsorption of moisture.

==7. Dry the following and provide samples for testing:==
===a. Bread. Make crumbs and use in a recipe for sampling.===
Bread can be dried without the use of special equipment by placing several slices in a large bowl and covering it with a towel.  The bowl should be kept indoors.  After several days, the bread will be dry (also known as &quot;stale&quot;) and it can then be crumbled.  The usual use for bread crumbs is to make stuffing.  You may use any stuffing recipe you like (as long as it uses bread crumbs), or you can use this one:

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stuffing Recipe}}

===b. Fruit leather===
Wash the fruit and puree it in a food processor.  Line a shallow pan with wax paper, being sure to bring the edges up so that the pureed fruit cannot run under it.  Pour the fruit puree into the pan until it is about a quarter inch deep (0.6 cm).  Place it in the food dryer set to 140°F (60°C).  Check it after four hours (but it may take much longer).  Remove the fruit when it is tacky to the touch.  Remove it and the wax paper from the pan and slice into thin strips, leaving the wax paper attached.  Roll the strips (and wax paper) into a spiral and place in a sealable plastic bag.  Store in a cool dry place.  Fruit leather can be stored for up to six months.

===c. Vegetable leather===
You can make vegetable leather from just about any type of vegetable so long as it is pureed first.  A shortcut is to use baby food as the starting point, and then proceed as with fruit leather.  Here are two other recipes (in case your Pathfinders rebel at the thought of eating baby food).

====Pumpkin Leather====
* 2 cups of canned pumpkin, or 2 cups of fresh pumpkin, cooked and pureed.
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (powdered)
* 1/4 teaspoon cloves (powdered)

Combine ingredients and dry at 140°F (60°C) (same as for fruit leather).

====Tomato Leather====
Core and slice ripe tomatoes into quarters.  Boil for 15 minutes.  Remove from water, force through a colander or a sieve.  Add salt (if desired for flavoring), and simmer until thick.  Spread on a plastic or wax paper lined tray and dry at 140°F (60°C) (same as for fruit leather).

===d. Fruit slices===
Most fruits need to be pretreated before they are dried.  Apples should be cored, peeled, and sliced.  Fruits with pits (such as peaches, nectarines, and cherries) should be split in half and pitted.  

Thin slices of fruit dry quicker than thick slices, so it is important to slice fruit into uniform thicknesses so that it dries evenly.  

Fruit with thick, waxy skins (such as blueberries and cherries) must be ''cracked'' before it is dried.  Cracking the skin allows the moisture to escape.  To crack the fruit, drop it in boiling water for 30-60 seconds, and then quickly move it to very cold water.

Some fruits, such as apples, pears, and apricots become discolored quickly after they are peeled and sliced.  To prevent them from turning brown, mix two teaspoons of ascorbic acid in one cup of water, and dip the fruit in this solution as you work with it.  One cup of this solution should be enough to treat five quarts of fruit.  Ascorbic acid (more commonly known as Vitamin C) is available in most drug stores.  You can also crush a 500mg tablet of Vitamin C and mix that with a quart (one liter) of water.  Soak the fruit in that solution for two to three minutes.

Once the fruit has been prepared, arrange it in a single layer on a drying tray with the cut side up (if cut in half). Finally, place the trays in a food dryer, and wait.  The amount of time varies depending on the fruit, how thick the slices are, et cetera.  It should take between four and ten hours to dry.

===e. Vegetable slices (such as carrots) or pieces (such as peas)===
Select ripe, high quality vegetables.  Cut out any bad spots, discard overripe pieces, and slice into thin, uniform pieces (unless you are starting with small vegetables such as peas).

Nearly all vegetables need to be blanched before they are dried.  Blanching stops enzymes from destroying the vegetables.  Drying by itself does ''not'' stop the enzyme action.  To blanch vegetables, drop them in boiling water for a minute or two.  Then cool them in ice water for the same amount of time that they were blanched.  Blanching does remove some nutrients from the vegetables, so be sure to blanch them for only the minimum specified time (see table).

Arrange the vegetables on a drying tray in a single layer.  Place the trays in the dryer at 140°F (60°C) with a minimum of one inch between trays.  Drying will take between four and twelve hours. Turn the vegetable pieces every thirty minutes and rearrange them on the tray so that they are dried evenly (different areas on the trays will dry at different rates).  The pieces are dry when they are hard and brittle.  You can test them by striking a piece with a hammer.  If it shatters, the vegetable is dry.

===f. Vegetarian jerky===
* 1 lb firm tofu
* 1/2 cup [http://www.bragg.com/products/liquidaminos.html Bragg Liquid Aminos]
* 3-4 tablespoons liquid smoke
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon pepper
* 1 teaspoon honey
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/8 cup water

# Drain and slice the tofu into quarter-inch (5mm) thick, long, narrow slices
# Mix all the ingredients, adding the tofu slice last in shallow baking dish.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
# Dry at 140°F (60°C) 4-6 hours, turning hourly.

===Easy Vegetarian Jerky===

* Stripples (Worthington)

# Spread Stripples out in a single layer in food dehydrator or oven (set on lowest temperature setting). 
# Turn stripples once or twice as needed for even drying, throughout drying time.

===g. Parsley or some other herb===
Fresh parsley, mint, oregano, basil, marjoram, and rosemary can be dried without any special equipment.  Simply bundle the fresh herbs and hang them in a dry corner of the kitchen out of direct sunlight for a couple of weeks.  You can also dry them by spreading them out on a dish towel.

==8. Reconstitute a vegetable and cook for sampling.==
Vegetables can be reconstituted by soaking them in water for two or three hours.  They should return to their full size.  Cook any way you like.

Still trying to figure all this out.  It's a bit confusing.  I would like to help with a proposed wikijunior book about the alphabet.  I think this is the most important book that wikijunior should start with, after all, a kid needs to be able to know the alphabet and learn to read in order to take advantage of all that wiki has to offer.</text>

This is printing (ironically).  The no print tag attached to this template doesn't seem to work.  See [[A-level Computing]], where i had to use noinclude tags. [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 12:51, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
: I used print preview function in Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer. None of them showed the template. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:16, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== java.lang.Object ==

{{java:Object}} class is the superclass of all Java classes.  All Java classes inherited from this class.  This makes it possible that we can have methods that are available in all Java classes. This simplifies things compared to C++ where this is not the case.  

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! {{java:Object}} class methods
! Description 
|-
| {{java:boolean}} equals( {{java:Object}} o );  
| Gives generic way to compare objects
|-
| {{java:Class}} getClass();
| The {{java:Class}} class gives us more information about the object
|-
| {{java:int}} hashCode();
| Returns a hash value that is be used to search object in a collection
|-
| {{java:void}} notify();
| Used in synchronizing threads
|-
| {{java:void}} notifyAll();

|-
| {{java:void}} wait();
| Used in synchronizing threads
|-
| {{java:protected}} {{java:Object}} clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException ;
| Return a new object that are exactly the same as the current object
|-
| {{java:protected}} {{java:void}} finalize() throws Throwable;
| This method is called just before an object is garbage collected
|-
|}

== equals() Method ==

* The &lt;code&gt;'{{java:boolean}} equals( {{java:Object}} o );'&lt;/code&gt; method gives a generic way to compare objects for equality.  You need to override it, in your class. Then you can write:
 {{java:public}} {{java:boolean}} isCustomerExsist( Customer newCustomer )
 {
    {{java:boolean}} isRet = {{java:false}};
    Iterator iter = _collAllCustomer.iterator();
    {{java:while}} ( iter.hasNext() )
    {
       {{java:if}} ( newCustomer.'''equals'''( (Customer) iter.next() )
       {
          // -- Customer was found ---
          isRet = {{java:true}};
       }
    }
   return isRet;
 }

Keep in mind that when you override equals(), you always need to also override hashCode() so the two methods are consistent. If two objects are equal, they must have the same hashcode.

For more information also see [[Java Programming/Comparing Objects]]

== getClass() Method ==

There is a {{java:Class}} object for each class in your program. Every array also belongs to a class that is reflected as a {{java:Class}} object that is shared by all arrays with the same element type and number of dimensions. The [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive Java types]] ({{java:boolean}}, {{java:byte}}, {{java:char}}, {{java:short}}, {{java:int}}, {{java:long}}, {{java:float}}, and {{java:double}}), and the keyword {{java:void}} are also represented as {{java:Class}} objects. Class has no public constructor. Instead Class  objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes are loaded

For more information see {{java:Class}}.

The most popular use of the {{java:Class}} is to find out the object's class name during runtime.
 {{java:import}} com.yourCompany.Customer;
 ...
 Object obj = new Customer();
 ...
 System.out.println( &quot;Name:&quot; + obj.getClass().getName() );
The output:
 Name: com.yourCompany.Customer

== hashCode() Method ==

In most cases you should not override this method, since the default implementation of this method returns a unique number for the object. The number is used when the object is put into a [[Java Programming/Collection Classes|collection]].  Finding an object in a big collection may take a while, if objects are compared one by one sequentially.  To speed the search up, objects may be placed in a tree structure, weighted by an integer hash code.  Comparing the hash code while navigating through the tree, the number of object comparisons can be reduced.
    _______ A _____
    |              |  
 __ B__          __C__
 |     |        |     |
 D     E        F     G
 ...  ...      ...   ...
To give you a general idea of how it may work, see the above diagram. Let's say we are searching object G.  If at each 'node' of the tree we can decide which way to go, then by '''3 steps''' we reach the object G.

By constrast in a linear search:
 A --- B  ----- C  ---- C  ---- D  ---- E ---- F ---- G
We would need '''8 steps''' to reach the object G.

So the search will be faster with the tree structure. Adding a new object however, will be slower because the tree structure needs to be maintained. The place of the new object in the tree has to be found first.

== toString() Methods ==

This method can be used to convert an object to a {{java:String}}.  It is automatically used in many places to convert objects to String; for example: in PrintStream, in StringBuffer, and for the string concatenation operator when used on objects.

The default implementation returns a weird string with the class name and the hash code.

For example:
 {{java:String}} str = &quot;This customer is &quot; + objCust;
The &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method is called on the &lt;code&gt;objCust&lt;/code&gt; object.

The &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method can also be used for debugging:
 {{java:public}} {{java:class}} Customer
 {
    {{java:private}} {{java:String}} _name;
    {{java:private}} {{java:String}} _address;
    {{java:private}} {{java:String}} _age;
 ...
    {{java:public}} {{java:String}} '''toString'''()
    {
        StringBuffer buf = StringBuffer();
        buf.append( &quot;Name   = &quot; );  buf.append( _name );     buf.append( &quot;\n&quot; );
        buf.append( &quot;Address= &quot; );  buf.append( _address );  buf.append( &quot;\n&quot; );
        buf.append( &quot;Age    = &quot; );  buf.append( _age );      buf.append( &quot;\n&quot; );
     ...
        return buf.toString();
    }
 ...
 }
After that whenever in your code, you want to see what a customer object is, just call:
 System.out.println( objCustomer );

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Afrikaans uses the [[w:Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], the same one as English. The Afrikaans alphabet has the 26 letters in English, as well as eight accented letters: è, é, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, and û.

==How many people speak this language?==
[[File:Afrikaans ETN15 Spread.svg|300x300px|thumbnail|right|The blue colours on the map show where most of the Afrikaans speaking population live (South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana).]]
Over 10 million people speak Afrikaans.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Afrikaans is spoken mostly in [[w:Namibia|Namibia]], [[w:South Africa|South Africa]], and a bit of [[w:Botswana|Botswana]]. There are also tiny pockets of Afrikaans-speaking communities in [[w:Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]], [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], and the [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. It should be noted that Afrikaans does not have a majority of speakers anywhere, as in South Africa, it is one out of 11 official languages, and in Namibia and Botswana, it is treated as one of several minority languages (A minority language in the U.K. would be Irish, or in the U.S., any Native American language.).

== What is the history of the language? ==
The Dutch spoken in 17th century South Africa slowly moved away from 17th century [[Wikijunior:Languages/Dutch|Standard Dutch]] to what is now known as Afrikaans. When Afrikaans was recognised as an independent language, the Dutch called it a &quot;Kitchen language&quot; (''Kombuistaal'') until the mid 1950s. The Dutch named it so because it was so rare to find speakers of it that the educational system in South Africa barely acknowledged it. 

It is estimated that 90-95% of Afrikaans vocabulary comes from Dutch. but has also influences from other languages including: [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]], [[w:Malay|Malay]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/Portuguese|Portuguese]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/German|German]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/French|French]], and some African languages. Afrikaans acquired its Malay influence because most of the people who spoke Afrikaans in the beginning of its creation were mostly Asian slaves whose first language was Malay.  

Until the 19th century, Afrikaans was only used as a spoken language, and Dutch was used as the formal and written language. In 1925, it became the official language of South Africa, along with English. Being based on Dutch, Afrikaans is part of the Indo-European family, and the Germanic group of languages (English, German, Dutch, etc.). Afrikaans is used by all races.

1933 was a major milestone for Afrikaans; the entire Bible was translated into the language. Another revision was made in 1983, and the 1983 revision is the bible that most Afrikaans-speakers use today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is very lacking, considering the abundance of information on wikipedia, and across the web on this topic, here are some notes I took, however I do not feel very confident nor competent to enter them into this text.
Notes on Cell types:
Parenchyma cells are generalized plant cells that are essentially the most basic plant cells containing all necessary structures, a parenchyma with chloroplasts (thus one that conducts photosynthisis) are called chlorencyma.
Collenchyma a parenchyma that has thickened walls that allow for the support and stucture of the plant.
Sclerenchyma lignified dead parenchyma which form large fibers which allow for increased support for the stucture of the system.
Epidermal tissues are simply the skin of the plant, they cover and protect it.
Cork an amalgamation of tightly packed dead parenchyma and epidermal cells found in the inner bark which allows for improved insulation and helps to prevent the loss of water and other nutrients in larger wooded plants.
Xylem is a tissue responsible for the transport of water (and other nutrients) across the plant system, it is primarily composed of tracheary cells, Xylem Tracheid and Xylem Vessels. All tracheary cells have lignified cell walls and the absence of a protoplast. Due to the lignified cells walls the xylem tissue aids in supporting the plant system. Xylem trachied are long, 1mm in length, cells which allow for the transport of nutrients throughout the plant, and hold water against gravity by means of adhesion.

== First Example ==

IMO the first example is too complicated and not as introductory as it could be. Sure, it introduces a lot of literals, but I think it is simply too potentially confusing because of the fact that it is parsing code, which might be a mysterious concept to newbie programmers. --[[Special:Contributions/108.184.91.21|108.184.91.21]] ([[User talk:108.184.91.21|discuss]]) 01:56, 1 October 2013 (UTC)

The definition of statement on this page is incorrect, take a look [http://www.artima.com/objectsandjava/webuscript/ExpressionsStatements1.html here] for more details. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 20:06, 16 February 2010 (UTC)
: To my utmost knowledge, the definition of ''statement'' on this page is as per your provided reference. In your reference, it states that a statement is a ''&amp;lsquo;single unit of instruction&amp;rsquo;'' that is then ''&amp;lsquo;terminated with a semicolon&amp;rsquo;''. This compares to exactly what the text on this page says about this in a particularly laymen&amp;rsquo;s term. Please note that when Bill Venners starts talking about blocks, &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;try..catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks, he actually refers to ''statement&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;'' (in plural). &amp;ndash; [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 00:44, 22 February 2010 (UTC)
:: Looks like I just glazed over the definition and didn't look carefully enough, sorry. So would I be right in saying a statement is something that is executed quite often ''uses'' expressions &lt;code&gt;if (expression) { statements }&lt;/code&gt;. If so I think I already knew that and simply managed to confuse myself, feel free to delete this section when you've read it --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 21:58, 8 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Libraries Reference}}

The module Data.Map provides the &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; datatype, which allows you to store ''values'' attached to specific ''keys''. This is called a lookup table, dictionary or associative array in other languages. 

== Motivation ==
Very often it would be useful to have some kind of data structure that relates a value or list of values to a specific key. This is often called a dictionary after the real-world example: a real-life dictionary associates a definition (the value) to each word (the key); we say the dictionary is a ''map from words to definitions''. A filesystem driver might keep a map from filenames to file information. A phonebook application might keep a map from contact names to phone numbers. Maps are a very versatile and useful datatype.

=== Why not just &lt;code&gt;[(a, b)]&lt;/code&gt;? ===
You may have seen in other chapters that a list of pairs (or 'lookup table') is often used as a kind of map, along with the function &lt;code&gt;lookup :: [(a, b)] -&gt; a -&gt; Maybe b&lt;/code&gt;. So why not just use a lookup table all the time? Here are a few reasons:

* Working with maps gives you access to a whole load more useful functions for working with lookup tables.
* Maps are implemented far more efficiently than a lookup table would be, both in terms of speed and the amount of memory it takes up.

== Definition ==
Internally, maps are defined using a complicated datatype called a ''balanced tree'' for efficiency reasons, so we don't give the details here.

== Library functions ==
The module Data.Map provides an absolute wealth of functions for dealing with Maps, including setlike operations like unions and intersections. There are so many we don't include a list here; instead the reader is deferred to the [http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/containers/Data-Map.html hierarchical libraries documentation] for Data.Map.

== Example ==
The following example implements a password database. The user is assumed to be trusted, so is not authenticated and has access to view or change passwords.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 {- A quick note for the over-eager refactorers out there: This is (somewhat)
    intentionally ugly. It doesn't use the State monad to hold the DB because it
    hasn't been introduced yet. Perhaps we could use this as an example of How
    Monads Improve Things? -}
 
 module PassDB where
 
 import qualified Data.Map as M
 import System.Exit
 
 type UserName = String
 type Password = String
 type PassDB   = M.Map UserName Password 
   -- PassBD is a map from usernames to passwords
 
 -- | Ask the user for a username and new password, and return the new PassDB
 changePass :: PassDB -&gt; IO PassDB
 changePass db = do
   putStrLn &quot;Enter a username and new password to change.&quot;
   putStr &quot;Username: &quot;
   un &lt;- getLine
   putStrLn &quot;New password: &quot;
   pw &lt;- getLine
   if un `M.member` db               -- if un is one of the keys of the map
     then return $ M.insert un pw db -- then update the value with the new password
     else do putStrLn $ &quot;Can't find username '&quot; ++ un ++ &quot;' in the database.&quot;
             return db
 
 -- | Ask the user for a username, whose password will be displayed.
 viewPass :: PassDB -&gt; IO ()

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Libraries Reference}}

The '''List''' datatype (see [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-List.html Data.List]) is the fundamental data structure in Haskell — this is the basic building-block of data storage and manipulation. In computer science terms it is a singly-linked list. In the hierarchical library system the List module is stored in &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt;; but this module only contains utility functions. The definition of list itself is integral to the Haskell language.

== Theory ==

A singly-linked list is a set of values in a defined order. The list can only be traversed in one direction (i.e., you cannot move back and forth through the list like tape in a cassette machine).

The list of the first 5 positive integers is written as
 [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
We can move through this list, examining and changing values, from left to right, but not in the other direction. This means that the list
 [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
is not just a trivial change in perspective from the previous list, but the result of significant computation (''O(n)'' in the length of the list).

== Definition ==

The polymorphic list datatype can be defined with the following recursive definition:
 data [a] = []
          | a : [a]
The &quot;base case&quot; for this definition is &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, the empty list. In order to put something into this list, we use the &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; constructor
 emptyList = []
 oneElem = 1:[]
The &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced ''cons'') is right-associative, so that creating multi-element lists can be done like
 manyElems = 1:2:3:4:5:[]
or even just
 manyElems' = [1,2,3,4,5]

== Basic list usage ==
=== Prepending ===
It's easy to hard-code lists without cons, but run-time list creation will use cons. For example, to push an argument onto a simulated stack, we would use:
 push :: Arg -&gt; [Arg] -&gt; [Arg]
 push arg stack = arg:stack

=== Pattern-matching ===
If we want to examine the top of the stack, we would typically use a peek function. We can try pattern-matching for this.
 peek :: [Arg] -&gt; Maybe Arg
 peek [] = Nothing
 peek (a:as) = Just a
The &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; before the ''cons'' in the pattern matches the head of the list. The &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; matches the tail of the list. Since we don't actually want the tail (and it's not referenced anywhere else in the code), we can tell the compiler this explicitly, by using a wild-card match, in the form of an underscore:
 peek (a:_) = Just a

== List utilities ==
''FIXME: is this not covered in the chapter on [[Haskell/List processing| list manipulation]]?''
=== Maps ===
=== Folds, unfolds and scans ===
=== Length, head, tail etc. ===

      <comment>deprecating prettytable, replaced: prettytable → wikitable</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a way of making a much more distictive signal form a ordinary astable signals. It needs at least two astables, with one set to a significantly higher frequency than the other. If the output of the astable with the longer period (lower freqency) is connected to the Pin 4 reset pin of the second astable, the following result is obtained:

[[image:Double Astable Bleeper.svg|center|500px]]

The slave astable will not actually give the second signal, the master turns the output of this astable off when it is not giving a high itself, but this signal represents the ouput of the second astable if it had Pin 4 permanently connected high.

The output can provide a distinctive sound when passed through a buzzer, something like &quot;''dee-dee-dee-----dee-dee-dee...''&quot; or a noticable flashing sequnece when passed through LEDs - ideal for a bike light or such. The number of short pulses per train and the length of the train is dependent on the values used for each stage.

Below is the circuit diagram for a standard astable bleeper with two stages and a master freqency of about 1Hz and a slave frequency of about 4Hz.

|}

The entire circuit can be made using only one IC by using a 556 timer IC, which contians two identical 555 circuits. The circuit will be the same, but the pin numbers will be different.

A similar result can be obtained using the two astables and an AND [[/Practical Electronics/Logic/Transmission Gates|transmission gate]], but this requires more ICs and it also means that you may get out-of-sync signals. Imagine the second signal shifted slightly to the left in the above diagram - the output would have two short pulses at the start and end of the train, and two longer ones in the middle. This may not be disatrous, but if the shift &quot;drifts&quot; slowly over time it would not be ideal, as the number of pulses be cycle would vary. This shift could occur if the two astables were not prefectly in sync. The action of the reset pin &quot;zeroes&quot; the second astable each time the master goes high, preventing this creep happening.

==Grammar: Personal Pronouns==
Spanish has six different types of pronouns.

{{Spanish Grammar|1=Los Pronombres|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;'''English equivalent'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;'''Spanish equivalent'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1st person singular (1)'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2nd person singular (2)'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''singular'' you (informal)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tú&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3rd person singular (3)'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;he, she, you (formal)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;él, ella, usted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1st person plural (4)'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;we&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;nosotros, nosotras&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2nd person plural (5)'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''plural'' you (informal)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;vosotros, vosotras&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3rd person plural (6)'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;they, you (formal)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ellos, ellas, ustedes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}
&lt;/br&gt;

'''A few things to keep in mind:'''
* It is normal in Spanish to omit the personal pronoun (i.e. you seldom say &lt;b&gt;yo estoy bien&lt;/b&gt; but &lt;b&gt;estoy bien&lt;/b&gt;, and you ask &lt;b&gt;¿Cómo se llama?&lt;/b&gt; instead of &lt;b&gt;¿Cómo se llama usted?&lt;/b&gt;) because the specific conjugation of a verb usually indicates which person is the subject. However, usted, él and ella all use the same verb form so if you choose to drop the pronoun in this case it must be clear in the situational context which pronoun is being referenced.
* In most of Spain the vosotros form can be used to address a group of familiar people (e.g. friends), and ustedes is used with more formality (e.g. recent acquaintances). In all Latin American countries and parts of Spain ustedes is used also for a familiar group of people; in these countries the &quot;vosotros&quot; form is almost never used.
* In Argentina and parts of Uruguay, the ''tu'' form is replaced with ''vos.''
* ''Usted'' and ''ustedes'' can be abbreviated as ''Ud.'' and ''Uds.'', respectively.

==Grammar: Verbs ser and estar==

Spanish has two different words that can be translated with &quot;''to be''&quot;.
'''Ser''' is used more for more permanent characteristics (&quot;''Soy Luis''&quot;) whereas '''estar''' is used for more temporary or changeable conditions, such as location (&quot;''La papelera está al lado del escritorio''&quot;, &quot;The trash can is beside the desk&quot;) and  feeling (&quot;''Estoy bien''&quot;). In future lessons we will come back to the uses of ser and estar. 

Here we will look at the conjugations in the ''present indicative''.

==Hay==

Spanish uses a different verb ('''haber''') to express &quot;''there is ''&quot; and &quot;''there are''&quot;. The form of '''haber''' used for this purpose is '''hay,''' for both singular (&quot;''there is''&quot;) and plural (&quot;''there are''&quot;).

''Ñ'' should always be alphabetized after ''N'' no matter where it appears in the word (e.g., ''muñeca'' goes after ''mundo''). ''RR'' is considered a letter in the Spanish language, but there are no words beginning with this letter. It is alphabetized after ''R'' (e.g., ''carro'' comes after ''caro'').

|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F3F5DE&quot;|
''CH'' and ''LL'' used to be considered as distinct letters of the alphabet, but in 1994, the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) declared that ''CH'' and ''LL'' were not letters but [[w:Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Accordingly, words beginning with ''CH'' and ''LL'' are now alphabetized under ''C'' and ''L'', respectively.

|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
''K'' and ''W'' are part of the alphabet but are mostly seen in foreign derived words and names, such as karate and whisky. For instances, kilo is commonly used in Mexico to refer to a kilogram.

Although the above will get you understood, proper pronunciation of Spanish consonants is a bit more complicated:

Most of the consonants are pronounced as they are in American English with these exceptions:
*'''b''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n''; otherwise closer to ''v'' (in Latin America there's no distinction)
*'''c''' before '''a''', '''o''', '''u''' and other consonants, like English ''k''
*'''c''' before '''i''' and '''e''' like English ''th'' in “think” (in Latin America is like English ''s'')
*'''ch''' like ''ch'' in “cheese”
*'''d''' between vowels (even if it starts a word following a word ending in a vowel) or at the end of a word, like English ''d'' in dental
*'''g''' before '''e''' or '''i''' like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in “loch”, except that it is voiced
*'''g''' before '''a''' or '''o''' like ''g'' in “get”
*'''h''' is always silent (except in the digraf ''ch'')
*'''j''' like the ''h'' in hotel
*'''ll''' is pronounced like English y in “yes”
*'''ñ''' like nio in “onion” (or gn in French cognac)
*'''q''' like the English ''k''
*'''r''' slighty trilled; like a soft ''d'' except at the beginning of a word or after '''l''', '''n''' or '''s''' where it is trilled
*'''rr''' should be trilled longer than a single ''r''
*'''v''' is pronounced like a cross between a ''v'' and a ''b''
*'''z''' like the English ''th'' (in Latin America is like English ''s'')

==Vowel pronunciation==
The pronunciation of vowels is as follows:

*'''a''' [a] &quot;''La Mano''&quot; as in &quot;Kahn&quot;          (ah)
*'''e''' [e] &quot;''Mente''&quot; as the ''ay'' in &quot;day&quot;  (e)
*'''i''' [i] &quot;''Sin''&quot; as the ''ea'' in &quot;lean&quot;   (i)
*'''o''' [o] &quot;''Como''&quot; as in &quot;no&quot;.              (short o)
*'''u''' [u] &quot;''Lunes''&quot; as in &quot;toon&quot; or &quot;loom&quot;  (oo)
The &quot;u&quot; is always silent after &quot;q&quot; (as in &quot;qué&quot; pronounced kā). 

Spanish also uses the ¨ (diaeresis) diacritic mark over the vowel u to indicate that it is pronounced separately in places where it would normally be silent. For example, in words such as ''vergüenza'' (&quot;shame&quot;) or ''pingüino'' (&quot;penguin&quot;), the u is pronounced as in the English &quot;w&quot; and so forms a diphthong with the following vowel: [we] and [wi] respectively. It is also used to preserve sound in stem changes and in commands.

==Semi-Vowels==

*'''y''' [j] &quot;''Rey''&quot; as in the y of &quot;yet&quot;.

==Acute accents==
Spanish uses the ´ (Acute) diacritic mark over vowels to indicate a vocal stress on a word that would normally be stressed on another syllable; Stress is contrastive. For example, the word ''ánimo'' is normally stressed on ''a'', meaning &quot;mood, spirit.&quot; While ''animo'' is stressed on ''ni'' meaning &quot;I cheer.&quot; And ''animó'' is stressed on ''mó'' meaning &quot;he cheered.&quot; {{Audio||listen}}

Additionally the acute mark is used to disambiguate certain words which would otherwise be homographs. It's used in various question word or relative pronoun pairs such as ''cómo'' (how?)&amp; ''como'' (as), ''dónde''(where?) &amp; ''donde'' (where), and some other words such as ''tú'' (you) &amp; ''tu'' (your), ''él'' (he/him) &amp; ''el'' (the).

==Emphasis==

The rules of stress in Spanish are:

1. When the word ends in a vowel or in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot; the emphasis falls on the second to last syllable.

Eg: Mañana, Como, Dedos, Hablan.

2. When the word ends in a consonant other than &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, the emphasis falls on the last syllable.

Eg: Ciudad, Comer, Reptil.

3. If the above two rules don't apply, there will be an accent to show the stress.

Eg: Fíjate, Inglés, Teléfono.

4. '''SPECIAL CASE''': Adverbs ending in ''-mente'', which are derived from adjectives, have two stresses. The first stress occurs in the ''adjective part'' of the adverb, on the syllable where the adjective would normally be stressed. The second stress occurs on the ''-men-'' syllable.

Eg: Solamente, Felizmente, Cortésmente.

==== The Indefinite Article ====

In English the indefinite articles are ''a'' and ''an'' (singular) or ''some'' (plural).
In Spanish there are different forms for masculine-gender, feminine-gender, singular or plural.

|-

|-
|unas niñas
|''some girls''
|}
&lt;br&gt;
For phonetic reasons some words beginning with accented '''a''' may have the article '''un''': un ave blanca ''(a white bird),'' las aves blancas ''(the white birds)''. This is basically the same idea as '''el ave blanca''' ''(the white bird)''.

Remember, do not confuse uno ''(one)'' with un ''(a or an)''.&lt;br&gt;
Also, do not confuse una ''(a or an)'' with uña ''(fingernail)''.

== Text ==

Here are a couple of sentences and short dialogs about people planning/doing leisure activities. Besides the new vocabulary you should also have a look at how the verbs are conjugated depending on the subject of the sentence.

{{Spanish Dialogue|1=Los Verbos|2=Maria '''viaja''' a México&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Luis'': ¿Qué '''hacen''' por la noche?&lt;br&gt;''Ana y Carmen'': Nosotras '''bailamos''' en la fiesta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Raúl'': ¿Qué '''haces''' mañana?&lt;br&gt;''Carlos'': Mañana '''practico''' al tenis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marco '''mira''' la televisión porque hace mal tiempo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pedro y Mario '''toman''' unos refrescos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rosalía '''escribe''' a sus padres los domingos.}}

As you may see, each verb is bolded. These verbs are ''conjugated'', that is, changed by the person(s) to which they are referring. Notice that subject pronouns are ''not'' necessary.

===Regular Verbs===

Spanish has three different types of regular verbs: '''-ar''', '''-er''', and '''-ir''' verbs. The subject pronoun is not necessary and in conversational Spanish it is only used for emphasis, for this lesson, we will omit it. One can still use pronouns, however. The conjugation pattern is the
following:

{{Spanish Grammar|1=El presente regular|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-ar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-er'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-ir'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Infinitive''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''hablar''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''comer''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''vivir''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;English&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to talk&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to eat&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to live&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''as'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''es'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''es'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''a'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''e'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''e'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''amos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''emos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''imos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''ais'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''eis'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''ís'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''an'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''en'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''en'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}
&lt;/br&gt;

As one can see, the endings for each person are different. This is similar to other Romance languages, such as Portuguese and Italian (the notable exception is French). This is the reason why we may omit the pronouns while we speak. Remember that sometimes it is best to clarify whether él, ella, or usted is speaking, because they share the same form. However, the context of the rest of the sentence sometimes clarifies this. There are a few steps involved with conjugating a verb. Here are the steps involved:
# Take the ending off of the infinitive. This is either an -ar, -er, or -ir.
# Without the -ar, -er, or -ir, the verb is in its ''base'' form.
# Add the appropriate ending to the base of the verb.

Notice that there are only two differences between the conjugations of -er and -ir verbs. The ''nosotros'' (4) and ''vosotros'' (5) forms are the only differences. Those forms have an &quot;i&quot; in the stem instead of an &quot;e.&quot; 

'''Exercise''': [[Spanish/Exercises/Regular Verbs|Regular Verbs]]

===&quot;G&quot; Verbs===
The verb ''hacer'' means to do or to make. Hacer is irregular in the first person singular form ''(I)'' of the present tense only. The irregular form is '''hago'''. Hacer is one of the many verbs in Spanish which add a &quot;g&quot; in the first person singular of the verb. This is the present indicative of the verb '''hacer'''.
{{Spanish Grammar|1=El verbo hacer|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''Verb form'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ha'''g'''o&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;haces&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hace&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hacemos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;haceis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hacen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}

Note that the verb '''hacer''' is translated as ''to do'' and ''to make'' when
referring to activities. But it can also be used to talk
about weather conditions:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!El Tiempo
!The Weather
|-
|Hace buen tiempo.
|The weather is good.
|-
|Hace mal tiempo.
|The weather is bad.
|-
|Hace frío.
|It's cold.
|-
|Hace fresco.
|It's chilly.
|-
|Hace calor.
|It's hot.
|-
|Hace sol.
|It's sunny.
|-
|Hace nublado.
|It's cloudy.
|-
|Hace viento.
|It's windy.
|}

When speaking about the weather using '''hacer''', the Ud. form (third singular form) is always used.

==Stem Changing Verbs==

In Spanish, some verbs change their stems when they are conjugated. These verbs are known as ''stem-changing verbs''. Many of these verbs are important and often used. There are three different types of stem changing verbs in Spanish:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''Cambios de los Verbos'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Types of Stem-Changing Verbs&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;e → ie&lt;br&gt;
e → i&lt;br&gt;
o → ue&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The stem changes for all conjugations, excepting '''nosotros/as''' and '''vosotros/as'''. The endings are the same as for regular verbs ('''-o''' for '''yo''', '''-as/-es''' for '''tú''', ...). 

&lt;big&gt; '''Entender'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Understand

    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You understand&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;We understand&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;nosotros entend&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;emos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (pl.) understand&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;vosotros entend&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;eis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They understand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;ellos ent'''ie'''nd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (pl form) understand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Ustedes ent'''ie'''nd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Note that the stem change is done for the second 'e' (not the first one) - in general the stem always changes for the last vowel before the '''-ar/-er/-ir''' ending.

'''Example''': pedir (e-&gt;i) ''to ask for, to order''

&lt;big&gt; '''Pedir'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Ask For, Order

==Present Participle==

The present participle in Spanish is used either for continuous tenses (with ''estar'', e.g. ''I am running.'') and can also be used as an adjective. The Spanish present participle corresponds to the English '''-ing''' form of the verb.To form the present participle for regular '''-ar''' verbs, add '''-ando''' to the stem. For '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs add '''-iendo''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''El Participio Presente'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;-ing&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;hablar →  hablando&lt;br&gt;
comer →  comiendo&lt;br&gt;
vivir →  viviendo&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;speaking&lt;br&gt;
eating&lt;br&gt;
living&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, not all present participles are that regular. Some verbs add a &quot;y,&quot; or change the spelling, to adhere to Spanish orthography (spelling) rules. Here is a list of some common verbs that have an irregular present participle:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top

|-

{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot;

|-

|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;cayendo&lt;br&gt;

riendo&lt;br&gt;
siguiendo&lt;br&gt;
trayendo&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Present Progressive==

Like in English, the Spanish present progressive is used to describe an ''action in progress''.
It is formed by conjugating the verb '''estar''' and then adding the present participle:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #7FFFD4; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''El Presente Progresivo'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Talking about actions occurring right now&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;Yo estoy hablando&lt;br&gt;
Tú estás hablando&lt;br&gt;
Él/ella/usted está hablando&lt;br&gt;
Nosotros estamos hablando&lt;br&gt;
Vosotros estáis hablando&lt;br&gt;
Ellos/ellas/ustedes están hablando&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;I am talking&lt;br&gt;
You are talking&lt;br&gt;
He/She/You is/are talking&lt;br&gt;

== Grammar - Questions ==

Like in English, yes/no questions in Spanish are formed by switching
the position of subject and verb (if the subject is explicit). Unlike English, Spanish uses a
reversed question mark ('''¿''') at the beginning of a question:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Tú eres de México.
|''You are from Mexico.''
|-
|Eres de México.
|''You are from Mexico.''
|}
become

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|¿Eres tú de México?
|''Are you from Mexico?''
|-
|¿Eres de México?''
|''Are you from Mexico?''
|}

For other type of questions Spanish uses the following question words (note that all of them have an accent in the word):

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Cómo...? or ¿Qué...?	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''How...?'' or ''What...?''	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Cuándo...?	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''When...?''		&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Cuánto...?     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''How much...?''	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Cuántos...? 	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''How many...?''	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Dónde...? 	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Where...?''		&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Por qué...? 	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Why...?''		&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Quién...?  	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Who...? (singular)''	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Quiénes...?  	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Who...? (plural)''	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Here are some Spanish sentences where specific question words are used:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Cómo te llamas?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''What is your name?'' (Literally: ''How do you call yourself?)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Cuántos años tienes?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''How old are you?'' (Literally: ''How many years do you have?'')&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;¿Dónde está el aeropuerto?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Where is the airport?''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Questions can also be posed within a sentence:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Y tú, ¿cuántos años tienes?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''How old are you?'' (Literally: ''And you, how many years do you have?'')&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Entonces, ¿por qué no puedo jugar con él?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''So, why can't I play with him?''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Grammar - Possessive Adjectives ==

Like English, the Spanish possessive adjectives differ depending on the person they are referring to. Unlike English, the possessive article also changes depending on the number of items that one possesses (for example: '''mi libro''' = ''my book'', '''mis libros''' = ''my books''). It can also change depending on the gender of the item (for example: '''nuestro perro''' = ''our dog'', '''nuestra casa''' = ''our house''').
The following table summarizes all Spanish possessive adjectives:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Person	            &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Singular    &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Plural        &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;English	&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;
  Examples&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yo     		    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;mi          &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;mis           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;my		&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  mi lápiz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tú     		    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;tu          &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;tus           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;your	&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  tu lápiz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;él&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;su, de él&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sus           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  su lápiz, el lápiz de él&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ella&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;su, de ella&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sus, de ella&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  su lápiz, el lápiz de ella&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;usted&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;su, de usted&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sus, de usted&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  su lápiz, el lápiz de usted&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nosotros/nosotras   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;nuestro, nuestra, de nosotros  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  nuestros, nuestras&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;our		&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;nuestro lápiz, el lápiz de 
  nosotros&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vosotros/vosotras   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vuestro, vuestra&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vuestros, vuestras  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;your	&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  vuestro lápiz&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ellos &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;su, de ellos&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sus, de ellos&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;their	&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  su lápiz, el lápiz de ellos&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ellas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;su, de ellas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sus, de ellas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  su lápiz, el lápiz de ellas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ustedes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;su, de ustedes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sus, de ustedes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  su lápiz, el lápiz de ustedes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

*Possessive Pronouns are &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; used when talking about body parts:&lt;br&gt;

== Grammar - Comparisons ==

=== Equality ===

Spanish uses three slightly different constructions for comparisons of equality. One for comparing verbs,
one for comparing nouns and one for comparing adjectives/adverbs. The following examples
show the three different possibilities:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Alberto estudia '''tanto como''' Felicitas.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Alberto studies as much as Felicitas.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yo tengo '''tanto''' dinero '''como''' mi hermano.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I have as much money as my brother.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;La estudiante es '''tan''' inteligente '''como''' el profesor.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''The student is as intelligent as the teacher.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

When comparing nouns, the ending of '''tanto''' will be modified to '''tanta''', '''tantos''',
or '''tantas''' in order to match gender and quantity of the noun. The general pattern for comparisons
of equality is the following:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{verb} '''tanto como'''                &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{verb} ''as much as''           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tanto/a/os/as''' {noun} '''como'''  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''as much/as many'' {noun} ''as''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tan''' {adjective/adverb} '''como'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''as'' {adjective/adverb} ''as'' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Inequality ===

For comparisons of inequality, Spanish uses the same form for both nouns and adjectives/adverbs. There
are two types of inequalities: '''más ... que''' (''more than'') and '''menos ... que''' (''less than''):

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trabajo '''más''' horas '''que''' tú.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I work more hours than you.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trabajo '''menos''' horas '''que''' tú.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I work less hours than you.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tom Hanks es '''más''' famoso '''que''' Patrick Stewart.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Tom Hanks is more famous than Patrick Stewart.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Patrick Stewart es '''menos''' famoso '''que''' Tom Hanks.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Patrick Stewart is less famous than Tom Hanks.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In general:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''más/menos''' {noun/adjective/adverb} '''que'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''more/less'' {noun/adjective/adverb} ''than''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Superlatives ===

Superlatives in Spanish are similar to comparisons of inequality: They use '''más''' for ''the most'',
'''menos''' for ''the least''. Then follows the adjective and finally there is a preposition ('''de'''):

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ricardo es el estudiante '''más''' alto '''de''' la universidad.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Ricardo is the tallest student in the university.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plutón es el planeta '''más''' pequeño '''del''' sistema solar.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Pluto is the smallest planet in the solar system.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Los diamantes son las gemas '''más''' caras '''del''' mundo.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Diamonds are the most expensive gems in the world.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;María es la '''más''' inteligente '''de''' la clase.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Maria is the most intelligent one in the class.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;El libro de Jorge es el '''menos''' interesante '''de''' la clase.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Jorge's book is the least interesting book in the class.''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

Note that in some cases ('''la más inteligente''') you can just write the article and omit the noun. The
general pattern for Spanish superlatives is:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''el/la/los/las''' ({noun}) '''más/menos''' {adjective} '''de'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''the (most/least)''{adjective} {noun} ''in/of''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

== Grammar - Object Pronouns ==

=== Direct Object Pronouns ===

While the subject of a sentence ''initiates'' an action (the verb), the
direct object is the one that is ''affected'' by the action. A direct
object pronoun is used to refer to the direct object of a previous sentence:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 El chico come '''la manzana'''.&lt;br&gt;
 Él '''la''' come.
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 ''The boy eats'' '''''the apple''''' ''.''&lt;br&gt;
 ''He eats'' '''''it''''' ''.''
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The following table shows the six types of direct object pronouns:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  Object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''me'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''me''            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tú&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''te'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you''           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;él&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''le/lo'''  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''him/it''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ella&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''la'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;her/it&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;usted&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''lo/la'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;you&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nosotros&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''nos'''    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''us, we''            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vosotros&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''os'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you (plural)''           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ellos&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''les/los'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''them (masculine)''      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ellas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''las'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''them (feminine)''      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ustedes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''les/los/las'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Note: In Spain, ''le'' and ''les'' are used as the masculine direct object pronoun only when referring to people. If the antecedent of a direct object is masculine but non-human, ''lo'' or ''los'' are used instead. In most other Spanish speaking places, ''lo'' and ''los'' are used instead of ''le'' and ''les''.

=== Indirect Object Pronouns ===

An indirect object is an object that would be asked for with
''To whom...?'' or ''From whom...?''. It is called ''indirect'' because
it occurs usually together with a direct object which is affected directly
by the action: 

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 La mujer da una manzana '''al chico'''.&lt;br&gt;
 La mujer '''le''' da una manzana.
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 ''The woman gives an apple'' '''''to the boy''''' ''.''&lt;br&gt;
 ''The woman gives'' '''''him''''' ''an apple''.
 &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The apple ''is given'' by the woman (direct). The boy gets
the ''given apple'' (indirect - depends on the apple being given).

Here is a table with all of the Spanish indirect object pronouns:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  Indirect Object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''me'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''to/from me''         &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tú&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''te'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''to/from you''        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;él/ella/usted&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''le'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''to/from him/her/you''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nosotros/nosotras&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''nos'''    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''to/from us''         &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vosotros/vosotras&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''os'''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''to/from you''        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ellos/ellas/ustedes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''les'''    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''to/from them/you''   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Position Of Object Pronouns (Double Object Pronouns) ===

So far we have only seen sentences with one object pronoun. If there is
both a direct and an indirect object pronoun, the indirect pronoun usually comes
first:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Te''' compro una bicicleta .&lt;br&gt;
'''Te''' '''la''' compro.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
''I buy you a bike.''&lt;br&gt;
''I buy it for you.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Also, when both object pronouns are in the third person (either singular or plural),
the indirect pronoun changes from '''le/les''' to '''se''':

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
El profesor '''le''' da unos libros.&lt;br&gt;
El profesor '''se''' '''los''' da.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
''The professor gives her the books.''&lt;br&gt;
''The professor gives them to her.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In sentences that contain an infinitive or a participle, the object
pronoun may be either '''placed before''' the conjugated verb or it
maybe '''attached''' to the infinitive/participle:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Carmen puede cantar el himno nacional.&lt;br&gt;
Carmen puede '''cantarlo'''. '''''or''''' Carmen '''lo''' puede cantar.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
''Carmen can sing the national anthem.''&lt;br&gt;
''Carmen can sing it.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

It is possible to have the two rules above working at the same time: A combination
of direct and indirect pronouns that is attached to an infinitive/participle:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Quiero mostrarte una casa.&lt;br&gt;
Quiero '''mostrártela'''.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
''I want to show you a house.''&lt;br&gt;
''I want to show it to you.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;la comida (la cena)          &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dinner, main meal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;comer (cenar)                &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to eat, to have dinner&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Instead of saying ''desayuno, comida y cena'' (Spain) or ''desayuno, almuerzo y comida'' (Chile, Colombia), it's safer to say ''desayuno, almuerzo y cena''.
&amp;nbsp;

The word ''comida'' has several meanings
*'''food''' ''Me gusta la comida mexicana''
*'''meal''' ''El desayuno es la principal comida del día''
*'''lunch''' ''La comida es a las 2 PM''
*'''dinner''' ''La comida es a las 9 PM''

&lt;/table&gt;

Note that due to the pervasive influence of English, in many supermarkets there is a section called ''Vegetales'' instead of ''Verduras''. They mistranslate '''vegetable''', forgetting that this is not the same as English '''vegetal''' (relating to plants).

*&lt;b&gt;Legumbres&lt;/b&gt; means the same thing as &lt;b&gt;verduras&lt;/b&gt; (vegetables).

== Grammar - Preterite (el pretérito indefinido) ==

The following table shows the preterite of regular verbs. Regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern. Note that the '''nosotros'''
form is the same as in the present tense for '''-ar''' and '''-ir''' verbs, so you have to know the context to
figure out the time. Also, note that the last letter of '''comí''' and '''viví''' has an accent mark.

== Grammar - Imperfect (el pretérito imperfecto)==

The following table shows the imperfect of regular verbs. Note that regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;habl''ar'' &lt;br&gt;(-ar)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;com''er'' &lt;br&gt;(-er) &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to eat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;viv''ir'' &lt;br&gt;(-ir)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to live&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yo           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;hablaba      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I was talking''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;comía      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I was eating''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vivía      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I was living''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

There are only three verbs that are irregular in the imperfect:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;

== Grammar - Preterite vs. Imperfect ==

Spanish has two tenses that correspond to the English ''simple past''. Roughly speaking,
the '''Preterite''' is used to tell '''What happened''' - it refers to a '''specific''' event.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Preterite''' is used for...
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Example'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
A specific event
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Ayer, yo '''comí''' una hamburguesa.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Beginning/end of an event
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
La fiesta '''terminó''' a las tres de la mañana.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
A series of events
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Carlos '''salió''' de la universidad, '''compró''' unas ropas y '''volvió''' a casa.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Preterite                     &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Key words                     &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''esta mañana             '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''this morning              ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''anoche                  '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''last night                ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ayer                    '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''yesterday                 ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''el otro día             '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''the other day             ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''el lunes pasado         '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''last Monday               ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''la semana pasada        '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''last week                 ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''el mes pasado           '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''last month                ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''el año pasado           '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''last year                 ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''hace dos años           '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''two years ago             ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''en ese momento          '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''at that moment            ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''entonces                '''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''then                      ''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The '''Imperfect''' is used to tell '''How things were''' - it refers to the '''general''' situation.

== Grammar - Formal Commands (el imperativo) ==

Commands are used when you ask someone to do something
or give instructions to people. In this lesson we learn the
formal commands, which are the ones you say to persons where
you use the '''usted''' or '''ustedes''' form. The following
table shows the endings for the regular verbs. Note that the
stem changes that occur in the yo form, ('''e-&gt;ie''', '''e-&gt;i''', '''o-&gt;ue''', '''ar/er/ir-&gt;go''' '''cer-&gt;zco''' '''etc.''', ) apply for formal commands:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;hablar        &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;comer          &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;pedir        &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Usted   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habl&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;com&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;pid&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ustedes &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habl&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;com&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;pid&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The following verbs have irregular formal commands:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;dar    &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;estar   &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;ir    &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;saber   &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;ser   &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Usted   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dé     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;esté    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vaya  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sepa    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sea   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ustedes &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;den    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;estén   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vayan &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sepan   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sean  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Like in English, the command is usually put in the beginning of the sentence:

'''Examples''':

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Piense''' antes de hablar.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Think before you speak.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Terminen''' sus tareas escolares.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Finish your homework.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Dejen''' la casa inmediatamente.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Leave the house immediately.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Grammar - Informal Tú-Commands ==

In this lesson we learn the commands you say to someone
you would address in the '''tú''' form. Spanish distinguishes
two different types of '''tú'''-commands, the '''affirmative'''
(''do something'') and the '''negative''' (''don't do something'').
Like the formal commands, we also apply stem changes here:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;        &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;hablar        &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;comer           &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;pedir        &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Affirmative   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habl&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;com&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;pid&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no habl&lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no com&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no pid&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The following verbs have irregular informal '''tú'''-commands for the affirmative and negative.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;decir     &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;hacer   &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;ir       &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;poner    &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Affirmative &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;di        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;haz     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ve/andá (Chile, Argentina)      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;pon      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no digas  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no hagas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no vayas &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no pongas &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;salir     &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;ser     &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;tener    &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;venir    &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Affirmative &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sal       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sé      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ten      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ven      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no salgas  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no seas  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no tengas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;no vengas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This can be memorized with the rhyming mnemonic device
&quot;''di haz pon ten, sal sé ve ven.''&quot;

'''Examples''':

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Piensa''' antes de hablar.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Think before you speak.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''Termina''' tus tareas escolares.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Finish your homework.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
'''No dejes''' la casa.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Don't leave the house.

:&lt;b&gt;Hay mucha gente en el parque hoy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are a lot of people in the park today.&lt;/i&gt;
== Grammar - Past Participle (el participio)==

Spanish uses the past participle primarily for present perfect, past perfect,
and other similar times. For '''-ar''' verbs form the past participle
by adding '''-ado''' to the stem. For '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs add
'''-ido''':

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Verb                      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Past Participle             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;hablar                    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;hablado                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;comer                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;comido                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vivir                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vivido                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

If the stem of an '''-er''' or '''-ir''' verb ends in one of the vowels '''-a''',
'''-e''', or '''-o''', the '''i''' of '''-ido''' gets an accent mark:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Verb                      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Past Participle             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;caer                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;caído                           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;creer                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;creído                           &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;leer                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;leído                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;oir                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;oído                        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;reir                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;reído                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

There are a few verbs with an irregular past participle:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Verb                      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Past Participle             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;abrir                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;abierto                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;cubrir                    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;cubierto                    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;descubrir                 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;descubierto                 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;decir                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dicho                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;escribir                  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;escrito                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;freír                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;frito                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;hacer                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;hecho                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ir                        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ido                         &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;morir                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;muerto                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;poner                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;puesto                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;romper                    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;roto                        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;satisfacer                &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;satisfecho                  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ver                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;visto                       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;volver                    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vuelto                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


As in English, the past participle can also be used as an adjective for a noun. In
that case the ending has to match gender and number of the noun. Example:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Su barba está '''afeitada'''.                      
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
''His beard is shaved.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Finally, there are a few verbs with ''both'' a regular and an irregular past participle. In this case, the irregular past participle is used as an adjective, while the regular form is used for the verb tenses.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Verb                      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Past Participle             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;imprimir                    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;imprimido / impreso                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ocultar                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ocultado / oculto                      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Grammar - Present Perfect (el pretérito perfecto) ==

The Spanish present perfect is formed by conjugating the auxiliary verb '''haber'''
(= ''to have'') and adding the past participle of the verb.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;              &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Present Perfect&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''English''             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yo            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;he comido      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I have eaten''        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tú            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;has comido     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you have eaten ''     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ud./él/ella   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ha comido      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you/he/she has eaten''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nosotros(as)  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;hemos comido   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''we have eaten''       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vosotros(as)  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habéis comido  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you have eaten''      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Uds./ellos(as)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;han comido     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you/they have eaten'' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Here are a few examples of the Spanish Present perfect. Note that in Spanish
the auxiliary verb '''haber''' and the past participle are never separated:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Carlos y yo '''hemos jugado''' fútbol.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Carlos and I '''have played''' soccer.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
¿'''Has hecho''' tus tareas escolares de español?
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;'''Have''' you '''done''' your Spanish homework? &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Nunca se '''ha enfermado'''.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He '''has''' never '''been''' sick. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

----

== Grammar - Pluperfect (el pretérito pluscuamperfecto) ==

The Spanish pluperfect is formed by conjugating imperfect of '''haber'''
(= ''to have'') and adding the past participle of the verb.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;              &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Present Perfect      &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''English''             &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yo            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;había comido         &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I had eaten ''        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;tú            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habías comido        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you had eaten''       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ud./él/ella   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;había comido         &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you/he/she had eaten''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nosotros(as)  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habíamos comido      &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''we had eaten''        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;vosotros(as)  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habíais comido       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you (all) had eaten''       &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Uds./ellos(as)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;habían comido        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''you/they had eaten''  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Here are a few examples of the Spanish pluperfect. It is used to refer to
an event that happened before another event in the past. As in the present perfect,
the auxiliary verb '''haber''' and the past participle are never separated:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Carlos y yo '''habíamos jugado''' el fútbol antes la fiesta anoche.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Carlos and I '''had played''' soccer before the party last night.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
¿Tu '''habías venido''' antes a Mexico?
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;'''Had''' you '''been''' to Mexico before? &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Nunca se '''había enfermado''' cuando era un niño.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He '''had''' never '''been''' sick while he was a kid. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some notes to those adding pictures:
#If possible, edit the picture to no more than 800 pixels wide and add &quot;|frame|none|''description''&quot; to the Image entry.
#If you cannot or do not know how to do that, add &quot;|thumb|none|800px|''description''&quot; to the Image entry to limit it's size.

== Identifying which model of Motorola you have........ ==

There are two lines of copy which read:
Phase II is identified by the model number DCT-6412/2000 on a label on the bottom of the unit.
Phase II is identified by the model number DCT-6412/2005 have Comcast logo.

Shouldn't the first one read: Phase I ?
Looks like a simple typo.

Thanks.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">As DavidHouse just pointed out on the article page, this is actually converging steadily towards the basic introduction to lists at the very start of the book. I confess I didn't notice that page before I started this one! (Oh, the shame.) What, instead, should be the focus of this article to differentiate it? : [[User:Ithika|Ithika]] 13:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

: Since this is in the Hierarchical libraries chapter of the book, I think it should cover functions that are in the Data.List library, but not in the Standard Prelude. Also, all functions used in the list introductions that aren't in the Prelude, shouldn't be there, imho. Some handy functions in (Data.List \\ Prelude) include &lt;tt&gt;intersperse&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;inits&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;tails&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;unfoldr&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;union&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;intersect&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;nub&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(\\)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt;. A special mention may be appropriate for the -By functions. --[[User:Tchakkazulu|Tchakkazulu]] 22:25, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Frequency modulation is the process of modifying the frequency of one signal according to another. This is the basis of [[w:FM_broadcasting|FM radio]], which modulates a base frequency with another signal.

Basic frequency modulation can be achieved with a 555 Timer IC. This circuit uses the voltage at the &quot;Control Voltage&quot; pin, Pin 5, to alter the frequency of the output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The 555 timer IC is a very versatile and useful component and can be used for many things, from giving clock pulses to switch debouncing and as an output transducer. The basic 555 IC is housed in an 8-pin carrier, and these come in DIL and SOIC formats. They run from 3-15V, and are generally quite hardy devices.

==Pinout==

[[image:555 Pinout.svg|right|200px]]
The 555 has 8 pins. The layout of these pins is shown to the right and the function of these pins in given in the table below.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Pin!!Abbrv.!!Name!!Function
|-
|1||GND||Ground Supply||This is the 0V Power Supply pin for the IC
|-
|2||TR||Trigger||A low voltage (less than 1/3 Vcc) starts the timer
|-
|3||Q||Output||This is where the output signal comes from
|-
|4||RST||Reset||A low state on this pin resets the timer, which will not be enabled until the Pin goes high again.
|-
|5||CV||Control Voltage||This is used to adject the trigger voltage. Usually, it is unused, and is connected to ground to avoid noise in the circuit.
|-
|6||THR||Threshold||This pin stops the timer when the voltage reaches 2/3 Vcc.
|-
|7||DIS||Discharge||This pin is connected to ground when the output goes low. This is used to control timing in certain applications.
|-
|8||+V||Positive Supply|| The positive voltage supply to the chip. Must be between 3 and 15V.

I really like to help in this site and that is why I am here. And I really like to write articles especially on my favorites subjects. I really likes topics on Harry Potter, mythology, geography and entertainment. I hope I will be a big help in this site.

I'm really a huge fan, follower and supporter of Harry Potter and I am sure I am a really big help in editing and sharing knowledge and information for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]. I have books within my reach and I have notebooks where I scribbled notes, extracts and information from the Harry Potter bookitself so I have a lot of sources for the Muggles Guide. I'm an active member of one of the biggest community fan site of Harry Potter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discussion ==
The easiest of the two event sides to design is the supplier. In TAO 1.5 there are a few event examples. My favorite is the [http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/orbsvcs/examples/CosEC/Simple COSEC]  on the TAO site, which is similar to the example in the TAO Developer's Guide example. Unfortunately, in the examples on the TAO site, there are no comments. What follows is an example of a simple event supplier which sends an event every 6 seconds. To accomplish this, an ACE timer is set up (with associated handler/callback) which serves to send the event at the appointed time. Finally, the timer is inserted into an ACE reactor and told to &quot;run&quot; in open loop mode.

When reading the code, note at the top of main that connections are made to the orb, the naming service, and the event service. Then, quite a bit of boilerplate code related to creating connections to the event service can be found. The last line of this boilerplate code determines that the event channel will not care that consumers are disconnecting.

This event client is designed to accept the events from the previously defined event server. The main difference between the server, where you can simply stuff some message in a CORBA::Any object and sent it to the event dispatcher, the client needs to overload the POA_CosEventComm::PushConsumer class. Specifically, the push and disconnect members need to be overridden.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As described earlier, the raw IOR string for tying together client and server isn't the preferred method to getting the two sides to talk together. In a production environment, the usual method is to use a naming service. This serves both as a way to advertise a location for a service, and as a method to keep the effective IOR of the service constant. You might have noticed, had you played with the previous server example more than once that the IOR string tended to change. With this method, you can ensure both consistency and readability.

The infrastructure used by CORBA programs to perform such address registration and lookups is the naming service. For TAO, the naming service is started with several command line args. In the examples below, the arg &quot;-ORBEndPoint&quot; is used to define where the service will listen, and the arg &quot;-ORBDaemon&quot; is designed to force the daemon to actually act like a daemon. Oddly enough, none of the services (daemons) you will be compiling with TAO will actually act like daemons, unless you use this optional arg. 

The endpoint is critical to running any TAO service or compiled client/server app. If you don't supply one, the default endpoint is the multicast endpoint. This default endpoint is described as being useful for apps where performance isn't an issue, or for testing. That being said, this author couldn't get the multicast IIOP endpoint to work on a stock Linux FC4 system, even though the Linux system swore that multicasting was up and running. I was able to verify the bug by running the multicast test app under the ACE framework test directory. To ensure that anyone reading this is able to get something up and running, we will therefore set up a client with the explicitly defined endpoint of &quot;localhost&quot;.

There are two basic forms of this endpoint, there is the service advertising its services, and the client trying to find a service. To make this discussion intuitive, we will assume that in each example, a naming service server is running and reachable from your test box. To get the naming service started, try the following:
&lt;pre&gt;Naming_Service -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:12345 -ORBDaemon&lt;/pre&gt;

This should set up your naming service on port 12345 on the localhost interface. To test that this is up and working, try the following:
&lt;pre&gt;nslist -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12345/NameService&lt;/pre&gt;

This should then produce the following output:
&lt;pre&gt;
Naming Service:
---------
&lt;/pre&gt;

This shows that your naming service is up and running , but reporting no services yet. To see what a service looks like, try the following command to start the event service (which we will be using in later examples):
&lt;pre&gt;CosEvent_Service -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12345/NameService -ORBDaemon&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, when you run nslist again, you will see the following output:
&lt;pre&gt;
Naming Service:
---------
  CosEventService: object reference:   Protocol: IIOP,   Endpoint: 10.0.0.53:32802
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, we have a working set of servers we have connected together with IIOP endpoints. When you connect your clients and servers together, you will be using the same process... start the naming server, possibly the event service (or others) and then start in with your clients and servers. For linux, the people associated with the ACE+TAO project have provided RPM packages with script files designed to interract with linux's boot facilities which will start the naming service (and the others) automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As discussed in the previous section, Dealing with IIOP Endpoints, the naming service is one of the basic services. The other basic services you will be needing for most purposes are:
CosEvent_Service
Notify_Service
Scheduling_Service

On most platforms, you can start these with the following command lines by hand:
&lt;pre&gt;Naming_Service -ORBEndPoint iiop://localhost:12345 -ORBDaemon&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;CosEvent_Service -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12345/NameService -ORBDaemon&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Notify_Service -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12345/NameService -ORBDaemon&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Scheduling_Service -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12345/NameService -ORBDaemon&lt;/pre&gt;

Where the endpoint determines where the listener for the service will hang-out, and the ORBDaemon option tells the service to run as a background daemon. In the Linux environment, these services can also be started automatically in the background through the boot time scripts found in '''/etc/rc.d'''. One of the developers on the list server has been good enough to provide RPMs of ACE+TAO complete with the boot time scripts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discussion ==
So, unlike the server, the client doesn't involve implementing any code generated by the IDL. In the client, we simply instantiate a copy of the factory (using as an address the IOR string we generated with the server) and call its functions. This is all it takes for a basic client.

In the following code, the first argument to the program gets used as the address argument to TAO's orb to find our server. We are using the string generated earlier much like someone would use an IP address/port combination to find a host and application on the internet. While we will discuss it later, this analogy is somewhat apt because, on the internet, we usually prefer to use host names (using DNS) and well known services (ports) to access our services. In CORBA land, the same is true, and we will be discussing that later.

After acquiring the factory object from the orb, we then downcast the generic object to our My_Factory_var object as generated by the IDL. Note that we aren't downcasting it to &quot;My_Factory&quot;, but rather &quot;My_Factory_var&quot;. TAO, and perhaps CORBA seem to have adopted a standard of using XXX (as defined in your IDL) as the class you use to manipulate the ORB, and XXX_var (as generated by the IDL) as the repository for your object, as generated by XXX.

Now that you have generated your application specific factory object from the generic one received from the ORB, you may proceed to use these two objects as you would any normal C++ object. Just remember to keep in mind the type of data you are getting back from your queries, and or what type of data you are sending. Suffice it to say that inattention to these details will cause memory leaks.

Finally, destroy the ORB. While this is quite a simple application, and technically the destructor isn't needed, its still a good idea to get in the practice as leaving these objects hanging will cause all sorts of problems with distributed programs.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: feasable → feasible using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discussion ==
So the previous client/server pair were a bit clunky. What they lacked in elegance, they gained in brevity. This client/server example will show how to edit the previous examples so that they use the naming service and nolonger rely on the clunky manual IOR method of addressing. As a side note, these IOR strings are only good for the length of time the server is running. Since each new process generates a unique IOR string, storing them in a file for client reuse just isn't feasible, therefore, we use the naming service, which acts like a DNS for our services.

So, to make this work, we need to get a reference to a naming service, create a name with which to bind our service under, and register that name with the naming service. The following lines of code are what we will need:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
  //Now we need a reference to the naming service
  Object_var naming_context_object = orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references (&quot;NameService&quot;);
  CosNaming::NamingContext_var naming_context = CosNaming::NamingContext::_narrow (naming_context_object.in ());
  //Then initialize a naming context
  CosNaming::Name name (1);
  name.length (1);
  //store the name in the key field...
  name[0].id = string_dup (&quot;widgits&quot;);
  //Then register the context with the nameing service
  naming_context-&gt;rebind (name, dc_log.in ());

 &lt;/source&gt;
Placing this code above the &quot;orb-&gt;run&quot; line of the previous server will get it on the naming server. For the full source code, see the following listing
== main.cpp ==
So, as you can see, the main difference here is the addition of a new include for the naming service and the code snipit mentioned above. The other portions of the server remain exactly the same.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include &lt;config.h&gt;
#endif

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &quot;basicI.h&quot;
#include &quot;basicC.h&quot;
#include &quot;ace/streams.h&quot;
#include &lt;orbsvcs/CosNamingC.h&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace CORBA;

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // First initialize the ORB, that will remove some arguments...
    ORB_var orb = ORB_init (argc, argv, &quot;ORB&quot; /* the ORB name, it can be anything! */);
    Object_var poa_object = orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references (&quot;RootPOA&quot;);
    PortableServer::POA_var poa = PortableServer::POA::_narrow (poa_object.in ());
    PortableServer::POAManager_var poa_manager = poa-&gt;the_POAManager ();
    poa_manager-&gt;activate ();

    // Create the servant
    My_Factory_i my_factory_i;

    // Activate it to obtain the object reference
    My_Factory_var my_factory = my_factory_i._this ();

    // Put the object reference as an IOR string
    String_var ior = orb-&gt;object_to_string (my_factory.in ());
    //Now we need a reference to the naming service
    Object_var naming_context_object = orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references (&quot;NameService&quot;);
    CosNaming::NamingContext_var naming_context = CosNaming::NamingContext::_narrow (naming_context_object.in ());
    //Then initialize a naming context
    CosNaming::Name name (1);
    name.length (1);
    //store the name in the key field...
    name[0].id = string_dup (&quot;Widgits&quot;);
    //Then register the context with the nameing service
    naming_context-&gt;rebind (name, my_factory.in ());
    //By default, the following doesn't return unless there is an error
    orb-&gt;run ();

    // Destroy the POA, waiting until the destruction terminates
    poa-&gt;destroy (1, 1);
    orb-&gt;destroy ();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ok, so we now have a client and server along with services... let's wire them up.

If you have an already compiled server from one of the previous examples, you'll want to start that up first and have it advertised on the naming service. To do that, you'll need to tell the server you wrote the IOR of the naming service. TAO allows you two ways to do this. The first is to create an environment variable &quot;NameServiceIOR&quot; which you assign the IOR you used when you started the NamingService. The other method, is to put the IOR on the command line. The IOR from the example below is the string starting with &quot;corbaloc&quot; and continuing to the end of the line. The latter option is my preferred method to get a server started. 

&lt;pre&gt;./YourServer -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:yoyodyne.com:12345/NameService&lt;/pre&gt;

The -ORBInitRef option is simply passed to the CORBA::ORB_init() function in the opening lines of your application, so you could optionally pass this in directly to the function, thus obviating the need for this long command line. In practice, however, I've always used this long command line form as it makes it easier to move the app around.

To start the client side, using the command line from above is fine.

&lt;pre&gt;./YourClient -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:yoyodyne.com:12345/NameService&lt;/pre&gt;

One final note unrelated to connecting your apps into the framework. The ACE+TAO framework, because it was designed to work on Microsoft's platform, comes with a non-standard way to start up the app. If you want to run your shiny new app as a daemon, you need to add -ORBDaemon to the command line. If you are doing this under linux, don't try the daemon() C function call in your source, it'll only serve to confuse things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well done this is the correct answer.

Recall by Ohm's Law that V=IR and then V/I = R. Observe on the graph that as voltage increases, current increases also. So as these values increase, their quotient must remain relatively constant. So the resistance remains relatively constant.Hence a straight line graph.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorry this is the wrong answer.

From Ohm's Law

:R=V/I

But V/I is also the ''slope'' (or ''gradient'') of the line on the graph. So with a constant slope, we must have a constant resistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|The Holocaust}}

The book looks at the situation in which the Holocaust was able to take place. It will look into those involved and where and when important events took place, to try and establish a clear picture of the extent of what has happened. What happened after the war and what ongoing impact will the events of the Holocaust have now?

{{mergefrom|Cookbook:Melanzane Parmigiana}}
'''Melanzane alla Parmigiana''' is a typical Italian dish, existing in different forms in most parts of Italy. Northerners claim it as their own because of the name.  Southerners, in particular Sicilians, claim that it originated in the south and that &quot;Parmigiana&quot; is a misunderstanding for &quot;Palmigiana&quot;, which is a type of shutter, alluding to the way in which the eggplant slices are laid.  There are some variations (including a dessert version with chocolate) but mostly the ingredients are: eggplants, tomato sauce, basil leaves, mozzarella, and, obviously, Parmesan cheese.

== Ingredients ==

* 2 kg/4 lb [[Cookbook:eggplant|eggplants]]
* 700 g/24 oz fresh cooking [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], or one large or two medium cans of plum tomatoes
* 1 kg/2 lb cows' milk [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]], known in Italy as ''fiordilatte''
* ½ large or 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced 
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil leaves]] 
* [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] (Parmigiano) or Grana Padano cheese

== Procedure ==

#Cut eggplants lengthwise in slices ¼ of an inch (0.75cm) thick and put them in a plate covered by plenty of salt for about 1 hour. Wash off the excess salt and dry the slices with a paper towel.
#Prepare a tomato sauce as follows.  Start cooking the onion slices in olive oil; when the onion is soft add drained whole tomatoes and mash them with a fork. If the tomatoes are watery, add a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Add 2 leaves of basil and simmer for about 20 minutes.
#While the tomato sauce is cooking, fry the eggplant slices as follows.  Fill a frying pan (cast iron if you have it) with ½ inch (1 cm) of olive oil and heat. When the oil is hot, start frying the eggplant slices a few at a time so that they do not overlap in the pan. Cook until golden, flipping once. Remove the eggplants and put them in a drainer so the excess oil can drain. Repeat until all the slices are cooked. 
#To assemble the Parmigiana, start with a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a greased oven proof baking pan or casserole. Then proceed with a layer of eggplants with their edges slightly overlapped and no voids.  Then add basil leaves and a layer of sliced mozzarella. Continue alternating layers until the eggplant is used up, and finish topping with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan or grana. Bake in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350°F (180°C). Serve really hot. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, they taste even better the day after.

===1...e6===
This move does not hold independent status as an opening. At this point, it is more likely to transpose into a myriad of 1. d4 openings. What is unique about this move is that it is somewhat of an invitation for white to enter the French.

White can play almost anything at this point, but 2. c4 and 2. e4 are the more common replies.

IMHO This needs attention. I'm not sure it can be fixed without a complete rewrite. 
It is not written well (must be someone for whom English is not their fist language?), and the structure is not good. There is some good content in there, and the person that wrote it probably does have a grasp on collections, but it needs some attention.
: I have changed the status of this page to 25% {{stage short|25%|[data unknown]}}. I will be rewriting some of the sections to provide the reader with delightful insights.

::* Generics is mentioned but it should be made clear that you used to have the casting problems, not with generics. The way it is written now suggests that it's the problem when using generics.
:::I have fixed this point.
::* More basic coding examples for each group including using generics.
:::I have added code.
::* Explain about 'syncronized' earlier in the article instead of in the end. Since you use it extensively in the article, it's only confusing now if you don't know what it means.
:::I have added a section but this section needs to be completed.
::* Separate the in depth info like the comparison troubles with sets.
::* The package prefixes before each interface and implementation does not improve the readability of the article. Consider removing them or including them in a different manner.
:::I have used colors.
::* The LinkList pointer bit should realy need some more explaination.
::* Consider including a table like in [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/implementations/index.html 'The Java Tutorials - Collections' by Josh Bloch]. This would provide a clear overview of the posibilities.
::* &lt;code&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt; remain basically unexplained.
::* Some questions people might have after reading the article that might need answering:
::** Should or shouldn't we still use the old style, i.e. not using generics in all cases?
:::It should be OK now.
::** If sets don't allow duplicates in the first place, why should we check if there's a duplicate ourselfs?
::** You talk about 'syncronized' and 'non-syncronized' as if it's something different then 'thread safe', is it?
:::Mentioned.
::** In examples like &lt;code&gt;Collection coll2 = new HashSet();&lt;/code&gt; you make &lt;code&gt;coll2&lt;/code&gt; of the type &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;. Why not make it &lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt; instead? E.g. &lt;code&gt;HashSet coll2 = new HashSet();&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Set coll2 = new HashSet();&lt;/code&gt; even.

:::This point is explained in the page: It lets you switch from one implementation to another easily. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 02:44, 21 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Haskell Basics|noexercises=1}}

This chapter describes how to install the programs you'll need to start coding in Haskell.

== Installing Haskell ==
Haskell is a ''programming language'', i.e. a language in which humans can express how computers should behave. It's like writing a cooking recipe: you write the recipe and the computer executes it.

To use Haskell programs, you need a special program called a Haskell ''compiler''. A compiler takes code written in Haskell and translates it into ''machine code'', a more primitive language that the computer understands. Using the cooking analogy, you write a recipe (your Haskell program) and a cook (a compiler program) does the work of putting together actual ingredients into an edible dish (an executable file). Of course, you can't easily get the recipe from a final dish (and you can't get the Haskell program code from executable after it's compiled).

To start learning Haskell, '''download and install the [http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/ Haskell platform]'''. It will contain the &quot;Glasgow Haskell Compiler&quot;, or GHC, and everything else you need.

If you're just trying out Haskell, or are averse to downloading and installing the full compiler, you can try [http://www.haskell.org/hugs/ Hugs], the lightweight Haskell interpreter (it also happens to be portable). You might also like to play around with [http://www.tryhaskell.org/ TryHaskell], an interpreter hosted online. Note that all instructions here will be for GHC.


{{body note|1=
UNIX users:

If you are a person who prefers to compile from source: This might be a bad idea with GHC, especially if it's the first time you install it. GHC is itself mostly written in Haskell, so trying to bootstrap it by hand from source is very tricky. Besides, the build takes a ''very'' long time and consumes a lot of disk space. If you are sure that you want to build GHC from the source, see [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building Building and Porting GHC at the GHC homepage].

In short, we strongly recommend downloading the Haskell Platform instead of compiling from source.
}}

== Very first steps ==
After you have installed the [http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/ Haskell Platform], it's now time to write your first Haskell code.

For that, you will use the program called '''GHCi''' (the 'i' stands for 'interactive'). Depending on your operating system, perform the following steps:

* On Windows: Click Start, then Run, then type 'cmd' and hit Enter, then type &lt;code&gt;ghci&lt;/code&gt; and hit Enter once more.
* On MacOS: Open the application &quot;Terminal&quot; found in the &quot;Applications/Utilities&quot; folder, type the letters &lt;code&gt;ghci&lt;/code&gt; into the window that appears and hit the Enter key.
* On Linux: Open a terminal and run the &lt;code&gt;ghci&lt;/code&gt; program.

You should get output that looks something like the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first bit is GHCi's version. It then informs you it's loading the base package, so you'll have access to most of the built-in functions and modules that come with GHC. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;Prelude&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; bit is known as the ''prompt''. This is where you enter commands, and GHCi will respond with their results.

Now you're ready to write your first Haskell code. In particular, let's try some basic arithmetic:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 2 + 2
4
Prelude&gt; 5 + 4 * 3
17
Prelude&gt; 2 ^ 5
32
}}

The operators are similar to what they are in other languages: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;  is addition, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is multiplication, and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; is exponentiation (raising to the power of, or &lt;math&gt;a ^ b&lt;/math&gt;). Note from the second example that Haskell follows standard order of operations.

Now you know how to use Haskell as a calculator. Actually, Haskell is always basically a calculator - a really powerful one, able to deal not only with numbers but also with other objects like characters, lists, functions, trees, and even other programs (if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, don't worry).

GHCi is a very powerful development environment. As we progress, we will learn how we can load files with source code into GHCi, and evaluate different parts of them. 

If you're clear on everything so far (if not, use the talk page and help us improve this Wikibook!), then you are ready for next chapter, in which we will introduce some of the basic concepts of Haskell, along with our first Haskell functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an annotated list of existing resources that can support your Wikibooks learning as well as extend it.

==Books==
There are very few books available in English about Uyghur, which is partly a motivating factor for this Wikibook.
===Instructional===
* '''Spoken Uyghur''' by Reinhard Hahn (1991, University of Washington Press, ISBN 0295986514). [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0295986514/026-8000646-5981269?v=glance&amp;n=266239 Amazon] indicates that it's going to be reprinted in October 2006. Has 15 lessons with dialogues in Arabic script, Latin script and English translation. Main script used in vocabulary lists is Latin. Has a lengthy and detailed introductory section on the &quot;principles of morphophonology&quot;.

*'''Introduction to Modern Uyghur''' by Hamit A. Zakir, (2007, Xinjiang University Press, ISBN) 7563120777). Available in private bookstores in Urumqi (best bet, ones near Xinjiang University, specifically Ghalibiyet Kitabxanisi). 28 lessons, Arabic script, instruction and explanation in English.

===Phrasebooks===
* [unseen] '''Lonely Planet Central Asia Phrasebook''' by Justin Jon Redelson (1998, Lonely Planet Publications, ISBN 0864424191). Covers five languages, one of which is Uyghur. Reportedly the chapter on Uyghur is better than the others, also reportedly only has transliterations, not original scripts.

===Dictionaries===
* '''An Uyghur-English Dictionary''' by Henry Shwarz (1992, East Asian Research Aids and Translations, ISBN 0914584898). A large dictionary that suffers from only having Latin script lookup and no Arabic script at all, save the alphabet on the inside cover. Has terminological lists in an appendix on these topics: Agriculture, astronomy, botany, chemistry, clothing, food, geography, geology, grammar &amp; linguistics, history, literature, mathematics, medicine, military, music, philosophy, physics, physiology, religion, sports and zoology.
* [unseen] '''Inglizcha-Uighurcha lughat: English-Uighur dictionary''' by Anvar Paizulla (1998, Shinjang Khalq Nashriyyati, ISBN 7228007395).
* [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/salrc/afghanistan/materials/Uyghur.htm List of further dictionaries]

{{displaytitle|title=F# Programming}}

== Contents ==
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Preface|Preface]]''' - About this book and its authors.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Introduction|Introduction]]''' - Introducing the F# Programming Language.

=== F# Basics ===
''This section is suitable for complete beginners to F# and Functional Programming in general.''

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Getting Set Up|Getting Set Up]]''' - Installing F# on Windows, Linux and Mac.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Basic Concepts|Basic Concepts]]''' - A lightweight crash course in functional programming concepts.

==== Working With Functions ====
''F# is a functional programming language. Not surprisingly, functions are a big part of the language, and mastering them is the first step to becoming an effective F# developer.''

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Values and Functions|Declaring Values and Functions]]''' - This article will show you how to declare simple functions, how to use type inference, and how to read F#'s 'arrow' notation.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Pattern Matching Basics|Pattern Matching Basics]]''' - Pattern matching is used for control flow. Its conceptually similar to a switch statement in other languages, but orders of magnitude more powerful.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Recursion|Recursion and Recursive Functions]]''' - A recursive function is a special type of function which calls itself.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Higher Order Functions|Higher Order Functions]]''' - Higher order functions take and return functions as values. Combined with currying, it allows programmers to write powerful and expressive programs.

==== Immutable Data Structures ====
''&quot;Data structure&quot; is a fancy word which refers to anything that helps programmers group and represent related values in useful, logical units. F# has a number of built-in data structures which include tuples, records, lists, unions, and a number of others.''

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Option Types|Option Types]]''' - Option types are simple, lightweight data structures which are commonly used to represent successful or failed computation.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Tuples and Records|Tuples and Records]]''' - Tuples and records are simple data structures which allow programmers to group related values together into a single unit.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Lists|Lists]]''' - A list represents an ordered group of values. F#'s List library has extensive support for manipulating and working with lists.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Sequences|Sequences]]''' - Sequence expressions represent sequences of data computed on-demand.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Sets and Maps|Sets and Maps]]''' - Sets are conceptually similar to lists, except they cannot hold duplicate items. Maps allows programmers to relate ''keys'' to ''values'' and find items in the collection very efficiently.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Discriminated Unions|Discriminated Unions]]''' - Discriminated unions represent a finite, well-defined set of choices. Discriminated unions are often the tool of choice building up more complicated data structures including linked lists and a wide range of trees.

==== Imperative Programming ====
''F# is an &quot;impure&quot; programming language, meaning it allows programmers to write functions with side-effects and mutable state, very similar to the programming style used by imperative programming languages such as C# and Java.''

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Mutable Data|Mutable Data]]''' - By default, variables in F# are immutable. However, F# supports mutable variables through mutable fields and ref cells.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Control Flow|Control Flow]]''' - Decision making and Loops.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Arrays|Arrays]]''' - Arrays are ubiquitous mutable data structure used in imperative programming languages.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Mutable Collections|Mutable Collections]]''' - Lists and Dictionaries.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Input and Output|Basic I/O]]''' - Reading and writing to files and the console window.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Exception Handling|Exception Handling]]''' - Exception handling allows programmers to catch and handle errors whenever an application enters an invalid state.

==== Object Oriented Programming ====
''F# is a CLI/.NET programming language. CLI is an object-oriented platform. One of the most important features of F# is its ability to mix and match styles: since the .NET platform is Object Oriented, with F#, you often work with objects.

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Operator Overloading|Operator Overloading]]''' - C#-like operator overloading.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Classes|Classes]]''' - classes and objects are the foundation of object-oriented programming (OOP). They are used to model actions, processes, and any conceptual entities in applications.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Inheritance|Inheritance]]''' - inheritance makes OOP code reusable. It allows programmers to create classes which inherit features from another class and add its own modifications.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Interfaces|Interfaces]]''' - interfaces abstract away the implementation details of a class by defining a template of methods an object must implement and expose publicly.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Events|Events]]''' - events allow a classes to send and receive messages between one another.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Modules and Namespaces|Modules and Namespaces]]''' - modules and namespaces are used to organize classes into groups of related functionality.

=== F# Advanced ===
''F# is easy enough for beginners to learn as their first language, yet it provides a powerful set of tools which can be appreciated by experienced developers. This section describes advanced syntactic contructs and techniques often used in F# programs.''

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Units of Measure|Units of Measure]]''' - Units of measure attach metadata to floats, which allows floats to represent kilograms, pounds, Newtons, hectares, and so on.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Caching|Caching]]''' - Techniques to store computed values for efficient future retrieval. Also called Memoization.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Active Patterns|Active Patterns]]''' - Active patterns allow programmers to wrap ad hoc values and objects in union-like structures for use in pattern matching.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Advanced Data Structures|Advanced Data Structures]]''' - Overview of techniques used to implement immutable data structures. 
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Reflection|Reflection]]''' - Reflection allows programmers to inspect types and metadata in objects.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Quotations|Quotations]]''' - Quotations convert arbitrary F# code into an abstract syntax tree.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Computation Expressions|Computation Expressions]]''' - Similar to monads in Haskell, computation expressions are used to simplify code written continuation-passing style.

==== Multi-threaded and Concurrent Applications ====
''Multi-threading is becoming increasingly important with the development of multi-core processors. Functional programmers can take advantage of immutable data structures to make massively scalable, concurrent applications that are simple and easy to write.''

# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Async Workflows|Async Workflows]]''' - F#'s async primitive is fundamental for writing functional, simple multi-threaded code.
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/MailboxProcessor|MailboxProcessor Class]]''' - Mailboxes are used to implement &quot;message-passing concurrency,&quot; a style of concurrent programming used in massively parallel applications consisting of 10s or 1000s of independent nodes.

==== F# Tools ====
# '''[[F Sharp Programming/Lexing and Parsing|Lexing and Parsing]]''' - FsLex and FsYacc, lexer/parser generators based on the GNU Bison family of generators, are used to implement custom grammars and domain-specific languages in F#.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Would-be contributors are asked to observe the following:

* We aim to present functional programming in F# in a simple manner.  Many texts go into great detail about the theoretical aspects of FP (''e.g.'' lambda calculus) fairly early on which is :
**distracting to beginners who assume that functional programming is for &quot;boffins&quot; only.
**unnecessary for learning how to use functional programming techniques.
* Ensure that you only use a language construct or concept after it has been explained.  It is the task of any tutorial to split things up into digestable chunks. This may mean explaining or demonstrating things in a clumsier or less general way than you would like. So be it.
* Do not treat the existing text or structure as sacrosanct.  If it would be better done another way then by all means do it. Remember that WikiBooks are under version control, so any mistake can always be backed out. (Having said that, major changes should probably be discussed first).

Additionally topics should be organized in a way that makes sense to first-time programmers and those who have no prior experience with functional programming languages. In particular:

* Readers should be able to start at the beginning of this book and understand each section. No page should reference code or language constructs before they are properly introduced.
* Each section should build on prior sections. In other words, this book is meant to be read in serial format: from start to finish. Readers are not expected to understand code or concepts by skipping over material.
* An emphasis should be placed on explaining writing F# code properly, rather than on syntax alone. This is extremely important, but unfortunately overlooked in many programming tutorials on the web. There's no real point learning F# if programmers only intend to transcribe C++ in a different syntax; mastering this language means mastering its idioms and functional programming style.
* Its good for articles to have a high density of short, explanatory code samples. Always accompany new concepts with code that that reader can experiment with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|F Sharp|Introduction|Basic Concepts}}
{{fsharpTitle|Getting Set Up}}


==Windows==
At the time of this writing, its possible to run F# code through Visual Studio, through its interactive top-level F# Interactive (fsi), and compiling from the command line. This book will assume that users will compile code through Visual Studio or F# Interactive by default, unless specifically directed to compile from the command line.

===Setup Procedure===

F# can integrate with existing installations of Visual Studio 2008 and is included with Visual Studio 2010. Alternatively, users can [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=40646580-97FA-4698-B65F-620D4B4B1ED7&amp;displaylang=en download Visual Studio Shell] for free, which will provide an F# pioneer with everything she needs to get started, including interactive debugging, breakpoints, watches, Intellisense, and support for F# projects. Make sure all instances of Visual Studio and Visual Studio Shell are closed before continuing. 

To get started, users should download and install the latest version of the .NET Framework from Microsoft. Afterwards, 
[http://fsharp.org/ download the latest version of F#] from the F# homepage on Microsoft Research, then execute the installation wizard. Users should also consider downloading and installing the [http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/ F# PowerPack], which contains handy extensions to the F# core library.

After successful installation, users will notice an additional folder in their start menu, &quot;Microsoft F# 2.0.X.X.&quot; Additionally, users will notice that an entry for &quot;F# Projects&quot; has been added to the project types menu in Visual Studio. From here, users can create and run new F# projects.

It is a good idea to add the executable location (''e.g.'' &lt;code&gt;c:\fsharp\bin\&lt;/code&gt;) to the &lt;code&gt;%PATH%&lt;/code&gt; environment variable, so you can access the compiler and the F# interactive environment (FSI) from any location.

As of Visual Studio 2012 the easiest way to get going is to install Visual Studio 2012 for Web at [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads] (even if you want to do desktop solution).  You can then install &quot;F# Tools for Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web&quot; from [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34675]. Once this is done you can create F# projects.  Search Nuget for additional F# project types.

===Testing the Install===
====Hello World executable====
Lets create the Hello World standalone application.

Create a text file called &lt;code&gt;hello.fs&lt;/code&gt; containing the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* filename: hello.fs *)
let _ = printf &quot;Hello world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Save and close the file and then compile this file:

 fsc -o hello.exe hello.fs

Now you can run &lt;code&gt;hello.exe&lt;/code&gt; to produce the expected output.

====F# Interactive Environment====

Open a command-line console (hit the &quot;Start&quot; button, click on the &quot;Run&quot; icon and type &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; and hit ENTER).

Type &lt;code&gt;fsi&lt;/code&gt; and hit ENTER.  You will see the interactive console:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
Microsoft F# Interactive, (c) Microsoft Corporation, All Rights Reserved
F# Version 1.9.6.2, compiling for .NET Framework Version v2.0.50727

Please send bug reports to fsbugs@microsoft.com
For help type #help;;

&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can try some basic F# variable assignment (and some basic maths).
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let x = 5;;
val x : int
 
&gt; let y = 20;;
val y : int

&gt; y + x;;
val it : int = 25
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally we quit out of the interactive environment
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; #quit;;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Misc.===
====Adding to the PATH Environment Variable====
#Go to the Control Panel and choose System.
#The System Properties dialog will appear.  Select the Advanced tab and click the &quot;Environment Variables...&quot;.
#In the System Variables section, select the Path variable from the list and click the &quot;Edit...&quot; button.
#In the Edit System Variable text box append a semicolon (;) followed by the executable path (e.g. &lt;code&gt;;C:\fsharp\bin\&lt;/code&gt;)
#Click on the &quot;OK&quot; button
#Click on the &quot;OK&quot; button
#Click on the &quot;Apply&quot; button

Now any command-line console will check in this location when you type &lt;code&gt;fsc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fsi&lt;/code&gt;.

== Mac OSX, Linux and UNIX==

F# runs on Mac OSX, Linux and other Unix versions with the latest [http://www.mono-project.com/ Mono]. This is supported by the F# community group called the [http://fsharp.org/ F# Software Foundation].

===Installing interpreter and compiler===

The [http://fsharp.org/ F# Software Foundation] give latest instructions on getting started with F# on Linux and Mac. Once built and/or installed, you can use the &quot;fsharpi&quot; command to use the command-line interpreter, and &quot;fsharpc&quot; for the command-line compiler.

===MonoDevelop add-in===

The [http://fsharp.org/ F# Software Foundation] also give instructions for installing the Monodevelop support for F#. This comes with project build system, code completion, and syntax highlighting support. 

===Emacs mode and other editors===

The [http://fsharp.org/ F# Software Foundation] also give instructions for using F# with other editors. An [http://fsharp.github.com/fsharpbinding emacs mode for F#] is also available on [https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding#emacs-support Github].

      <comment>/* The sounds of Uyghur */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most important, and sometimes challenging, parts of learning a new language is mastering the new sounds involved. There are dozens of different sounds one can make with the throat, mouth and tongue, and any given language usually only employs a much smaller subset of these sounds. For example, English has no tongue-clicks, rolling-r's or lip smacks, but some languages do. Learning to make a new sound therefore means learning to manipulate your mouth in a new and unfamiliar way -- something you haven't had to do since your learnt your first language. Yup, it's back to preschool!

==The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)==
''If you've done some basic linguistics or are otherwise familiar with the IPA, you can safely skip this section.''

Some textbooks, when describing the sounds of a new language, try to describe them in terms of the language you already know. &quot;Like the a in ''father''.&quot; &quot;Like the g in ''aghast'' but further back in the throat.&quot; The problem with descriptions like this is that they are imprecise and may not be accurate  for people who speak a different dialect or with a different accent to the author. Therefore we will use the IPA to describe the sounds of Uyghur.

As you are probably aware, there are two different types of basic sounds - consonants and vowels. We'll deal with consonants first. Consonants are characterised by a closure or restriction in the [[w:vocal tract|vocal tract]] (typically somewhere in your mouth). Repeat the sound &quot;pa&quot; or &quot;apa&quot; aloud. Where is the closure occurring? Your lips. &quot;Fa&quot; - your teeth and your lips. Then &quot;tha&quot; - &quot;sa&quot; - &quot;sha&quot; - &quot;ya&quot; - &quot;ka&quot;. 

Here is a simplified table of the consonants of English (from [[w:English_language#Consonants|Wikipedia]]):

OK, what have we got here? Most of those symbols look familiar, but some will be new. How is this table arranged?

The  columns represent different [[w:place of articulation|places of articulation]]. That means where in the mouth is the restriction occurring? So when you say &quot;pa&quot; or &quot;apa&quot; which part of your mouth is closed? Your lips. ''Bilabial'' means two lips. As you go from left to right across the columns, the place of articulation slowly moves back through your mouth, until we get to glottal - basically your throat.

Going down the rows, we have different [[w:manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]. This refers roughly to how your tongue and lips and the rest of your mouth come in contact. You are probably not aware of it when you speak, but there are different ways. Compare saying &quot;ba&quot; to &quot;ma&quot;. Your mouth is not changing position - so why are they different sounds? It's due to air flow from the back of your throat to your nose, which is why {{IPA|m}} and {{IPA|n}} are in the row called &quot;nasal&quot;. The first row is called &quot;plosive&quot; - kind of like &quot;explosive&quot;. You can tell these are plosives because it's impossible to hold the sound. Compare &quot;ammmmmmmmmmmmmma&quot; to trying to say &quot;abbbbbbbbbbbbbbba&quot;. If you're making a true {{IPA|b}} sound, it's impossible!

Next down, for English, is &quot;fricatives&quot;. If you hold a hand in front of your mouth while you say &quot;ffffff&quot; or &quot;sssssss&quot; or &quot;shhhhhhhh&quot; you will be able to feel air getting through, but you can tell that it's being restricted. This is what characterises fricatives - air in your mouth being forced through a narrow channel. 

Just one last thing... why do some cells have two entries in them? In each cell, the one to the right is ''voiced''. The difference between a voiced and unvoiced consosnant is best shown with &quot;f&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. Make the sounds &quot;afa&quot; and &quot;ava&quot;. Your mouth isn't moving - why are these sounds different? Now put your hand against your throat and say them again. Do you notice when you make the &quot;f&quot; sound, your throat stops vibrating, while when you say &quot;v&quot; it vibrates all the way through the sound? That's the difference and that's why &quot;v&quot; is a voiced consonant.

So how do these strange symbols correspond to the English orthography we know and love? Let's have a look (if it's not listed, that means it's exactly what you'd expect):

* {{IPA|ŋ}}: &quot;ng&quot;. In English, only occurs at the end of words, such as &quot;sing&quot;.
* {{IPA|θ}}: &quot;th&quot;, unvoiced. As in &quot;think&quot;.
* {{IPA|ð}}: &quot;th&quot;, voiced. As in &quot;they&quot;.
* {{IPA|ʃ}}: &quot;sh&quot;.
* {{IPA|ʒ}}: Like the s in &quot;treasure&quot; and the final sound in &quot;mirage&quot;. Some people use this sound when they say &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; or &quot;Beijing&quot;. Not a very common English sound.
* {{IPA|tʃ}}: &quot;t&quot; + &quot;sh&quot;... what does it turn out to be? &quot;ch&quot; as in &quot;church&quot; (twice!).
* {{IPA|dʒ}}: Like the final sound in &quot;judge&quot;.
* {{IPA|ɹ}}: Just plain old &quot;r&quot;, but in IPA {{IPA|r}} means a trilled r, so we use the upside-down symbol.
* {{IPA|j}}: Usually &quot;y&quot; as in &quot;yesterday&quot; but also sometimes looks like a vowel, as in the first sound in the word &quot;usually&quot;.

Not so scary now, is it?

      <text xml:space="preserve">See also: [[:Category:Haskell/Stubs]]

== Cleanups ==
* [[../Other data structures]] - tricky one. While the discussion on generalized mapping was used as a lead into [[../The Functor class]] a little ahead, the tone of the discussion (specially the parts about folds) seem to lead towards discussion of morphisms, which probably belong to the advanced track (possibly, as Apfelmus once suggested, to [[../Datatype algebra]]). It should also be noted that the catamorphism folds described here are not the same than the folds done with Data.Foldable, which might be confusing for a curious newbie. Finally, there is not a passing mention (not even as pointers to the practical track) of common data structure libraries such as Data.Sequence, Data.Map, Data.Array... 
* [[../Practical monads]] - this one is quite messy. The forward pointers to the advanced track (such as the concurrency stuff near the end) aren't too bad of a problem at this point of the book, but still the chapter feels disjointed. Perhaps we should combine some or all of the parsing stuff (the Parsec section derived from &quot;Write yourself a Scheme&quot;, [[../Monadic parser combinators]] and [[../ParseExps]]) into a single page and move it to the practical track, leaving just a pointer in this chapter.  
* [[../Understanding arrows]]

== Stubs ==
* [[../Phantom types]]
* [[../CPS]]
* [[../Laziness revisited]]
* [[../Polymorphism]]
* [[../Strictness/]]
* [[../Advanced type classes]]
* [[../Concurrency]]
* [[../Algorithm complexity]]
* [[../Mutable objects]]
* [[../Debugging]]

== Unincorporated ==

* &lt;s&gt;[[Haskell/StephensArrowTutorial]] - it is a shame that this has spent nearly three years without a proper place in the book. I propose replacing [[Haskell/Arrows]] with it. ''In fact, I intend to do it - but first I need to study arrows myself. Meanwhile, feel free to do it if you agree. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 23:25, 6 May 2012 (UTC)''&lt;/s&gt; Done!

== Old pages ==

* [[../Beginning/]] - hey! this page actually seems kinda complete... was it overlooked somehow?
* [[../Preliminaries/]] - remove?
* [[Template:Haskell]]
* [[../Advanced monads/]] - should be kept for historical purposes. There might be a few little bits not yet on the Understanding monads subpages that might be worth transferring, mainly in the State subsection and the external links.
* [[../Monadic parser combinators/]] - perennial stub. Feel free to work on this chapter and reintegrate it into the book if you see a place for it.
* [[../Arrows/]] - the old initial arrows chapter. At this stage, the arrow tutorial is better suited for that role. This page will stay here should anyone feel like developing it further.

== Viable but removed red links and stubs ==

* [[Haskell/State]] - Kowey's stub had the following headers:
** IORef - passing information around
** Passing information without IO
** Mixing State with IO
** Reader and Writer - not quite State
* [[Haskell/Working with lists]] - this one was proposed by Apfelmus' as part of his plans for reorganization of the beginner modules. The idea was to introduce list comprehensions in Haskell Basics as an easy way of doing mapping and filtering without need for higher-order functions. ''Personal note: I removed the red link so that the reorganization warning can be finally dropped. This particular proposal of Apfelmus' makes sense, but I am not sure about how to pull it off while accounting for the implications for the surrounding chapters. Please do give it a try it if you see a way... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 08:43, 1 May 2012 (UTC)''

I appreciated how the Beginner track provided quite a bit of explanation and elaboration on concepts. I feel that I've stepped off into the deep end for a moment here. If someone who knows could go through this chapter and just expand and draw connections and things I think it would be improved.--[[User:Jberryman|Jberryman]] ([[User talk:Jberryman|talk]]) 01:58, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

== What is pattern matching? ==

Algebraic datatypes and the 'data' keyword appear without prior explanation.

:Thanks for the tip! I've linked algebraic datatypes to the relevant chapter.  Do you think this is enough? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

::No because the Type Declarations are a later chapter. You can't recall something from later in the book.
:::This is not the case any more, Type Declarations are now previous. Great!

well, you can &quot;pattern match&quot; against constants like 0 or 'a'... shouldn't they be mentioned?

: Just wrote a section on literal values to cover that --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 01:08, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

== lot of forward references == 
Case expressions are on the next page, Lambda is known to be part of the Greek alphabet - seriously, most of the &quot;Where you can use it&quot; section are heavily dependant on later chapters! See also:

=== Let expressions / Where clauses ===

&quot;Just x&quot;: it's assumed that the reader knows lookup returns Just something, and we are &quot;discarding the Just&quot;, whatever that means.

=== List comprehensions ===

Assumes understanding of Maybe &amp; Just.

=== Comments on above ===

Yep! Thanks for pointing that out.  This makes me rather convinced that doing things in the public is the best way to go.  People find your errors for you for free.  My attention is too divided right now to work on this.  I'm partly waiting for Hal to loosen his copyright on YAHT so that the wikibooks admins feel more comfortable with the issues (personally, I think it's just an implicit dual license - Hal keeps his stricter copyright, but accords us the GFDL).  When this is done, we can start remixing in earnest and really shaking things down.  In the meantime, if you feel that you have a bit of time on your hands, be bold and try rearranging it yourself! (it doesn't hurt to put a word on [[Talk:Haskell]] though.  The worst that can happen is that somebody will not like it and change it back :-).  Thanks again, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Just a note about double meanings ==

I'm learning haskell from this (excellent) tutorial after trying to learn it before with others.. (besides monads) I keep getting hung up on pattern matching because of the use of the same term in Perl, et al. It would clear up a lot of confusion if you explained right away that these are not the same concepts and maybe explain how they differ (or are similar). Thx --[[User:207.14.29.3|207.14.29.3]] 21:19, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

I agree.  I was understanding things fairly easily up until this chapter.  Coming from a Python/C/Java background, I was expecting pattern matching to be regular expressions. --[[User:Nfirvine|anglozaxxon]] 11:05, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the comments.  Is the following helpful?
{{body note|1=
=== Pattern matching on what? ===
Some languages like Perl and Python use pattern matching in a very specific way, that is to match regular expressions against strings. The pattern matching we are referring to in this chapter is quite different. In fact, you're probably best of forgetting what you know about pattern matching for now. Here, pattern matching is used in the same way as in others ML-like languages : to deconstruct values according to their type specification.}}
:Anyway, it's what I've included in the text for now.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:45, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

::-1. I suggest this to be changed, pattern matching as in regular expression and pattern matching as in value deconstruction is quite a different terms, just cut the explanation short into something like this: 

{{body note|1=
=== A short note about the term &quot;Pattern Matching&quot; ===
In some languages, like Perl and Python, the term &quot;Pattern Matching&quot; is used to mean matching regular expression patterns against strings. The pattern matching we are referring to in this chapter is not about regular expression. Here, pattern matching means deconstructing values according to their type specification. It is similar to tuple assignment in Python, but is much, much more powerful.}}

::reason is because Haskell's pattern matching is more akin to multiple assignment (tuple assignment) in Python than regex matching.

::PS: tuple assignment in Python is like this:

&lt;code&gt;
    a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
&lt;/code&gt;

::or a bit elaborated

&lt;code&gt;
    def func(): 
        return 1, 2, 3
    a, b, c = func()
&lt;/code&gt;
--[[User:The Kid|The Kid]] ([[User talk:The Kid|talk]]) 04:53, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

=== A comment about &quot;to deconstruct values according to their type specification&quot; ===
Doesn't pattern matching extend beyond values to functions as well? In that sense, pattern matching is not just about values or their type specifications, but also ad hoc matching of functions that produce those values and type specifications.

== Records? Just? Maybe? List Comprehensions? Lambda?==

There are lots of mentions of topics that haven't been covered yet. All of the above are mentioned in this module as examples of pattern matching, but without knowing what they are, the examples are of no use.
It would probably be better to have pattern matching using only the syntax we have so far covered. Pattern matching for other topics can be shown when those topics are taught in other modules.
:I second that. At least records should be handled in [Haskell/Type_declarations]. List comprehensions could be introduced together with lists. --[[User:SealedSun|SealedSun]] ([[User talk:SealedSun|talk]]) 12:19, 3 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

Nice to see you back. Add yourself to the Infobox if you plan on being here a while. Chazz is still cranking and we have a new copyeditor as well. I see you fixed the template too which is funny because I'm not super-skilled with templates and noticed the same thing you did.

== MG2HP Templates ==

Why the Beginner spoiler -&gt; Spoiler change? Actually, that's Matt's suggestion: It can be either, but the summary, he felt, would be a spoiler for everyone and not just for beginners, so he suggested that we should use the standard rather than the beginner-specific. In the project Discussion archives:
:I would think that the general spoiler template should only be used on plot pages. That keeps its use to only the Books section. Any other sections will be sufficiently flagged using the Beginner and Intermediate spoiler templates. -Matt 14:03, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
I was changing back to Beginner Spoiler pretty religiously as I created chapter summaries for PoA, but after discussion with Matt (which I can't now find, possibly in his Talk history), at his request I started reverting to the standard spoiler template. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

:One of these days I'll learn to read... Yes, it is still valid to use the beginner spoiler everywhere except, apparently, chapter summaries. Not only valid but encouraged. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

::Actually, from my talk history, you may see that Matt and I nattered back and forth for a while before we got those frameworks together. You may also see that there are two versions of the Magic framework: I suggested an Extended Description section, and Matt agreed to it, so I have been adding that as I could. So last time you were working with us, those frameworks didn't exist as such. Oh, and welcome back, eh? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 23:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

== MG2HP timeline ==

Hmm. I knew I had seen that Oct 31 1981 date somewhere before, but I'm away from my references right now and can't immediately place where. It is mentioned as gospel / canon on a number of fan sites, though. I'll try to track that down and get back to you. Why do you say it doesn't fit very well? What would you see as being a better date? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 23:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
:Good point... the original does say it was a Tuesday as well, and I agree with you that October 31 in 1981 was a Saturday. Which means possibly that JKR got it wrong, or possibly that the fan sites have leapt to conclusions. There are a lot of calendar errors in the series – ephemeris says that JKR's dates for full moon in PoA are wrong, and even if we hunt for a  year when they are right, they don't all match. And there aren't enough of them. Probably the best course is to simply not buy into the fan sites contention that it was 31 October. I'll modify the time line and the chapter summary to eliminate Oct. 31 as the date. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 04:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
::Damn, you're right... there it is. &quot;All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Hallowe'en ten years ago.&quot; Hmm... Okay. The authoritative entry on that is thus PS/SS chapter 4, and that's where references should point. I'm pressed for time right now, but I will reinstate that information in the analysis section  of PS/SS chapter 1, link it to chapter 4 appropriately, and include the appropriate comments there and in the timeline section. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 18:47, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

One thing that has been impressed on Hermione is that she is not allowed to change the past, to the point that she is absolutely horrified to discover that Harry actually cast the Patronus that saved everyone. If she had already altered the past by distracting Lupin, she would not be so upset that Harry had altered the past by performing the Patronus. In my edition of the book, when they see Lupin changing, the three of them, Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak, simply retreat swiftly and silently to Hagrid's hut.

:You are correct; I over-reacted, because I had unmade the same change in about four places and it was coming back again, so I leapt to conclusions. My apologies, my liege. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:25, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

==Watchlist==

Thank you for the pointer. The problem with any watch list is that it can't pick up new pages added; for that matter, the RecentChangesLinked list will also only show pages that have been added if the editor that added them put them properly into the MG category. Granted, also, the RecentPages categories are limited to recent changes (one month); still, I'm on here often enough that this is not a major concern. I understand that your life forces long &quot;idle periods&quot; on you, and so Recent Changes is likely not appropriate for your situation; but I am somewhat in awe of someone who can handle a 700+ page watch list...  [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:51, 6 May 2007 (UTC)
:Umm... but the &quot;unvisited blue&quot; color re-appears after a month, so unless you walk your watchlist and turn all 700+ pages of it purple again, each month, you could end up thinking someone has added something to all the project. Which is, I presume, another reason a very massive watch list is hard to manage. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 08:03, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

== Squib ==

Excuse me for asking, but I don't think I've ever seen a squib referred to as a &quot;Non&quot;. Could you point me to a reference? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:24, 27 June 2007 (UTC)
:Not a problem... I salute you for your ability to work across language lines so very well. Errors will creep in, and I have had my fair share of them... quite apart from the typos.

== Muggle's Guide general questions ==

I saw that you were asking about a permanent link to the Wizard of the Month on JKR's site. In fact, there is no such permanent link as far as I know, any more than there are permanent links to the character birthdays. Apparently those two pages exist only as dynamically generated pages based on month or day. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:55, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

== Singular possessive ==

I personally don't like &quot;s's&quot; and haven't seen that purposefully used in the Guide so far. I am surprised that Wikipedia takes the stance that this is explicitly &quot;nonstandard&quot; and I definitely disagree. In my professional experience, even discussing this with English professors, both are allowed and the &quot;s's&quot; creates a dragging &quot;s&quot; sound which is undesirable. We may want to discuss this as a whole to decide a permanent stance, but I'm for the &quot;nonstandard&quot; usage. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:21, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

:So we agree that we don't like &quot;s's&quot; then? I don't think we have to obey the grammar rules Rowling follows either, especially if she's contradictory at times. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:17, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:I really dislike the &quot;s's&quot; for proper nouns (and so does Chazz I believe) so I'd prefer it if we didn't use them. It's not &quot;the Jones's daughter went to the park&quot; to me but &quot;the Jones' daughter went to the park&quot;. Right now Firefox's spell checker is disliking the &quot;s's&quot; as well.

== Epilogue ==

I was being lazy and didn't look it up before, but I do have a book right next to me (although I haven't finished reading it yet and keep screwing myself up by revealing spoilers as I edit here). According to the TOC (and this is the US version) the chapter is called &quot;Epilogue&quot;. Perhaps the actual page at the chapter doesn't say that, but I believe it's still the chapter name. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:16, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:Weird. Maybe once Chazz and PNW Raven reappear we can get a consensus decision. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:21, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

::Alright, we're both sort of correct in the end but I'm probably less correct. The TOC says just &quot;Epilogue&quot; and a page number. The front page of the chapter says &quot;Epilogue&quot; where the chapter number goes (i.e. &quot;chapter twenty-six&quot;), then there's the typical drawing, then &quot;Nineteen Years Later&quot;. Therefore, I figure the book page and page name should be left &quot;Epilogue&quot; and the title in the page text be reverted to your &quot;Nineteen Years Later&quot;.

== Muggles' guide: map of the school locations ==

Hiya,

Just to let you know, I am asking for some feedback on the Muggle's Guide, basically on the return of the map of the possible locations of the 3 wizarding schools in Europe (it was deleted from the common).
The link [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Places/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry#Map_of_the_locations_of_the_know_wizarding_schools_in_Europe] describes my thoughts, and opens the discussion.

The main question is: how much speculation can we allow ourselves in this book? Please, leave a comment if you wish to.

Thanks --[[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] 23:04, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

== Welcome back ==

Good to see you posting again, Jokes. It was getting a bit lonely over at the Muggles' Guide. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:40, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
:Well, there is still the Todo stuff on the project page. Where we are lacking right now is actually analysis; PNW Raven is doing an incredible job on that, but there's only one of her. She's done analysis and greater picture for DH and is now working on GoF, but all of the others, especially OotP and HBP, are in need as well. I'm currently fleshing out Major Events, and look to give Magic the same treatment next unless someone beats me to it; Places may need some attention as well. So, yeah, still lots to do.

== Chronicles of Narnia ==

Thank you for looking at those, Jokes. I'm working from a laptop at the moment, and I don't like the keyboard... key travel is too short and the keys tend to jam if I don't hit them just right. So my work is rife with typos.

In case you are wondering, the Chronicles are being put together for [[User:ChazzJr|ChazzJr]], who says he wants to do for Narnia what we've done for Harry Potter. I don't see it as being the sort of thing that attracts as much attention, so anything you care to do with it would be welcome. ChazzJr is not yet 100% with capitalization, also, which is why that is a problem there... but he is young yet, he will learn.

The problem that you fixed in those two entries is endemic to the entire page and will have to be fixed by something with a regexp handler; it would be too tedious otherwise.

== Template changes ==

See [[User_talk:Chazz#Muggles.27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter]] for the goal of the template code.

:I don't understand why you're taking issue with this now.  I had this same code on all the Philosopher's Stone chapters since May for a trial run.

:I changed the printonly line to show the chapter number, book, and title on both print versions and non-print versions.  For those without JavaScript, it shows them the title.  For those with, it duplicates the title, unfortunately, but it shows the chapter number and book in case they don't pay attention to the vertical navigation links that are automatically generated by the path. Since the template is not part of PDF versions because of its &quot;exclude in print&quot; category, it won't be creating a redundant line in the PDF output.

:No changes to the template affect the PDF version because the template is in [[:Category:Exclude in print]].

You could also have a &quot;noprint&quot; portion in the &quot;else&quot; for content that should appear on the page but not appear when printing that individual page. The &quot;printonly&quot; was removed in order to show the chapter title regardless of whether one was printing or not, for those without JavaScript support. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:13, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

== Overview ==

The '''''Dark Mark''''' is a sigil or sign, being the image of a skull with a snake twisting through it. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Dark Mark, being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s sign, is almost as much feared as Voldemort is himself. There is an incantation, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Morsmordre]], which will create an image of the Dark Mark floating in the sky above the caster; this symbol was routinely left floating above a house in which the inhabitants had been killed by Death Eaters.

Every Death Eater also has a copy of this emblem or sigil burned into his left forearm by Voldemort himself; its clarity and color change with the Dark Lord's power. They also serve as a signalling device; when Voldemort touches the Dark Mark of any Death Eater, all other Dark Marks turn black and painful. This is a signal to all Death Eaters to stop what they are doing and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] immediately to Voldemort's side. The communication aspect of the mark also appears reversed, as Death Eaters are able to touch their marks to call Lord Voldemort.

== Analysis ==

It is, of course, significant that the Dark Lord's call involves inflicting pain on his supporters. It is clear by this alone that Voldemort does not lead so much as whip his followers into line; they follow more out of fear and the hopes of getting some of his leavings, rather than out of respect.

It is uncertain how much information is transferred via the Dark Mark. When we first see it used, it seems to be implied that it is acting as a simple caller; Voldemort says that his touching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail's]] Mark will summon his Death Eaters to his side. Later, we see that individual Death Eaters seem to be able to transfer more information than that to Voldemort, identifying themselves and their locations as well as indicating that they have found &quot;the boy&quot; ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]). As individual Death Eaters use it to notify Voldemort of events, we also find that it is a broadcast system; at least some Death Eaters can perceive when other Death Eaters report to Voldemort.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# Does Voldemort have a Dark Mark?  If so, why doesn't he use ''it'' to summon his Death Eaters, instead of Pettigrew's Mark?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Clearly, when Voldemort summons all his Death Eaters to the graveyard in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', it is then a broadcast, as more than one Death Eater responds. The fact that they responded with such alacrity indicates that they knew it was Voldemort summoning them, which means that the individual touching the Mark, rather than the individual wearing the Mark, is the one identified with the sending. (Recall that it was Pettigrew's Mark that Voldemort touched, not his own – if in fact Voldemort has one.) When Alecto Carrow summons Voldemort because Harry has been located inside Hogwarts, Snape evidently intercepts the message.

Both in the broadcast nature of the communications, and in the ability to pass extra information, one can see great similarity to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|Protean charm]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] actually notes the resemblance when speaking with members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

No, I'm not a Dr. not yet at least, and Darsh isn't my real name either. Dr Darsh is just how they nickname me. 


Anyway, I'm always reluctant to talk, so here we are. Naturally I'm here because I beleive in free learning. To offer the opportunity of learning to everybody... to avoid losing any good minds... 


Whatever, you will find my contribuitions often in &quot;points&quot;. I don't like very much to chat in my works, but I don't know if you are used to that. 


So, feel free to edit. I hope I can be useful. You can e-mail me if you want to discuss something. It's B_smart88@hotmail.com (where 88 does '''not''' refer to Hitler, since I was asked about that many times before).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biomechanics is the study of the mechanics of tissues. Though the subject is typically considered a foundational aspect of Bioengineering, it is often part of a Biophysics curriculum, as it involves many concepts from physics in order to fully understand the biological mechanisms. 

The types of tissues we are going to study are muscles, lungs and blood vessels, each with special characteristics to accomplish contraction functions and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's begin now. This part has a lot of biology, but like the biology of biophysics in general, it's quite interesting. You won't be taught systematic or morphology or anything that actually doesn't have a link to some physical mechanism. So the biology here is not &quot;pure biology&quot; just for knowledge, which is really a relief for people like me. 


Ok, now let's see what we've got. Try to use your imagination as some mechanisms need you to picture what happens in the three dimensions... Whatever let's begin.



== Skeletal muscle morphology ==
[[Image:Skeletal muscle.jpg|right|300px|thumbnail|A top-down view of skeletal muscle]]

'''Connective tissues in muscles'''

''Epimysium''

Outer covering of muscles(fascia).

''Perimysium''

Internal connective sheath separating large portions of muscle tissue.

''Endomysium''

Internal connective sheath separating individual groups of muscle cells.

''Tendons''

Connective tissues connecting muscles to bones.

[[Image:Musclon1.jpg]]

'''Muscle bundles and muscles fibers'''

''Muscle bundle (fasciculus)''

Group of muscle fibers enclosed by perimysium and subdivided by endomysium.

''Muscle fiber (cell)''

Multinucleate syncytium resulting from the fusion of many embryonic muscle cells (myoblasts).

== Muscles Systems ==

'''a.	Membrane system:'''

1)	Sarcolemma: plasma membrane of the muscle cell. It conducts action potential (AP). Motor endplates and many openings to the T-tubules are found on the sarcolemma.

2)	T-tubules (transverse tubules): system of tubules continuous with both sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. They pass from one side of the cell to another and are filled with extracellular fluid.

3)	Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR): the internal membrane system of the cell. It is connected to the T-tubules. When AP moves along the sarcolemma, it enters the T-tubules and sets off a general depolarization of SR. 

4)	T-system: SR that is associated with the T-tubules.

5)	Cisternae: regions of SR that concentrate large amounts of Ca2　by actively removing it from the sarcoplasm. Thus, they contain

o	Ca2　ATPase (a Ca2　pump).

o	Voltage dependent Ca2　channels that can release Ca2　back into the sarcoplasm when the SR is depolarized.

[[Image:Musclon2.jpg]]

'''b.	Contractile system:'''

Myofibrils: bundles of 4 types of proteins. They produce the contractile force. There are 2 types: thick myofibrils and thin myofibrils.


'''c.	Support system:'''

Ø	Produces the ~P needed for contractions.

Ø	Serves as a road for Ca2 to flow from cisternae to the thin fibrils.

Ø	Supports general functions of the cell (protein synthesis…etc.).

Ø	It consists of

1)	''Sarcoplasm:'' the cytosol. It is the seat of the glycolytic reactions to form ~P from carbohydrates. It thus contains stores of glycogen and ~P (in form of ATP and phosphagen).

2)	''Mitochondria:'' located next to the fibrils. They are present in all muscle cells but vary in no. In muscles that depend heavily on O2 for ~P generation, they make up 50% of cell volume. In cells that are mainly anaerobic, they make up less than 1% of cell volume.


== Muscle contraction ==

§	Muscle contraction depends on the hydrolysis of ~P from ATP.

§	The striations on muscle cells consist of alternating light and dark regions. (see image above)


'''a.	Light I bands (isotropic):'''

Ø	The middles of I bands have transverse lines called Z-lines.

Ø	I bands are composed of thin filaments that

-	Are fixed to the Z-lines.
 
-	Are arranged in a lattice.

-	Are made of 3 types of proteins: actin, troponin and tropomyosin.

-	Have many glycolytic enzymes, indicating the importance of ATP produced.


Ø	Sarcomere = area between 2 adjacent Z-lines.

[[Image:Musclon3.jpg]]

'''b.	Dark A bands (anisotropic):'''

Ø	At rest, A bands have a light colored central region called H zone.

Ø	H zone is made of thick filaments composed of 1 type of protein: myosin.

Ø	A bands are composed of both thick and thin filaments, so they are the darkest.


'''c.	During contraction:'''

Ø	According to the “Sliding filament theory”,

1)	The thin filaments move along the thick filaments and move further into the H zone, slowly obliterating it.

2)	Since the thin filaments are fixed to the Z lines, the sarcomere decreases in length.


Ø	The “Cross-bridge theory” replaced the former theory to explain the physical connections (cross-bridges) between the thick and thin filaments.



== Studies used to explain muscle contraction ==

'''a.	X-ray crystallography:''' 

To see how proteins’ shapes (conformations) change with respect to different conditions.


'''b.	Protein biochemistry:''' 

To explain the chemical properties of proteins involved in contraction.


'''c.	Histochemistry:''' 

To test ideas about muscle contraction on real cells. The techniques include injection of dyes to change color according to Ca2　　 present in the sarcoplasm or according to voltage.


== The thin filaments ==

(Please look at the thumbnail picture at the beginning for further understanding).

'''a.	Actin:'''

Ø	Most of the thin filament is a double helix of 2 F actin polymers.

Ø	Each F actin is made of a large no. of single actin molecules called G actin (globular proteins, MW = 45000).

Ø	Each G actin can bind to

-	Other G actins to form a polymer.

-	Troponin. 

-	Myosin.

[[Image:Actin filament.jpg]]

'''b.	Troponin:'''

Ø	Least common protein.

Ø	It is the filament-level regulator of crossbridge formation.

Ø	It has a quantenary structure made of 3 subunits:

1)	Troponin-I binds actin to troponin-C.

2)	Troponin-C (most important), can bind up to 4 Ca2　　.

3)	Troponin-T binds troponin-C to tropomyosin.


Ø	It is allosteric: it can change shape in response to the amount of Ca2　　 that has bound to it. 

Ø	The steep part of the curve indicates that a slight change in Ca2　　 causes a large effect on troponin’s shape.

[[Image:Troponino.jpg]]

'''c.	Tropomyosin:'''

Ø	Rod-shaped molecule attached to troponin.

Ø	At rest, tropomyosin is held over the myosin binding sites on the actin.

Ø	During contraction, Ca2　　 is high and tropomyosin is moved away from the binding sites to let myosin bind to actin. This occurs by the binding of troponin to 4 Ca, then it deforms and “bends”. Doing so, it moves the tropomyosin in the groove between the 2 actin filaments, letting the actin binding site to myosin revealed.

Ø	So, the role of tropomyosin is to produce “steric hindrance” to the binding of myosin to actin.

[[Image:Tropomyosin.jpg]]

'''d.	Polarity:'''

The thin filaments show a polarity: they only bind with myosin heads that point in a certain direction. This polarity reverses at each side of the Z-line.

== The thick filaments ==

§	They are composed of myosin, a very large (MW = 470000), quantenary (6 chains) allosteric protein.

§	Each myosin consists of 2 identical subunits wrapped around each other. Each subunit consists of 1 heavy chain and 2 different light chains.


'''a.	Components of the heavy chain:'''

1)	Tail: long, very insoluble units that polymerize with each other to form what is viewed as the thick filament.

2)	Neck: its material is similar to that making up the tails, except that it is more water-soluble and is flexible.

3)	Globular heads: large and water-soluble. They contain 

o	Binding sites for actin. So, together with necks, they make the cross-bridges.

o	ATPase. 


'''b.	Light chains:'''

They are attached to the globular heads of the heavy chains. Have regulatory function


'''c.	Polarity:'''

1)	Polarity results from the way the myosin tails are connected together. 

2)	Myosin polarity reverses at the center of each sarcomere.

3)	All myosin heads on one side of the center move together, pulling the thin filament towards the center of the sarcomere.

[[Image:Myosin filament.jpg]]

'''d.	Note:'''

§ Each thick and thin filament is organized in a 3D lattice that permits each filament to form cross-bridges with several others.

§ Contraction occurs by the heads of myosin, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere. This &quot;pulling&quot; by heads is done by continuously breaking and building a bond between the head and the neck of myosin (imagine a bond between your thumb and your index. As the bond breaks and rebuilds, your thumb continuously goes and move away from your index. This &quot;leaving-returning&quot; mechanism allows the myosin to pull the actin).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}


==Radiation-Induced Liver Disease (RILD)==
*Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) endpoint which limits dose delivered
*Historically called &quot;radiation hepatitis&quot;
*Clinical syndrome: fatigue, RUQ pain, ascites, anicteric hepatomegaly, elevated LFTs (esp. alkaline phosphatase)
*Pathologic changes: veno-occlusive disease, marked central venous congestion, sparing of large veins, entrapment of erythrocytes, atrophy of adjactent hepatocytes
**Clinically similar to TBI or high-dose chemotherapy
*Pathophysiology: deposition of fibrin in central veins, injury to endothelial cells rather than hepatocytes, TGF-beta and TNF-alpha activation
*Develops usually 1-2 months after RT (range 2 weeks - 8 months)
*Treatment: supportive; most patients recover, but can lead to liver failure and death


*'''Stanford, 1966''' PMID 5327788 -- &quot;The human liver after radiation injury. A form of veno-occlusive disease.&quot; (Reed GB Jr, Am J Pathol. 1966 Apr;48(4):597-611.)
**Seminal paper on RILD. 12 patients with total liver irradiation for metastatic disease. RT: 30 – 59 Gy over 6 weeks. 5 patients received chemotherapy
**Pathology: Acutely: prounounced hyperemia; Chronic: veno-occlusive disease with marked hepatocyte atrophy
**Re-establishment of effective circulation and normalization of hepatic structure after 4 months

==Normal Liver Tolerance==
*First reported liver radiation was in 1924. Liver cells were felt to be resistant to radiation
*Several RTOG studies in the 1970's and 1980's determined whole liver tolerance to be 30-35 Gy. This allowed reasonable but short palliation, and no possibility of cure
*First rigorous (based on CT) partial liver tolerance analysis came from Lawrence Berkeley Lab in 1985, using heavy ions. 
**If whole liver dose was 18 Gy, then doses &gt;30-35 Gy should be confined to &lt;30% of liver
*Emami report in 1991 established baseline partial liver tolerances. These were mostly speculative
**TD5/5: 1/3 = 50 Gy, 2/3 = 35 Gy, 3/3 = 30 Gy
**TD50/5: 1/3 = 55 Gy, 2/3 = 45 Gy, 3/3 = 40 Gy
*Burman report in 1991 fitted these values into the Lyman model, with the following parameters:
**n = 0.32, m = 0.15
*Lawrence report in 1992 (University of Michigan data), adjusted the Lyman model parameters:
**n = 0.69 
*Jackson report in 1995, University of Michigan data), modeled liver as a parallel organ:
**TD50 = 41.6 Gy (in 1.5 Gy BID), V50 (mean functional reserve) = 49.7%
*Dawson report in 2002 (University of Michigan data), further adjusted the Lyman model parameters:
**n = 1.1, m = 0.18
**TD5/5 (in 1.5 Gy BID): 1/3 = 107 Gy (~94 Gy in 2Gy/fx), 2/3 = 54 Gy (~48 Gy in 2Gy/fx), 3/3 = 37 Gy (~32 in 2Gy/fx)
**Due to parallel nature, mean liver dose is directly proportional to risk of RILD. Thus, 5% risk of RILD for whole liver RT is at 32 Gy
**Small liver volumes (&lt;25%) can tolerate doses &gt;100 Gy
**There is a difference between normal liver tolerance (with liver mets) and HCC liver tolerance (which is quite a bit lower)


'''Partial Liver Tolerance'''
*'''University of Michigan data''' 
**'''2002''' PMID 12095546 -- &quot;Analysis of radiation-induced liver disease using the Lyman NTCP model.&quot; (Dawson LA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Jul 15;53(4):810-21.) 	
***203 patients treated with conformal liver RT and CT prospectively followed; 19 developed RILD
***No cases developed for mean liver dose &lt;31 Gy
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These data demonstrate that the liver exhibits a large volume effect for RILD, suggesting that the mean liver dose may be useful in ranking radiation plans. The inclusion of clinical factors, especially the diagnosis of primary hepatobiliary cancer vs. liver metastases, improves the estimation of NTCP over that obtained solely by the use of dose-volume data.&quot;
***&lt;u&gt;Comment&lt;/u&gt;: PMID 15001282 -- &quot;Analysis of radiation-induced liver disease using the Lyman NTCP model: in regard to Dawson et al. IJROBP 2002;53:810-821.&quot; (Tome WA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Mar 15;58(4):1318-9; author reply 1319-20.)

**Retrospective. 3 patients s/p liver transplant treated with 30 Gy at 1.5 Gy/fx BID (2 patients) or 45 Gy to hilus + 5-FU infusion.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Transplanted livers exhibit responses to radiation similar to those normally observed.&quot;

**11 patients treated with heavy charged particles, whole liver 10-24 GyE, tumor 53.5-70 GyE
**1 radiation hepatitis
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Liver doses in excess of 30 to 35 GyE should be limited to 30% of the liver or less when 18 GyE of whole liver radiation is delivered at 2 GyE per fraction&quot;

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;DNA repair-promoting genes were up-regulated in radio-resistant cells and down-regulated or unchanged in radiation-sensitive cells.

***HBV carrier status significant independent predictor for RILD
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;RILD is described with a parallel-architecture NTCP model for HBV carriers and noncarriers with a threshold effect greater than 0.4. The main difference is in slope parameter for subunit dose-response.&quot;

**'''2002''' PMID 12182986 -- &quot;Radiation-induced liver disease after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: dosimetric analysis and implication.&quot; (Cheng JC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Sep 1;54(1):156-62.)
***Retrospective. 93 patients treated, 68 HCC and complete 3D data evaluated. 50 had chronic viral hepatitis (B or C). Median dose 50.2 Gy in 1.8/2 Gy/fx, no whole liver RT.
***18% developed RILD. No difference in patient characteristics, mean hepatic dose higher (25.0 vs. 19.7 Gy). Lyman NTCP volume effect 0.40, curve steepness 0.26, TD(50) 43 Gy. NTCP higher (26% vs. 16%, p=0.006)
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Dose-volume histogram analysis can be effectively used to quantify the tolerance of the liver to RT. Patients with RILD had received a significantly higher mean dose to the liver and a significantly higher NTCP. The fitted volume effect parameter of the Lyman NTCP model was close to that from the literature, but much lower in our patients with HCC and prevalent chronic viral hepatitis than that reported in other series with patients with normal liver function. Additional efforts should be made to test other models to describe the radiation tolerance of the liver for Asian patients with HCC and preexisting compromised hepatic reserve.&quot;

**Review article
**&quot;The mean liver doses associated with a 5% risk of classic RILD for primary and metastatic liver cancer are 28 Gy and 32 Gy, respectively, in 2 Gy per fraction.&quot;

**Rat model of cirrhosis. Treated with partial RT, 5-FU, or partial RT + 5-FU
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In a rat cirrhosis model with mildly impaired liver function, combined treatment of partial RT plus 5-FU  resulted in significantly high incidence of lethal liver injury. The results in this study show that a combined treatment of RT plus chemotherapy in cirrhotic patients should be applied with extreme caution.&quot;

Another 2002 article suggested that when the effective liver volume is 1.0 (i.e., whole liver irradiation), the dose with 5% RILD incidence is 24Gy, and dose with 50% RILD incidence is 43Gy. However if the effective liver volume irradiated is 0.5 (ie., half the liver), the 5% RILD incidence occurs at 32Gy.

      <comment>deprecating prettytable, replaced: prettytable → wikitable</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This circuit is useful for application where a signal has to pulse fast, and slow down to a stop, such as electronic dice, games timers, etc. If gives an output like the one below:

[[image:Diminishing_Frequency_Waveform.svg|center|350]]

The way the diminishing frequency is achieved is by using another capacitor to run the timing components. As the exponentially decreasing voltage from this capacitor falls, it slows the rate of charging of the timing capcitor, which decreases the output frequency. Eventually, the voltage from the control capacitor falls beolw 2/3 supply voltage, and the astable stops. The circuit diagram is given below.

{|align=center
|[[image:555 Diminishing Frequency Astable.svg|center|300px]]
|
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Component!!Value
|-
|IC1||555 Timer
|-
|R1||100R
|-
|R2||470K
|-
|R3||470K
|-
|C1||47&amp;mu;F
|-
|C2||10nF
|-
|C3||100nF
|}
|}

These value give a freqency of about 100Hz, which runs down in about 30 seconds. Experiment with values to get the effect you want, being in mind the following guidelines:

The size of the control capcitor, C1, governs the time it take to run down. Bear in mind that for a very large value of C1, R1 must be small enough to allow the control capacitor to charge in the time that SW1 is pressed down.

R2 and R3 must have high values, as if they are too small, the control capcitor, C1, will be discharged too quickly, and the astable will &quot;run down&quot; in a very short time. This also means that the addition of the 100R resistor for charging the capacitor safely does not significantly alter the timing of the circuit while the switch is pressed down.

      <comment>/* In Gtk2Hs Haskell → the code is now highlighted */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This small tutorial demonstrates creating a simple window with a single button. When the button is clicked, the contents of that label on the button is printed to stdout.

The label is packed into the button, which is in turn packed into the window.

Firstly, you must include the gtk header file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include&lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, two '''callback functions''' prototypes are defined, one for closing the window, and one for clicking on the button. Callback functions are basically functions that are called by lower-level code (in this case, GTK itself) by being passed the function address.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 static gint delete_callback(GtkWidget* w, GdkEventAny* e, gpointer data);
 static void button_callback(GtkWidget* w ,gpointer data); 
&lt;/source&gt;

==Full source==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include&lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;
 
 static gint delete_callback(GtkWidget* w, GdkEventAny* e, gpointer data);
 static void button_callback(GtkWidget* w ,gpointer data); 
 
 int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 {
   GtkWidget* window;
   GtkWidget* button;
   GtkWidget* label;
   
   gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
   
   window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
   button = gtk_button_new();
   label = gtk_label_new(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
   
   gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(button),label);
   gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), button);
   
   gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), &quot; Hello World&quot;);
   gtk_container_set_border_width(GTK_CONTAINER(button),10);
   gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window),400,400);         
   
   gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(window),
 		     &quot;delete_event&quot;,
 		     GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(delete_callback),
 		     NULL);
   
   gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(button),
 		     &quot;clicked&quot;,
 		     GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(button_callback),
 		     label);

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]
[[Image:Greek yoghurt panna cotta in blackberry sauce.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Panna cotta in blackberry sauce]]

'''Panna cotta''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dessert, the name of which means ''cooked cream''. Similar dishes are also found in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greece]].

==Traditional recipe==
===Ingredients Panna cotta===

* 15g [[Cookbook:Gelatine|gelatin]]
* 2 cups (500ml) [[Cookbook:Cream|heavy cream]]
* 200g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 cups (500ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

===Ingredients Red fruits Sauce===

* 100g berries ([[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]], [[Cookbook:Blueberry|blueberries]])
* 100g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

-The sauce can be any fruit (peach, pear, ...)

===Procedure===
Dissolve the gelatin in 2 cups of cold water (around 5 minutes).

In a pot, place the milk, cream, sugar, gelatin previously soaked in cold water. Heat the pot to a gentle boil (stirring regularly to prevent burns) and remove from heat.

Pour the mixture into molds suited to a small portion for dessert, and let cool for 2 or 3 hours in the refrigerator.

While waiting, liquidize the berries, combining with the [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. 

When ready to serve, release the dessert onto a plate, and decorate with red fruit sauce.

Note:  If you are using packets of gelatine, weigh the gelatine.  The amount of gelatine in a packet may vary.

==Basic recipe==
===Ingredients===

* ¾ tsp. [[Cookbook:Gelatine|gelatin]]
* 2 cups (480ml) [[Cookbook:Cream|heavy cream]]
* ½ cup (60g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1½ tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla essence]] or 1 small vanilla bean
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===Procedure===
Allow the gelatin to dissolve in 1 Tbl of the cream for about 5 minutes. Combine the remaining ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves and tiny bubbles appear around the edge of your pan, remove from heat and add the gelatin, stir until it is thoroughly incorporated. Pour the cream mixture into small ramekins (baking dishes) and allow to set in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, up to overnight. Serve with fresh [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]], [[Cookbook:Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]], port, or a sweet sauce.

==Lighter recipe==

Phantom types are a way to embed a language with a stronger type system than Haskell's. &lt;!--''FIXME: that's about all I know, and it's probably wrong. :) I'm yet to be convinced of PT's usefulness, I'm not sure they should have such a prominent position.'' [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 17:42, 1 July 2006 (UTC)--&gt;

== Phantom types ==
An ordinary type

 data T = TI Int | TS String
 
 plus :: T -&gt; T -&gt; T
 concat :: T -&gt; T -&gt; T

its phantom type version

 data T a = TI Int | TS String

Nothing's changed - just a new argument &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; that we don't touch.  But magic!
 
 plus :: T Int -&gt; T Int -&gt; T Int
 concat :: T String -&gt; T String -&gt; T String

Now we can enforce a little bit more!

This is useful if you want to increase the type-safety of your code, but not impose additional runtime overhead:

 -- Peano numbers at the type level.
 data Zero = Zero
 data Succ a = Succ a
 -- Example: 3 can be modeled as the type
 -- Succ (Succ (Succ Zero)))
 
 type D2 = Succ (Succ Zero)
 type D3 = Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))
 
 data Vector n a = Vector [a] deriving (Eq, Show)
 
 vector2d :: Vector D2 Int
 vector2d = Vector [1,2]
 
 vector3d :: Vector D3 Int
 vector3d = Vector [1,2,3]
 
 -- vector2d == vector3d raises a type error
 -- at compile-time:
 
 --   Couldn't match expected type `Zero'
 --               with actual type `Succ Zero'
 --   Expected type: Vector D2 Int
 --     Actual type: Vector D3 Int
 --   In the second argument of `(==)', namely `vector3d'
 --   In the expression: vector2d == vector3d
 
 -- while vector2d == Vector [1,2,3] works

== Types ==
There are several different types of textures that can be used with opengl:
*GL_TEXTURE_1D: This is a one dimensional texture. (requires opengl 1.0)
*GL_TEXTURE_2D: This is a two dimensional texture (it has both a width and a height). (requires opengl 1.0)
*GL_TEXTURE_3D: This is a three dimensional texture (has a width, height and a depth). (requires opengl 1.2)
*GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP: Cube maps are similar to 2D textures but generally store six images inside the texture. Special texture mapping is used to map these images onto a virtual sphere. (requires opengl 1.3)
*GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB: this texture format is much like the two dimensional texture but supports non power of two sized textures (requires 

== Basic usage ==
&lt;pre&gt;
 GLuint theTexture;
 glGenTextures(1, &amp;theTexture);
 glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, theTexture);
 glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_DECAL);
 // ...
 glTexImage2D(...);
 // draw stuff here
 glDeleteTextures(1, &amp;theTexture);
&lt;/pre&gt;

When you set up a new texture, you will usually have a pixel array in memory, as well as the dimensions of the  image. (Image libraries or OpenGL wrappers might provide you with routines to read various graphic formats and directly make textures from them, but in the end it is all the same.)

For that, you first tell OpenGL to give you a new texture &quot;template&quot;, which you then select to work with it afterwards. You set various parameters, like how the texture is drawn. It is possible to make it that, for textures with alpha channel, the objects behind it are drawn, but it is incompatible with the depth buffer (it does not know the texture is translucent, marks the object in the front as solid and will not draw the objects behind). You then need to sort the objects by their distance to the camera by yourself and draw them in that order to get proper results. This is not handled here, by the way.

Finally you give OpenGL the pixel array and it will load the texture into memory.

Let's write a function that allows us to read the pixel array from a file, specifying the dimensions as parameters:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
 
 GLuint raw_texture_load(const char *filename, int width, int height)
 {
     GLuint texture;
     unsigned char *data;
     FILE *file;
     
     // open texture data
     file = fopen(filename, &quot;rb&quot;);
     if (file == NULL) return 0;
     
     // allocate buffer
     data = (unsigned char*) malloc(width * height * 4);
     
     // read texture data
     fread(data, width * height * 4, 1, file);
     fclose(file);
     
     // allocate a texture name
     glGenTextures(1, &amp;texture);
     
     // select our current texture
     glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture);
     
     // select modulate to mix texture with color for shading
     glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_REPLACE);
     
     glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_DECAL);
     glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_DECAL);
     
     // when texture area is small, bilinear filter the closest mipmap
     glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST);
     // when texture area is large, bilinear filter the first mipmap
     glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
     
     // texture should tile
     glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_REPEAT);
     glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_REPEAT);
     
     // build our texture mipmaps
     gluBuild2DMipmaps(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 4, width, height, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data);
     
     // free buffer
     free(data);
     
     return texture;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;


The function eats image files that contain all pixel values in the order R, G, B, A. Such can be created using GIMP, for example: Make the image, merge all layers (necessary, because the RAW export module is broken), give it an alpha channel, save it and select RAW in the list of file types (at the bottom). (A recent version, 2.3 or up may be needed, I had problems with 2.2).

It returns you an OpenGL texture ID which you can select with ''glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture)'' (passing the ID for ''texture'').

Now that we loaded our texture, see how we can use it:

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* compile with: gcc -lGL -lglut -Wall -o texture texture.c */
 
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;

     #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 #endif
 
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 #include &lt;time.h&gt;
 
 /* using the routine above - replace this declaration with the snippet above */
 GLuint raw_texture_load(const char *filename, int width, int height);
 
 static GLuint texture;
 
 void render()
 {
     glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
     glLoadIdentity();

     gluPerspective(60, 1, 1, 10);
     gluLookAt(0, 0, -2, /* eye */
               0, 0, 2, /* center */
               0, 1, 0); /* up */
     glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
     glLoadIdentity();
     
     glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
     glPushAttrib(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
         glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
         
         /* create a square on the XY
            note that OpenGL origin is at the lower left
            but texture origin is at upper left
            =&gt; it has to be mirrored
            (gasman knows why i have to mirror X as well) */
         glBegin(GL_QUADS);
         glNormal3f(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
         glTexCoord2d(1, 1); glVertex3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

         glEnd();
         
         glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
     glPopAttrib();
     
     glFlush();
     
     glutSwapBuffers();
 }
 
 void init()
 {
     glClearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
     glShadeModel(GL_SMOOTH);
     
     glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);

     glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_AMBIENT, (GLfloat[]){1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0});
     
     texture = raw_texture_load(&quot;texture.raw&quot;, 256, 256);

Wow, that was a lot of code. Let's try to understand it, starting with ''main()'':

The first lines set up GLUT and are not worth being explained further.

''init()'' sets up the canvas and the light and loads our texture into a global variable. Since we only have one texture here, it's useless, as we don't need to switch textures, but it's here anyway. (You switch textures using ''glBindTexture'', see above.)

Then some callbacks are set up, also not worth being talked about, except the display function. First the camera is set up (if you would change the perspective during simulation, you'd make use of this - in this case it's redundant). The canvas is cleared then (you should also know that).

Now we switch texture mode on, which means everything we do now will be textured. The currently selected texture will be used, which is in this case the one we created before (it is still selected since it was first selected during setup). Then a square is created on the XY axis. Note the ''glTexCoord2d'' calls: They define which part of the texture is to be assigned to the next vertex. We will make more use of it in another example.

Eh, and then it's drawn. It didn't really hurt, did it?

You want to place a RAW image called ''texture.raw'' in the working directory, RGBA 256x256. Such files can be created with some graphics editors, including GIMP.

== A simple libpng example ==
This c++ code snippet is an example of loading a png image file into an opengl texture object.  It requires libpng and opengl to work. To compile with gcc, link png glu32 and opengl32 .  Most of this is taken right out of the libpng manual.  There is no checking or conversion of the png format to the opengl texture format.  This just gives the basic idea.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;
 #include &lt;png.h&gt;
 #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
 #include &lt;string&gt;
 
 #define TEXTURE_LOAD_ERROR 0
 
 using namespace std;

== Specifying texture coordinates ==
Texture coordinates assign certain points in the texture to vertices. It allows you to save texture memory and can make work a bit easier. For example, a dice has six different sides. You can put every side next to each other in a texture and say &quot;this side should get the leftmost third of my texture&quot;.

This makes even more sense when modeling complex objects like humans, where you have the body, legs, arms, head, ... if you would use extra texture files for every part, you quickly end up with a lot of texture files which are terribly inefficient to manage. You better put all parts in one file and select the appropiate part when drawing, performs much better.

You saw texture coordinates already in the previous example, although the selected part was the whole texture. The two parameters given to ''glTexCoord2d'' are numbers ranging from 0 to 1. (This has the advantage of being size-independent - you can later decide to use a higher-resolution texture and do not need to change the rendering code!)

== Tips ==
* Switching textures is inefficient. Try to draw all objects with texture A first, then switch textures and draw everything with texture B, and so on. (If you have alpha textures, this can't be accomplished always, as you then must order all objects by yourself. An article about this might follow soon.)
* Try to combine small textures into one large and select the part you want with texture coordinates. This reduces the memory overhead and also reduces the number of texture switches.

Making a simple mouse pointer in the game engine.
This takes up a lot of resources but it is very simple.

A little Python is involved but it is very easy to use and is only 2 lines of code.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up blender and split the screen in two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the right screen a text editor and add a new text file with '''ALT+N'''. Type in the following code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;import Rasterizer as r
r.showMouse(1)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set ''TX: showpointer'' in the middle of the Text panel menu bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an object that will always be available - preferably a camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the logic tab, add a ''&quot;Property&quot; sensor'', a ''&quot;Python&quot; controller'', an ''&quot;AND&quot; controller'' and a ''&quot;Property&quot; actuator''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate the ''True Level Triggering'' (the '''“‘''' button), set ''Prop: switch'' and ''Value: 0''. Connect the property sensor to the python and AND controllers by dragging lines between the bullets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the python controller set ''Script: showpointer''.

Note: If the value keeps being reverted to blank after setting it, the name you entered is not a legal script name; chances are you did not set the name of your script correctly. Look for the selection menu beginning with &quot;TX:&quot; and make sure it says ''TX:showpointer''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now connect the AND controller to the property actuator. Set ''Prop: switch'' and ''Value: 1''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select ''Actor'' and click on ''Add Property'' make it a ''Int'' type and set ''Name:switch''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Now press '''P''' to start the game and now you`ll see your mouse pointer.

== Consider Your Career ==

Our careers take up a large part of our lives.  Not only do they provide us with money in exchange for our time, skills, and services, but they also are a place where we spend a large part of our time.  Being in a career that is a good fit for you can be one of the most positive things you do for your life, and vice-versa, being in a career that is a bad fit, can be something that makes your life miserable. 

At the time you are looking for employment you may want to consider your career as a whole. Are you on the right path for you? If you want a change now might be a good time to make it.
Like any major decision, deciding a career involves a lot of fact finding. Fortunately, some of the best informational resources are easily accessible. You should assess career guidance materials carefully. Information that seems out of date or glamorizes an occupation, overstates its earnings or exaggerates the demand for workers, for example, should be evaluated with scepticism. Gathering as much information as possible will help you make a more informed decision.  A [[W:Decision Matrix|decision matrix]] may be a useful tool to help make your decision.  You may also wish to pursue more than one career option at the same time.

== Some Factors to Consider ==
* Income
* Health Benefits
* Retirement Benefits
* Other Benefits
* Personal Satisfaction
* Style of Work
* Stress Load

== Resources that may Help while Researching Career Options ==

=== Ask People You Know about Careers===

One of the best resources can be those you know, such as friends and family. They may answer some questions about a particular occupation or put you in touch with someone who has some experience in the field. This personal networking can be invaluable in evaluating an occupation or an employer. These people will be able to tell you about their specific duties and training, as well as what they did or did not like about a job. People who have worked in an occupation locally also may be able to recommend and get you in touch with specific employers.  These same people can also help you get a job later through networking.

=== School career planning and placement offices ===
Many high schools and colleges have placement offices that have materials about career options.  Many also have counsellors that you can talk with about potential careers.

=== Employers ===
Through your library and Internet research, develop a list of potential employers in your desired career field. Employer Web sites often contain lists of job openings. Web sites and business directories can provide you with information on how to apply for a position or whom to contact. Even if no open positions are posted, do not hesitate to contact the employer and the relevant department. Set up an interview with someone working in the same area in which you wish to work. Ask them how they got started, what they like and dislike about the work, what type of qualifications are necessary for the job, and what type of personality succeeds in that position. Not only can this be invaluable in helping you to decide whether this career path is right for you, it also might open up doors for getting a job with the company in the future, or they may be able to put you in contact with other people who might hire you. Make sure to send them your resume and a cover letter. If you are able to obtain an interview, be sure to send a thank-you note. Directly contacting employers is one of the most successful means of job hunting.

=== Internet Resources ===
While the Internet contains a lot of resources to help you get a specific job, it also contains a lot of good information that can help you choose a general career path.

== Education ==

Education can open doors for those looking to start a new career or change specialty within their current occupation. This section outlines some major sources of education and training required to enter many occupations.

For information on the specific training and educational requirements for a particular occupation, and what training is typically provided by an employer, consult the Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement section of the appropriate Handbook statement.

=== Disclaimer ===

Links to non-BLS Internet sites are provided for your convenience and do not constitute an endorsement.

== Four-Year colleges and universities == 

These institutions provide detailed information on theory and practice for a wide variety of subjects. Colleges and universities can provide one with the knowledge and background necessary to be successful in many fields. They also can help to place students in cooperative education programs often called &quot;co-ops&quot; or internships. Co-ops and internships are short-term jobs with firms related to one's field of study that lead to college credit. In co-ops and internships, students learn the specifics of a job while making valuable contacts that can lead to a permanent position.

For more information on colleges and universities, go to your local library, consult your high school guidance counselor, or contact individual colleges. Also check with your State's higher education agency. A list of these agencies is available on the Internet: http://www.ed.gov/Programs/EROD.

== Junior and community colleges ==

Junior and community colleges offer a mixture of programs that lead to associate degrees and training certificates. Community colleges tend to be less expensive than 4-year colleges and universities. They typically are more willing to accommodate part-time students, and their programs are more tailored to the needs of local employers. Many have an open admissions policy, and often these institutions offer weekend and night classes.

Many community colleges form partnerships with local businesses that allow students to gain job-specific training. For students who may not be able to enroll in a college or university because of their academic record, limited finances, or distance from such an institution, junior or community colleges are often used as a place to earn credits that can be applied toward a degree at a 4-year college. Junior and community colleges also are noted for their extensive role in continuing an adult education.

For more information on junior and community colleges, go to your local library, consult your high school guidance counselor, or contact individual schools. Also check with your State's higher education agency. A list of these agencies is available on the Internet: http://www.ed.gov/Programs/EROD.

Note that many community colleges hire based on enrollment, and may add course sections based on student demand in the weeks immediately before a semester begins. Adjuncts are often contacted immediately prior to the first week of classes, even if they have submitted applications months earlier.

== Vocational and trade schools ==

These institutions train people in specific trades. They offer courses designed to provide hands-on experience. Vocational and trade schools tend to concentrate on trades, services, and other types of skilled work.

Vocational and trade schools frequently engage students in real-world projects, allowing them to apply field methods while learning theory in classrooms. Graduates of vocational and trade schools have an advantage over informally trained or self-trained job seekers because graduates have an independent organization certifying that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the duties of a particular occupation. These schools also help students to acquire any license or other credentials needed to enter the job market.

For more information on vocational and trade schools, go to your local library, consult your high school guidance counselor, or contact individual schools. Also check with your State's director of vocational-technical education. A list of State directors of vocational-technical education is available on the Internet: http://www.ed.gov/Programs/EROD.

== Apprenticeships ==

An apprenticeship provides work experience as well as education and training for those entering certain occupations. Apprenticeships are offered by sponsors, who employ and train the apprentice. The apprentice follows a training course under close supervision and receives some formal education to learn the theory related to the job.

Apprenticeships are a way for inexperienced people to become skilled workers. Apprenticeships are an agreement between the apprentice and the sponsor and generally last between 1 and 4 years. Some apprenticeships allow the apprentice to earn an associate degree. An Apprenticeship Completion Certificate is granted to those completing programs. This certificate is administered by federally approved State agencies.

Information on apprenticeships is available from the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services on the Internet: http://www.dir.ca.gov/databases/das/aigstart.asp. For assistance finding an apprenticeship program, go to: http://www.electricianprograms.org/electro/apprenticeships-they-are-alive-and-well-and-right-in-your-backyard.html.

== Professional Groups ==

Professional societies, trade associations, and labor unions are other useful sources of information. These groups are made up of people with common interests, usually in related occupations or industries. The groups frequently are able to provide training, access to training through their affiliates, or information on acceptable sources of training for their field. If licensing or certification is required, they also may be able to assist you in meeting those requirements.

For a listing of professional societies, trade associations, and labor unions related to an occupation, check the Sources of Additional Information section at the end of that occupational statement in the Handbook.

Employers. Many employers provide on-the-job training. On-the-job training can range from spending a few minutes watching another employee demonstrate a task to participating in formal training programs that may last for several months. In some jobs, employees may continually undergo training to stay up to date with new developments and technologies, or to add new skills.

== Military ==

The United States Armed Forces trains and employs people in more than 4,100 different occupations. For more information, see the Handbook statement on &quot;Job Opportunities in The Armed Forces.&quot; For detailed answers to specific questions, contact your local recruiting office. Valuable resources also are available on the Internet: http://www.todaysmilitary.com.

== Funding ==

Many people fund their education or training through financial aid or tuition assistance programs. Federal student aid comes in three forms�grants, work-study programs, and loans. All Federal student aid applicants must first fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which provides a Student Aid Report (SAR) and eligibility rating. Forms must be submitted to desired institutions of study, which determine the amount of aid you will receive.

For information on applying for Federal financial aid, visit the FAFSA Internet site: http://www.fafsa.ed.gov.

A U.S. Department of Education publication describing Federal financial aid programs, called The Student Guide, is available at: http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/
students/publications/student_guide/index.html.

Information on Federal programs is available from: http://www.studentaid.ed.gov and http://www.students.gov.

Information on State programs is available from your State�s higher education agency. A list of these agencies is available at: http://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/Programs/EROD/.

== Grants == 

A grant is money which is given to a student or the institution they are attending in order to pay for their education or training and any associated expenses. Grants are typically given on the basis of financial need. Grants are considered gifts and are not paid back. Federal grants are almost exclusively for undergraduate students. They include Pell Grants, which can be worth up to $4,050 annually, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), which can be worth up to $4,000 annually. Priority for FSEOG awards is given to those who have also received the Pell Grant and have exceptional financial need.

Additional information on grants is available on the Internet: http://www.studentaid.ed.gov.

Information also is available from your State Higher Education agency. A list of these agencies is available at: http://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/Programs/EROD/.

== Federal Work-Study program ==

The Federal Work-Study program is offered at most institutions and consists of Federal sponsorship of a student who works part time at the institution he or she is attending. The money a student earns through this program goes directly toward the cost of attending the institution. There are no set minimum or maximum amounts for this type of aid, although, on average, a student can expect to earn about $2,000 per school year.

For additional information on work-study opportunities offered, check with individual institutions. General information on the Federal Work-Study program is available at: http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/students/publications/
student_guide/2005-2006/english/types-fed-workstudy.htm.

== Scholarships ==

A scholarship is a sum of money donated to a student to help pay for his or her education or training and any associated costs. Scholarships can range from small amounts up to the full cost of schooling. They are based on financial need, academic merit, athletic ability, or a wide variety of other criteria set by the organizations that provide the scholarships. Frequently, students must meet minimum academic requirements to be considered for a scholarship. Other qualifying requirements�such as intended major field of study, heritage, or group membership�may be added by the organization providing the scholarship.

Scholarships can be provided by a wide variety of institutions, including educational institutions, State and local governments, private associations, social groups, and individuals. There are no federally awarded scholarships based on academic merit. Most large scholarships are awarded to students by the institution they plan to attend. Students who have received State scholarships and plan to attend a school in another State should check with their State to see if the scholarship can be transferred.

Information on scholarships is typically available from high school guidance counselors and local libraries. Additional scholarship information is available from State higher education agencies. A list of these agencies is available at: http://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/Programs/EROD/. The College Board has information on available scholarships at: http://www.collegeboard.com/pay.

== Student loans == 

Many institutions, both public and private, provide low-interest loans to students and their parents or guardians. The Federal Government also provides several types of student loans based on the applicant�s level of financial need. The amount of money a student can receive in loans varies by the distributing institution and depends on whether the student is claimed by a parent or guardian as a dependent. Since the process of applying for a loan may take several months, it is a good idea to start applying for Federal student loans well in advance.

The available Federal loan programs can accommodate prospective undergraduate, graduate, vocational, and disabled students. Federal loans can be distributed through the school that the student is attending, from the Federal Government directly, or from a third-party private lender or bank. Perkins loans are distributed through the school the student is attending. Loans coming from the Federal Government directly from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program are dispersed by the Department of Education. Third-party loans through a private lender or bank are from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. For all federally funded loans, payments are made to the institution that originally dispersed the funds.

For those with financial need, Federal Perkins loans and both Direct and FFEL-subsidized Stafford loans are available. Perkins loans have no minimum amount, but they are capped at $4,000 per year for undergraduates and $6,000 per year for graduate students. Subsidized Stafford loans can range in value from $2,625 to $8,500 per year and can increase as a student completes more years of undergraduate, graduate, or professional education. Interest rates remain at a flat 5 percent for all Perkins loans, while rates can fluctuate up to 8.25 percent for subsidized Stafford loans. Those with Perkins loans are not responsible for starting to repay the loan until they have been out of school for 9 months. Those with subsidized Stafford loans must begin payments within 6 to 9 months of leaving school but are not charged monthly interest while in school.

For those who do not demonstrate financial need, Direct and FFEL-unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Federal Parent Loans for Students (PLUS) are available. Unsubsidized Stafford loans can range in value from $2,625 to $18,500 per year. PLUS loans are capped at the cost of attendance. With Federal unsubsidized Stafford Loans, interest payments start almost immediately and can be paid monthly or accrued until the completion of studies. The latter option results in a larger total loan cost but may be more convenient for some students. With PLUS loans, the parent must pay interest and principal payments while the student is enrolled in school and must continue payments after completion. Check with your lender for available repayment schedules. Typically, students have 10 years to repay Perkins loans and from 10 to 30 years for unsubsidized Stafford loans.

Subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans are only available to students who are enrolled in an academic program at least half time. As with any loan, be sure to investigate different lenders, and understand what your loan contract requires of you before agreeing to any loan. Check with established financial institutions to compare the terms of available private student loans. Comparisons of the various types of loans are available on the Internet: http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/students/publications/student_guide/index.html.

The College Board has information on available loans at: http://www.collegeboard.com/pay.

== Employer tuition support programs ==

Some employers offer tuition assistance programs as part of their employee benefits package. The terms of these programs depend on the firm and can vary by the type and amount of training subsidized, as well as by eligibility requirements. Consult your human resources department for information on tuition support programs offered by your employer.

Military tuition support programs. The United States Armed Forces offer various tuition assistance and loan repayment programs for military personnel. See the Handbook statement on &quot;Job Opportunities in the Armed Forces&quot; for more information. Also go to:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Find Employment Page}}

== Find Prospects ==

Before you can go to an interview, or even mail out a resume, you need to find companies (with job openings) where you are interested in working. Traditional methods of finding prospective employers is to look at the classified ads in the newspapers, look through job-hunting magazines and periodicals, or even attend career-fairs. Modern methods for finding jobs involve the internet, and sites such as careerbuilder.com and monster.com.

== Research the Employer ==

Study the prospective employer. Research for information about the employer's policies, scope of operations, and work culture. Find out what skills are in demand, and can get you hired. Find out what salaries are paid to people in the position, which you have applied for. This information helps in negotiations at a later stage. Many professional websites also have lists of Job openings. It is always preferable to apply to a specific job. Submitting a resume that is not in response to a specific job opening is known as '''cold submitting''', and has a low chance of success. 

Once you find the specific job opening (or openings) that you are interested in applying for, copy down the relevant information: You are going to need it to write an effective cover letter, and to focus your resume.

After reviewing your research, create questions to ask your prospective employer.  These questions will display your initiative and your interest in the company.

== Networking ==

Eighty percent of available jobs are never advertised, and over half of all employees get their jobs through networking, according to BH Careers International. Therefore, the people you know -friends, family, neighbors, acquaintances, teachers, and former co-workers - are some of the most effective resources for your job search. The network of people that you know and the people that they know can lead to information about specific job openings that are not publicly posted. To develop new contacts, join student, community, or professional organizations.

== Career Fairs ==

Career fairs are great places to submit resumes, talk to company representatives, and to gather valuable contact information. However, because of the nature of career fairs, it can be difficult to provide a focused resume and cover letter to every company in attendance. Often times, you are forced to simply create a generic resume that you will hand to every company. Also, representatives at career fairs receive many resumes, and many applications, and often times the representatives don't have the time to carefully read each one. If your resume doesn't stand out from the pile immediately (and you shouldn't suspect that it will), then you may never hear back from the company. The most important job that you can do at a job fair is to gather contact information for the human resources personnel at the target company. After the job fair is over, you should create a focused resume and cover letter specifically for that company, and mail (or email) those materials directly to the HR department. This will ensure that your resume stands out from the crowd, and that the HR people are forced to look at your resume closely, after the career fair has ended.

== Personal contacts ==  

Eighty percent of available jobs are never advertised, and over half of all employees get their jobs through networking, according to BH Careers International. Therefore, the people you know — friends, family, neighbors, acquaintances, teachers, and former co-workers — are some of the most effective resources for your job search. The network of people that you know and the people that they know can lead to information about specific job openings that are not publicly posted. To develop new contacts, join student, community, or professional organizations.

School career planning and placement offices. High school and college placement offices help their students and alumni find jobs. They allow recruiters to use their facilities for interviews or career fairs. Placement offices usually have a list of part-time, temporary, and summer jobs offered on campus. They also may have lists of jobs for regional, non-profit, and government organizations. In addition to linking you to potential employers, career planning offices usually provide career counselling, career testing, and job search advice. Some have career resource libraries; host workshops on job search strategy, résumé writing, letter writing, and effective interviewing; critique drafts of résumés; conduct mock interviews; and sponsor job fairs.

== Employers == 

Through your library and Internet research, develop a list of potential employers in your desired career field. Employer Web sites often contain lists of job openings. Web sites and business directories can provide you with information on how to apply for a position or whom to contact. Even if no open positions are posted, do not hesitate to contact the employer and the relevant department. Set up an interview with someone working in the same area in which you wish to work. Ask them how they got started, what they like and dislike about the work, what type of qualifications are necessary for the job, and what type of personality succeeds in that position. Even if they don’t have a position available, they may be able to put you in contact with other people who might hire you, and they can keep you in mind if a position opens up. Make sure to send them your résumé and a cover letter. If you are able to obtain an interview, be sure to send a thank-you note. Directly contacting employers is one of the most successful means of job hunting.

== Classified ads == 

The &quot;Help Wanted&quot; ads in newspapers list numerous jobs. You should realize, however, that many other job openings are not listed, and that the classified ads sometimes do not give all of the important information. They may offer little or no description of the job, working conditions, or pay. Some ads do not identify the employer. They may simply give a post office box to which you can mail your résumé, making follow-up inquiries very difficult. Some ads offer out-of-town jobs; others advertise employment agencies rather than actual employment opportunities.

When using classified ads, keep the following in mind:

* Do not rely solely on the classifieds to find a job; follow other leads as well.
* Answer ads promptly, because openings may be filled quickly, even before the ad stops appearing in the paper.
* Read the ads every day, particularly the Sunday edition, which usually includes the most listings.
* Beware of &quot;no experience necessary&quot; ads. These ads often signal low wages, poor working conditions, or commission work.
* Keep a record of all ads to which you have responded, including the specific skills, educational background, and personal qualifications required for the position.

== Internet networks and resources == 

The Internet is an invaluable resource. Use it to find advice on conducting your job search more effectively; to search for a job; to research prospective employers; and to communicate with people who can help you with your job search. No single Web site will contain all the information available on employment or career opportunities, so in addition to the Web sites listed below, use a search engine to find what you need. The different types of sites that may be useful include general career advice sites, job search sites, company Web sites, trade and professional association Web sites, and forums. Internet forums, also called message boards, are online discussion groups where anyone may post and read messages. Use forums specific to your profession or to career-related topics to post questions or messages and to read about other peoples’ job searches or career experiences.

In job databases, remember that job listings may be posted by field or discipline, so begin your search using keywords. Some Web sites provide national or local classified listings and allow job seekers to post their résumés online. When searching employment databases on the Internet, it usually is possible to send your résumé to an employer by e-mail or to post it online.

CareerOneStop is a database consisting of three separate career resource tools. It can be accessed on the Internet at: http://www.CareerOneStop.org, or by telephone at: (877) 348-0502. Alternatively, each resource tool can be accessed directly at its own Internet address.

America’s Job Bank allows you to search through a database of more than 1 million jobs nationwide, create and post your résumé online, and set up an automated job search. The database contains a wide range of mostly full-time private sector jobs that are available all over the country. Job seekers can access America’s Job Bank at: http://www.ajb.org.

America’s Career InfoNet provides information on educational, licensing, and certification requirements for different occupations by State. It also provides information on wages, cost of living, and employment trends, and helps job seekers identify their skills and write résumés and cover letters. Job seekers can access America’s Career InfoNet at: http://www.acinet.org.

America’s Service Locator provides listings of local employment service offices which help job seekers find jobs and help employers find qualified workers at no cost to either. At the State employment service office, an interviewer will determine if you are &quot;job ready&quot; or if you need help from counselling and testing services to assess your occupational aptitudes and interests and to help you choose and prepare for a career. After you are &quot;job ready,&quot; you may examine available job listings and select openings that interest you. A staff member can then describe the job openings in detail and arrange for interviews with prospective employers. Job seekers can access America’s Service Locator at: http://www.servicelocator.org. A list of offices is also in the State government telephone listings under &quot;Job Service&quot; or &quot;Employment.&quot;

Using Internet Resources to Plan your Future, a U.S. Department of Labor publication, offers advice on organizing your Internet job search. It is primarily intended to provide instruction for job seekers on how to use the Internet to their best advantage, but recruiters and other career service industry professionals will find information here to help them also. How to Use the Internet in your Job Search; The Job Search Process; and the Career-Related Pages, other U.S. Department of Labor Internet publications, each discusses specific steps that job seekers can follow to identify employment opportunities. Included are daily tips and hints, plus a large database of links and job search engines. Check with your State employment service office, or order a copy of these and other publications from the U.S. Government Printing Office’s Superintendent of Documents. Telephone: (202) 512-1800. Internet: http://bookstore.gpo.gov or http://www.doleta.gov.

== State employment service offices == 

The State employment service, sometimes called the Job Service, operates in coordination with the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration. Local offices, found nationwide, help job seekers to find jobs and help employers to find qualified workers at no cost to either. To find the office nearest you, look in the State government telephone listings under &quot;Job Service&quot; or &quot;Employment.&quot;

Job matching and referral. At the State employment service office, an interviewer will determine if you are &quot;job ready&quot; or if you need help from counselling and testing services to assess your occupational aptitudes and interests and to help you choose and prepare for a career. After you are &quot;job ready,&quot; you may examine available job listings and select openings that interest you. A staff member can then describe the job openings in detail and arrange for interviews with prospective employers.

Services for special groups. By law, veterans are entitled to priority for job placement at State employment service centers. If you are a veteran, a veterans’ employment representative can inform you of available assistance and help you to deal with problems.

State employment service offices refer people to opportunities available under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998. WIA reforms Federal employment, adult education, and vocational rehabilitation programs to create an integrated, &quot;one-stop&quot; system of workforce investment and education activities for adults and youths. Services are provided to employers and job seekers, including adults, dislocated workers, and youths. WIA's primary purpose is to increase the employment, retention, skills, and earnings of participants. These programs help to prepare people to participate in the State's workforce, increase their employment and earnings potential, improve their educational and occupational skills, and reduce their dependency on welfare, which will improve the quality of the workforce and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation's economy.

We have more information on these services in the appendix.

== Federal Government == 

Information on obtaining a position with the Federal Government is available from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) through USAJOBS, the Federal Government’s official employment information system. This resource for locating and applying for job opportunities can be accessed through the Internet at http://www.usajobs.opm.gov or through an interactive voice response telephone system at (703) 724-1850 or TDD (978) 461-8404. These numbers are not tollfree, and charges may result.

== Professional associations == 

Many professions have associations that offer employment information, including career planning, educational programs, job listings, and job placement. To use these services, associations usually require that you be a member; information can be obtained directly from an association through the Internet, by telephone, or by mail.

== Labor unions == 

Labor unions provide various employment services to members, including apprenticeship programs that teach a specific trade or skill. Contact the appropriate labor union or State apprenticeship council for more information.

Private employment agencies and career consultants. These agencies can be helpful, but they may charge you for their services. Most operate on a commission basis, with the fee dependent upon a percentage of the salary paid to a successful applicant. You or the hiring company will pay the fee. Find out the exact cost and who is responsible for paying associated fees before using the service.

Although employment agencies can help you save time and contact employers who otherwise might be difficult to locate, the costs may outweigh the benefits if you are responsible for the fee. Contacting employers directly often will generate the same type of leads that a private employment agency will provide. Consider any guarantees that the agency offers when determining if the service is worth the cost.

== Community agencies == 

Many non-profit organizations, including religious institutions and vocational rehabilitation agencies, offer counselling, career development, and job placement services, generally targeted to a particular group, such as women, youths, minorities, ex-offenders, or older workers.

== School career planning and placement offices == 
High school and college placement offices help their students and alumni find jobs. They allow recruiters to use their facilities for interviews or career fairs. Placement offices usually have a list of part-time, temporary, and summer jobs offered on campus. They also may have lists of jobs for regional, non-profit, and government organizations. In addition to linking you to potential employers, career planning offices usually provide career counselling, career testing, and job search advice. Some have career resource libraries; host workshops on job search strategy, resume writing, letter writing, and effective interviewing; critique drafts of resumes; conduct mock interviews; and sponsor job fairs.

== Research ==

Local libraries. Libraries can be an invaluable source of information. Since most areas have libraries, they can be a convenient place to look for information. Also, for those who do not otherwise have access to the Internet or e-mail, many libraries provide this access.

Libraries may have information on job openings, locally and nationally; potential contacts within occupations or industries; colleges and financial aid; vocational training; individual businesses or careers; and writing resumes. Libraries frequently have subscriptions to various trade magazines that can provide information on occupations and industries. These sources often have references to organizations which can provide additional information about training and employment opportunities. Your local library also may have video materials.

If you need help getting started or finding a resource, ask your librarian for assistance.

== Professional Groups ==

These groups, such as professional societies, trade groups, and labor unions have information on an occupation or various related occupations with which they are associated or which they actively represent. This information may cover training requirements, earnings, and listings of local employers. These groups may train members or potential members themselves, or may be able to put you in contact with organizations or individuals who perform such training.

Each occupational statement in the Handbook concludes with a section on sources of additional information, which lists organizations that may be contacted for more information. Another valuable source for finding organizations associated with occupations is The Encyclopedia of Associations, an annual publication that lists trade associations, professional societies, labor unions, and fraternal and patriotic organizations.

Employers. This is the primary source of information on specific jobs. Employers may post lists of job openings and application requirements, including the exact training and experience required, starting wages and benefits, and advancement opportunities and career paths.

== Postsecondary institutions ==

Colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions may put a lot of effort into helping place their graduates in good jobs, because the success of their graduates may indicate the quality of their institution and may affect their ability to attract new students. Postsecondary institutions frequently have career centers with libraries of information on different careers, listings of related jobs, and alumni contacts in various professions. Career centers frequently employ career counsellors who generally provide their services only to their students and alumni. Career centers can help you build your resume; find internships and co-ops which can lead to full-time positions; and tailor your course selection or program to make you a more attractive job applicant.

== Guidance and career counsellors ==

Counsellors can help you make choices about which careers might suit you best. Counsellors can help you determine what occupations suit your skills by testing your aptitude for various types of work, and determining your strengths and interests. Counsellors can help you evaluate your options and search for a job in your field or help you select a new field altogether. They can also help you determine which educational or training institutions best fit your goals, and find ways to finance them. Some counsellors offer other services such as interview coaching, resume building, and help in filling out various forms. Counsellors in secondary schools and postsecondary institutions may arrange guest speakers, field trips, or job fairs.

Common places where guidance and career counsellors are employed include:

* High school guidance offices
* College career planning and placement offices
* Placement offices in private vocational or technical schools and institutions
* Vocational rehabilitation agencies
* Counselling services offered by community organizations
* Private counselling agencies and private practices
* State employment service offices

When using a private counsellor, check to see if the counsellor is experienced. One way to do so is to ask people who have used their services in the past. The National Board of Certified Counsellors and Affiliates is an institution which accredits career counsellors. To verify the credentials of a career counsellor and to find a career counsellor in your area, contact:

* The National Board for Certified Counsellors and Affiliates, 3 Terrace Way, Suite D, Greensboro, NC 27403-3660. Internet: http://www.nbcc.org/cfind

Internet resources. With the growing popularity of the Internet, a wide verity of career information has become easily accessible. Many online resources include job listings, resume posting services, and information on job fairs, training, and local wages. Many of the resources listed elsewhere in this section have Internet sites that include valuable information on potential careers. Since no single source contains all information on an occupation, field, or employer, you will likely need to use a variety of sources.

When using Internet resources, be sure that the organization is a credible, established source of information on the particular occupation. Individual companies may include job listings on their Web sites, and may include information about required credentials, wages and benefits, and the job's location. Contact information, such as whom to call or where to send a resume, is typically included.

Some sources exist primarily as a Web service. These services often have information on specific jobs, and can greatly aid in the job hunting process. Some commercial sites offer these services, as do Federal, State, and some local governments. Career OneStop, a joint program by the Department of Labor and the States as well as local agencies, provides these services free of charge.

Online Sources from the Department of Labor. A major portion of the U.S. Department of Labor's Labor Market Information System is the Career OneStop site. This site includes:

* America's Job Bank allows you to search over a million job openings listed with State employment agencies.
* America's Career InfoNet provides data on employment growth and wages by occupation; the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by an occupation; and links to employers.
* America's Service Locator is a comprehensive database of career centers and information on unemployment benefits, job training, youth programs, seminars, educational opportunities, and disabled or older worker programs.

Organizations for specific groups. Some organizations provide information designed to help specific groups of people. Consult directories in your library's reference center or a career guidance office for information on additional organizations associated with specific groups.

== Summer Jobs ==

Doing summer job is a good experience for growth. However, remember that summer jobs are just that: temporary jobs that you have over the summer (or even during the school year), that don't necessarily help prepare you for future careers. This book will not talk specifically about part-time or seasonal jobs. However, many of the techniques from this book can be adapted to finding summer work. Further information about summer jobs can be found in the appendix.

== About Resumes ==

In your lifetime, you will be preparing many resumes of many types:   education, job, true-love, health-treatment, legal-justifications, financial justifications, and others.  So start with your MASTER RESUME. Then you can use to then cut-and-paste all the later needs for your immediate resume.

{{info|The correct spelling is: '''résumé''', but due to difficulties in typing, the remainder of this book may ignore the accents.}}

If you ever need to use your life experiences for the human service industries, it might be worthwhile recording dates &amp; places of any human-type activities:  friends, clubs, etc.
At a very serious job interview (the last of several for an important application, you can use a copy of this &quot;Master&quot; to illustrate or support the statements made in writing or spoken in any interview.

Resumes are usually just advertisements, that are supposed to sell your most valuable product: you. Resumes should be truthful, but they do not (and should not) be complete descriptions of you, your past, and your skills. Specifically, modern guidelines state that a resume should be 1 page long, no more, and generally no less. The resume should be specifically tailored to the job for which you are applying.

== Résumés and application forms == 
Résumés and application forms are two ways to provide employers with written evidence of your qualifications and skills. Generally, the same information appears on both the résumé and the application form, but the way in which it is presented differs. Some employers prefer a résumé and others require an application form. The accompanying box presents the basic information you should include in your résumé.

There are many ways of organizing a résumé; choose the format that best showcases your skills and experience. It may be helpful to look for examples on the Internet or in books at your local library or bookstore. Typically, an employer has a very limited amount of time to review your résumé. It is important to make sure it is clear and concise, and highlights your skills and experiences effectively through the use of formatting, ordering, and headings.

Many employers scan résumés into databases, which they then search for specific keywords or phrases. The keywords are usually nouns referring to experience, education, personal characteristics, or industry buzz words. Identify keywords by reading the job description and qualifications; use the same words in your résumé that are used in the job ad. For example, if the job description includes customer service tasks, use the words &quot;customer service&quot; on your résumé. Scanners sometimes misread paper résumés, which could mean some of your keywords don't get into the database. So, if you know that your résumé will be scanned, and you have the option, e-mail an electronic version. If you must submit a paper résumé, make it scannable by using a simple font and avoiding underlines, italics, and graphics. It is also a good idea to send a traditionally formatted résumé along with your scannable résumé, with a note on each marking its purpose.

When you fill out an application form, make sure you fill it out completely and follow all instructions. Do not omit any requested information and make sure that the information you provide is correct.

== Writing the Resume ==

Writing a résumé can often be a strenuous task because it is this piece of paper alone which will separate yourself from hundreds, if not thousands of other applicants.

When writing a résumé, one must be careful to make theirs stand out so that the prospective employer does not just throw it in a pile. A résumé should contain your name, previous employment history, skills, accomplishments and goals you wish to achieve in your life.

Avoid the use of prose when describing what you have accomplished in your current or previous jobs.  Bullets are definitely your friend when it comes to sharing you accomplishments.  Start each bullet point with a good, strong verb.  If you have data to share, such as an increase in sales, a savings of money, or something similar, be sure to include this information.  For example: Developed new training protocols resulting in a savings of $10,000 a year for the company.

== Warning ==

Studies have shown that employers often do not read entire résumés, but quickly scan through them. You have approximately 30-45 seconds to make an impression on a prospective employer - to make him or her want to read your résumé more closely.  Therefore, you must make your résumé stand out from the rest. Think of a résumé as a marketing tool, and what you are selling is yourself. With this in mind, one must learn some basic marketing skills which will help produce leads (job interviews). In order to produce a good result, if done correctly, one will not have to be dishonest in his or her résumé, and often, being dishonest can later be a drawback for future promotions or possibly be grounds for termination.

== Focus ==

When writing your résumé, you must focus on the needs of your prospective employer, not yours. When selling yourself, you need to make yourself sound like a good buy and you need to present yourself as one who would benefit the company in the long-term. Now put yourself in the employer's shoes: what would make you want to hire a prospective candidate? What does the corporation really need? What would set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd? If you are looking for a job in an area that you are familiar with, you will probably know what employers in your field are already looking for. If you are unsure, you can find out from the tone of the help-wanted ad and by talking to people in the area that you wish to work in. Do not be afraid to call the employer and ask him or her what they are looking for in a candidate. This itself would show initiative on your part, and probably keep the employer thinking about you.  It can also be a good idea to ask a prospective employer for a copy of the position description.  By reviewing this document, you can tailor your resume to highlight how you can meet the needs of the company.

Resumes have a number of different sections, depending on the aspects that you want to illustrate about yourself. This page will talk about the different sections of a resume, and when to use each one.

== Styles of Resumes ==

Sometimes Resumes are categorized by how they present information and in what order they present information.  Most resumes share certain common features, and there is not just one &quot;right&quot; way of doing a resume.  If the resume gets you a job, then you did it right. The type of resume you choose to use determines which sections you will include and where you will put the sections.

===Chronological résumé===

This is the most traditional type of resumes. They emphasize job experience and are good for people with a lot of experience in a given field who are entering back into the same field.  They are called a &quot;chronological&quot; resume because they list your experience in sequence of time, from new to old.

===Functional résumé===
A functional résumé lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function. 

The functional résumé is used to assert a focus to skills that are specific to the type of position being sought.  This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency.  In contrast, the chronological résumé format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth via reverse-chronological listing with most recent experience listed first.

===Combination résumé===
The combination résumé balances the functional and chronological approaches.  A résumé organized this way typically leads with a functional list of job skills, followed by a chronological list of employers.

===Curriculum Vitae===
In the United States, a CV is expected to include a comprehensive listing of professional history including every term of employment, academic credential, publication, contribution or significant achievement.  In certain professions, it may even include samples of the person's work and may run to many pages.

Within the European Union, a standardised CV model known as Europass has been developed (in 2004 by the European Parliament) and promoted by the EU to ease skilled migration between member countries.

== What Usually Goes into a Resume ==

* Name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
* Employment objective. State the type of work or specific job you are seeking.
* Education, including school name and address, dates of attendance, major, and highest grade completed or degree awarded. Consider including any courses or areas of focus that might be relevant to the position.
* Experience, paid and volunteer. For each job, include the job title, name and location of employer, and dates of employment. Briefly describe your job duties.
* Special skills, computer skills, proficiency in foreign languages, achievements, and membership in organizations.
* References, only when requested.
* Keep it short; only one page for less experienced applicants.
* Avoid long paragraphs; use bullets to highlight key skills and accomplishments.
* Have several people review your resume for any spelling or grammatical errors.
* Print it on high quality paper.

== The Objective ==

Despite all the effort that you put into your resume, many employers may not read any further then the first section, before they decide if you are an interesting potential candidate or not. For this reason, many people choose to make the first section of the resume a statement about their value, and the reason why they would be a good addition to the company. This first section is generally titled the &quot;Objective&quot; section, although some templates will call this the &quot;Purpose&quot; section, or even the &quot;Statement of Goals&quot;.

The objective section should state exactly what position you are applying for, and the reasons why you are a good fit for that position. For this reason, your objective section--if nothing else--should be specifically tailored to the job you are applying for.

== Work History ==


Nobody wants to read about the summer job you had during school, so that you could have some money in your pocket. The work history section is more aptly named the &quot;Relevant Work Experiance&quot; section, and should only contain job experiences that are relevant to the new business. For instance, if you spent several years as a tax preparer, it doesnt make sense to elaborate on that too much when applying for a job in designing computers. Of course, most people don't make such drastic career shifts in their lifetimes, so frequently it pays off listing all the work experience you have had (at least since you graduated).

Employers like to see job continuity. This is meant in two ways: First, employers like to see that you have spent time at your previous jobs. In other words, you didnt sign on, and quit within a month. Employers are making an investment in you, and the would like to think that you are going to hang around for a while. Second, employers like to see that you have been continually employed for some time. If there are several years unaccounted for in your resume, employers are going to ask questions. For example:

 1990 - 1995  Mr Computer Shack   Someplace, USA
 IT Consultant
 
 2000 - Present  Jim's Computer Barn     Otherplace, USA
 Sales Person

Now, the hiring manager is going to read this, and ask &quot;What did you do for those 5 years?&quot;. Did you take time off to write your memoirs? Did you spend time in prison? Did you drink yourself into the gutter? If you do have a gap in your employment, be prepared to discuss that gap both in your cover letter, and at the interview (if you get the interview). It is always better to bring the issue up and make the reason known, then to try and avoid the issue. However, be warned that employers don't want to hear all your whiney excuses either.

== Education ==

In today's world, prospective employees for most corporate jobs are required to have some degree of higher education. You should almost always list your education on the resume, but if it isn't your crowning achievement in life, you should probably not play it up too much. Also, if your degree is in an unrelated (or nearly unrelated) field from the job you are applying for, it only serves as a notice that &quot;I can be taught&quot;.

If you are a newly graduating student, it is generally recommended that you do not include your GPA on your resume, unless your GPA is fantastic: Don't mention it unless it is over about 3.5 (depending on how competitive your major is). Many students with low GPAs include them on their resume unnecessarily, and many students with high GPAs omit them. Some companies do specifically ask for you to include your GPA, so in that case you should.

== Awards and Memberships ==

This is a section that again, is probably more important for a graduating student then for a seasoned worker. However, if you are a member of a professional organization, or if you have received different professional awards, those are certainly worth mentioning. It is not generally worth while to mention that you are part of a book club, or a knitting circle, or a bowling team, although such an entry can help to spark conversation at the interview.

== Interests ==

Many people also like to include sections on their own personal interests on their resume. This can be a useful tactic if you have a small amount of room left on your resume that you would like to fill. Including some information about your interests and hobbies can alert the hiring manager as to the individual personality characteristics that you can bring to the team environment. Also, including some interests can help to feed the discussion at the interview.

However, there are some conflicting ideas about an interests section. Some employers consider resume sections that don't directly pertain to the job at hand as being a distraction. Whether to include an interests section in your resume or not is a decision that is worth some careful consideration.

      <comment>/* The Cover Letter */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Find Employment Page}}

== The Cover Letter ==

A cover letter is sent with a résumé or application form, as a way of introducing yourself to prospective employers. As with your résumé, it may be helpful to look for examples on the Internet or in books at your local library or bookstore, but be sure not to copy letters directly from other sources. Your cover letter should be original, capture the employer's attention, follow a business letter format, and usually should include the following information:

    * Name and address of the specific person to whom the letter is addressed.
    * Reason for your interest in the company or position.
    * Your main qualifications for the position.
    * Request for an interview.
    * Your home and work telephone numbers.

If you send a scannable résumé, you should also include a scannable cover letter, which is created similarly to a scannable résumé, by avoiding graphics, fancy fonts, italics, and underlines.

Different employers use cover letters in different manners.  It is quite common for an employer to first sort through a stack of applicants by reading the résumé and making sure potential employees have the correct qualifications, and after filtering out non-qualified applicants, to then read the cover letters to determine who will get interviews.  

== Content ==

In essence, the cover letter says all the things that the résumé can't (or shouldn't) say. The cover letter also provides a forum for discussing some of the issues that are present on your resume. For instance a cover letter allows you to address:

* Prolonged period of missing time in your work history 
* Connecting items listed on your resume that may look unrelated to the job at hand (transferable skills)
* A deep passion or dream you have of working in the field you are applying for
* Other selling points that are not addressed well in the résumé

== Opportunity ==

The cover letter also is a good opportunity to request an interview, and mention that you will be making a follow-up telephone call (and you will make this call, if you want the job).

== Style of the Letter ==

The resume is a listing of words and phrases, but the cover letter should be (must be) a formal, business-style letter. It should be broken up into paragraphs, it should contain well-formed sentences, and you should check and double-check your spelling. Running spell-check is not enough for this letter, because the spell-check will not pick up some errors such as &quot;they're and their and there&quot;. Many different websites and manuals will specify the paragraph layout of your cover letter, and most of them will even impose some restrictions on your sentence structure. For instance, many resources recommend that sentences be kept short and direct (12 words or so, at maximum). Also, it is generally considered a good idea to use the active voice (as opposed to the passive voice), and to be assertive.

== Applying Online ==

Many companies offer online or email-based application methods. This can be a tempting idea, but there are a number of factors to consider. First off, many online applications don't allow for uploading your resume or coverletters directly, but instead ask that you copy+paste the text into an available plain-text edit box. This can be very frustrating, considering that you have (or should have) spent a lot of time and effort formatting your resume and cover letters to look stylish and eye-catching. Note that when you copy+paste a heavily formatted document into a plain-text edit box, you lose more than just the fancy look: your text can be out of order, you can be missing important line-breaks, and you may also wind up with annoying control characters or blank characters in your edit box.

== Plain-Text Resume ==

If you are applying to many places that accept resumes in this way, it may be a good idea to take the time to prepare a second, plain-text resume before hand. You can create one in notepad or a similar editor, and you can ensure that everything looks as nice as is possible in such a simple format.

== Email ==

Also, be sure to look for options where you can email a resume instead of uploading a plain-text one. If you are going to be emailing a large number of resumes, it might be worthwhile to invest the time (and money) to convert your resume to PDF format, to look more professional.  Certain word processing programs such as OpenOffice.org can easily (and freely) produce PDF documents, and can also be used to convert pre-existing documents to PDF.

== Follow Up ==

After you mail in your resume, many people feel that you must now sit and wait for a response. However, this is not the best action, because you should always follow up your application with additional communications. Oftentimes the best method is to obtain the phone number of the hiring manager, and call him on a regular basis to find out what the status of the application is, and to help keep you on the front of everybody's mind. Persistance can be the key in these situations. Follow-Up emails can also be used, although they are not always as effective. A hybrid strategy combining emails and phone conversations however, could prove to be very effective.

== The Interview ==

Most of us face employment interviews in our careers. While there are no foolproof methods to &quot;pass&quot; the interview, there are some things that will help you on your way.  If the interview allows preparation, read  &amp; understand the many publications that can help you.  Rehearsing an interview with friend(s) can be useful, particularly if your rehearsals are done as close as possible to the real situation:, with aids, games, unprepared expectations that may be required just before the main interview, etc.

Find out the interview situation if you can:  how many are on the interview panel, whether this interview will be one of several this time, how long will the session be.  Also, do your homework about travel to the interview site so you know exact travel time.  If you are going to an unfamiliar area, it is good to drive the route the day before - preferably at the same time of day.

== Make a Good Impression ==

This is crucial.  Be psychologically prepared, like an athlete at peak performance:  not sleepy nor too-relaxed, but not over-aroused.  Properly finish with your food/ drink/ toiletry-needs.  Exercise your face, mouth, body and voice before the interview session, to get yourself in peak readiness.

Dress appropriately for the type of job you applying to. Wear sensible shoes, and carry a suitable handbag or briefcase. It is important to look professional, and to give the impression that you will fit in to the work atmosphere. If you look out of place, people will assume you are out of place, and form a negative opinion of you. Wearing heavy colognes or perfume is a no-no. Many people are sensitive or allergic to perfumes and are distracted when exposed to them.  Introduce yourself before sitting down and be sure to shake the interviewer's hand if he or she extends it.  There will be generally less than three interviewers in a panel. Remember their names and use them along the course of the interview. This would reflect well on your ability to get along with people. Avoid flirting, or being too serious, or too playful.

The outfit that you wear to an interview at a garage is certainly different from what you would wear to a business office. No matter where you are applying, however, it is important to remember that as a new applicant, you should definitely be dressed just as well or better than any of the current employees. You should dress well to set yourself apart. The better you appear, the better the hiring manager's opinion of you will be.

== Ask Questions ==

The interview is an opportunity for the hiring manager to learn about you, but it is also a good opportunity for you to learn more about the company. Do not hesitate to ask questions that you are unsure of. Do ask what the salary is like. Do ask about the benefits. Do ask about the environment, and the management, and even the food (if they serve food on the premises). At the interview, you might realize that you don't want to work for this company in the first place.

==Communicate effectively==

Answer all questions honestly and precisely. Avoid rambling or guessing. If you don't know the answer to a question, say so. Do not short-sell yourself. If the employer asks you about your own positive and negative qualities, do not go overboard while describing the negative qualities. One negative quality is enough per interview session. Avoid cracking jokes, unless you are auditioning to be a stand-up comedian. If you've done your homework well, answering questions will be a breeze.

Keep your answers short and engaging. 

Practice answering all kinds of interview questions.  Every answer should be no shorter than 5 seconds and no longer than 30 seconds unless it includes a story.  If it does include a story, try to keep the answer to less than 2 minutes.  The only exception is a question that asks you to set up a scenario and how you dealt with it.  E.g. “Tell me about a time you led a team and overcame internal obstacles.”  This will take more time, but keep it entertaining and focussed on the core of the question.

==Structure of a Job Interview==

Before receiving a job offer from an employer, you will typically have a series of interviews. The first interview is a screening interview conducted either over the phone or at the employer's office. On-campus interviews are considered screening interviews. Screening interviews are brief, usually lasting 30-60 minutes. During that time, the employer will want you to elaborate on experiences and skills outlined in your resume.

Many employers use the screening interview as a chance to describe the organization and the position. If the employer is impressed with your performance in this interview, you will be invited to a second (and perhaps third or fourth) interview. The second interview is longer, lasting anywhere from two hours to a whole day. It could include a variety of questions, some form of testing, lunch or dinner, a tour, as well as a series of interviews with various employees. You should come away from the second interview with a thorough understanding of the organization's culture and environment, job responsibilities, and have enough information to decide on a job offer - if one is extended.

;The Warm-Up:Each interview follows a rather predictable pattern of warm-up, information exchange, and wrap-up conversations. During the first few minutes of the interview (the warm-up), an employer will be formulating a first, lasting, impression of you. The way you greet the employer, the firmness of your handshake, and the way you are dressed, will all be a part of this initial impression. An interviewer may begin by asking common-ground questions about shared interests, the weather, or your travel to the interview. Some interviewers might start by saying &quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot; This is an opening for you to briefly and concisely describe your background, skills, and interest in the position. 
 
;The Information Exchange:The information exchange will be the primary part of the interview. This is when you will be asked the most questions and learn the most about the employer. In screening interviews, many employers will spend more time describing their opportunities than asking you specific questions. The reverse will be true in second interviews. Interview questions may range from &quot;Why did you choose to pursue a business degree?&quot; to &quot;What are your strengths/weaknesses?&quot; and &quot;What are your long-range career goals?&quot; If you are prepared for the interview, you will be able to emphasize your qualifications effectively as you respond to each question. By practicing for interviews, you will gain confidence and have more polished answers.
      
;The Wrap-up:Eventually the employer will probably say, &quot;Do you have any questions?&quot; This is your cue that the interview is moving to the wrap-up stage. Always ask questions. This demonstrates your research and interest in the job. Your questions might be direct, logistical questions such as, &quot;When can I expect to hear from you?&quot; (if that has not been discussed); questions to clarify information the employer has presented; a question regarding the employer's use of new technology or practices related to the career field; or a question to assess the culture and direction of the organization such as &quot;Where is this organization headed in the next five years?&quot; or &quot;Why do you like working for this organization?&quot; Do not ask specific questions about salary or benefits unless the employer broaches the subject first. The employer may also ask you if you have anything else you would like to add or say. Again, it's best to have a response. You can use this opportunity to thank the employer for the interview, summarize your qualifications, and reiterate your interest in the position. If you want to add information or emphasize a point made earlier, you can do that, too. This last impression is almost as important as the first impression and will add to the substance discussed during the information exchange.

* Give me an example of how you are a risk taker.
* If you could have any job in the world, what would it be?
* What motivates you?
* Why do you want to work for us and not for our competitor?
* Why should we hire you over everyone else we spoke to today?
* What do you think is the most important/difficult ethical dilemma facing corporations today?
* Give a one sentence positioning statement of yourself.
* How do you go about deciding what to do first when given a project?
* Tell me about an experience you have had in a working environment (school, work, or community).
* Describe a situation where you did not agree with something your boss asked you to do and how you resolved the problem.

For Career Changers

* Why would you be interested in this kind of work?
* How do you expect to get up to speed in all the areas which will be unfamiliar to you?

And, the Most Dreaded Question, &quot;Tell Us about Yourself&quot;. This is also your greatest opportunity. You are likely to be asked this, so plan to use the open-ended nature of the question to your advantage. It is not necessary to answer autobiographically. You may choose to organize your thoughts around your interest in the job and why you are prepared to do it.

== Questions you might ask ==

&quot;Do You Have Any Questions for Us?&quot;
The right answer is always yes, or you risk appearing uninterested. Prepare some questions in advance, but, above all, ask questions that show a response to what you have learned from the interviewers, and that are lively, rather than formulaic. Some examples include: 

Advancement

* Can you tell me how success in this position is measured?
* What skills would I need to be successful in this position?
* How do you encourage your employees to keep current with professional developments in the field?
* Could you tell me about your training program? What are some of the typical career paths followed by others who have been in this position? What would be a realistic timeframe for advancement?
* What are the opportunities for personal growth?
* What is the retention rate of people in the position for which I am interviewing?
* Is it organizational policy to promote from within? What is the work history of your top management? 

Responsibilities

* Tell me about a typical day in this job.
* Who would I work with most closely on a day-to-day basis?
* How often can I expect to relocate during the initial years of employment with your organization? 

Being New on the Job

* What do you consider the most challenging aspect of this position for someone who is new to your organization?
* What does the new [job title] need to accomplished in the next 6-12 months?
* What qualities are you looking for in your new hires?
* What are your expectations for new hires?
* Could you describe a typical first assignment?
* What are the most challenging facets of the position? 

More about the Organization

* Why is this position available?
* What are your department's major projects in the coming year?
* What do you think are your organization's greatest competitive strengths with clients?
* What is the overall structure of the department where the position is located?
* What is the work environment like?
* What makes your organization different from its competitors?
* What are your organizations strengths and weaknesses?
* How would you describe your corporation's personality and management style?
* Why did you join the organization? Why have you stayed with the organization?

==Things not to do in an interview==

# Never bring into discussion your ideologies or politics.
# Never say anything negative about previous employers.
# Do not put anything on your resume that you are not strong in. They might turn out to be an achilles heel. Only put your strengths on the resume.
# Do not flirt, do not make obscene or suggestive comments. Do not curse. This can be difficult if you are going directly to the interview from an informal atmosphere such as school or a day out with friends. 
# Do not brag. Nobody wants to hire you if you are cocky or over-confidant. Likewise, do not be too modest. It is important to point out your strengths without being arrogant or condescending.


==Job Interview Tips==

An interview gives you the opportunity to showcase your qualifications to an employer, so it pays to be well prepared. The following information provides some helpful hints.

;Preparation:
* Learn about the organization.
* Have a specific job or jobs in mind.
* Review your qualifications for the job.
* Prepare answers to broad questions about yourself.
* Review your résumé.
* Practice an interview with a friend or relative.
* Arrive before the scheduled time of your interview.

;Personal appearance:
* Be well groomed.
* Dress appropriately.
* Do not chew gum or smoke.

;The interview:
* Relax and answer each question concisely.
* Respond promptly.
* Use good manners.
* Learn the name of your interviewer and greet him or her with a firm handshake.
* Use proper English—avoid slang.
* Be cooperative and enthusiastic.
* Use body language to show interest.
* Ask questions about the position and the organization, but avoid questions whose answers can easily be found on the company Web site. Also avoid asking questions about salary and benefits unless a job offer is made.
* Thank the interviewer when you leave and, as a follow-up, in writing.

;Test (if employer gives one):
* Listen closely to instructions.
* Read each question carefully.
* Write legibly and clearly.
* Budget your time wisely and don’t dwell on one question.

;Information to bring to an interview:
* Social Security card.
* Government-issued identification (driver’s license).
* Résumé. Although not all employers require applicants to bring a résumé, you should be able to furnish the interviewer information about your education, training, and previous employment.
* References. Employers typically require three references. Get permission before using anyone as a reference. Make sure that they will give you a good reference. Try to avoid using relatives as references.
* Transcripts. Employers may require an official copy of transcripts to verify grades, coursework, dates of attendance, and highest grade completed or degree awarded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the sense of electronics, logic means that the circuit works using only two voltage levels - high and low (or on/off, true/false or 1/0). These voltage levels are sometimes called logic levels and digital circuits use only these logic levels to represent information.

==Logic Gates==

{|align=right class=wikitable
!Input!!Output
|-
!align=center|A!!align=center|Q
|-
|align=center|0||align=center|1
|-
|align=center|1||align=center|0
|}
Logic gates are devices that can combine multiple inputs at independent logic levels and come up with an output accordingly. There are many kinds of logic gate, and the distinction lies in that each kind processes the inputs differently, and may give different ouputs for the same inputs.

The way the logic gate processes different inputs is given in a '''truth table''' for that gate, which lists all the possible combinations of inputs next to their outputs. An example is given for a simple one-input gate with the function of giving the opposite logic level at the output to the one at the input. The inputs are given on the left, and the outputs are on the right. Generally, the inputs are called A, B, C, etc., and the output is labelled Q. In this case, there are only two possible inputs, 1 or 0, but logic gates can have any number of inputs.

There are seven kinds of logic gates,each kind of logic gate has a circuit symbol associated with it. In fact, there are several conflicting standards defining the symbols for logic gates. The standard symbols are ANSI symbols, sometimes called the MIL symbols. These are the most distinctive and are widely used and recognised. It is recommended to use these symbols for basic logic cirucits, and this wikibook will use them to the exclusion of the others. It is better to use the IEC (rectangular) symbols for advanced logic designs, but this is at a higher level that this book. The comparison between the three symbol sets is given [[Practical_Electronics/Logic symbols|here]].

==Boolean Algebra==

Boolean algebra is a way to mathematically express logical ''operations'' performed on data. There are symbols for the operations performed by each logic gate, and these are given in the relevant sections below. It uses several symbols that are not generally used anywhere else, and the use of these will be also be explained below. Boolean algebra can be used to represent several logical operations done at once, and this be explained in [[#Multiple Gates|this section]].

Each kind of gate has its own symbol used when writing the functions down, but ideally, only the symbols for NOT, AND, OR and XOR are used, to reduce confusion, and to ease [[/Boolean Simplification|simplification]].

==The 7 Basic Gates==

===NOT===

{|align=right class=wikitable
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30|Q
|-
!¬A
|-
|align=center|0||align=center|1
|-
|align=center|1||align=center|0
|}

[[Image:NOT_ANSI.svg|left|100px]]

A '''NO gate''' or an '''inverter''' is the simplest kind of logic gate. Its function is to give the opposite output to its input - if it gets a high, it gives a low, and vice versa. This is equivalent to saying that the output is ''not'' the input.

The circuit symbol, left, for a NOT gate is a triangle with the point facing towards the output, and a circle at the output.

The boolean symbol for the NOT operator is either a line over the relevant input, or a &quot;¬&quot; symbol preceding it. Thus, the statement that the output, Q, is not the input, A, is either

::&lt;math&gt;\bar{A}=Q&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\neg A = Q\, &lt;/math&gt;

For instructions on how to write this in Wikitext or HTML, see [[/Practical Electronics/Help/Logic Symbols#NOT|here]].

NOT gates can be implemented in a variety of ways. See the following for more information:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4049|4049]] - The standard CMOS inverter. This IC contains six independednt inverters.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative NOT|Alternatives to an inverter]]. This page details methods other than using a 4049 for achieving a logical NOT operation.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===AND===

{|align=right class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
!AB
|-
|0||0||0
|-
|0||1||0
|-
|1||0||0
|-
|1||1||1
|}

[[Image:AND_ANSI.svg|left|100px]]

An '''AND gate''' gives a high output only when both inputs are high. If one or more inputs are low, then the output is also low. This is equivalent to saying that the output is high when one input ''and'' the other one are high.

The circuit symbol, left, for an AND gate is a box with one rectangular end (inputs) and one semi-circular end (output).

Boolean multiplication is equivalent to the AND function (see why [[/Boolean Arithmetic|here]] Thus, the AND gate can be represented by a multiplication dot &amp;middot; or just putting the two terms together.

::&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B=Q&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;AB=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;.

For instructions on how to write this in Wikitext or HTML, see [[/Practical Electronics/Help/Logic Symbols#AND|here]]

See the following for more information on the implementation of AND gates:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4081|4081]] - The standard CMOS AND gate. This IC contains four independent AND gates.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative AND|Alternatives to an AND Gate]]. This page details methods other than using a 4081 for achieving a logical AND operation.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===NAND===

{|align=right class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
&lt;th&gt;A|B&lt;/th&gt;
|-
|0||0||1
|-
|0||1||1
|-
|1||0||1
|-
|1||1||0
|}

[[Image:NAND_ANSI.svg|right|100px]]

A '''NAND gate''' gives a low output only when both inputs are high. If one or more inputs is low, then the output is high. This is equivalent to saying that the output is NOT the output of an AND gate presented with the same inputs. This NOT AND combination is shortened to just NAND.

The circuit symbol, left, for an NAND gate is a box with one rectangular end (inputs) and one semi-circular end (output). This output end has a small circle, denoting an inversion.

The boolean symbol for the NAND operator is a vertical line (the Sheffer Stroke). Thus, the NAND gate can be represented by the boolean statement

::&lt;math&gt;A | B=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

NAND can also be written as the negation (NOT) of the AND:

::&lt;math&gt;\overline {A \cdot B}=Q&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline {A B}=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the prefered notation, as it is easier to see what is happening in terms of the basic functions.

See the following for more information on the implementation of AND gates:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4011|4011]] - The standard CMOS NAND gate. This IC contains four independent NAND gates.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative NAND|Alternatives to an NAND Gate]]. This page details methods other than using a 4011 for achieving a logical NAND operation.

NAND gates have the property that any other logic gate can be mode from just NAND gates. For the method of achieving this, see [[/NAND Logic|NAND Logic]]([[w:NAND logic|NAND logic]]).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===OR===

{|align=right class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
&lt;th&gt;A+B&lt;/th&gt;
|-
|0||0||0
|-
|0||1||1
|-
|1||0||1
|-
|1||1||1
|}

[[Image:OR_ANSI.svg|right|100px]]

An '''OR gate''' gives a high output if any input is high. If all inputs are low, then the output is low. This is equivalent to saying that the output is high only when when one OR the other OR both inputs are high.

The circuit symbol, left, for an OR gate is similar to that of an AND gate, but with a pointed end (ouptuts) and a concave end (inputs).

Boolean addition is eqivalent to the OR function (see why [[/Boolean Arithmetic|here]] Thus, the OR gate can be represented by a plus sign (+):

::&lt;math&gt;A + B=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

A V-shaped symbol can also be used, but it is not common and should not generally be used.

::&lt;math&gt;A \lor B=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

See the following for more information on the implementation of OR gates:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4071|4071]] - The standard CMOS OR gate. This IC contains four independent OR gates.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative OR|Alternatives to an OR Gate]]. This page details methods other than using a 4071 for achieving a logical OR operation.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===NOR===

{|align=right class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
&lt;th&gt;A⊥B&lt;/th&gt;
|-
|0||0||1
|-
|0||1||0
|-
|1||0||0
|-
|1||1||0
|}

[[Image:NOR_ANSI.svg|right|100px]]

A '''NOR gate''' gives a high output only if no inputs are high. If an input is high, then the output is low. This is equivalent to saying that the output is high only when when neither one NOR the other input is high. It is the opposite to an OR gate.

The circuit symbol, left, for a NOR gate is similar to that of an OR gate, but for the addition of a circle to denote the inversion from an OR gate.

NOR can also be written as the negation (NOT) of the OR:

::&lt;math&gt;\overline {A + B}=Q&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the preferred notation. Another symbol for the NOR operator is a symbol like &quot;⊥&quot;, which can be used when the line over the top cannot easily be drawn (e.g. in normal text like this):

::&lt;math&gt;A \perp B=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

See the following for more information on the implementation of NOR gates:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4001|4001]] - The standard CMOS NOR gate. This IC contains four independent NOR gates.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative NOR|Alternatives to an NOR Gate]]. This page details methods other than using a 4001 for achieving a logical NOR operation.

NOR gates have the property that any other logic gate can be mode from just NOR gates. For the method of achieving this, see [[/NOR Logic|NOR Logic]].

===XOR===

{|align=right class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
&lt;th&gt;A≠B&lt;/th&gt;
|-
|0||0||0
|-
|0||1||1
|-
|1||0||1
|-
|1||1||0
|}

[[Image:XOR_ANSI.svg|left|100px]]

An '''XOR gate''' short for &quot;exclusive-OR&quot;, gives a high output if one input is high and the other is low. If both inputs are the same, the output is low. This is equivalent to saying that the output is high only when one OR the other but not both inputs are high.

The circuit symbol, left, for an XOR gate is similar to that of an OR gate, but with a double line at the concave input end.

The boolean symbol for the XOR operator is a plus-sign in a circle or, because it only returns a high when the inputs are different,a not-equal-to sign (not generally used). Thus, the XOR gate can be represented by the boolean statements

::&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B=Q \,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(A \ne B)=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

For instructions on how to write this in Wikitext or HTML, see [[/Practical Electronics/Help/Logic Symbols#XOR]]

See the following for more information on the implementation of XOR gates:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4030|4030]] - The standard CMOS XOR gate. This IC contains four independent XOR gates.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative XOR|Alternatives to an XOR Gate]]. This page details methods other than using a 4030 for achieving a logical XOR operation.

===XNOR===

{|align=right class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
&lt;th&gt;A≡B&lt;/th&gt;
|-
|0||0||1
|-
|0||1||0
|-
|1||0||0
|-
|1||1||1
|}

[[Image:XNOR_ANSI.svg|left|100px]]

An '''XNOR gate''' short for &quot;exclusive-NOR&quot;, gives a high output if both outputs are the same - it is the opposite of the XOR gate.

The circuit symbol, left, for an XNOR gate is similar to that of an XOR gate, but it has a circle representing the inversion at the ouput.

XNOR is written as the negation of the XOR function:

::&lt;math&gt;\overline{A \oplus B}=Q&lt;/math&gt;

As the XNOR function only returns a &quot;one&quot; when both inputs are the same, the boolean symbol for the XNOR operator is an equalvalent-to sign (≡) sign (not equals) in normal text. Because this looks very much like an equals sign it is easily mistaken and should not be used where possible.

::&lt;math&gt;(A \equiv B)=Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

See the following for more information on the implementation of XNOR gates:

*[[Practical Electronics/IC/4077|4077]] - The standard CMOS XNOR gate. This IC contains four independent XNOR gates.
*[[Practical Electronics/Logic/Alternative XOR|Alternatives to an XNOR Gate]]. This page details methods other than using a 4077 for achieving a logical XNOR operation.

==Uses of Logic Gates==

Logic gates underpin most of digital electronics, (indeed the entire on-board computer in the Apollo spacecraft was made of NOR gates).

The most obvious uses is for simple control. Imagine designing a washing machine so that the water only turns on when the washing is loaded (logic-1), the door is closed (logic-1) but the clothes are not yet wet (logic-0). This can be done by ANDing the first two conditions, and inverting the third. Now, AND these together, and you get a high only when all three conditions are satified.

{|class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center
!Washing!!Door!!Wet Clothes!!Washing AND Door!!NOT Wet Clothes!!Water (output)
|-
!A!!B!!C!!AB!!¬C!!(AB)(¬C)
|-
|0||0||0||0||1||0
|-
|0||0||1||0||0||0
|-
|0||1||0||0||1||0
|-
|0||1||1||0||0||0
|-
|1||0||0||0||1||0
|-
|1||0||1||0||0||0
|-
|1||1||0||1||1||1
|-
|1||1||1||1||0||0
|}

By using just three logic gates (and, at most two ICs - one 4081 and one 4049), the problem has been solved.

However, logic gates are also used to make [[Practical_Electronics/Flip-flops|flip-flops]] and other vital electronic components.

One convenient use of them is as [[/Transmission Gates|transmission gates]] which allow a signal to pass only under certain conditions.

{{mergefrom|Find Employment/Evaluating an Offer}}

== The Offer ==

If the interview has gone well, and if both parties are happy with the interview process, you might receive an offer. Many offers are verbal, over the phone, but recently some companies have been sending out offers (at least informal offers) over email as well. Inevitably, the question will come up about compensation, and the hiring manager is likely to ask &quot;how much money do you want?&quot; This is a loaded question, so it is worth while to prepare your response.

Once you receive a job offer, you are faced with a difficult decision and must evaluate the offer carefully. Fortunately, most organizations will not expect you to accept or reject an offer immediately.

=== Issues to Consider ===

There are many issues to consider when assessing a job offer. Will the organization be a good place to work? Will the job be interesting? Are there opportunities for advancement? Is the salary fair? Does the employer offer good benefits? If you have not already figured out exactly what you want, the following discussion may help you to develop a set of criteria for judging job offers, whether you are starting a career, reentering the labor force after a long absence, or planning a career change.

=== The organization ===
Background information on an organization can help you to decide whether it is a good place for you to work. Factors to consider include the organization�s business or activity, financial condition, age, size, and location.

You generally can get background information on an organization, particularly a large organization, on its Internet site or by telephoning its public relations office. A public company�s annual report to the stockholders tells about its corporate philosophy, history, products or services, goals, and financial status. Most government agencies can furnish reports that describe their programs and missions. Press releases, company newsletters or magazines, and recruitment brochures also can be useful. Ask the organization for any other items that might interest a prospective employee. If possible, speak to current or former employees of the organization.

Background information on the organization may be available at your public or school library. If you cannot get an annual report, check the library for reference directories that may provide basic facts about the company, such as earnings, products and services, and number of employees. Some directories widely available in libraries either in print or as online databases include:

* Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s Million Dollar Directory
* Standard and Poor’s Register of Corporations
* Mergent’s Industrial Review (formerly Moody’s Industrial Manual)
* Thomas Register of American Manufacturers
* Ward’s Business Directory

Stories about an organization in magazines and newspapers can tell a great deal about its successes, failures, and plans for the future. You can identify articles on a company by looking under its name in periodical or computerized indexes in libraries. However, it probably will not be useful to look back more than 2 or 3 years

The library also may have government publications that present projections of growth for the industry in which the organization is classified. Long-term projections of employment and output for detailed industries, covering the entire U.S. economy, are developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and revised every 2 years. See the November 2005 Monthly Labor Review for the most recent projections, covering the 2004-14 period, on the Internet at: http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/mlrhome.htm. Trade magazines also may include articles on the trends for specific industries.

Career centers at colleges and universities often have information on employers that is not available in libraries. Ask a career center representative how to find out about a particular organization.

;Does the organization's business or activity match your own interests and beliefs?:
It is easier to apply yourself to the work if you are enthusiastic about what the organization does.

=== Size of the FCompany ===

;How will the size of the organization affect you?:
Large firms generally offer a greater variety of training programs and career paths, more managerial levels for advancement, and better employee benefits than do small firms. Large employers also may have more advanced technologies. However, many jobs in large firms tend to be highly specialized.

Jobs in small firms may offer broader authority and responsibility, a closer working relationship with top management, and a chance to clearly see your contribution to the success of the organization.

;Should you work for a relatively new organization or one that is well established?:
New businesses have a high failure rate, but for many people, the excitement of helping to create a company and the potential for sharing in its success more than offset the risk of job loss. However, it may be just as exciting and rewarding to work for a young firm that already has a foothold on success.

=== Type of Company ===

;Does it make a difference if the company is private or public?:
An individual or a family may control a privately owned company and key jobs may be reserved for relatives and friends. A board of directors responsible to the stockholders controls a publicly owned company and key jobs usually are open to anyone.

;Is the organization in an industry with favorable long-term prospects?:
The most successful firms tend to be in industries that are growing rapidly.

=== Nature of the job === 
Even if everything else about the job is attractive, you will be unhappy if you dislike the day-to-day work. Determining in advance whether you will like the work may be difficult. However, the more you find out about the job before accepting or rejecting the offer, the more likely you are to make the right choice. Actually working in the industry and, if possible, for the company would provide considerable insight. You can gain work experience through part-time, temporary, or summer jobs, or through internship or work-study programs while in school, all of which can lead to permanent job offers.

;Where is the job located?:
If the job is in another section of the country, you need to consider the cost of living, the availability of housing and transportation, and the quality of educational and recreational facilities in that section of the country. Even if the job location is in your area, you should consider the time and expense of commuting.

;Does the work match your interests and make good use of your skills?:
The duties and responsibilities of the job should be explained in enough detail to answer this question.

;How important is the job in this company?:
An explanation of where you fit in the organization and how you are supposed to contribute to its overall objectives should give you an idea of the job�s importance.

;Are you comfortable with the hours?:
Most jobs involve regular hours—for example, 40 hours a week, during the day, Monday through Friday. Other jobs require night, weekend, or holiday work. In addition, some jobs routinely require overtime to meet deadlines or sales or production goals, or to better serve customers. Consider the effect that the work hours will have on your personal life.

;How long do most people who enter this job stay with the company?:
High turnover can mean dissatisfaction with the nature of the work or something else about the job.

=== Opportunities offered by employers === 
A good job offers you opportunities to learn new skills, increase your earnings, and rise to positions of greater authority, responsibility, and prestige. A lack of opportunities can dampen interest in the work and result in frustration and boredom.

The company should have a training plan for you. What valuable new skills does the company plan to teach you?

The employer should give you some idea of promotion possibilities within the organization. What is the next step on the career ladder? If you have to wait for a job to become vacant before you can be promoted, how long does this usually take? When opportunities for advancement do arise, will you compete with applicants from outside the company? Can you apply for jobs for which you qualify elsewhere within the organization, or is mobility within the firm limited?

=== Salaries and benefits === 
Wait for the employer to introduce these subjects. Some companies will not talk about pay until they have decided to hire you. In order to know if their offer is reasonable, you need a rough estimate of what the job should pay. You may have to go to several sources for this information. Try to find family, friends, or acquaintances who recently were hired in similar jobs. Ask your teachers and the staff in placement offices about starting pay for graduates with your qualifications. Help-wanted ads in newspapers sometimes give salary ranges for similar positions. Check the library or your school�s career center for salary surveys such as those conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers or various professional associations.

If you are considering the salary and benefits for a job in another geographic area, make allowances for differences in the cost of living, which may be significantly higher in a large metropolitan area than in a smaller city, town, or rural area.

You also should learn the organization's policy regarding overtime. Depending on the job, you may or may not be exempt from laws requiring the employer to compensate you for overtime. Find out how many hours you will be expected to work each week and whether you receive overtime pay or compensatory time off for working more than the specified number of hours in a week.

Also take into account that the starting salary is just that—the start. Your salary should be reviewed on a regular basis; many organizations do it every year. How much can you expect to earn after 1, 2, or 3 or more years? An employer cannot be specific about the amount of pay if it includes commissions and bonuses.

Benefits also can add a lot to your base pay, but they vary widely. Find out exactly what the benefit package includes and how much of the cost you must bear.

== Research ==

It is important, before you even go to an interview, and certainly before you entertain an offer, that you know what you are worth, and what the job pays. There are many resources on the internet, such as Salary.com, where you can find out what other people in your area are getting paid for similar work. If you are a college graduate, ask your advisors what kinds of salary people with your qualifications are worth. If you aren't a graduate, find out what other qualifications you have, and what their combined worth is. If you have your highschool diploma, and a number of certifications, and if you have attended training programs, do some research and find out what your net worth is.

== Don't Make the First Offer ==

No matter what happens, you should never say a dollar amount first. If you ask for a number that is too high, the hiring manager may think that you are unrealistic, or that you are accustomed to having too high paying a job. If you ask for too little, the manager might accept your offer, even if they were willing to pay you more.

Here is a story: A hiring manager is looking to hire an office assistant for approximately 20$ an hour, plus some benefits. The manager interviews 2 candidates, both of which are equally qualfied. He asks what each one wants to make. The first candidate says &quot;I've done some research, I know this job is worth approximately 20$/hour, but I'm not despirate, and I'm willing to negotiate&quot;. The second candidate says &quot;I want to make at least 15$ an hour.&quot; So who gets the job? The hiring manager will likely hire the second candidate, because the second candidate will be happy with only 15$ an hour, and the hiring manager can save 25% of his money for other needs!

Now, the example above may make it look like you can get your foot in the door if you under-bid the competition, but keep in mind: If you make yourself look cheap, people will think you are cheap. People may think that they can get away with giving you too little money, or they may think that you simply haven't done your research (which makes you look bad), or they may even think that you are only worth the lower amount! if competition for a job is tough, don't undersell yourself, because you lose your edge.

== Don't Forget Benefits ==

Benefits, if they are being offered, are an important part of your employment package. Which is better: $35,000 a year with full medical and dental, or $40,000 per year with no benefits at all? If you are already covered, you might spring for the higher number, but many people should definitely think hard about this decision, because it could affect the rest of your life. If you have college loan debt, see if the company offers tuition reimbursement. For young women, find out what the maternity package is like. Everybody should inquire about the retirement options, the medical benefits, life insurance options, et cetera. Also, if the company is unionized, find out what the union dues cost, and find out what the union benefits are. It's your job, and if you've gotten this far in the employment process, you can probably find another job if this one doesn't meet your needs.

== Evaluating a Job Offer ==

Once you receive a job offer, you are faced with a difficult decision and must evaluate the offer carefully. Fortunately, most organizations will not expect you to accept or reject an offer immediately.

There are many issues to consider when assessing a job offer. Will the organization be a good place to work? Will the job be interesting? Are there opportunities for advancement? Is the salary fair? Does the employer offer good benefits? If you have not already figured out exactly what you want, the following discussion may help you to develop a set of criteria for judging job offers, whether you are starting a career, reentering the labor force after a long absence, or planning a career change.

=== The organization === 

Background information on an organization can help you to decide whether it is a good place for you to work. Factors to consider include the organization’s business or activity, financial condition, age, size, and location.

You generally can get background information on an organization, particularly a large organization, on its Internet site or by telephoning its public relations office. A public company’s annual report to the stockholders tells about its corporate philosophy, history, products or services, goals, and financial status. Most government agencies can furnish reports that describe their programs and missions. Press releases, company newsletters or magazines, and recruitment brochures also can be useful. Ask the organization for any other items that might interest a prospective employee. If possible, speak to current or former employees of the organization.

Background information on the organization may be available at your public or school library. If you cannot get an annual report, check the library for reference directories that may provide basic facts about the company, such as earnings, products and services, and number of employees. Some directories widely available in libraries either in print or as online databases include:

* Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s Million Dollar Directory
* Standard and Poor’s Register of Corporations
* Mergent’s Industrial Review (formerly Moody’s Industrial Manual)
* Thomas Register of American Manufacturers
* Ward’s Business Directory

Stories about an organization in magazines and newspapers can tell a great deal about its successes, failures, and plans for the future. You can identify articles on a company by looking under its name in periodical or computerized indexes in libraries. However, it probably will not be useful to look back more than 2 or 3 years

The library also may have government publications that present projections of growth for the industry in which the organization is classified. Long-term projections of employment and output for detailed industries, covering the entire U.S. economy, are developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and revised every 2 years. See the November 2005 Monthly Labor Review for the most recent projections, covering the 2004-14 period, on the Internet at: http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/mlrhome.htm. Trade magazines also may include articles on the trends for specific industries.

Career centers at colleges and universities often have information on employers that is not available in libraries. Ask a career center representative how to find out about a particular organization.

;Does the organization’s business or activity match your own interests and beliefs?:It is easier to apply yourself to the work if you are enthusiastic about what the organization does.

;How will the size of the organization affect you?:Large firms generally offer a greater variety of training programs and career paths, more managerial levels for advancement, and better employee benefits than do small firms. Large employers also may have more advanced technologies. However, many jobs in large firms tend to be highly specialized.

Jobs in small firms may offer broader authority and responsibility, a closer working relationship with top management, and a chance to clearly see your contribution to the success of the organization.

;Should you work for a relatively new organization or one that is well established?:New businesses have a high failure rate, but for many people, the excitement of helping to create a company and the potential for sharing in its success more than offset the risk of job loss. However, it may be just as exciting and rewarding to work for a young firm that already has a foothold on success.

;Does it make a difference if the company is private or public?:An individual or a family may control a privately owned company and key jobs may be reserved for relatives and friends. A board of directors responsible to the stockholders controls a publicly owned company and key jobs usually are open to anyone.

;Is the organization in an industry with favorable long-term prospects?:
The most successful firms tend to be in industries that are growing rapidly.

=== Nature of the job === 

Even if everything else about the job is attractive, you will be unhappy if you dislike the day-to-day work. Determining in advance whether you will like the work may be difficult. However, the more you find out about the job before accepting or rejecting the offer, the more likely you are to make the right choice. Actually working in the industry and, if possible, for the company would provide considerable insight. You can gain work experience through part-time, temporary, or summer jobs, or through internship or work-study programs while in school, all of which can lead to permanent job offers.

== State and Local Information ==

Most States have career information delivery systems (CIDS), which may be found in secondary and postsecondary institutions, as well as libraries, job training sites, vocational-technical schools, and employment offices. A wide range of information is provided, from employment opportunities to unemployment insurance claims.

Whereas the Handbook provides information for occupations on a national level, each State has detailed information on occupations and labor markets within their respective jursidictions. State occupational projections are available at: http://www.projectionscentral.com

== What this book is about ==

This book is about finding work. This book will discuss finding a job through the creation of a resume and a cover letter, the application process, and the interview. This book will also briefly discuss finding work by starting your own business.

== Who this book is for ==

Technically speaking, this book is for every person. People who are unemployed, or who are looking to switch careers should read this book.  This book will be most relevant to those living in the United States, or those countries that have similar standards and methods as the USA.

== How this book is arranged ==

This book is arranged in a chronological manner. The first section deals with finding job prospects, and doing research on companies. The second section deals with writing a resume and a cover letter. The third section deals with the interview process. Finally, the fourth section deals with evaluating an offer. Additional information and resources can be found in the appendix.

== Job search is a job ==

It often takes months of time and effort to find a job that matches your qualifications and desires. Actively pursuing multiple leads will maximize your search efforts and reduce the time it takes you to find employment. This means devoting as much time as you can to your job search. If you are unemployed, treat your job search like a full-time job, waking up early and working a full day. If you are working or in school, it is still important to devote time every day to your job search.

Inform people you know that you are looking for a job. Read the classified ads. Use the Internet, including general job search sites, special interest sites, company Web sites, and trade and professional association Web sites. Directly contact employers in which you are interested, even if they are not advertising a job opening. You may also wish to consult State employment service offices and to consider private employment agencies.

      <comment>/* Comparison between elastic and compliant materials */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Ok, here comes the second part. Here we'll discuss mainly &quot;muscle stretch&quot; or what happens to a muscle when it is stretched passively or actively. We'll also see how this affects crossbridges (links between myosin and actin) and we shall finish this chapter by considering some physical properties of muscles.


Ok, let's go.



== Passive stretch ==

	It is important for cardiac muscles.

	Muscle is attached to 2 supports, one mobile and the other fixed.

	When muscle is stretched, force and length of the muscle are recorded after obtaining equilibrium, to construct a tension-length curve.

	Since the muscle is not actively contracting (no crossbridges) and since it doesn’t require ATP, this is a passive stretch.


'''Results:'''

1-	No tension is measured before L becomes greater than L0 (which is quite obvious):

L / L0 &gt; 1

Where L0 = normal length of relaxed muscle (resting length), L = length of muscle at any given time.

Thus, at rest L / L0 = 1, under stretch L / L0 &gt; 1


2-	The curve is not a straight line because it is a biological material (mixture of different tissues). Also, dF / dx is not constant.


3-	Muscles are elastic.


== Active stretch ==

Same experiment, but here, after stretching the muscle to a predetermined length and passive tension, muscle is stimulated to produce a single twitch. Max force developed by the muscle is then measured.

[[Image:musclons.jpg]]

'''Observation:'''

1-	The curve obtained describes an active stretch before L0 but an active with some passive stretch after L0. Thus, we must subtract the passive from the active curve (active – passive) to obtain an active twitch tension vs. length.

2-	The single twitch tension is greatest around L0.

[[Image:graph musclon1.jpg]]

'''Explanation'''

''At L / L0 = 1''

Max no. of non-interfering crossbridges can be formed. Myosin only meets actin of the correct polarity and movement is all towards the center of the sarcomere.

H zone is a relatively small portion of the A band.


''At L / L0 &gt; 1''

Few crossbridges are formed because, the more the muscle is stretched, the less thin and thick filaments overlap.

H zone is close to the size of the A band.


''At L / L0 &lt; 1''

Few crossbridges are formed because interference occurs. Short length thin filaments can crumple and block access for myosin. Also, myosin may pull on actin from the wrong side of the sarcomere.

No H zone.


'''Conclusion:'''

F α total no. of crossbridges. Thus, increase in muscle strength is not due to increase in muscle fiber no., but is due to increase in no. of bundles of parallel myofibrils. Thus, F is directly proportional to cross-sectional area (i.e. total myofibrils).

== Tension, cross bridging and muscle elasticity ==

1) Contraction occurs after a delay. Latent period = time between stimulus and begin of contraction.

Reason: Muscles are not just contractile in nature. They are also elastic, even at L &lt; L0. That’s because the contractile fibers themselves, the z-lines, and anything else in series with contractile components (e.g. tendons) can and will stretch when a contraction puts tension on them.  


2) Tension produced by a muscle is not instantaneous: it builds up and then wanes.

Reason: Tension does not appear/disappear instantaneously because Ca2　must diffuse and bind, crossbridges must form, then Ca2　must be removed and crossbridges must be broken. So, diffusion, active transport and conformational changes take time.  


'''Main elements governing muscle elasticity''' 


''Contractile Elements (CE)''

Contractile fibrils responsible of muscle contraction. During contraction, CE shorten after cross-bridging. 


''Series Elastic Elements (SEE)''

Elements in series with CE. They allow a contracted muscle to reach an L &gt; L0 when it is actively stretched. 

During contraction, SEE lengthen slightly.


''Parallel Elastic Elements (PEE)''

Elements in // with CE. They produce a tension when a muscle is passively stretched past L0.

PEE remain at the same length.


''Notes:''

	Certain parts of the muscle are both parts of the CE and the SEE. They are functionally separate but physically the same.

	If the CE is not contracting, there are no functionally SEE.

	Max supportable load (F0) = max load that a muscle can support without lengthening = greatest force that CE can produce.

	Viscosity = internal resistance due to rearrangement. It represents a net loss of E. from the system.

== Muscle Power Output ==

	Force = muscular tension = mg (a muscle with a load of 1 kg exerts a force of 9.8 N). 

	Work = F d. Since the muscle does not shorten under isometric contraction, the muscle does no external work. It does do internal work though. Likewise, a muscle that shortens against no external load does no external work.

	Power = Work / time = Fv. Again, an isometrically contracting muscle develops no external power, nor does an isotonically contracting muscle with no external load.

[[Image:graphons.jpg]]

	From curve 1 (x vs. t), as the load increases from no load to heavier loads, 

o	The distance the muscle can shorten decreases as does the velocity.

o	The latent period increases. 

o	At F0, the contraction becomes totally isometric as the muscle doesn’t change in length. 

o	The muscle lengthens beyond F0 despite contracting maximally. This is because the elastic elements lengthen and/or the crossbridges are broken by the load.


	From curve 2 (v vs. load), movement of muscle slows down as load increases.


	From curve 3 (P vs. load), there is an optimum load for a given muscle to produce max useful external power. Muscles thus do not contract proportionately faster and faster as the load is reduced. Different muscles give different curves.


== Muscles Dimensions (force and speed) ==


•	F α cross-sectional area of muscle, thus α no. of myofibrils. Thus, F is increased as no. of elements in // increases. That’s because a thick muscle has more crossbridges, so the load is spread over a greater area and thus it is less likely any fiber will break.


•	v is a fn of muscle length. The more the sarcomeres in series, the greater the displacement that occurs when all move at the same time. Because total shortening is the sum of dx of each sarcomere. 


•	v also depends on load on the muscle.


== Comparison between elastic and compliant materials ==


'''Elastic materials'''

Elastance = Stress / Strain (N / m2)

Tolerates high stress and shows a minor change in shape.

Example: muscles.



'''Compliant materials'''

Compliance = Strain / Stress (m2 / N)

A low stress causes a high change in shape. Thus, small forces like surface tension are very significant.

Example: lungs.

      <comment>/* AND Transmission Gate */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Transmission gates represent a very useful application of logic gates. A transmission gate allows a signal to pass only when a certain condition is met, and the same gate can also invert the signal if necessary.

==AND Transmission Gate==

This is the basic transmission gate. The &quot;condition signal&quot; is one input, and the &quot;signal input&quot; is the other. When the condition input is high, any high at the signal input will result in a high at the output, and a low at the signal input will result in a low. Therefore, the signal at the signal input is &quot;transmitted&quot; through the gate when the condition signal goes high.

==NAND Transmission Gate==

==OR Transmission Gate==

==NOR Transmission Gate==

==Summary==
The table below summarises the type of transmission gates you need to use to produce the right behaviour:

{|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; class=wikitable align=center
!&amp;nbsp;!!Non-Inverting!!Inverting
|-
!Normally High
|OR||NAND

!Normally Low

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the free response section, could someone add that sometimes students are asked to write a lab.  When writing a lab (in free response), clearly state question, the hypothesis, and the method.  In the method, the variables must be stated and labelled dependent or independent.  Then explain possible results, and what each result would mean (prove or disprove hypothesis).  I'd do it myself but I'm out of town and don't have my resources to doublecheck i havn't missed any steps.</text>

Liberal Studies is one of four compulsory subjects in the New Senior Secondary Curriculum, which was introduced in Hong Kong schools in 2009, with the first candidates sitting public exams in 2012. This guide outlines the core and elective components of the syllabus which has been proposed by the Curriculum Development Council and approved by the Education and Manpower Bureau, together with suggested questions for discussion and further study and recommended websites for further reading. The guide also outlines study tips for the subject.

Liberal Studies is currently an optional A/S Level subject. The aim of making the subject compulsory is to ensure that all students develop an understanding of the major issues confronting our society in the 21st century and that they are equipped with the critical thinking skills that they need in order to make informed, critical judgments about these issues. 

The subject contains elements of science, the humanities and the liberal arts and it also serves to ensure that all students have some degree of breadth in their senior secondary studies.

I'm relatively new to actively editing Wikipedia, although I cannot remember when I started using Wikipedia as a resource.  I want to contribute to Wikipedia because I think I can make it better.  Isn't that why everyone does it?

I am somewhat educated on the subjects of [[Ancient warfare]], especially Ancient Roman Warfare (warfare during the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Empirical Periods]]), and Ancient History, more specifically [[Ancient Rome|Roman History]].  My interest in these areas was sparked when I first played [[Rome: Total War]] by [[Creative Assembly]].  I read further into this era of [[Military History]] and I was fascinated by what I saw, most astounding are the accomplishments of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]], among others. 

==Articles I've Made==
None yet, although I have submitted several source texts on WikiSource.

==Articles I've Contributed to==
Many of the ancient warfare (especially the Roman military) articles have something of mine in there somewhere.  The following are articles I have edited or contributed to in a notable way.

[[Marian reforms]]

[[Testudo formation]]

[[Roman infantry tactics, strategy and battle formations]]

[[Military establishment of the Roman Republic]]

==Books I've Contributed to==


==Source Texts Contributed==

Note:  On the following I contributed unwikified source texts, and added links to the Latin WikiSource texts and vice-versa.  All other editing, wikifying, etc. is by other users and I extend my sincere thanks to them for their work.

'''TCL SCRIPT FOR MODELSIM USERS'''

I tried to find a TCL script, which helps in compilation and simulation of Modelsim programs and has both GUI and single letter commands but I didn’t find any.

Later I learned TCL and wrote a small script for Modelsim users, which makes icons on the Modelsim GUI. Just by clicking on the icons your project files will get compiled, simulated and so on.

The icons and its description are


·'''compile     c''' is for compilation, simulation, add wave and run, simply do everything 

·'''com-restart   r'''      does compilation and restarts the already run code, we do this  
whenever we change code and want to compile and execute it 

·'''Quitsim         q'''     quits the simulation 

·'''QuitModel sim   Q'''     quits Modelsim


You can do all the afore said things just by clicking on the icon as we use 'save' and 'open'-like icons in general GUI.

And also you can do these things just by typing c, r, q &amp; Q (defined above) on the command prompt, only one letter will do.
 
For these things, you just have to execute one command on the command prompt of Modelsim after opening Modelsim:
                        
'''source  filename.tcl'''


'''TCL CODE:''' 

&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc c  {} {
    '''''vcom counter.vhd  ''''' # add  your files here then delete this comment 
    '''''vcom countertb.vhd  '''''  
    echo &quot;---------------COMPILATION IS OVER--------------------------&quot;
    '''''vsim work.countertb'''''
    echo &quot;---------------STARTED SIMULATION---------------------------&quot;
    add wave *
    run -all
}

proc r  {} {
    '''''vcom counter.vhd'''''  # add  your files here then delete this comment
    '''''vcom countertb.vhd'''''   
    echo &quot;---------------COMPILATION IS OVER--------------------------&quot;
    restart
    echo &quot;---------------SIMULATION IS RESTRATED----------------------&quot;    
    run -all
}
proc q  {} {
 quit -sim
}

proc Q  {} {
 quit -force
}



button .compile -command c -text &quot;Compile&quot;

button .compile_restart  -command r -text &quot;Com-Restart&quot;

button .quitsim -command q       -text &quot;QuitSim&quot;

button .quitmodelsim -command Q   -text &quot;QuitModelsim&quot;


pack .compile -side left

pack .compile_restart -side left

pack .quitsim -side right

pack .quitmodelsim -side right

 
&lt;/source&gt;



This is a very generic code suited for all projects of Modelsim but unfortunately only Modelsim DE and Questa sim supports button command    you just have to change the bold and italic font statements(.vhd files). These statements are for files of a counter project here. So you have to replace those counter example files with your project files. 



Then save your file as script.tcl (file with .tcl extension) and execute the file with “source “ command as said above. 


Now your GUI and single letter commands are ready to simplify your work.

Growing a garden is an ancient practice we have perfected over thousands of years. However, in modern times, we are not all raised with a garden in the back yard, so it's good to approach a new garden with careful forethought and a plan to follow. 

Before starting the plan, the gardener should first come up with a list of priorities for the garden, perhaps asking questions such as these:

#What will be the main purpose of the garden? A hobby? A place to grow food? A place to entertain? All of the above?
#How much time will I have to spend in the garden?
#How much money will be in the gardening budget?

These are all important questions, because the approach to garden planning and design will vary greatly according to how they are answered. We'll begin by going over these topics in detail.

==The aims of the garden==

Gardens are grown for many reasons, such as for a hobby (where the act of gardening becomes its own reward), a place to grow food for the family or the market, or as a place to entertain.

Hobby gardens tend to come about slowly, one bed at a time, and one plant at a time. Hobby gardening often verges on obsession, as the gardener learns of new plants to grow, and tries to utilize every inch of soil to its greatest potential. The best approach to a hobby garden is to start small, then expand the project as you get a feel for how much work is involved. 

When growing fruits and vegetables, the primary interest is in the final products (the produce), and so the garden should be planned to get the most production from the time and space available to the grower. 

When the garden is intended as a place to entertain, the planning needs to take into account how much space will be needed for your guests, what time of year it will be used, and what sort of entertaining you'll be doing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Test to conduct before purchasing a second-hand vehicle'''&lt;br&gt;
The sump compression of an engine must be negative. Pull out the dipstick while engine is idling, don't rev
the engine. If there's any wind, gas or oil escaping the dipstick holder then the rings are worn. This condition is known as 'blow-by'. 

White smoke from the exhaust indicates engine oil remaining on the bore that the rings haven't scraped off -loss
of oil control. Black smoke from the exhaust indicates dirty fuel injectors on a diesel engine. Dirty fuel injectors
aren't a serious problem.  The rings gets progressively worn down. A slight escape of wind from the dipstick is the first stage of ring failure. It will get worse until gasses and oil start escaping the dipstick holder. 
Reduced compression or blow-by on the rings has nothing to do with the condition of a diesel pump.

Reduced engine compression/white smoke are the result of the piston rings not sealing tight with the bore. 'Blow-by' on the rings results in less power transferred to the crankshaft. The compression gases that escape past the rings
are forced out via the sump. This results in the sump leaking oil.

First conduct a 'dry test' and then a 'wet test'. The dry/wet readings must be very close to each other. To do a dry test, unplug the spark plugs for petrol and remove the glowplugs on a diesel engine. Place compression tester inside glowplug and crank engine 10 times till the needle indicates maximum compression. Note this reading and write it down. Repeat test for remaining three cylinders. All four readings must be within 10% of the vehicle specs and very close to each other. Should a reading be out, insert 10ml engine oil into the glowplug and repeat compression test. The oil seals any faulty rings. Should the reading differ from the dry reading, it indicates a failing ring. Above sea level the compression readings on all four pistons must be within 80% of the specs. 

A mechanic must perform a compression test on any used vehicle before purchase. And don't use the mechanic next door to the retail outlet - ensure you obtain an unbiased opinion. 

If there's no air, gases or oil escaping the dipstick holder, but the compression readings are not correct
then the cylinder head is cracked or there is a blown head gasket.  Look for a white emulsification on the dipstick. It would indicate a cracked cylinder head, leaking engine coolant on the piston.Check the dipstick end for gear oil or engine oil. Unscrupulous sellers add SAE90 gear oil to mask faulty ring symptoms.

'''Prevent engine overheating:'''&lt;br&gt;
Replace water pump, thermostat and radiator hoses. Have radiator cleaned at a radiator workshop. Make certain that the radiator capacity is big enough for the engine. Diesel uses 3core, petrol 2core radiators for LDV. Remove radiator cap and check for oil. Oil in the water means a cracked cylinder head. This is major structural damage to an engine. Machinist shops test head integrity via a pressure test. There must be engine coolant in the radiator. Clear water in radiator indicates poor maintenance of engine.

'''Repairing the internal combustion engine and condition inspection''' &lt;br&gt;
1) Forged pistons need 80% more bore/piston clearance than cast iron pistons. Cast iron pistons expand less. &lt;br&gt;
2) Custom, extremely hard, cast iron pistons can be made by a machinist so that bore/piston clearance can be kept very low/&lt;br&gt;
3) The skirt is the bottom and crown the top part of a piston&lt;br&gt;
4) Clearance measurement is done at the skirt of the piston. &lt;br&gt;
5) Mitutoyo bore gauge measures the inside diameter of an engine bore. It resolution is 0.0001 inch. &lt;br&gt;
6) Ribbon gauges are thin long gauges that stick in between piston and bore to measure the clearance. Determine with a scale the pound/inch force needed to pull out the ribbon gauge. It must be a certain force. A 2.4D Toyota engine shall have 0.007 inch clearance between piston/bore. Use 0.002/0.004 inch ribbon gauges. If they are binded when pulled out, hone bore more. The piston is placed inside the bore without rings to measure the clearance.&lt;br&gt;
7) Generally for each inch of bore diameter, the piston/bore clearance must be 0.0005 inch of bore.&lt;br&gt;
8) If the piston skirt/bore clearance is to small, the piston will expand and seize the engine when hot.&lt;br&gt;
9)Smear main bearings, big-ends,crankshaft with assembly grease before torquing bolts. &lt;br&gt;
10)Ring gap-size is measured with a feeler gauge. It must be a certain minimum size to prevent the ends clamping together as the engine heats up during operation. The ring gap doesn't determine if the bore/piston clearance is correct. Insert an inverted piston at the top of the block to make the ring absolutely level, remove the piston and measure the gap. Rings in the first stage of 
failure will allow just air and/or a small amount of white gas with it. It sometimes is 
possible to only fit new rings and not new sleeves with first stage ring failure. The next size
rings are fitted to the piston. But the ring gap must be manually resized via a file. Clamp a file
onto a work bench and file of the ends of the oversized ring. Fit the ring in the piston and
measure for ring gap clearance via a feeler gage. Repeat process until all the rings gap-size is
within specs. &lt;BR&gt;
11)A toolshop bores the bore/sleeves to the exact size of the piston skirt. After this the bores are honed to the specified clearance via a honing machine. Insert the piston without rings to test for clearance as described.




'''Suspension check on Toyota bakkie'''&lt;br&gt;
The front suspension consists of: &lt;br&gt;
1) Lower control arm,  bushing and connecting bolt x2&lt;br&gt;
2) Upper control arm x2&lt;br&gt;
3) Torsion bar x2&lt;br&gt;
4) Upper and lower balljoints x 4&lt;br&gt;
5) Tie-rod ends x2 &lt;br&gt;
6) Wheel bearings x2 &lt;br&gt;
7) Draglink x1 &lt;br&gt;
Load 600 kg on the bakkie. Drive at 60 km/h and slam on the breaks hard. If the bakkie yanks to one side, then the lower-control-arm-bushing and bolt are worn out. The lower-control-arm are fastened to the chassis via the bushing and bolt. The torsion bar mounts on the connecting pin. To check the tie-rod ends and wheel bearing, jack the front up and manipulate the wheel - there should be no play. Wheel alignment can't be done unless the entire front suspension is in working order. Check for play on the steering wheel - there should be none. If there is, a nut on the steering box is turned to increase the tension. But before this is done, you must be certain that the entire suspension is order - in particular the draglink and tie-rod ends. 

Unleaded fuel won't damage your engine.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Don't use engine additives'''&lt;br&gt;
Engine additives glazes the bore or sleeves of the block. This results in ring slippage and lost compression
- 'blow-by' past the rings. Don't add it to the differential or gearbox either, it makes the gears brittle and thus prone
to break. Replace gearbox and differential oil every 30000km with the lubricant specified by the manufacturer. Some Transmissions/Differentials use a SAE90 gear oil. Isuzu TD280's gearbox must take SAE30 oil. Other manual transmissions use Automatic transmission fluid, such as the Borg-Warner (Tremic) T5OD transmission. Engine additives is probably the biggest consumer fraud in the automotive
business. The only thing in your engine should be the relevant viscosity oil - full stop 

A certain company that sells an engine additive has the following statement on their webpage: &lt;br&gt;
''XXXX Engine Treatment successfully reduces friction and heat in your engine with its patented technology.''&lt;br&gt;
Of course their product reduces friction - ''by glazing the bore''. There has to be a certain amount of friction between the rings and the bore so as to prevent ''blow-by'' past the rings. A car plant hones a diamond like
pattern on the bore in a deliberate attempt to create friction between the bore and the rings. This friction must not be reduced, which is what engine additives do by bonding with the bore. Each engine has a specific amount of friction that is measured by pulling out a ribbon gauge between the skirt of the piston and bore. The sleeves of an engine block experience severe damage from prolonged use of engine additives.  If the damage becomes severe enough, it may damage them beyond repair, in which case new sleeves have to be fitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WMOG-header}}
Almost any soil will benefit from improvement, and the overall health of the garden both over the long term and the short will be greatly improved by having a good soil to grow from. As a rule, the simple answer to soil improvement is to incorporate [[../Compost Introduction/|composts]]. However, the soil may need particular improvements, as indicated in a [[../Soil Testing|soil test]]. The goal is to create a soil with good tilth, appropriate levels of available nutrients, a desirable pH, and in most cases good drainage.

==General soil improvement==

Improving soil in a general sense (with or without a soil test) is a physically demanding yet crucial task in the garden. As an old saying goes, &quot;a ten dollar plant in a twenty dollar hole will grow much better than a twenty dollar plant in a ten dollar hole.&quot; That saying might be misleading in some ways (current thinking is that putting plants in &quot;good holes&quot; has similar long-term effects as would planting it in a container), but improving the entire garden bed will indeed make for great plants.

The best way to improve most any soil is to add composts, because a soil with lots of organic matter will be much more amenable for growing plants.

These are non-proprietary formats, so they can be read by any vector or bitmap program. For example, if you're creating a file in Adobe Illustrator, and you save it in Illustrator's .ai format, only certain Adobe products will be able to read it. If you save it as an EPS, though, it can be read by other programs, such as QuarkXPress.

EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) supports both vector and bitmap images, and can handle color separations. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) also handles color separations, but only supports bitmaps.

Clip art consists of small illustrations that are not copyrighted. They are either in public domain, or sold with a user's license.

{{fsharpTitle|Basic Concepts}}

Now that we have a working installation of F# we can explore the syntax of F# and the basics of functional programming. We'll start off in the Interactive F Sharp environment as this gives us some very valuable type information, which helps get to grips with what is actually going on in F#. Open F# interactive from the start menu, or open a command-line prompt and type &lt;code&gt;fsi&lt;/code&gt;.

== Major Features ==

=== Fundamental Data Types and Type System ===
In computer programming, every piece of data has a ''type'', which, predictably, describes the type of data a programmer is working with. In F#, the fundamental data types are:

F# is a fully object-oriented language, using an object model based on the .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). As such, it has a single-inheritance, multiple interface object model, and allows programmers to declare classes, interfaces, and abstract classes. Notably, it has full support for generic class, interface, and function definitions; however, it lacks some OO features found in other languages, such as mixins and multiple inheritance.

F# also provides a unique array of data structures built directly into the syntax of the language, which include:
* Unit, the datatype with only one value, equivalent to &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; in C-style languages.
* [[F Sharp Programming/Tuples and Records|Tuple types]], which are ad hoc data structures that programmers can use to group related values into a single object.
* [[F Sharp Programming/Tuples and Records#Defining_Records|Record types]], which are similar to tuples, but provide named fields to access data held by the record object.
* [[F Sharp Programming/Discriminated Unions|Discriminated unions]], which are used to create very well-defined type hierarchies and hierarchical data structures.
* [[F Sharp Programming/Lists|Lists]], [[F Sharp Programming/Sets and Maps#Maps|Maps]], and [[F Sharp Programming/Sets and Maps|Sets]], which represent immutable versions of a stack, hashtable, and set data structures, respectively.
* [[F Sharp Programming/Sequences|Sequences]], which represent a lazy list of items computed on-demand.
* [[F_Sharp_Programming/Computation_Expressions|Computation expressions]], which serve the same purpose as monads in Haskell, allowing programmers to write continuation-style code in an imperative style.

All of these features will be further enumerated and explained in later chapters of this book.

F# is a statically typed language, meaning that the compiler knows the datatype of variables and functions at compile time. F# is also strongly typed, meaning that a variable bound to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s cannot be rebound to &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s at some later point; an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; variable is forever tied to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; data.

Unlike C# and VB.Net, F# does not perform implicit casts, not even safe conversions (such as converting an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;int64&lt;/code&gt;). F# requires explicit casts to convert between datatypes, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let x = 5;;

val x : int = 5

&gt; let y = 6L;;

val y : int64 = 6L

&gt; let z = x + y;;

  let z = x + y;;
  ------------^

stdin(5,13): error FS0001: The type 'int64' does not match the type 'int'
&gt; let z = (int64 x) + y;;

val z : int64 = 11L&lt;/source&gt;
The mathematical operators &lt;code&gt;+, -, /, *,&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; are overloaded to work with different datatypes, but they require arguments on each side of the operator to have the same datatype. We get an error trying to add an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; to an &lt;code&gt;int64&lt;/code&gt;, so we have to cast one of our variables above to the other's datatype before the program will successfully compile.

=== Type Inference ===
Unlike many other strongly typed languages, F# often does not require programmers to use type annotations when declaring functions and variables. Instead, F# attempts to work out the types for you, based on the way that variables are used in code.

For example, let's take this function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let average a b = (a + b) / 2.0&lt;/source&gt;

We have not used any type annotations: that is, we have not explicitly told the compiler the data type of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, nor have we indicated the type of the function's return value. If F# is a strongly, statically typed language, how does the compiler know  the datatype of anything beforehand? That's easy, it uses simple deduction:

* The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operators are overloaded to work on different datatypes, but it defaults to integer addition and integer division without any extra information.
* &lt;code&gt;(a + b) / '''2.0'''&lt;/code&gt;, the value in bold has the type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;. Since F# doesn't perform implicit casts, and it requires arguments on both sides of a math operator to have the same datatype, the value &lt;code&gt;(a + b)&lt;/code&gt; must return a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; as well.
* The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator only returns &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; when both arguments on each side of the operator are &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s, so &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; must be &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s as well.
* Finally, since the return value of &lt;code&gt;float / float&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;average&lt;/code&gt; function must return a float.

This process is called type-inference. On most occasions, F# will be able to work out the types of data on its own without requiring the programmer to explicitly write out type annotations. This works just as well for small programs as large programs, and it can be a tremendous time-saver.

On those occasions where F# cannot work out the types correctly, the programmer can provide explicit annotations to guide F# in the right direction. For example, as mentioned above, math operators default to operations on integers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let add x y = x + y;;
val add : int -&gt; int -&gt; int&lt;/source&gt;
In absence of other information, F# determines that &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; takes two integer and returns another integer. If we wanted to use &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s instead, we'd write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let add (x : float) (y : float) = x + y;;
val add : float -&gt; float -&gt; float&lt;/source&gt;

=== Pattern Matching ===
F#'s pattern matching is ''similar'' to an &lt;code&gt;if... then&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; construct in other languages, but is much more powerful. Pattern matching allows a programmer to decompose data structures into their component parts. It matches values based on the ''shape'' of the data structure, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Proposition =  // type with possible expressions ... note recursion for all expressions except True
    | True          // essentially this is defining boolean logic
    | Not of Proposition
    | And of Proposition * Proposition
    | Or of Proposition * Proposition
    
let rec eval x =
    match x with
    | True -&gt; true // syntax: Pattern-to-match -&gt; Result
    | Not(prop) -&gt; not (eval prop)
    | And(prop1, prop2) -&gt; (eval prop1) &amp;&amp; (eval prop2)
    | Or(prop1, prop2) -&gt; (eval prop1) || (eval prop2)
    
let shouldBeFalse = And(Not True, Not True)
    
let shouldBeTrue = Or(True, Not True)
    
let complexLogic = 
    And(And(True,Or(Not(True),True)),
        Or(And(True, Not(True)), Not(True)) )
        
printfn &quot;shouldBeFalse: %b&quot; (eval shouldBeFalse)    // prints False
printfn &quot;shouldBeTrue: %b&quot; (eval shouldBeTrue)      // prints True
printfn &quot;complexLogic: %b&quot; (eval complexLogic)      // prints False&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; method uses pattern matching to recursively traverse and evaluate the abstract syntax tree. The &lt;code&gt;rec&lt;/code&gt; keyword marks the function as recursive. Pattern matching will be explained in more detail in later chapters of this book.

== Functional Programming Contrasted with Imperative Programming ==
F# is a mixed-paradigm language: it supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional styles of writing code, with heaviest emphasis on the latter.

=== Immutable Values vs Variables ===

The first mistake a newcomer to functional programming makes is thinking that the ''let'' construct is equivalent to assignment. Consider the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let a = 1
(* a is now 1 *)
let a = a + 1
(* in F# this throws an error:  Duplicate definition of value 'a' *)
&lt;/source&gt;

On the surface, this looks exactly like the familiar imperative pseudocode:

  a = 1
  // a is 1
  a = a + 1
  // a is 2

However, the nature of the F# code is very different. Every ''let'' construct introduces a new scope, and binds symbols to values in that scope. If execution escapes this introduced scope, the symbols are restored to their original meanings. This is clearly not identical to variable state mutation with assignment. 

To clarify, let us desugar the F# code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let a = 1 in  
  ((* a stands for 1 here *);
   (let a = (* a still stands for 1 here *) a + 1 in (* a stands for 2 here *));
   (* a stands for 1 here, again *))
&lt;/source&gt;

Indeed the code

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let a = 1 in  
  (printfn &quot;%i&quot; a;
   (let a = a + 1 in printfn &quot;%i&quot; a);
   printfn &quot;%i&quot; a)
&lt;/source&gt;

prints out

  1 
  2
  1

Once symbols are bound to values, they cannot be assigned a new value. The only way to change the meaning of a bound symbol is to ''shadow'' it by introducing a new binding for this symbol (for example, with a ''let'' construct, as in &lt;code&gt;let a = a + 1&lt;/code&gt;), but this shadowing will only have a localized effect: it will only affect the newly introduced scope. F# uses so-called 'lexical scoping', which simply means that one can identify the scope of a binding by simply looking at the code. Thus the scope of the &lt;code&gt;let a = a + 1&lt;/code&gt; binding in &lt;code&gt;(let a = a + 1 in ..)&lt;/code&gt; is limited by the parentheses. With lexical scoping, there is no way for a piece of code to change the value of a bound symbol outside of itself, such as in the code that has called it.

Immutability is a great concept. Immutability allows programmers to pass values to functions without worrying that the function will change the value's state in unpredictable ways. Additionally, since value can't be mutated, programmers can process data shared across many threads without fear that the data will be mutated by another process; as a result, programmers can write multithreaded code without locks, and a whole class of errors related to race conditions and dead locking can be eliminated.

Functional programmers generally simulate state by passing extra parameters to functions; objects are &quot;mutated&quot; by creating an entirely new instance of an object with the desired changes and letting the garbage collector throw away the old instances if they are not needed. The resource overheads this style implies are dealt with by sharing structure. For example, changing the head of a singly-linked list of 1000 integers can be achieved by allocating a single new integer, reusing the tail of the original list (of length 999).

For the rare cases when mutation is really needed (for example, in number-crunching code which is a performance bottleneck), F# offers reference types and .NET mutable collections (such as arrays).

=== Recursion or Loops? ===

Imperative programming languages tend to iterate through collections with loops:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
void ProcessItems(Item[] items)
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; items.Length; i++)
    {
        Item myItem = items[i];
        proc(myItem); // process myItem
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This admits a direct translation to F# (type annotations for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; are omitted because F# can infer them):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let processItems (items : Item []) = 
  for i in 0 .. items.Length do
    let item = items.[i] in
      proc item
&lt;/source&gt;

However, the above code is clearly not written in a functional style. One problem with it is that it traverses an array of items. For many purposes including enumeration, functional programmers would use a different data structure, a singly linked list. Here is an example of iterating over this data structure with pattern matching:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let rec processItems = function
  | []       -&gt; ()  // empty list: end recursion
  | head :: tail -&gt; // split list in first item (head) and rest (tail)
      proc head;
      processItems tail // recursively enumerate list
&lt;/source&gt;

It is important to note that because the recursive call to &lt;code&gt;processItems&lt;/code&gt; appears as the last expression in the function, this is an example of so-called ''tail recursion''. The F# compiler recognizes this pattern and compiles &lt;code&gt;processItems&lt;/code&gt; to a loop. The &lt;code&gt;processItems&lt;/code&gt; function therefore runs in constant space and does not cause stack overflows.

F# programmers rely on tail recursion to structure their programs whenever this technique contributes to code clarity.

A careful reader has noticed that in the above example &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt; function was coming from the environment. The code can be improved and made more general by parameterizing it by this function (making &lt;code&gt;proc&lt;/code&gt; a parameter):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let rec processItems proc = function
  | []       -&gt; ()
  | hd :: tl -&gt;
      proc hd;
      processItems proc tl // recursively enumerate list
&lt;/source&gt;

This &lt;code&gt;processItems&lt;/code&gt; function is indeed so useful that it has made it into the standard library under the name of &lt;code&gt;List.iter&lt;/code&gt;.

For the sake of completeness it must be mentioned that F# includes generic versions of &lt;code&gt;List.iter&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;Seq.iter&lt;/code&gt; (other List.* functions usually have Seq.* counterparts as well) that works on lists, arrays, and all other collections. F# also includes a looping construct that works for all collections implementing the &lt;code&gt;System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
for item in collection do 
  process item
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Function Composition Rather than Inheritance ===
Traditional OO uses ''implementation inheritance'' extensively; in other words, programmers create base classes with partial implementation, then build up object hierarchies from the base classes while overriding members as needed. This style has proven to be remarkably effective since the early 1990s, however this style is not contiguous with functional programming.

Functional programming aims to build simple, composable abstractions. Since traditional OO can only make an object's interface more complex, not simpler, inheritance is rarely used at all in F#. As a result, F# libraries tend to have fewer classes and very &quot;flat&quot; object hierarchies, as opposed to very deep and complex hierarchies found in equivalent Java or C# applications.

F# tends to rely more on object composition and delegation rather than inheritance to share snippets of implementation across modules.

=== Functions as First-Order Types ===
F# is a functional programming language, meaning that functions are first-order data types: they can be declared and used in   exactly the same way that any other variable can be used.

In an imperative language like Visual Basic there is a fundamental difference between variables and functions.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Dim myVal as Integer
Dim myParam as Integer
myParam = 2
Public Function MyFunc(Dim param as Integer)
    MyFunc = (param * 2) + 7
End Function
myVal = MyFunc(myParam)
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice the difference in syntax between defining and evaluating a function and defining and assigning a variable.  In the preceding Visual Basic code we could perform a number of different actions with a variable we can:
* create a token (the variable name) and associate it with a type
* assign it a value
* interrogate its value
* pass it into a function or sub-routine (which is essentially a function that returns no value)
* return it from a function

Functional programming makes no distinction between values and functions, so we can consider functions to be equal to all other data types. That means that we can:
* create a token (the function variable name) and associate it with a type
* assign it a value (the actual calculation)
* interrogate its value (perform the calculation)
* pass a function as a parameter of another function or sub-routine 
* return a function as the result of another function

== Structure of F# Programs ==
A simple, non-trivial F# program has the following parts:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
open System
 
(* This is a
multi-line comment *)
 
// This is a single-line comment
 
let rec fib = function
    | 0 -&gt; 0
    | 1 -&gt; 1
    | n -&gt; fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
 
let main() =
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;fib 5: {0}&quot;, (fib 5))
 
main()
&lt;/source&gt;

Most F# code files begin with a number of &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; statements used to import namespaces, allowing programmers to reference classes in namespaces without having to write fully qualified type declarations. This keyword is functionally equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; directive in C# and &lt;code&gt;Imports&lt;/code&gt; directive in VB.Net. For example, the &lt;code&gt;Console&lt;/code&gt; class is found under the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; namespace; without importing the namespace, a programmer would need to access the &lt;code&gt;Console&lt;/code&gt; class through its fully qualified name, &lt;code&gt;System.Console&lt;/code&gt;.

The body of the F# file usually contains functions to implement the business logic in an application.

Finally, many F# application exhibit this pattern:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let main() =
    (*
       ...
       This is the main loop.
       ...
    *)

main()
(*
   This is a top-level statement because it's
   not nested in any other functions. This calls 
   into the main method to run the main loop.
*)&lt;/source&gt;


In general, there is no explicit entry point in an F# application. Rather, when an F# application is compiled, the last file passed to the compiler is assumed to be the entry point, and the compiler executes all top-level statements in the file from top to bottom. While its possible to have any number of top-level statements in the entry point of a F# program, well-written F# only has a single top-level statement which calls the main loop of the application.

&lt;font size=3&gt;'''Oracle XML Reference'''&lt;/font&gt;

Oracle possesses a variety of powerful XML features.  A tremendous amount of documentation exists regarding Oracle's XML features.  This resource is intended to be a cheat sheet for those of us who don't have time to wade through the hundreds of pages of documentation, but instead wish to quickly understand how to create simple XML output and input XML into a database.

'''Other Oracle References'''
*[[Oracle Programming/SQL Cheatsheet|Oracle PL/SQL Reference]]

=DBMS_XMLGEN=
==Overview==
''See also:''
* [http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/appdev.920/a96620/xdb12gen.htm#1025388 Generating XML from Oracle9i Database Using DBMS_XMLGEN]: Official Oracle Documentation.
==Functions==
===getXML()===
Gets the XML document by fetching the maximum number of rows specified. It appends the XML document to the CLOB passed in. Use this version of GETXML Functions to avoid any extra CLOB copies and to reuse the same CLOB for subsequent calls. Because of the CLOB reuse, this GETXML Functions call is potentially more efficient.

'''Syntax:'''
 DBMS_XMLGEN.GETXML (
   ctx          IN ctxHandle, 
   tmpclob      IN OUT NCOPY CLOB,
   dtdOrSchema  IN number := NONE)
 RETURN BOOLEAN;

Generates the XML document and returns it as a temporary CLOB. The temporary CLOB obtained from this function must be freed using the DBMS_LOB.FREETEMPORARY call:

 DBMS_XMLGEN.GETXML (
   ctx          IN ctxHandle,
   dtdOrSchema  IN number := NONE)
 RETURN CLOB;

Converts the results from the SQL query string to XML format, and returns the XML as a temporary CLOB, which must be subsequently freed using the DBMS_LOB.FREETEMPORARY call:

 DBMS_XMLGEN.GETXML (
   sqlQuery     IN VARCHAR2,
   dtdOrSchema  IN number := NONE)
 RETURN CLOB;


'''Example:'''

The following procedure parses the fields in the employee table into XML and saves the XML as CLOB rows in a table.
 CREATE OR REPLACE procedure dump_pcd AS
     qryCtx DBMS_XMLGEN.ctxHandle;
     result CLOB;
 BEGIN
     qryCtx :=  dbms_xmlgen.newContext ('SELECT * from employees;');
     DBMS_XMLGEN.setRowTag(qryCtx, 'EMPLOYEE'); DBMS_XMLGEN.setMaxRows(qryCtx, 5);
     LOOP
 
         -- save the XML into the CLOB '''result'''.
         result :=  DBMS_XMLGEN.getXML(qryCtx);
         EXIT WHEN DBMS_XMLGEN.getNumRowsProcessed((qryCtx)=0);
  
         -- store the data to a temporary table
         INSERT INTO temp_clob_tab VALUES(result);
 
     END LOOP;
 END dump_pcd;
==='''setRowSetTag()'''===
Sets the name of the root element of the document. The default name is ROWSET.  Setting the rowSetTag to NULL will stop this element from being output. An error is produced if both the row and the rowset are NULL and there is more than one column or row in the output.  The error is produced because the generated XML would not have a top-level enclosing tag.

'''Syntax:'''
 DBMS_XMLGEN.setRowSetTag ( 
   ctx        IN ctxHandle,  
   rowSetTag  IN VARCHAR2);

'''Example:'''
 DBMS_XMLGEN.setRowSetTag ( ctxHandle, 'ALL ROWS' );

'''Sample output:'''

This encloses the entire XML result set in the tag specified by the second parameter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;ALL ROWS&gt;
  &lt;ROW&gt;
     &lt;NAME&gt;John Doe&lt;/NAME&gt;
  &lt;/ROW&gt;
  &lt;ROW&gt;
     &lt;NAME&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/NAME&gt;
  &lt;/ROW&gt;
  ...
&lt;/ALL ROWS&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==='''setRowTag()'''===
This function sets the name of the element each row. The default name is ROW. Setting this to NULL suppresses the ROW element itself. This produces an error if both the row and the rowset are NULL and there is more than one column or row in the output.  The error is returned because the generated XML must have a top-level enclosing tag.

'''Syntax:'''
 DBMS_XMLGEN.setRowTag ( 
   ctx        IN ctxHandle,  
   rowTag     IN VARCHAR2);

'''Example:'''

This tells the XML generator to enclose the columns of each row in an AUTHOR tag.

 DBMS_XMLGEN.setRowTag ( ctxHandle, 'AUTHOR' );

'''Sample output:'''

Every row output is now enclosed inside the AUTHOR tag.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;ROWSET&gt;
  &lt;AUTHOR&gt;
     &lt;NAME&gt;John Doe&lt;/NAME&gt;
  &lt;/AUTHOR&gt;
  &lt;AUTHOR&gt;
     &lt;NAME&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/NAME&gt;
  &lt;/AUTHOR&gt;
  ...
&lt;/ROWSET&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Examples==
===Dumping a Query Result as XML===
Sample procedure for dumping the results of an SQL query as XML.

 CREATE OR REPLACE procedure dump_pcd AS
     qryCtx DBMS_XMLGEN.ctxHandle;
     result CLOB;
 BEGIN
     qryCtx :=  dbms_xmlgen.newContext ('SELECT * from employees;');
     DBMS_XMLGEN.setRowTag(qryCtx, 'EMPLOYEE'); DBMS_XMLGEN.setMaxRows(qryCtx, 5);
     LOOP
         result :=  DBMS_XMLGEN.getXML(qryCtx);
         EXIT WHEN DBMS_XMLGEN.getNumRowsProcessed((qryCtx)=0);
         INSERT INTO temp_clob_tab VALUES(result);
     END LOOP;
 END dump_pcd;

The returned XML results will look similar to the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=''1.0''?&gt;
 &lt;ROWSET&gt;
  &lt;EMPLOYEE&gt;
    &lt;EMPLOYEE_ID&gt;30&lt;/EMPLOYEE_ID&gt;
    &lt;LAST_NAME&gt;SCOTT&lt;/LAST_NAME&gt;
    &lt;SALARY&gt;20000&lt;SALARY&gt;
  &lt;/EMPLOYEE&gt;
  &lt;EMPLOYEE&gt;
    &lt;EMPLOYEE_ID&gt;31&lt;/EMPLOYEE_ID&gt;
    &lt;LAST_NAME&gt;MARY&lt;/LAST_NAME&gt;
    &lt;AGE&gt;25&lt;/AGE&gt;
  &lt;/EMPLOYEE&gt;
&lt;/ROWSET&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Positions==
A printing broker is in charge of coordinating projects. A graphic designer creates designs and artwork for a project.

==Copyright==
According to intellectual property laws, software (including fonts) isn't actually owned by the person who buys it. The purchaser is paying for a license to use the software.

Choose contracts carefully. &lt;s&gt;Make sure that printers &quot;work for hire&quot; so that you retain copyright to the work.&lt;/s&gt; If you would like to retain work products from a designer or printer for later use, negotiate this point before work begins. &quot;Work for hire&quot; is work that is created by, for example, a designer, but done so with the express understanding that it is exclusively the property of the client. Paying for work to be performed does not constitute &quot;work for hire.&quot; A job cannon be &quot;declared&quot; as a &quot;work for hire.&quot; This is a specific legal definition and the terms of &quot;work for hire&quot; cannot be assumed unless:
#the job performed fits within a narrow range of possibilities, such as work by a full-time employee or similar or
#the worker creating the work is supplied with the &quot;materials and methods&quot; to perform the work as well as specific directions on how to do the job and (typically) the location to work or
#the worker signs a contract agreeing to create material on a &quot;work for hire&quot; basis.
Obviously, given the large number of factors involved, a contract is the safest way to assure that work that you hire performed is yours and yours alone.

==Planning==
Questions to ask during a project's planning phase:
# What is the project's purpose?
# Who is your audience?
# How will it look?
# How will it be used?
# How will your audience be reached?
# When do you need it done?
# What quantity and quality do you need?

One popular strategy is to start at the end of a project, and work backwards. In other words, conceptualize what you want the end product to be, and then figure out the steps to get there.

'''Prepress''' is the &quot;creation&quot; to &quot;production&quot; stage. It involves word processing, illustration, and image-editing programs (raster or vector-based).

==Quality==
===Grades===
One of the most important steps to a successful print job is determining the right grade for your job. The determining factors are quality, money, and type of job. For instance, items that have a short &quot;lifespan&quot; (such as a promotional poster or flyer) are typically printed on basic or good grade. Everything in a package should be the same quality.

Remember to save all project files for future use.

'''Basic'''

Basic grade uses toner, not ink. It is usually only one or two colors, for cheap, throwaway items like flyers. It is inexpensive and low quality.

'''Good'''

This grade can be made at a print shop (not a copy shop). It may use toner or ink. Used by magazines like Time and Newsweek.

'''Premium'''

This is the grade for &quot;perfect&quot; prints, used for publications that depend on high-quality color (ie, National Geographic).

'''Showcase'''

'''Showcase''' is top-of-the-line printing, suitable for high-quality art books.

'''Legibility''' is the contrast between print and background.

'''Halftone art''' causes fine lines to disappear.

===Resolution===
'''Resolution''' is measured in various ways, depending on the device. Printers use lpi (lines per inch) and dpi (dots per inch), while computer monitors use ppi (pixels per inch) according to the paper size.

==Using color printing==
The cheapest type of printing remains black ink on a white or colored paper stock. However, four-color process printing has become more affordable in recent years. Specifically, if your color printing job is fairly typical in size, paper stock and quantity, you can take advantage of economies of scale by using a &quot;gang printer&quot; who specializes in printing with process inks on large format presses, combining several print jobs onto a single sheet. This sheet is later cut to produce different jobs for separate clients. This type of process printing is often cheaper than printing a job with solid color inks (say black, maroon and yellow solid ink colors). 

==Color Models==

The RGB (Red Green Blue) color model is an &quot;additive&quot; color model. All colors are a mixture of these three hues, mixing 100% of all three colors produces white light and the absence of light leaves black (darkness). The term &quot;additive&quot; refers to the fact that adding color (light) produces a result (a specific color or image). Monitors and most scanners are RGB devices. Most inkjet printers are also RGB devices (despite some having ink sets that may resemble CMYK inks.)

The CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow blacK) process color model is used by professional printers. This is ''subtractive'' color method. In this system, black is theoretically composed of all colors, and white is the absence of color (paper-color). Cyan, magenta and yellow, mixed at full strength, do not produce black. This is a limitation of the pigments used. The closest result is a dirty brown, so black is added as a fourth &quot;color&quot; to allow for a full range of colors to be expressed and to bolster sharpness and contrast of the image. 

Image setters are specialized printers that produce very high resolution output. Typically they are CMYK devices. They can print separations on film which are then used to produce printing plates. Or you can send directly to plate with the new Computer-to Plate technology.

==Color Tips==
Since color is dependent on light, an object which is one color under one type of light will be a different color when viewed under a different type of light. This phenomenon is ''metamerism.'' Some types of light are fluorescent (which is greenish), incandescent (yellowish-orange), and natural (which has a 5000 Kelvin color temperature).

Neutral grey is the best background to view another color.

Color quality, like print quality, depends on the type of publication. &quot;Pleasing&quot; color is used for newspapers, and is the standard for desktop publishing. The next levels are &quot;match&quot; color (used for magazines) and &quot;match original&quot; (used for calendars).

===Terminology===
The '''gamut''' is the color range available to a device. A ''palette'' is a set of colors. '''Chroma''' refers to the saturation of a color. '''Value''' is the tint or shade of a color.

'''Temperature''' is the warmth or coolness of a color. Relatively cool colors are violet, blue and green, relatively warm colors are red, yellow, and orange. Grey or beige are &quot;neutrals&quot;, and are considered neither warm nor cool.

===Printing techniques===
The two major ways to print color are process printing and spot color printing. Process creates colors by printing very small colored dots. Spot color printing uses solid color inks that are either purchased premixed or mixed from base color inks using specific formulas to match the desired spot or solid color. Spot color printing is also used when a job calls for unusual colors like fluorescent or metallic inks. A spot color is usually specified to print a company logos or proprietary material, although it often will be combined with standard four-color process printing, making the spot color a &quot;fifth&quot; color. This combination can be expensive to produce, although it is common in jobs created for corporate clients.

==Photos==
When testing prints, view under &quot;standard conditions&quot; (that is, the type of lighting, etc. you expect to be in the environment where your finished project will be viewed).

Interpolation is a technique that computers use to increase the resolution of a photo. For example, if a digital image happens to have a resolution of 100 pixels per inch, interpolation can be used to increase the resolution to 200 pixels per inch. However, in doing so, four pixels are generated with the data from a single pixel, causing serious image degradation. Some advanced processing technologies, available, for example, in commercial plug-ins for use in Photoshop, can help mitigate the damage to the image. However, the results will not equal starting with an image with sufficient resolution in the first place. In short, interpolation produces sub-standard results in professional terms. Avoid it when you can.

===Quality===
'''Halftone'''

This technique is used for black-and-white photos. It uses one screen.

'''Duotone'''

This technique uses two screens for two colors (typically, black and a color). One screen is used for highlights, and the other for shadows.

'''Separation'''

This technique uses four screens (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to create a wide variety of colors. If the registration of any of the screens is off, the photo will get a cast.

'''High fidelty'''

A method using 5-8 halftones.

==File Types==
* PICT -native Apple Macintosh image format until the advent of Mac OSX when it was replaced with PNG and PDF formats
* TIFF -(Tagged Image File Format) - Contains bitmap images, and supports color separations.
* EPS -(Encapsulated PostScript) - may contain both bitmap &amp; vector images; can only be cropped or scaled. This format is often used for color separations.
* JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group (lossy)
* DCS - Desktop Color Separations
* PDF - Portable Document Format
* GIF - 8-bit

==Devices==
===Scanners===
'''Scanner''' quality is measured in spots per inch (spi). (Digicams use the same measurement.) To ensure a good quality, make sure that pictures are scanned at 1.5 to 2 times the lpi of the finished product.

A scanner's ''density''' (DMax) ranges from 0-5 (with 0 being low density). Most models are between 0 and 3 DMax.

==Paper==
'''Paper''' is usually made from trees. After a tree is cut, debarked and chipped, it can be processed many different ways to make different kinds of paper. It is pulped for newsprint and bag paper. To make writing paper, it must be processed with chemicals. It is calendared (pressed) to make it smooth.

Categories of paper are defined by use (fine, industrial, or sanitary paper), printing method (sheet or web), or pulp content (groundwood, used for newsprint and paper bags, or free sheet, used for writing paper).

===Types===
'''Bond''' is the most common writing paper. It is standard printing paper, and is more transparent than book or text paper.

'''Uncoated book''' is used for books and newsletters.

'''Coated book''' is used for textbooks.

'''Text paper''' (short for &quot;texture&quot;) is used for brochures.

'''Cover''' is very thick paper used for paperback book covers and postcards.

===Attributes===

Paper is rated from I-5 (coated) to A-E (uncoated).

The rest of choosing the right paper depends on aesthetics. Does it have the right look and feel? What kind of texture is good? What level of whiteness do you want? Paper comes in many off-whites, and there are no standards for color. Colored paper is more expensive, and the price goes up the darker the shade is.

'''Brightness''' of paper is a measure of its reflectance. Brighter paper creates contrast, but may contribute to eyestrain. '''Opacity''' ranges from 1-100%. Most papers are 80-98%.

The '''grain''' of a piece of paper can be determined by getting the paper wet and seeing which way it curls. If the sheet curls along the long edges, the paper is &quot;grain long&quot;; if along the short edges, it is &quot;grain short.&quot; This is denoted by marking a line under the dimension that the grain follows (for example, 8.5 x &lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt; would be grain long letter paper).

The paper's weght determines cost. It is sold by &quot;basis weight&quot;, which is how much one ream (500 sheets) weighs, in pounds, when cut to 8.5 x 11 inches (21.6 x 27.9 cm). For example, bond paper is 20# weight, since one ream of letter-sized bond weighs 20 pounds.

'''Caliper''' is paper thickness, and is measured in points. One point = .001 inch. (This is a different point than the measurement used in typesetting. A typesetting point = 1/72 inch.)

'''Dot gain''' is caused by the matte quality of paper. Dots spread as they are absorbed by the paper. The less absorbent the paper is, the less the dots will spread. Glossy paper has low dot gain; this is why higher quality photos are printed on it. (Another factor in dot gain is the ink used. Soy ink has lower dot gain than petroleum-based inks, but takes longer to dry.)

==Ink==
The three types of ink are printing ink (a solid), writing ink (a solution of dye), and toner (a mixture of liquid and solid).

Printing ink, like paint, is made of pigment and binder. It may also contain agents to speed drying and prevent scuffing.

The four ways ink can dry are by absorption, oxidation (exposure to air), evaporation (exposure to heat), and from exposure to light.

Two important attributes of ink are ''viscosity'' and ''tack.'' Viscosity is a measure of flow. Ink that flows easily has a ''low'' viscosity. Tack is a measure of stickiness. Inks that have higher viscosity have greater tack. The faster a press is, the higher the tack should be.

==Press==
Once the job has been fully planned, a proof can be made up for evaluation. This is a preview of the final product, and a vital step in the project.

Plates are used for some types of printing. Light is passed through a film negative to make an impression on the light-sensitive plate material, such as aluminum or plastic.
===Planographic===
'''Planographic''' printing uses a flat surface. It uses areas marked off by oil and water to transfer an image.
The most popular usage of this process is lithography. The term comes from two Greek words---''litho'' (stone) and ''graph'' (writing). (Originally, the plates used were made of limestone.)

Anti-offset powder is used to hasten drying. The ink has a high viscosity and tack. Since it's oil-based, it takes about four hours to dry, and the machine's rollers have to be cleaned after printing. Only uncoated paper can be used.

Problems that arise in planographic printing include ''moire patterns'' (from misalignment), ''ghosting'' (not enough ink), ''hickies'' (particles stuck in the rollers), ''setoff'' (ink's too wet), ''scumming'' (not enough water), and ''picking'' (ink's too tacky,or high print pressure.).

===Intaglio===
'''Intaglio''' is an expensive process using an engraved plate (such as a rotogravure). 

Gravure is the process used to make US dollar bills. It uses quick-drying, low viscosity ink.

===Relief===
'''Relief''' is the opposite of intaglio: the printing area is raised. Simple examples of relief printing are rubber stamps and typewriter keys.

'''Flexography''' is one method of relief printing. It uses rubber plates wrapped around a revolving cylinder to create the impression. An ''anilox roller'' picks up ink and transfers it to the printing roller. This method is often used to for package printing, such as food bags and boxes, owing to the processe's ablilty to deal with difficult materials such as flexible roll plastics (think of heavy plastic wrap). Common problems with flexographic printing are ''halos'' (caused by too much pressure between the plate and the substrate) and ''voids'' (not enough pressure). Art meant to be printed on a flexographic press must be mechanically stretched in the direction of the material feed to counteract the distortion of the printing plate as it wraps around the cylinder.

'''Letterpress''' Uses metal type either on a flat bed or mounted on a cylinder.  The raised areas are inked and the paper is placed in direct contact with the type.  At one time most newspapers where printed with letterpress.  One of the last major newspapers to switch to ofset lithography was the New York Times.
For additional information see the &quot;Pocket Pal&quot; from International Paper Company

===Gravure===
'''Gravure''' printing is an intaglio method of printing in which the printing areas are lower than the surface of the printing plate. The plate is coated with ink and the flat surfaces are scraped clean, leaving ink in the recesses of the plate. The press then uses high pressure to force the paper into the recesses which pull out the ink and leave a surface that can be felt with the hand in the areas which contain printed image. One type of letterpress in common use was created by the German company Heidelberg and, due to the pinwheeling arms that both loaded and unloaded the paper stock from the press, was often called a &quot;windmill&quot; press.
Ref: Pocket Pal &quot;A graphic arts production handbook&quot; from International Paper 15th edition

===Stencil===
'''Stencil''' printing is a method in which ink is forced through a surface with positive spaces (solid material) and negative spaces (openings) which form the image. A simple example would be using a cardboard mask to spray-paint words on a crate or box.

'''Screenprinting''', a form of stencil printing, is the most versatile method of printing. It uses a squeegee to force ink through a fabric screen with the non-printing areas masked with a resist or film. It is often employed to print on shirts, sportswear and wallpaper,but other uses range from glass bottles to metal plates to printing on flexible plastics and complex shapes. Screenprinting can be used to print the resists that form the circuits (traces) of electronic circuit boards. This resist keeps the metal that is meant to carry current from being etched away by the acid bath that removes the unwanted metal from the surface of the board.

===Electrostatic===
'''Electrostatic''' printing is used by machines such as laser printers.

===Inkjet===
The two types of inkjet are CIJ (Continuous InkJet) and DOD (Drop On Demand).

CIJ prints with a series of ink drops. Since the ink is continuous, a switch is used to either drop a dot or deflect the drop back into the ink reservoir. This is the method used to print address labels.

DOD sprays ink when it receives a signal.

'''Imposition''' is pagination on a large sheet press. This large sheet is then cut and bound. This is the process used to print books.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{java:const}} is a '''reserved keyword''', presently not being used.

In other programming languages, such as C, const is often used to declare a constant. However, in Java, {{java:final}} is used instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter provides a brief overview of the use of card tricks when performing.  Thousands of books have been written on the topic of card magic and some of the finer examples are listed below.  '''Note''': Before leaping into performing card tricks, remember the basic principle every magician lives by: never divulge the secrets to your tricks.

== Introduction ==

Magicians have used playing cards to entertain audiences for centuries.  Card tricks with playing cards became quite popular during the 1800's with the rise in popularity of both poker playing as well as cards used in parlor games (bridge, etc.)

It would be difficult to name a &quot;basic&quot; use for card tricks, but the most commonly recognisable model would involve a scenario wherein the magician would ask the spectator to choose a card from a fanned deck of cards, look at the card (while noting it's value and suit) and replace the card in the deck.  From that point, either the magicians shuffles the card into the deck (legitimately or otherwise) - - or possibly even asks the spectator to shuffle the deck, then the magician would find the card.

==How to force a card onto a spectator==
Note the top card of the deck(this is the one you will force). Ask the spectator to cut the cards and leave the top half down on a table. Bring the bottom half and leave it on top of the cards on the table so that it makes a cross(i.e. perpendicular to the other half). You will need about 5 seconds of misdirection after this so ask a question. The card you noted at the beginning and is the top card of the bottom half. Bring the attention back to the cards and lift off the top half. Tell the spectator to look at the card he cut to and point to the card on the table. This force is called the cut cross force and can be performed convincingly even though it does not require much skill to perform it.

{{fsharpTitle|Introduction}}

== Introducing F# ==

The '''F#''' programming language is part of Microsoft's family of .NET languages, which includes C#, Visual Basic.NET, JScript.NET, and others. As a .NET language, F# code compiles down to Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) byte code or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) which runs on top of the Common Language Runtime (CLR).  All .NET languages share this common intermediate state which allows them to easily interoperate with one another and use the .NET Framework's Base Class Library (BCL).

In many ways, it's easy to think of F# as a .NET implementation of [[Objective Caml|OCaml]], a well-known functional programming language from the ML family of [[Computer programming/Functional programming|functional programming languages]]. Some of F#'s notable features include type inference, pattern matching, interactive scripting and debugging, higher order functions, and a well-developed object model which allows programmers to mix object-oriented and functional programming styles seamlessly.

== A Brief History of F# ==
There are three dominant programming paradigms used today: functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming. Functional programming is the oldest of the three, beginning with Information Processing Language in 1956 and made popular with the appearance of Lisp in 1958. Of course, in the highly competitive world of programming languages in the early decades of computing, imperative programming established itself as the industry norm and preferred choice of scientific researchers and businesses with the arrival of Fortran in 1957 and COBOL in 1959. 

While imperative languages became popular with businesses, functional programming languages continued to be developed primarily as highly specialized niche languages. For example, the APL programming language, developed in 1962, was developed to provide a consistent, mathematical notation for processing arrays. In 1973, Robin Milner at the University of Edinburgh developed the ML programming language to develop proof tactics for the LCF Theorem prover. Lisp continued to be used for years as the favored language of AI researchers.

ML stands out among other functional programming languages; its polymorphic functions made it a very expressive language, while its strong typing and immutable data structures made it possible to compile ML into very efficient machine code. ML's relative success spawned an entire family of ML-derived languages, including Standard ML, Caml, and its most famous dialect called OCaml which unifies functional programming with object-oriented and imperative styles.

F# was developed in 2005 at Microsoft Research[http://research.microsoft.com]. In many ways, F# is essentially a .Net implementation of OCaml, combining the power and expressive syntax of functional programming with the tens of thousands of classes which make up the .NET class library.

== Why Learn F#? ==
Functional programming is often regarded as the best-kept secret of scientific modelers, mathematicians, artificial intelligence researchers, financial institutions, graphic designers, CPU designers, compiler programmers, and telecommunications engineers. Understandably, functional programming languages tend to be used in settings that perform heavy number crunching, abstract symbolic processing, or theorem proving. Of course, while F# is abstract enough to satisfy the needs of some highly technical niches, its simple and expressive syntax makes it suitable for CRUD apps, web pages, GUIs, games, and general-purpose programming.

Programming languages are becoming more functional every year. Features such as generic programming, type inference, list comprehensions, functions as values, and anonymous types, which have traditionally existed as staples of functional programming, have quickly become mainstream features of Java, C#, Delphi and even Fortran. We can expect next-generation programming languages to continue this trend in the future, providing a hybrid of both functional and imperative approaches that meet the evolving needs of modern programming.

F# is valuable to programmers at any skill level; it combines many of the best features of functional and object-oriented programming styles into a uniquely productive language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:this}} is a Java keyword. It contains the current object reference.
# Solves ambiguity between instance variables and parameters .
# Used to pass current object as a parameter to another method .

Syntax:
 {{java:this}}.method();
 or
 {{java:this}}.variable;
 

Example #1 for case 1:
{{java|code=
 public class MyClass
 { 
    //...
    private String value;
    //...
    public void setMemberVar( String value )
    {
        this.value= value;
    }
 }
}}
Example #2 for case 1:
{{java|code=
 public class MyClass
 { 
    MyClass(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println(&quot;int a: &quot; + a);
        System.out.println(&quot;int b: &quot; + b);
    }
    MyClass(int a) {
        this(a, 0);
    }
    //...
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new MyClass(1, 2);
        new MyClass(5);
    }
 }
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:abstract}} is a Java keyword. It can be applied to a class and methods. An ''abstract'' class cannot be directly instantiated. It must be placed before the variable type or the method return type. It is recommended to place it after the access modifier and after the {{Java:static}} keyword. A non-abstract class is a ''concrete'' class. An abstract class cannot be {{Java:final}}.

Only an abstract class can have abstract methods. An abstract method is only declared, not implemented:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 1: AbstractClass.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public abstract class AbstractClass {
    // This method does not have a body; it is abstract.
    public abstract void abstractMethod();
 
    // This method does have a body; it is implemented in the abstract class and gives a default behavior.
    public void concreteMethod() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Already coded.&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

An abstract method cannot be {{Java:final}}, {{Java:static}} nor {{Java:native}}. Either you instantiate a concrete sub-class, either you instantiate the abstract class by implementing its abstract methods alongside a new statement:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1: Abstract class use.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
AbstractClass myInstance = new AbstractClass() {
    public void abstractMethod() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Implementation.&quot;);
    }
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A private method cannot be {{Java:abstract}}.

As with many of Black's off-beat 1st move alternatives, this move does not hold independent status as it usually transposes into other mainstream openings. It is certainly not a bad move on Black's part, but it does allow white to transpose into the Pirc or Modern defence by playing 2. e4, so black must enjoy playing these defences or should shy from this move.

White's options are many. Here are the 2 most popular:
* 2. e4 - Pirc or Modern transposition
* 2. c4 - Heading for various queen's pawn games (e.g. KID, OID)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Probabilistic and Deterministic Computations ==

Because half life computations may be either probabilistic or deterministic it is important to consider the difference between each method since each method is used extensively in nuclear physics, chemistry, and medicine as well as in commerce, business and finance. In both cases half life computations refer to the amount of time it takes for one half of the components that make up a group to be eliminated from the group through successive half-life intervals of time. This book will explain both the probabilistic and the deterministic methods of half life computation and show how each method of computation is used. 

=== [[w:Population growth|Growth and Decay]] ===

In the context of time when a group expands it grows and when it contracts it decays. The state of growth or decay is determined by means of comparing the current count of members with a previous count. If the previous count is less than the current count then the group is in a state of growth. If the previous count is greater than the current count then the group is in a state of decay. 

==== [[w:Linear function|Linear Rates of Growth and Decay]] ====

Sometimes we need to know the rate at which a group is growing or decaying. If the time of the previous and the current count are known then the rate of change can be determined by subtracting the previous count from the current count to get the change in members and subtracting the previous time from the current time to get the change in time and then dividing the change in members by the change in time. Thus a previous count of 50 made last month and a current count of 60 made this month means a rate of growth of 10 members per month.

==== [[w:Exponential function|Exponential Rates of Growth and Decay]] ====

Using the example above it can be seen that it will take an additional 5 months to increase the membership from 50 to 100 and an additional 10 months to increase it from 100 to 200 and an additional 20 months to increase it from 200 to 400 at the rate of adding 10 members per month. ''Instead of doubling the number of months each time to get the same increase in membership we can instead double the number of members per month.'' Thus if we increase the number of members per month from 10 to 20 it will only take 5 additional months instead of 10 to increase the membership from 100 to 200 members. If we next increase the number of members per month to 40 it will again take only 5 additional months instead of 10 to reach 400 members. When the number of members doubles in the same interval of time the group may be said to double in size every 5 months and to follow a pattern of exponential rather than linear growth. This also applies to decay where groups which loose half of their members in 5 months are said to have a Half-life of 5 months duration. In this case and in the case of instantaneous compounding of interest Half-life computation is deterministic and the survival of its members does not vary at random.

== [[w:Compound interest|The Deterministic Method - Compound Interest Rates]] ==

In the case of an annuity that is loosing money the half-life of the account may be determined if the age of the account and the percentage of the original value of the account that has survived is known by using the following deterministic formula: Half-life of the account equals the account's age times the natural logarithm of two divided by the natural logarithm of one divided by the percentage of the original value remaining in the account. (In this example the group is represented by the account and the members by the dollars.)

&lt;math&gt; {Half\ life} = age * \left[\frac{\ln \left({2}\right)}{\ln \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;


In some cases, however, [http://www.lbl.gov/abc/Basic.html#Half Half-life] is not deterministic but probabilistic and intended to represent cases in which the survival of each member is random. In other words the rate at which a group looses half of its members varies according to the laws of probability rather than according to a deterministic, stable, absolute, or fixed amount.

== [[w:Coin flipping|The Probabilistic Method - Coin Flipping]] ==

The Half-life of any random activity such as tossing a coin is determined as simply one half of the possible outcomes. Any number of possible outcomes may be represented using the mathematical or computational equivalent of this method. The probability of survival for a group which has two possible outcomes or a Half-life of one can be represented by a coin with two sides where one side represents survival and the other side represents termination. Cards or balls of various numbers can be used to represent a higher number of possible outcomes. Each card or ball in the set is simply marked &quot;terminal&quot; except for one which is marked &quot;survival&quot; and the set is placed into a container. For each &quot;toss&quot; only one card or ball is retrieved, counted if it is labelled &quot;survival&quot; and returned to the container to be ready for the next “toss.” (The container and contents are usually well shaken after each &quot;toss.&quot;) If six balls or cards are used then the Half-life is three. Multiple items with only two possible outcomes may be considered as well by &quot;tossing&quot; each item and counting only the items which turn up &quot;survival&quot; sides. Multiple items with multiples sides may be used as well.

The starting number of tosses is determined (usually 100, but 1,500 is better) and all tosses are completed for the first Half-life period and the number of survivors are counted. The number of tosses for the next Half-life period is then set to the number of survivors that were previously counted and the process repeated until the number of tosses remaining is zero. This process is repeated once for each trial.

=== [http://www.radiocarbon.org/Info/#labs Carbon 14 Dating Application] ===

The probabilistic computation of [http://www.lbl.gov/abc/Basic.html#Half Half-life] is easy to understand when presented in a simple and meaningful way using mathematical symbols and basic computer source code together. The purpose of this example is to demystify and explain the use of [http://www.lbl.gov/abc/Basic.html#Half Half-life] computation in determining the age of an archaeological sample.

The [http://www.lbl.gov/abc/Basic.html#Half Half-life] of [[w:Carbon-14|Carbon-14]] is 5,730 years (plus or minus 40 years). This means that radioactive emission from the decay of [[w:Carbon-14|Carbon-14]] into [[w:Nitrogen-14|Nitrogen-14]] after 11,460 years will be one quarter as much or the amount shown in the table above where ~25% of the Carbon-14 has survived. Why? The transition of [[w:Carbon-14|Carbon-14]] into [[w:Nitrogen-14|Nitrogen-14]] proceeds at the rate of one Half-life every 5,730 years which means that there will be only half as much [[w:Carbon-14|Carbon-14]] in an archeological sample that is 5,730 years old as compared to a sample that is created today. The following is an example of Half-life computation applied to the decay of [[w:Carbon-14|Carbon-14]]. (''Note: the symbol &quot;ln&quot; in the formula's below is generated by the Wikipedia math markup language and stands for &quot;logarithm.&quot; Since there are both natural and base 10 logarithms it must be clarified that &quot;ln&quot; stands for natural logarithms while &quot;log&quot; in the basic code below also represents the natural logarithms.'')

==== The age equation (percent of isotope) ====
:Where '''''h''''' is the archaeological isotope half-life and
:where '''''p''''' is the percent or portion of the isotope in the archaeological sample where
:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac {1}{{2^n}}&lt;/math&gt; and 
:where '''''n''''' is defined by the ratio of the age of the archaeological sample and the isotope half-life
:&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{age\ of\ archaeological\ sample\ }{half\ life\ } &lt;/math&gt; or
:where the number of isotope half lives in the archaeological sample are defined by
:&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{\ln \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)}{\ln \left({2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:and where '''''age''''' of an archaeological sample is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt; age=h*n\ &lt;/math&gt;

'''''Specifically:'''''

:Where '''''h''''' is the half-life of Carbon 14: 
:&lt;math&gt; h=5730\ &lt;/math&gt;
:and 
:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{1}{2^{\left({\frac{11,460}{5,730}}\right)}} &lt;/math&gt;
:and the percent or portion of Carbon-14 in the archaeological sample is 25%:
:&lt;math&gt; p=.25\ &lt;/math&gt; 
:and the number of Carbon-14 half lives equal to:
:&lt;math&gt; 2 = \frac{\ln \left(\frac{1}{.25}\right)}{\ln \left({2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:then the '''age''' of the archaeological sample will be:

:&lt;math&gt; 11,460 =5730 * 2\ &lt;/math&gt;   ''years''

'''Basic language computer code'''

 Option Explicit
 Dim h As Double, p As Double, n As Double, age As Double
 Private Sub Form_Load()
 h = 5730
 'Where h is the Half-life of Carbon 14
 p = 0.25
 '(where p is the percent or portion of Carbon-14 in the archaeological sample) and defined by'
 'p = 1 / (2 ^ n)
 'and n is defined as the number of half lives
 n = log(1/p) / log(2)
 'and age of the archaeological sample is defined as
 age = h * n
 Debug.Print &quot;Half-life&quot;, &quot;Percent&quot;, &quot;Half-lives&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;
 Debug.Print h, p, n, age
 End Sub

=== Other methods ===

==== The age equation (isotope proportions) ====

Considering that radioactive parent elements decay to stable daughter elements [http://www.gpc.edu/~pgore/geology/geo102/radio.htm], the mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time, called the age equation, is [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/radiometric.html]: 

&lt;math&gt; t = \frac{1}{\lambda} {\times} {\ln \left(1+\frac{D}{P}\right)}

&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; t = &lt;/math&gt;age of the sample

&lt;math&gt; D = &lt;/math&gt;number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the sample

&lt;math&gt; P = &lt;/math&gt;number of atoms of the parent isotope in the sample

&lt;math&gt; \lambda = &lt;/math&gt;decay constant of the parent isotope

&lt;math&gt; \ln = &lt;/math&gt;natural logarithm

where

[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DecayConstant.html &lt;math&gt; {\lambda} = \frac{\ln (2)}{t_{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;] 

The decay constant (or [http://cse.cosm.sc.edu/hses/AbsolDat/pages/decay.htm ''rate of decay'']) is the fraction of a number of atoms of a radioactive nuclide that disintegrates in a unit of time. The decay constant is inversely proportional to the radioactive [[Wikipedia:Half-life|half-life]].[http://www.fda.gov/oc/ocm/radplan.html#tab2]

and 

&lt;math&gt; t_{1/2} = &lt;/math&gt; half-life of the parent isotope, which can be obtained from tables such as the one given in  [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/radiometric.html]:

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Note that many members of the Black Family appear in this series. This article will only briefly touch on all known Black family members. For more discussion of the Black family, see the articles on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa (Black) Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix (Black) Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda (Black) Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Orion Black|Orion Black]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Walburga Black]]. Although [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], Narcissa's son, is related to the Black family through Narcissa, we will not include him directly in this article.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], as he brings the infant [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], says that he had borrowed young Sirius Black's flying motorcycle.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry finds out that Sirius Black has escaped from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] to find him, and it is widely believed Sirius' purpose is to kill Harry. He then finds out that Sirius was his father's best friend, and his godfather. Harry later finds out that actually it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], actually an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] wizard named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], that betrayed Harry's parents, and that he framed Sirius. Pettigrew, one of Sirius' purported victims, manages to escape before his continuing existence can be proved to the satisfaction of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], so Sirius remains a wanted fugitive.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Needing advice about dreams he is having, and about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], Harry contacts Sirius using Owl Post, and Sirius answers by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo Powder]]. Sirius counsels him, both from the fireplace and later in person, having concealed himself via his Animagus dog shape, but despite providing reassurance is not particularly helpful.

Shortly after the appearance and disappearance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]], Harry is briefly left alone in Dumbledore's office. While there, he discovers Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. Experimenting with it, he finds himself witnessing the trials of several [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], including Bellatrix Lestrange, who he feels is quite insane.

As the book ends, Dumbledore has Sirius reveal himself to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], and sends Sirius off to round up &quot;the old gang&quot;. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Shortly after Harry's birthday, the &quot;Advance Guard&quot; arrives to bring him to &quot;Headquarters&quot;. This building, at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], is now the Headquarters of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], and is the ancestral Black home. Harry is reunited here with Sirius, and meets the mad, screaming portrait of his mother, Walburga.

Sirius Black shows Harry the Black family tree on a tapestry in the front parlour at Grimmauld Place. The members of the family that he mentions are Phineas Nigellus, Aunt Elladora, Araminta Meliflua, his uncle Alphard Black, his parents Walburga and Orion, his brother Regulus, his cousins Bellatrix, Andromeda (who has had her spot on the tree burned off because she dated to marry &quot;the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]&quot;) and Narcissa, and Narcissa's son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]. This family tree is huge, and the motto is ''Toujours Pur'' - &quot;Always Pure&quot;. Those like Andromeda and Sirius himself who have dared to consort with Muggles or the Muggle-born have been burned off the family tree, and the tapestry itself is apparently fastened to the wall with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Permanent Sticking Charm|Permanent Sticking Charm]].

Harry and Sirius speak by means of Floo Powder a number of times in this book. Additionally, Phineas Nigellus at several points carries messages back and forth between Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place.

Some time after Christmas, several Death Eaters imprisoned in Azkaban break out. Bellatrix Lestrange is one of them.

At the end of the book, both Sirius and Bellatrix take part in the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry of Magic]], though on opposite sides. Of the twelve Death Eaters who take part in that battle, Bellatrix is the only one to escape, after killing Sirius. Bellatrix is trapped by Dumbledore, but is finally rescued by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Bellatrix (Bella) and Narcissa (Cissy) together visit Severus Snape. Narcissa has a favour to ask him; Bellatrix tries to dissuade her because she does not trust Snape's return from Dumbledore's side. Snape manages, mostly, to reassure Bellatrix, though he does mention that her value to Voldemort and her position in his councils has not been improved by the fiasco at the Ministry. After warning Narcissa that Voldemort prohibits discussion of missions between Death Eaters, Snape notes that he was already aware of Draco's mission, which is never clearly stated, and agrees to help him. He further reinforces his statements to Bellatrix about his loyalty by agreeing to take an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] to help Draco complete his mission.

Barely a fortnight into the summer, Professor Dumbledore visits [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley house]] to pick up Harry, and while there he tells Harry what he has inherited from Sirius. It appears Sirius left Harry everything he owns, including the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black at Grimmauld Place, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]] belonging to the house.

Draco's mission, it turns out, has been in part to arrange a secret entrance to Hogwarts. Having managed that, Draco waits until Dumbledore is away from the school, then leads a large number of Death Eaters into the school. Among their number is Bellatrix, who we see at one point taunting the weakened Dumbledore, and at another point dueling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].

The locket that Dumbledore retrieved from the lake in the cave bears a note signed by one &quot;R. A. B.&quot; It was believed, following the publication of this book, that the mysterious R. A. B. was Regulus Black; this was confirmed in the next book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We see Bellatrix and Narcissa in council with Voldemort, where it has become apparent, by the location where they are seated, that both have fallen out of favour with the Dark Lord. Bellatrix is also part of the group of Death Eaters who attack the seven Harry Potters in the escape from Privet Drive; she targets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], her own niece.

Having returned to Grimmauld Place, Harry recalls a locket that had been discarded two years earlier and guesses that it could be the locket Dumbledore had been trying to retrieve from the cave in the previous book. Summoning Kreacher, Harry discovers that Voldemort had borrowed Kreacher from Regulus in order to place the locket in the cave. On discovering what Voldemort had done, Regulus then returned to the cave with Kreacher, told Kreacher to take the locket and destroy it, and then drank the potion protecting the locket, afterwards being dragged to his death in the lake when he tried to quench the thirst caused by the potion. Kreacher remains distraught because he is unable to follow his master's final wishes, especially now as the locket has been stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]. Harry reveals that he has the same mission, to retrieve and destroy the locket, and gives Kreacher the locket Dumbledore had retrieved from the potion; Kreacher, as a result, becomes fervently loyal to Harry.

Captured by Snatchers, disguised hastily by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and brought to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Harry is faced by Bellatrix and Narcissa, who try to identify him. Bellatrix recognizes the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], and states that summoning Voldemort before they know where the Sword came from would be fatal. She questions Hermione, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]], finally accepting Hermione's story that the sword is a fake. Harry and Ron manage, with the help of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], to rescue Harry, Griphook, and the other prisoners, but in the process Dobby is murdered by a dagger thrown by Bellatrix.

After their escape, Harry mentions that, as they had overheard earlier that the Sword had been moved to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], Bellatrix' recognizing the Sword indicates that it had gone into her vault at Gringotts, and her fear suggested strongly that there was something else in there that Voldemort treasured. Harry guesses, correctly, that this is one of Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|horcruxes]], and determines to break into Gringotts and destroy it. To do this, Hermione disguises herself as Bellatrix, and using her captured wand as identification, manages to get the Trio into the deep vaults.

Both Narcissa and Bellatrix take part in the final battle at Hogwarts. After Harry's and Voldemort's souls return from the Waystation, Bellatrix rushes to help Voldemort, who brushes her off while ordering Narcissa to see if Harry is truly dead. Harry is not, and Narcissa can't help noticing this; she asks Harry if Draco is still alive. Harry replies that he is, and Narcissa lies to Voldemort, saying Harry is dead so Voldemort will not re-open the battle on the school. Battle is rejoined, however, and eventually Bellatrix is killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], who is defending her daughter Ginny.

We see later that Narcissa has survived the battle, and we are told that Andromeda Tonks had stayed at home to care for the infant Teddy.

== Strengths ==

The Black family seemed to have considerable magical strength. We see that Bellatrix (Lestrange) is an extremely powerful witch, and Sirius is quite able to hold his own with the other Marauders. It is also mentioned that Sirius' father had strengthened the protective spells on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], which we expect would take a rare strength, that building being so old and well-established.

Much of the perceived strength of character in the Black family was based on a belief in their own superiority due to being pure-blood wizards. While this may have made them appear stronger, it carries with it all the less savory aspects of nobility (looking down on others, treatment of those not blessed with pure blood as menials or subhuman) and so does not count particularly in their favour.

== Weaknesses ==

There seems to have been a strain of mental instability that is expressed in the Black blood line. We see this to a great extent in the portrait of Sirius' mother, and in Bellatrix Lestrange, and to a lesser extent in Sirius himself. We can only speculate that this is at least in part due to the Black belief in pure-blood strength, and the resulting in-breeding; we will note in the Black family tree that both Sirius' parents are descended from Phineas Nigellus Black. 

The Blacks seemed to have a surprisingly short life span for wizards. Most of the later generations were female and, with the death of Sirius near the end of ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', the family name came to an end. The blood-line continues, however, through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], child of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda (Black) Tonks]], and through Tonks' child, Teddy; and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], son of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa (Black) Malfoy]].

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Family tree drawing (note: pending redrafting of the tree, we are using a Portuguese image, hence the odd spellings of the names):

[[Image:Harry Potter_Black Tree.jpg|600x600px]]

== Analysis ==

If nothing else, the Black family tree details just how inbred and intermarried the &quot;pureblood&quot; Wizards are – both of Sirius' parents are descended from Phineas Nigellus and his wife Ursula Flint. One point of interest is that Dorea Black married Charlus Potter, and they had one son – could that be James Potter, Harry's father? James was born, we think, about 1959, when Dorea would have been about 40, which is possible; though it is equally possible that Charlus is James' grandfather. Sirius did mention that he spent rather a lot of time over at James' parent's, presumably because he didn't get along with his parents; it's possible that James' mother was his aunt or great-aunt. The Family Tree would not show James Potter in any event, as he had committed the cardinal sin (in the Black family estimation) of marrying the Muggle-born [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]].

It is curious that Harry did not see, or did not see fit to comment on, the presence of his own family name, when he saw the House of Black tapestry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

Other interesting names appear in this tapestry as well. Callidora, who was born in 1915 and is still alive, married Harfang Longbottom; what relationship are they to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]? Lucretia (1925 - 1992) married Ignatius Prewett; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] gave this name to her son Percy as his middle name as it was her uncle's name. Charis (1919 - 1973) married one Caspar Crouch: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch Sr.]]'s brother, perhaps? And Septimus Weasley, who apparently married Cedrella Black (burn-mark 4), is almost certainly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s grandfather.

Burn-mark 7, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] &quot;who married Muggle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]&quot;, is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]]' mother; Ted Tonks is not a Muggle, though he was Muggle-born. Tonks did mention that she was related to the Black family.

== General Overview ==

'''''St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries''''' is the wizard's hospital founded by Mungo Bonham. It is located in London.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While we don't actually see the hospital in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], it is mentioned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s parents are long-term residents of St. Mungo's Hospital.

To Muggles, the hospital appears to be the store Purge and Dowse Ltd., which is &quot;Closed for Refurbishment&quot;. Wizards and witches working in this hospital, who work directly with the patients, are called ''Healers''; they can be recognized by their lime green robes. The hospital can treat a wide range of magic-related illnesses and injuries.

'''Floor Guide''' (as it appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]):

*ARTIFACT ACCIDENTS...................... Ground Floor
(Cauldron explosion, wand backfiring, broom crashes, etc.)

*CREATURE-INDUCED INJURIES............... First Floor
(Bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc.)

*MAGICAL BUGS............................. Second Floor
(Contagious maladies, e.g. dragon pox, vanishing sickness, scrofungulus)

*POTION AND PLANT POISONING.............. Third Floor
(Rashes, regurgitation, uncontrollable giggling, etc.)

*SPELL DAMAGE............................ Fourth Floor
(Unliftable jinxes, hexes, and incorrectly applied charms, etc.)

*VISITOR'S TEAROOM AND HOSPITAL SHOP..... Fifth Floor

If you are unsure where to go, incapable of normal speech, or unable to&lt;br /&gt;
remember why you are here, our Welcome Witch will be pleased to help.

In ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] is taken to St. Mungo's after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] reports seeing him attacked by a snake. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] visit him there, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]]. Mr. Weasley is in a ward with other people who have received bites from magical creatures, including a werewolf and a woman who won't say what had bitten her.

When Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and the Twins return to St. Mungo's some time later to visit again, Ginny and the Trio end up on the wrong floor of the hospital. There, they find the long-term spell damage patients, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|one-time Professor Lockhart]], still suffering from his own mis-fired [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory charm]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Broderick Bode]]. They also run into Neville and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother Augusta,]] there visiting Neville's parents.

Broderick Bode later dies in the hospital when a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Devil's Snare|Devil's Snare]] which had been sent to him as a pot plant (US: potted plant) strangles him. The hospital is unable to explain how a Devil's Snare could have been accepted.

We actually only enter St. Mungo's in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. We do hear of it in many places, though; in particular, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] goes to St. Mungo's after she has been hit by multiple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunners]] during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge's]] attempt to arrest [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] is sent to St. Mungo's to recover after she touches a jinxed necklace, and it is said that Neville's grandmother had put the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] in St. Mungo's when he had tried to arrest her. In addition, it is mentioned that if Professor Dumbledore's sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] had been injured, she should have gone to St. Mungo's; the apparent fact that she did not lends weight to the belief that there was something shameful wrong with her.

It is during the Trio's attempt to find the tea shop that we hear a portrait of an ancient Healer chasing Ron around the stairwell, diagnosing him with Spattergroit. While we believe this to be a fictional or archaic disease, like &quot;the vapours&quot; in the Muggle world, we will see later that it is a very real disease, but luckily one that is not commonly encountered.

== Analysis ==

As it is a hospital, the intent is to care for people while they heal, so there should not be any permanent residents, only those who are taking longer to heal than others. We do see one ward for people with long-term spell damage, and see four people there that are mentioned elsewhere in the series: Gilderoy Lockhart, Broderick Bode, and Frank and Alice Longbottom. These four, among others, could be considered long-term residents of the hospital, but attempts are being made to return Bode and Lockhart to a more normal life.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is actually the presence of the long-term ward at St. Mungo's that explains why [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra, Ariana's mother]] was so reluctant to take her to St. Mungo's when she was injured by the Muggle boys. Kendra was certain that the Healers at the hospital would deem her a long-term case and effectively lock her up in a ward similar to the one where we find Lockhart and the others, dooming her to a life away from her family, with only visits from her parents and brothers for company. The earlier description of the Longbottoms' case, and our visit to their ward, reinforces for us the idea that magic is not a panacea, it cannot cure all ailments, particularly those that are caused by magic. Having seen the long-term care ward and its denizens, we start to understand Kendra's fear, and understand also her willingness to take care of Ariana herself, even at the risk of having Ariana believed to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]], rather than risk losing her to the bureaucracy of the hospital.

== Overview ==

The '''''Ministry of Magic''''' is the government body of the wizarding world in Britain, and has physical offices in London, apparently deep underground. In ''The Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter'', as in the Harry Potter series in general, the term is used to refer both to the physical place, and to the government body housed therein. This article will concentrate on the physical location, with events that occur therein; the organization, and its effects, are discussed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|in another article]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear of the Ministry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] comments disparagingly about it while reading the ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|Daily Prophet]]''. However, we don't actually get to see the physical Ministry location until the fifth book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

The visitor's entrance of the Ministry of Magic is an abandoned red telephone phone booth; one enters the Ministry by dialing &quot;62442&quot; (&quot;magic&quot;). While we don't know if it was different before the accession of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s puppet Minister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], by the seventh book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], one of the normal means of entrance for employees is via a particular public lavatory; one opens the lavatory booth with a special token and then flushes oneself to the Ministry. We are told that the Atrium is lined with fireplaces, so we must also assume that there are multiple connections to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]; however, we do not see anyone traveling to the Ministry with Floo powder, though we are led to believe that the toilets deposit one in one of the fireplaces. It is difficult to imagine either [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] or Pius Thicknesse using a public lavatory to go to work, so we suppose that they, at least, are able to use the Floo network to reach the Ministry directly.

We see the inside of the Ministry on three occasions; however, as is to be expected with such a large organization, we actually see very little of the workings of the place.

Early in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is summoned to a hearing concerning his apparent breaking of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|Statute for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]]. He accompanies [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] to his work, entering through the Visitor's Entrance, and passes through the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror offices]] on his way to Mr. Weasley's office. Finding that the hearing has moved, Mr. Weasley takes Harry down to the courtrooms on the level below the Atrium.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 34|Later in that same book]], Harry comes to believe that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is being tortured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] in the Department of Mysteries in the basement of the Ministry, and, along with five other students, flies to London to rescue him. It turns out to be a trap set by Voldemort, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|a battle ensues]], in the course of which the Atrium's Fountain of Magical Brethren is destroyed.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], searching for the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], enter the Ministry in disguise. They have learned that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], a Ministry functionary, currently has the locket, and hope to find some clue as to where it could be. In the course of this visit, we see the floor of the Ministry which is used by the Minister and his close staff, the Atrium, and the courtrooms. One of the areas we visit seems to be a flourishing propaganda production group. In the course of this visit, Harry does manage to recover the locket.

We should note that Level 1 of the Ministry is the top floor, with the Atrium and main entrance being located seven floors below it.

== Analysis ==

Part of the discussion of the Ministry premises revolves around the problem of keeping such a large organization hidden from the Muggles, it being simpler to hide than to explain the presence of a multi-story building, apparently Government-owned, but with no apparent purpose. We learn that the Ministry is entirely located underground, and that one of the issues facing the Ministry maintenance wizards is the underground environment. In Harry's first visit to the Ministry, he learns that the windows spotted around the Ministry do not reflect the outside world, but are fabrications of the maintenance workers, and that a contract dispute had resulted in the windows showing grim, rainy weather for a solid month no matter what the outside weather was doing. We also learn that the maintenance workers have full control of the office environment; in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', it apparently has become fairly common for rainstorms to occur in the offices of those who the maintenance workers don't approve of.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# We see rather a lot of the Department of Mysteries during the battle. We actually see rooms or wings dedicated to three mysteries, and hear later of a room dedicated to a fourth. What are the four mysteries that we see or hear about? What other mysteries might there be?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry first opens a door onto a room full of brains in tanks; presumably this is the Mystery of Consciousness or Thought. The second, the amphitheatre with the Veil, is apparently the mystery of Death. The third, that Harry cannot open, we learn later is the room of the mystery of Love. The fourth is the room of the mystery of Time. Everything that we find in the first room is somehow related to Time. The Hall of Prophecies beyond that is also clearly related to Time. We learn that in the course of the battle, Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] pass through a room containing a model of the planets; this may be dedicated to the mystery of Space, though it is probably more to do with Astronomy, and the effects of planetary position on various spells.

While this is never explicitly stated, it appears from the directions that people travel through the Department that there are often physical  connections between related Mysteries. As mentioned, the Hall of Prophecies is clearly related to Time, but clearly it is also related to Consciousness, and so there should be a door from that room to the brain room. The mysteries of Death and Consciousness are clearly related, and we see that there is a direct passageway from one to the other as Harry chases [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] out of the amphitheater of the Veil. The library area where Harry and the students are cornered is obviously intended for the study of many Mysteries and has direct links to several.

As the circular chamber leading into the Department of Mysteries has twelve doors, one of which is the exit, there must be a total of eleven mysteries. If Space is one of them, we have heard of five, and six must remain, assuming none of the doors are traps. We can safely guess that one of the remaining six is Magic, and that it will be a large and extremely busy area with connections to nearly all other Mysteries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although there are some NES compilers that utilize higher level languages (see references), most NES programming is done using assembly. If you haven't done so already, it would be best to look at the prior tutorial &quot;A few words on assembly&quot;. For those of you looking for more information about NES Assembly, check out some of the links provided below. For the code examples below, I will be using the P65 Assembler, which I believe is the less confusing than NesAsm. Also it is written in Perl so anyone can use it.


== INES Header ==

The INES Header is used to let the Emulator know the specifications of the NES Rom that you're trying to load. The first three bytes of any nes file contain the characters &quot;NES&quot; followed by the hex 0x1A. Note that hex values for the P65 begin with a '$'. After this initial information are two bytes representing the number of 16K Prg-Rom blocks and 8K Chr-Rom blocks respectively. Without mappers there can be up to two Prg-Rom blocks.

&amp;#59; iNES header  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
&amp;#59; iNES identifier  &lt;BR&gt;

.byte &quot;NES&quot; &lt;BR&gt;
.byte $1a  &lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#59; Number of PRG-ROM blocks &lt;BR&gt;
.byte $01 &lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#59; Number of CHR-ROM blocks &lt;BR&gt;
.byte $01 &lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#59; ROM control bytes: Horizontal mirroring, no SRAM &lt;BR&gt;
&amp;#59; or trainer, Mapper #0 &lt;BR&gt;
.byte $00, $00 &lt;BR&gt;

&amp;#59; Filler &lt;BR&gt;
.byte $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00 &lt;BR&gt;


== Interrupt Vectors ==

The NES has three interrupt vectors which represent locations within the program code that the CPU jumps to when certain types of interrupts occur. There are three different interrupts for the NES: The Non-Maskable Interrupt or NMI ($FFFA), the Reset Vector ($FFFC), and the IRQ/BRK Vector ($FFFE). The hex values that are in parenthesis are where the NES looks to find the 16 bit location of where to jump to within the NES. 

Normally the Reset vector will point to the beginning of your code which depending on the number of Prg-Rom blocks you have can be either be somewhere in the locate $8000 to $BFFF or $C000 to $FFFF.

The Non-Maskable interrupt refers to the interrupt that occurs when the PPU refreshes the screen (also known as the V-Blank period). During this time the screen can be updated without any flicker effect occurring. 

Finally the IRQ/BRK interrupt (which I like to call the maskable interrupt) is used when the BRK command occurs. Often it is used by the programmer for various purposes.

'''Example:'''

  reset:
  nmi:
  irq:
    rti

  ; ... more code

  .advance $FFFA
  .word nmi, reset, irq ; words pointing to the location of nmi, reset and irq.

== Programming the PPU ==

The Picture Processing Unit (PPU) on the NES handles the displaying of graphics onto the screen. It consists of four main components to display both background and sprite images: Pattern Tables, Name Tables, Attribute Tables, and Sprite/Image Palettes. The Pattern Tables store 8x8 or 8x16 pixel images that are used to display anything onto the screen. Each of these images can store a maximum of four different colors. The Name Tables are used to display images on the background, and the Attribute Tables affect the colors that can be displayed on the background. Finally there is the Sprite and Image Palettes which contain the possible colors for the foreground sprites and the background image respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|stackalloc}}

The keyword {{C sharp|stackalloc}} is used in an unsafe code context to allocate a block of memory on the stack. 

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int* fib = stackalloc int[100];
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, a block of memory of sufficient size to contain 100 elements of type int is allocated on the stack, not the heap; the address of the block is stored in the pointer fib. This memory is not subject to garbage collection and therefore does not have to be pinned (via fixed). The lifetime of the memory block is limited to the lifetime of the method in which it is defined (there is no way to free the memory before the method returns).

{{C sharp|stackalloc}} is only valid in local variable initializers.

Because {{C sharp|Pointer}} types are involved, {{C sharp|stackalloc}} requires unsafe context. See Unsafe Code and Pointers.

{{C sharp|stackalloc}} is similar to {{C-lang|_alloca}} in the C run-time library.

== Wikiversity ==

Welcome to the Wikiversity project. I hope you have a chance to read some of the information about Wikiversity at the [[w:Wikimedia|WikiMedia]] [[m:Wikiversity/Example|meta wiki]]. Wikiversity is currently a proposed project. The Board of Trustees for the WikiMedia Foundation has previously suggested that the project not be built around a collection of conventional courses. If not courses, then what?

Some thoughts:&lt;BR&gt;
We need to have a system for online learning that respects the wiki user interface. Particularly now when we are trying to launch the project, such &quot;respect&quot; should probably center on trying to build a community of project participants who are going to edit Wikiversity pages and help add content. I suggest that you try to design a &quot;course for Ancient Egypt&quot; that includes many elements that are not found in traditional courses. Think about what you are doing in terms of trying to attract of community of participants who will want to explore Ancient Egypt '''AND''' help you develop Wikiversity pages related to that topic. Learning at Wikiversity should be active. Participants in the &quot;Ancient Egypt&quot; course should become involved in learning-oriented projects. A good first project might be to identify and catalog online resources related to Ancient Egypt, starting with existing articles at [[w:Ancient Egypt|Wikipedia]] and textbooks at [[Ancient History/Egypt|Wikibooks]]. We need to find interesting ways of organizing such catalogs of online resources. For Cell Biology, I have been thinking about an essay that would try to be both a provocative introduction to the subject and a critical assessment of available online resources. This would serve both as an introduction to the topic and a guide to what additional learning resources need to be developed at Wikiversity. Wikipedia and Wikibooks textbooks focus on &quot;the facts&quot;. I think that Wikiversity should also be very much concerned with the remaining unknowns, doubts, controversies, mysteries, and on-going research. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 17:00, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

A '''blondie''' is essentially a brownie variant - a dense cake with butterscotch being the predominant flavor instead of chocolate. Characteristics to strive for include a rich, buttery flavor with good balance between sweetness and saltiness, moist texture, and a golden blonde appearance. This recipe should provide good foundation for further experimentation if you are so inclined.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 c. (240g) [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¾ tsp [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* ½ c. (120g) unsalted [[cookbook:butter|butter]], melted 
* 1 c. (240g) dark [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], firmly packed
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* 1 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]
* ¾ c. (180g) chopped [[cookbook:pecan|pecan]]s

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 325°F (170°C). 
# Dry toast the chopped pecans until fragrant and slightly colored. This can either be done in a dry skillet on the stove top over medium high heat while stirring frequently or else by roasting the nuts in the oven on a cookie sheet while you prepare the batter. The stove top method is faster but requires more attention. It is also possible to buy dry toasted nuts instead of raw to avoid this step. The pecans should be crunchy and nutty, not rubbery or mealy. 
# In a small bowl stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
# In a large bowl, stir the melted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until uniform, breaking any large lumps of sugar. 
# Beat in egg until creamy. 
# Gently fold in flour mixture. When flour is nearly incorporated, gently fold in toasted pecans. Do not overmix.
# Spread mixture into buttered 8&quot;x8&quot; (20cm x 20cm)baking dish. 
# Bake @ 325°[[Cookbook:F|F]] (170°C) for 30 minutes or until desired doneness. 
# Let cool and cut into bars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WMOG-header|Herbaceous Ornamental Plants}}Herbaceous plants fit roughly into 3 categories, namely annuals, biennials, and perennials.

'''Annuals''' are plants that complete their growing cycle in a single year or season. They germinate, grow vegetatively, flower, set seed, and then die. Many plants grown as annuals in temperate climates may actually be &quot;tropical perennials&quot;.

'''Biennials''' are similar to annuals, except that they do their vegetative growing one year, then flower, set seed, and die the following year. 

'''Perennials''' are plants that live year after year, going through regular cycles of vegetative growth, flowering, setting seed, and then returning to vegetative growth (usually with periods of dormancy in between). Woody plants such as trees, shrubs, and vines are also perennials, but are not addressed in this volume.

The approach of this book is to discuss the planting and maintenance of individual herbaceous plants. Over time, there may be many thousands of entries.

== Applications of Special Relativity ==

In this chapter we continue the study of special relativity by applying the ideas developed in the previous chapter to the study of waves. 

First, we shall show how to describe waves in the context of spacetime. We then see how waves which have no preferred reference frame (such as that of a medium supporting them) are constrained by special relativity to have a dispersion relation of a particular form. This dispersion relation turns out to be that of the relativistic matter waves of quantum mechanics. 

Second, we shall investigate the Doppler shift phenomenon, in which the frequency of a wave takes on different values in different coordinate systems. 

Third, we shall show how to add velocities in a relativistically consistent manner. This will also prove useful when we come to discuss particle behaviour in special relativity.

A new mathematical idea will be presented in the context of relativistic waves, namely the spacetime vector or four-vector. Writing the laws of physics totally in terms of relativistic scalars and four-vectors ensures that they will be valid in all inertial reference frames.

=== Waves in Spacetime ===

Waves in Spacetime

We now look at the characteristics of waves in spacetime. Recall that a wave in one space dimension can be represented by

&lt;math&gt;A(x,t) = A_0 \sin(kx- \omega t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; is the (constant) amplitude of the wave, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the wavenumber, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency, and that the quantity &lt;math&gt;\phi = kx - \omega t&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''phase'' of the wave. For a wave in three space dimensions, the wave is represented in a similar way,

&lt;math&gt;A(\mathbf{x},t) = A_0 \sin(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}- \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;	

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is now the position vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave vector. The magnitude of the wave vector, &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{k}| = k&lt;/math&gt; is just the wavenumber of the wave and the direction of this vector indicates the direction the wave is moving. The phase of the wave in this case is &lt;math&gt;\phi = \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x} - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Introductory_Physics_fig_5.1.png|Figure 5.1: Sketch of wave fronts for a wave in spacetime.]]&lt;br /&gt;'''Figure 5.1''': Sketch of wave fronts for a wave in spacetime. The large arrow is the associated wave four-vector, which has slope &lt;math&gt;\omega /ck&lt;/math&gt;. The slope of the wave fronts is the inverse, &lt;math&gt;ck/ \omega&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

In the one-dimensional case &lt;math&gt;\phi = kx - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;. A wave front has constant phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, so solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and multiplying by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the speed of light in a vacuum, gives us an equation for the world line of a wave front: 

&lt;math&gt;ct = \frac{ckx}{\omega}-\frac{c\phi}{\omega}=\frac{cx}{u_p}-\frac{c\phi}{\omega} \quad \mbox{(wave front).}&lt;/math&gt;

The slope of the world line in a spacetime diagram is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;c/u_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_p = \omega/k&lt;/math&gt; is the phase speed.

=== An application of relativity to waves ===

Returning to the phase of a wave, we immediately see that

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} - \omega t =
	\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} - ( \omega /c)(ct)
	= \underline{k} \cdot \underline{x} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a compact way to write a wave is
&lt;math&gt;A( \underline{x} ) = \sin ( \underline{k} \cdot \underline{x} ) .&lt;/math&gt;(6.8)

Since &lt;math&gt;\underline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is known to be a four-vector and since the phase of a wave is known to be a scalar independent of reference frame, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\underline{k}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a four-vector rather than just a set of numbers.  Thus, the square of the length of the wave four-vector must also be a scalar independent of reference frame

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{k} \cdot \underline{k} =
	\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k} - \omega^2 / c^2 = const .&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Introductory_Physics_fig_5.2.png|Figure 5.2: Resolution of a four-vector into components in two different reference frames.]] Resolution of a four-vector into components in two different reference frames.&lt;/div&gt;

Let us review precisely what this means. As this figure shows, we can resolve a position four-vector ''x'' into components in two different reference frames, e.g (''X'',''T'') and (''X′'',''T′''), but these are just different ways of writing the same vector.

This is exactly the same as the way a three-vector has different components in a rotated frame.

Similarly, just as a three-vector has the same magnititude in all frames, so does a 4-vector; i.e,

:&lt;math&gt;X^2-c^2 T^2 = X^{\prime 2} - c^2 T^{\prime 2}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Applying this to the wave four-vector, we infer that 

:&lt;math&gt;k^2-c^{-2} \omega^2 = k^{\prime 2} - c^{-2} \omega^{\prime 2}&lt;/math&gt;

where the unprimed and primed values of ''k'' and ω  refer to the components of the wave four-vector in two different reference frames.

Up to now, this argument applies to any wave. However, waves can be divided into two categories, those for which a ''special'' reference frame exists, and those for which there is no such special frame. 

As an example of the former, sound waves look simplest in the reference frame in which the gas carrying the sound is stationary. The same is true of light propagating through a material medium with an index of refraction not equal to unity. In both cases the speed of the wave is the same in all directions only in the frame in which the material medium is stationary.

If there is no material medium, then there is no unambiguous way of finding a special frame so the waves must fall into the second category. This includes all waves in a vacuum, such as light.

In this case the following argument can be made. An observer moving with respect to waves of frequency ω and wave number ''k'' sees waves of frequency ω′ and wave number ''k′''. If the observer can tell in any way that they come from a source moving with respect to them, then they can use this to identify a special frame for those waves, so the waves must look just like ones from a stationary source of frequency ω

This forces us to conclude that for such waves

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^2= c^2 k^2 + \mu^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where μ is a constant. All waves in a vacuum must have this form, a much more restricted choice than in classical physics.

In classical physics, ω and ''k'' for light are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = c k  \,&lt;/math&gt;

In relativistic physics, we've seen that for waves with no special reference frame, such as light, ω and ''k'' are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \mu^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;

If μ=0 then the relativistic equation reduces to the classical, so we can assume that, for light, μ does equal zero. 

This means that light does not have a mimimum frequency.

If μ is not zero then the wave being described are dispersive. The phase speed is
	
:&lt;math&gt;u_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{c^2 + \frac{\mu^2}{k^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

This phase speed always exceeds ''c'', which at first may seem like an unphysical conclusion. However, the group velocity of the wave is
	
:&lt;math&gt;u_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{kc^2}{\sqrt{k^2c^2+\mu^2}}
= \frac{kc^2}{\omega} = \frac{c^2}{u_p}&lt;/math&gt;

which is always less than ''c''. Since wave packets and hence signals propagate at the group velocity, waves of this type are physically reasonable even though the phase speed exceeds the speed of light.

Another interesting property of such waves is that the wave four-vector is parallel to the world line of a wave packet in spacetime. This is easily shown by the following argument. 

The spacelike component of a wave four-vector is '''k''', while the timelike component is ω/''c'' . The slope of the four-vector on a spacetime diagram is therefore ω/''kc''. However, the slope of the world line of a wave packet moving with group velocity is ''c''/''u&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is also ω/''kc'' .

Note that when we have ''k'' is zero we have ω=μ. In this case the group velocity of the wave is zero. For this reason we sometimes call μ the rest frequency of the wave.

=== The Doppler Effect ===

You have probably heard how the pitch of a train horn changes as it passes you. When the train is approaching, the pitch or frequency is higher than when it is moving away from you. This is called the Doppler effect. A similar, but distinct effect occurs if you are moving past a source of sound. If a stationary whistle is blowing, the pitch perceived from a moving car is higher while moving toward the source than when moving away. The first case thus has a moving source, while the second case has a moving observer.

In this section we will compute the Doppler effect as it applies to light moving through a vacuum. The figure below shows the geometry for computing the time between wave fronts of light for a stationary and a moving reference frame. 

*The time between wavefronts for the ''stationary'' observer, in the ''stationary'' frame, is &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  

*The time between wavefronts for the ''moving'' observer, in the ''stationary'' frame, is &lt;math&gt;T^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;.  

*The time between wavefronts for the ''moving'' observer, in the ''stationary'' frame, is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the world lines of the wave fronts have a slope of unity, the sides of the shaded triangle both have the same value, ''C''. If the observer is moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; , the slope of the observer's world line is &lt;math&gt;c/v&lt;/math&gt;, i.e

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{v}=\frac{cT+X}{X}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this for ''X'' and substituting in give &lt;math&gt;cT^{\prime} = cT + X&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;T^{\prime}=\frac{T}{1-\frac{v}{c}} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

In classical physics &lt;math&gt;T^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are the same so this formula, as it stands, leads directly to the classical Doppler shift for a moving observer. 

However, in relativity &lt;math&gt;T^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are different. We can use the Lorentz transformation to correct for this.

The second wavefront passes the moving observer at (&lt;math&gt;vT^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;cT^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;) in the stationary observers frame, but at (0,&lt;math&gt;c\tau&lt;/math&gt;) in its own frame. The Lorentz transform tells us that.

:&lt;math&gt;c\tau = \gamma \left( cT'-\frac{v}{c}vT' \right) 
= cT' \gamma \left( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right) = cT'/ \gamma &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in equation (1) gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\tau &amp; = &amp; T \frac{ \sqrt{ 1 - v^2/c^2 }}{1-v/c} \\
&amp; = &amp; T \sqrt{ \frac{ (1-v/c)(1+v/c)}{(1-v/c)^2}} \\
&amp; = &amp; T \sqrt{ \frac{c+v}{c-v} } 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we infer the relativistic Doppler shift formula for light in a vacuum:
	
:&lt;math&gt;\nu^{\prime}= \nu \sqrt{ \frac{c-v}{c+v} } &lt;/math&gt;

since frequency is inversely proportional to time.

We could go on to determine the Doppler shift resulting from a moving source. However, by the principle of relativity, the laws of physics should be the same in the reference frame in which the observer is stationary and the source is moving. Furthermore, the speed of light is still ''c'' in that frame. Therefore, the problem of a stationary observer and a moving source is conceptually the same as the problem of a moving observer and a stationary source when the wave is moving at speed ''c''. 

This is unlike the case for, say, sound waves, where the stationary observer and the stationary source yield different formulas for the Doppler shift.

An eclipse occurs when one casts a shadow on another object. A lunar eclipse happens when the shadow of the Earth falls on the Moon, because the Earth is in a position where it blocks the light from the Sun. Likewise, when the Moon interposes itself between the Earth and Sun, so that the Moon's shadow falls on the Earth (and the Sun is temporarily blocked from view), a solar eclipse is the result.

Eclipses occur when the Sun, Moon, and Earth align. An eclipse blocks sunlight headed toward either the Moon or the Earth, depending on whether the eclipse is a solar eclipse or a lunar eclipse. Such an alignment can only happen when the Moon is in new phase or full phase. If the Moon is new, then it's possible for a solar eclipse to occur. During a full moon, there might be a lunar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow falls on the Earth, and the Moon blocks the Earth's view of the Sun. During a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, and the Moon appears to be darkened as we see it from Earth.

As one of the rare and very spectacular celestial events, a solar eclipse is well worth seeing if you should ever have the opportunity. When viewing a solar eclipse, however, it is important that you avoid damage to your vision by taking steps to view the eclipse safely. (There is no danger in viewing a lunar eclipse, during which the observer never looks at the Sun.) The simplest way to view a solar eclipse is to project the sunlight through a pinhole onto a card or a sheet of paper. The sunlight on the paper will form an image of the Sun. As the eclipse progresses, you will see a round &quot;bite&quot; that the Moon's shadow has taken out of the Sun. If possible, you might also find a special filter, which you can look through directly to watch the eclipse. Solar filters make it possible to look directly at the Sun without harming your vision. Be sure to use a filter specifically designed for looking at the Sun &amp;mdash; sunglasses, welder's glass, and other filters are generally ''not'' sufficient. Don't use a telescope or binoculars unless the filter was designed for that purpose. Even near totality, when the Sun is almost completely covered, you risk damage to your eyes by staring into the Sun. Once totality arrives, however, it is safe to look directly. It is also safe (though not advisable) to look for a brief moment at the uneclipsed Sun. When viewing an eclipse, there's no need to be paranoid about the danger of accidentally glimpsing the Sun's surface for a split second. If your eyes catch the bright surface of the Sun, simply turn your head away.

The shadow of the Earth on the Moon (or any shadow cast by the Sun) has two parts. The inner part of the shadow, called the '''umbra''', is the darkest part. If you were to stand on the Moon under the umbra, your view of the Sun would be completely blocked. Under the outer part, the '''penumbra''', the Sun is only partially blocked. This is why the Moon is more darkened under the umbra than under the penumbra.  While the location of the boundary of the umbra and penumbra are precisely defined geometrically, there is no sharp shadow line between the two when looking at an eclipsed Moon. At the innermost part of the penumbra, only a tiny fraction of the sunlight reaches the Moon, and this part is almost as dark as the totally eclipsed umbra. During a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow falls on the Earth, we stand in the shadow rather than looking at it. Observers standing in the umbra see a total eclipse of the Sun, while observers under the penumbra see a partial eclipse.

The present average distance of the Moon from the Earth happens to be just right for the Sun and the Moon to have almost the same apparent size as viewed from Earth. The Sun is 400 times larger than the Moon, but it's 400 times farther from Earth. Because of this, the Moon can obscure the bright surface of the Sun while leaving the fainter outer part, called the corona, exposed. The result is dramatic. During a total solar eclipse, the seething outer layers of the Sun are visible around the Moon. An '''annular eclipse''' is possible when the Moon is near the most distant part of its orbit, a point called the apogee. In an annular eclipse, the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun but fails to block it completely, creating the appearance of a bright ring, or an annulus.

Since it's possible for an eclipse to occur twice a month, once of the Sun and once of the Moon, at each new and full moon, students often wonder why eclipses don't occur twice a month, each time the Moon passes through its new and full phase. Months often pass with neither a solar or lunar eclipse. Eclipses don't occur in these months because the Moon passes just north or south of the Earth's shadow during the full moon. Likewise, the Moon's shadow misses the Earth as it passes through new moon. This happens because the orbit of the Moon is not perfectly aligned with the Earth's orbit.  The Moon's path is tilted 5° to the ecliptic. It only passes through the ecliptic at two points in its orbit. These points are called the '''nodes'''.

Whenever the Moon isn't located at a node, it is either north or south of the Earth-Sun line. Eclipses can only occur when the Moon is at one of the nodes ''and'' at new or full phase &amp;mdash; when the Moon's orbit is positioned so that the nodes are aligned with the Earth-Sun line. This happens about twice a year, at intervals called '''eclipse seasons'''. The time of eclipse season changes over the course of many years, but consecutive eclipse seasons are about six months apart. In any year there are at least two eclipses, and there may be as many as seven, all occurring during the eclipse seasons. There are typically around four eclipses in a year.

Eclipses can only happen when the moon is at a node in its orbit - a point where the Moon's orbit around the Earth intersects with the Earth's orbit around the Sun. If the Moon crosses one of these nodes while it's in the full or new moon position, a lunar or solar eclipse (respectively) can occur.

[[image:Moonorbit_eclipse.svg|right|thumb|246px|
The plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth is tilted by 5° with respect to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the ecliptic. This tilt prevents an eclipse from occurring at every new and full moon.]]

In a lunar eclipse, the observer watches the Earth's shadow fall on the Moon. Observers don't need to be in any special place to see the eclipse, so long as the Moon is visible. Consequently, an observer on the side of Earth facing the Moon will be able to see the eclipse. Fully half of the Earth will have a view. In a solar eclipse, the observer stands in the shadow of the Moon. The umbra of this shadow is small, so only a small portion of the Earth will see a total eclipse. A much larger portion will see the Moon only partially blocked, and will have a partial eclipse.

The Moon will often become reddish or orange in color during a lunar eclipse. The color of eclipses varies, with the Moon sometimes becoming very red and at others only darkening with no change in color at all. The Moon reddens during the eclipse because sunlight filters through the Earth's atmosphere and is scattered into the Earth's shadow. Sunlight reddens as it is scattered by dust and smoke in the Earth's  the atmosphere; this is why sunsets are red. The reddened sunlight illuminates the eclipsed Moon, making the Moon brighter and redder. The color and darkness of an eclipse depends on the geometry of the eclipse and the weather on Earth during the eclipse.

Two phenomena caused by eclipses are the Diamond Ring and Baily's Beads.

Throughout history, astronomers have relied on cycles in their observations. The year, for example, is the cycle of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, and the seasons follow with this cycle, as do the motions of the stars. Since ancient times, astronomers have known about an eclipse cycle, called the Saros cycle. they can be used to predict in advance when an eclipse will occur and what the eclipse will be like.

The Saros cycle depends on three other cycles of the Moon: the time from one full moon to  the next &amp;mdash; the ''synodic month''; the time it takes for the Moon to pass through a node and come all the way around &amp;mdash; the ''draconic month''; and the time it takes for the Moon to come close to the Earth in its orbit, move away, and come close again &amp;mdash; the ''anomalistic month''. In one Saros cycle, there are almost exactly 242 draconic months, almost exactly 223 synodic months, and almost exactly 239 anomalistic months. The Saros cycle is the smallest length of time that evenly contains all of these cycles. This is why eclipses repeat within the Saros cycle.

Stonehenge is an ancient structure in Britain. It is made up of 30 monoliths in the Sarsen Circle. There are 56 Aubrey Holes outside of Stonehenge. It is believed that Stonehenge was used for predicting eclipses.

'''Cohesion'''

Binding interactions between molecules of the same type, mainly by H bonding.

Causes surface tension.


'''Adhesion'''

Binding interactions between molecules of different type, mainly by H bonding.

Causes lungs to be held to the inner side of the chest wall and diaphragm.

*Surface tension = interface phenomenon that arises because cohesion of liquids is greater than adhesion of liquid to air: water molecules pull more towards each other than to air. Thus, water molecules are pulled down and sideways but not upwards. These uneven forces make the liquid surface rigid.
*Surface tension for pure water is independent of the area. Unit = N / m.
*With lungs we use compliance curves = ∆V / V0 versus F / A
*The hysteresis between inspiration and expiration is due to E. loss caused when molecules rearrange themselves. 
*FRC = functional reserve capacity = V to which the chest is filled when no muscular work is done (3 liters).
*Respiratory statics = study of the respiratory system when there is no convective flow of gas.
*Plethysmograph = device used to measure lung volume.

== Properties of isolated lung ==

In order to investigate lungs properties, we will compare 2 lungs: one filled with air (normal) and the other filled with a saline.

Remember that compliance = Strain / Stress = change in Volume / pressure


'''In air filled lungs'''

Have a lot of surface tension because there is an air-water interface in every alveolus.

Low compliance. 
 
More P is required to expand the lung. 

Large hysteresis.


'''In saline filled lungs'''

Have no surface tension.

High compliance.  

Curve is steeper and switched to the left. 

Small hysteresis. Thus, the main thing undergoing volume dependent re-arrangements has been removed.

[[Image:Curvon1.jpg]]

Thus, lung tissue has a minor effect on elasticity (surface tension is the major effect).

•	Elastic nature of lung tissue is due to elastin (stretchy) and collagen (stiff). 

•	At low lung V, both fibers are folded, so lung is very compliant. 

•	As lungs are expanded, more and more fibers are stretched beyond their resting lengths, making the lung more and more elastant.

•	Changes in amount of collagen and elastin cause diseases: emphysema (too compliant), fibrosis (too elastant).


== Lung washings experiment ==

	Lung washings are placed in a square-shaped trough with a dam that can be moved laterally to increase or decrease surface area of lung washings.

	A plate attached to a strain gauge is placed on the surface of the washings to record surface tension.

[[Image:beakon.jpg]]

'''Results:''' 

Surface tension of lungs washings is

	Lower than that of pure water.

	Area dependent.


'''Explanation:'''

	This is due to the presence of Lecithin surfactant.

	This surfactant has hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail.

	The hydrophobic tail is fixed to alveolus wall.

	The hydrophilic head interacts with water, disrupting H bonds, which lowers the surface tension by decreasing the no. of water-water interactions.

	At low lung V, conc. of surfactant increases, so surface tension decreases.

	At high lung V, conc. of surfactant decreases, so surface tension increases.

	The hysteresis between inspiration and expiration is because surface tension is always opposite to lung motion:

[[Image:Surface tension and lung volume.jpg]]

''Inspiration''

Surface tension is directed inwards because water molecules on the alveolus wall are trying to interact with each other. 


''Expiration''

Surface tension is directed outwards because water molecules on the alveolus wall are pulled towards the bulk water outside the alveolus.


This opposite force creates an E. loss, shown as a hysteresis.

== Effects of surfactant on breathing ==

'''1) Reduces work associated with breathing.'''

Work = ∫ P dV

''Without surfactant:'' P is large so work is large.

''With surfactant:'' P is small so work is small.


'''2) Reduces work needed to open nearly collapsed alveoli and avoid their collapse'''

''Without surfactant:'' Work is large since surface tension is high.

''With surfactant:'' Work is low since surface tension is lowered because surfactant disrupts H bonds.


'''3) Stabilizes alveolar size'''

''Law of Laplace:''  P = 2T / r

Where P = pressure inside alveolus, T = surface tension,    r = radius of alveolus. 


For 2 connected alveoli, one small and the other large:


''Without surfactant:''  P of small alveolus is large because r is small and T is constant. 

As airflow goes from high P to low P, the small alveolus will empty into the larger one. Thus, 
- Total lung area decrease (area of large alveoli increases but they are few).
- Less diffusion occurs. 

[[Image:alveoli.jpg]]

''With surfactant:'' P of small alveolus is nearly constant because, as r decreases, T decreases.

Thus, P is the same in small and large alveoli, and small alveoli do not empty into large ones.

Size of alveoli is thus stabilized.

== Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) ==

	It is associated with low-levels of surfactant.

	When a child is born prematurely (28th – 32nd week) lungs do not yet have surfactants. Thus, surfactant effects are absent and the child suffers from the previous problems.

	Disease can be detected during birth by determining the Sphingomyelin to Lecithin ratio of the amniotic fluid. If greater than 2 : 1, child has RDS.

	Note: sphingomyelin is always present in the amniotic fluid (constituent of plasma membranes) but high conc. of lecithin is associated with the secretion of surfactants.


== Summary ==

•	Compliance of the lungs is due to both surface tension and elastic properties of lungs. 

•	In normal lungs, most stiffness is due to surface tension (although it is greatly reduced as area decreases, due to surfactants). 

•	Surfactants decrease surface tension and thus decrease E. loss and hysteresis.

== Mechanics of respiration ==

[[Image:IPP lungs.jpg]]

	IPP = intra-pleural pressure, the dynamics of lung mechanism. It is always lower than the atmosphere (-ve relative to atm). This is to allow lungs to expand: if it was equal or greater than atm, lungs wouldn’t expand and inspiration wouldn’t occur.

	Example: if Patm = 5 and IPP = 2, IPP is 3 –ve relative to atm. If IPP reduces 1, then IPP is 4 –ve relative to atm, thus more –ve. But if IPP = 6, no inspiration (unless we take a forced breath).

[[Image:Curvon2.jpg]]

'''Inspiration'''

Diaphragm contracts and enlarges pleural cavity, which reduces IPP.

As IPP reduces (becomes more –ve), it makes suction of lung walls outwards.

As V of lungs ↑, Palv ↓.

As airflow goes from high P to low P, air enters the lungs.

Since –ve Palv is needed to inspire air, air current is –ve.

''Conclusion:'' IPP, Palv and airflow become more –ve, V becomes more +ve.


'''Expiration'''

Diaphragm relaxes and reduces pleural cavity, which increases IPP.

As IPP increases (becomes less –ve), it releases lungs and recoil forces push lung walls inwards.

As V of lungs ↓, Palv ↑

As airflow goes from high P to low P, air exits the lungs.

Since +ve Palv is needed to expire air, air current is +ve.

''Conclusion:'' IPP, Palv and airflow become more +ve (with IPP still –ve), V more –ve.


'''Notes:''' 

-	Surface tension was thus always opposite to IPP during inspiration and to recoil force during expiration.

-	IPP is also –ve relative to Palv because alveoli are connected to atm by open tubes. 

-	In the curve, Palv begins with 0 (same P as atm), but IPP begins –ve. 

-	If IPP &gt; atm, air current is always +ve (out of lungs) unless we take a forced breath to make maximum contraction, making IPP –ve, and allowing air to enter. 

-	If density and height are given, ∆P is calculated by: ∆P = ρ g h.

== Analogy with Electricity ==

'''1) Ohm’s Law'''

''a) Current''

I = ∆v / R

I = q / t

I = Electric current (A)

∆v = Potential difference (V)

R = Electric resistance (Ω)

q / t = no. of charge flowing per unit time


''b) Resistance''

R = ∆v / I

R = (ρ L) / (π r2)

ρ = Resistivity (Ω.m)

L = Length of resistor (cm)

π r 2　　= Area of resistor (cm2)


''c) Work done''

W = V I t (joule)


''d) Power''

Power = V I (watt)


''e) Series resistance''

As current flows in various resistances,

I1 = I2


''f) Parallel resistances''

As current divides in different resistances,

1/ Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + … + 1/R3


''g) Capacitance''

C = q / v

High capacitance = conserve a high no. of charges (q) for a low voltage (v).



'''2) Poiseuille’s Law'''

''a) Current''

Q = ∆P / R

Q = V / t

Q = Fluid current (mL/sec)

∆P = Pressure diff. (cm H2O)

R = Flow resistance (poise / cm3　　)

V / t = Volume of particles flowing per unit time.


''b) Resistance''

R = ∆P / Q

R = (8 η L) / (π r 4)

η = Viscosity coeff. of fluid (poise)

L = Length of tube. (cm)

π r 4　　= (cm4)


''c) Work done''

W = P Q t = P (V / t) t ----&gt;  W = P V (joule) 


''d) Power''

Power = P Q = P (V / t)

Power = P V / t (watt)


''e) Series resistance''

As air flows in respiratory tree, from trachea to bronchi to alveoli,

Q1 = Q2 ----&gt; V1 / t = V2 / t ----&gt; (A1 L1) / t = (A2 L2) / t ----&gt; A1 v1 = A2 v2

This is the continuity eqn. Air thus flows quickly in small areas and slowly in large areas.


''f) Parallel resistances''

As each bronchus divides into 2 of smaller sizes, and each divides into 2 and so on, forming generations:
1/ Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + … + 1/R3

Note: in most generations of bronchi, the airway R decreases slightly. To do so, each bronchus has to divide into 2 bronchi with r2 &gt; 0.84 r1. (if r2 = 0.84 r1, R is const.)


''g) Capacitance''

C = V / P

This is actually the compliance.

High compliance = great strain (V) for low stress (P).

E.g. C of lungs = 200 mL/ cm H2O.

If it is 50, when IPP makes suction of the wall, it doesn’t stretch enough and there is a problem in respiration.



'''Note:'''

The last table is valid for the flow of air in lungs and flow of blood in arteries.

== Overview ==

The '''''Weasley Family''''' is one of the older pure-blooded families. Many of the prejudices held by and associated with the &quot;old&quot; families are not held by the Weasleys, nor do the Weasleys take pride (or shame) in their heritage of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|pure magical blood]].

The Weasleys' house is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The_Burrow|Burrow]], a multi-story magical dwelling located in the fictional village of Ottery St. Catchpole, Devon, United Kingdom (possibly based on the real town of Ottery St Mary).

The Weasleys are considered ''blood traitors'' because of their charitable dealings with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|muggles]] in general. This is exacerbated when they welcome [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] (a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|&quot;muggle-born&quot;]]) and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] (a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Half-blood|&quot;half-blood&quot;]]) into their home.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Weasley family in general play a very large role in the books; we will simply mention when they are introduced and some small details of the role the family as a whole plays for each book. For detail, please see the individual articles on the Weasleys.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

We see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and are introduced to four of the Weasley boys: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]]. We hear of two others, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], from Ron, and we hear Ron's dismay at being the sixth Weasley child to pass through Hogwarts. A large part of Ron's worries are caused by the fact that so many of the earlier Weasley children had excelled in some way or other.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

We first see the Weasley family and their home as a whole when Fred, George, and Ron extract Harry from captivity in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]'s home. We see the arrival at the Weasley family home, and we get to meet Mrs. Weasley; and shortly afterwards we meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]. While we see Ginny on a number of occasions, she seems to be largely in retreat; Ron comments that this is unusual, in that she ordinarily never shuts up. Ron does not seem to be aware that Ginny is suffering from a classic schoolgirl crush, possibly because he has lived with Harry for so long that he no longer finds Harry's presence intimidating. Ginny's nervousness in Harry's presence does not abate throughout this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The Weasley family meet Harry and Hermione in the Leaky Cauldron in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], where they are doing their school shopping. The events of the previous year have burned away some of Ginny's nervousness, but she still is not entirely at her ease speaking with Harry. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley understand from the Ministry that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is trying to reach Hogwarts, and it is believed his intent is to kill Harry. The Weasleys have evidently volunteered to protect him until he is actually on the Hogwarts Express. They are of  two minds on the mission, however; Mr. Weasley feels that Harry ought to know what is going on, while Mrs. Weasley would prefer to keep him unworried. Harry overhears their conversation, and so Mr. Weasley's platform revelation is not news to him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We meet the remaining two Weasley children, Bill and Charlie. The whole clan has gathered as Mr. Weasley has managed to get tickets for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and apart from his own family he has elected to include Harry and Hermione in the invitation. 

Knowing that Harry's own family, the Dursleys, would not be interested in seeing Harry compete in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], Mrs. Weasley comes to the school to watch, more or less ''in loco parentis.'' She brings Bill with her.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Many of the members of the family are at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], when Harry arrives there. the exceptions are Percy, who has had a falling out with Mr. Weasley over the Ministry's treatment of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], and Charlie, who is still in Romania working with dragons. Again we see that Mr. Weasley is in favour of telling Harry what is going on, while Mrs. Weasley prefers to have him unworried. We see the whole family's joy at Harry's successful defence at his hearing for underage use of magic. And when Mrs. Weasley's attempts to subdue a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]] fail, we see her worst fears: in turn, each of her family members and Harry, dead. This last, as little else could, shows how Harry has become like one of the Weasley children in Molly's mind.

Harry's position in the family is reinforced when Harry has a vision of the attack on Mr. Weasley at Christmas. His quick action saves Mr. Weasley's life, and earns him the gratitude of the entire Weasley family.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry spends most of his summer vacation at The Burrow, happily staying with the family he has come to appreciate more than his own. The only flaws are the presence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] who is engaged to Bill, and who does seem to be upsetting Mrs. Weasley; and the occasional presence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], who seems to be coming around occasionally for solace from Mrs. Weasley, but who forcefully reminds Harry of the death of Sirius.

With Fred and George graduated, the family does not gather much at the school; however, Ron conveys an invitation to Harry to join the Weasleys at Christmas, an invitation that he readily accepts. The ongoing battle of wills between Mrs. Weasley and Fleur does cause some tension, and Harry remains irked by the fact that the twins are able to get through their chores rapidly by means of magic, while he and Ron cannot. However, it is still the best family Christmas Harry has ever had.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

The Weasley family gather together again to provide escape and a safe house for Harry in the days between his escape from Privet Drive and the day of Bill and Fleur's wedding. During the escape, George loses an ear. Harry's birthday, of course, falls into the time that Harry is at the Burrow, and Harry, dismayed at how much work his mere presence has caused, says he doesn't want anything. Mrs. Weasley, however, feels that a wizard's coming of age must be celebrated, and provides a cake and gifts, including  a watch. Mrs. Weasley apologizes for the watch, it had been her brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fabian Prewett|Fabian]]'s. Apparently she had given her other brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gideon Prewett|Gideon]]'s watch to Ron; the fact that she is giving Harry this precious a family treasure is a clear indication, if we needed one, of how much Mrs. Weasley has come to accept Harry as a family member.

All of the Weasley family take part in the final battles for Hogwarts. In the preparations for the battle, Percy comes back to the family, admitting that he was a deluded fool and asking if the family will accept him back; they promptly do. During the battle itself, Fred is killed by falling masonry.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] have six sons and a daughter: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], identical twins [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]].

Arthur's parents were apparently Septimus Weasley and Cedrella [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|Black]], and they had another son, Bilius Weasley. Uncle Bilius was apparently somewhat older than Arthur; he had passed away rather recently, leaving no children.

Molly's father was the brother of Ignatius Prewett (who was married to Lucretia Black), and he had two more sons: twins [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gideon Prewett|Gideon Prewett]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fabian Prewett|Fabian Prewett]].

Another distant relative mentioned is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]]. It is never mentioned whether she is related to the Weasleys or the Prewetts.

== Analysis ==

Although he cannot see it directly, Harry senses a very great contrast between his life in the Muggle world with the Dursleys, and Ron's life in the Burrow. The Dursleys have a determinedly lovely house in a determinedly lovely suburb, with all the right business contacts and all the right accessories, but for all its material richness, it is sterile, even for the people who nominally belong there (Vernon, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. Harry's treatment as an outsider only makes this worse. To contrast this, quite apart from the magic everywhere, the Burrow is impoverished with lots of make do or make it yourself, cramped, and incredibly cheerful. Harry immediately feels at home, this is the sort of family he has dreamed about being a part of for twelve years... and to top it off, they accept him instantly as one of their own. (Although it must be noted that Mrs. Weasley never scolds Harry, that we hear; every one of her own children, and even her husband, catches the rough edge of her tongue sooner or later, but Harry does not seem to.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:else}} is a Java keyword. It is an optional part of a branching statement. It starts the 'false' statement block.

The general syntax of a {{java:if}}, using {{Java:EBNF}}, is

 branching-statement ::= {{java:if}} ''condition-clause'' 
                                     ''single-statement'' | ''block-statement''
                        &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{java:else}} 
                                     ''single-statement'' | ''block-statement'' &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  
 condition-clause    ::= '''&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;''' Boolean Expression '''&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;'''

For example:
{{java|code=
if ( expression ) {
   System.out.println(&quot;'True' statement block&quot;);
} else {
   System.out.println(&quot;'False' statement block&quot;);
}
}}

I have listed this book as a candidate for speedy deletion, and I would like to remove it from the engineering bookshelf. I feel that this book is about a subject that is too specific for most people, and therefore other people won't be able to contribute to it. However, if you would like me to move this content to a better book, such as &quot;The HP49 Calculator&quot;,i can certainly do that as well. I doubt highly that you will see this message before I actually delete this book (since you have been inactive for 6 months now), but you didnt supply an email address, and this is the only way I have to get ahold of you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

I have listed this book as a candidate for speedy deletion, because it contains no valuable content, and consists at the moment of a list of links. [[WB:WIW]] specifically states that pages that are simply lists of hyperlinks do not belong on wikibooks. If you have no questions or concerns on the matter, I will delete this in about a week or less. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

= Amar Opening =
===1...e5===
Refusing to threaten the Knight. Thus, calling White's bluff. A different way, emphasizing the correctness of one's own Knight, might be 1...Nc6. Then 2. d4 is the Mozarabic Opening--trying to put Black's riposte in the wrong equally.

= Amar Opening =
===1...d5===
Threatening to disrupt White's vulnerable Kingside pawn structure with 2...Bxh3, 3. gxh3. But White must want to evoke this outcome, either in search of an outrageous activity of the King's Rook, or a more subtle, Hedgehog-like approach with 2. g3 (and perhaps f3 and Nf2). It could be said that 1...d5 falls into the trap laid by 1. Nh3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Okay, one day I decided that I wanted to do something. This is it.


Anyway. This Logic Brick tutorial is for the people who know the basics of everything but logic bricks, pretty much. Let's get started.

Create a cube. Now in the Logic brick panel (purple pacman button), click &quot;add&quot; for all three of the little panelly things.

But first, here are the descriptions.&lt;br&gt;
'''SENSORS:''' These are what have to happen to play out the actuator. EG: mouse click, keyboard press &quot;H&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
'''CONTROLLERS:''' Best described, these are just a walkway for the sensor to activate the actuator (in 98% of the cases, but don't get confused now...)&lt;br&gt;
'''ACTUATORS:''' These are what happens when it detects that the sensor has happened. EG: animation from frame 1 to 100, movement / 100 places to the left.

In the first little panel, click on the arrow next to the word &quot;always&quot;. (Not the orange one, the near invisible silver one RIGHT next to it.)
Now click on keyboard. In the space next to the word &quot;key,&quot; click in and type any keyboard button you want. Now click and hold on the little yellow next the logic brick. Drag it to the yellow orb on the side of the controller logic brick. What you have just done is linked the sensor to the controller, so that when you link the controller up to the actuator something will happen.

Now, in the movement actuator logic brick, click in the first &quot;dloc&quot; space, and type the number &quot;.5&quot;. Now, link up the broken logic bricks, and voila! You have made your first interactive 3d content. Well, that's what I'm guessing if you've never used any other 3D program that makes interactive stuff, or if you've never made maps in TimeSplitters 3, but what the heck.

Start the game, and press the keyboard button that you entered into the sensor logic brick before. WOW! The cube moved! The cube actually moved in the co-ordination of where you typed &quot;.5&quot;. Those three tiny panels in each of the &quot;dloc&quot;s and the &quot;torque&quot;s rows, are different dirrections, x y and z, with all of the rotation command exceptions and crap or whatever.

Now, let's do something fancy. Do you want the camera to follow the cube when you are moving it? Probably not, but anyway...
To do this, go into animation mode, and add a camera that's looking straight at the cube. Now, in the big panel on the left, click on the camera. Add in a logic brick for all three of the panels (in the logic section), and leave the sensor on always. This means that this actuator is always going to happen in the game. ALWAYS. And yes, you can create an always sensor and a &quot;quit game&quot; actuator, but it's pretty gay, because as soon as you start the game, it quits!

Anyway... in the actuator logic brick, click on the near invisible arrow next to &quot;motion&quot;, and click on &quot;edit object&quot;. With the new options, click on the arrow of the tiny selection pop-up bar, and click on &quot;track to&quot;. This will make the camera look at the object at all times. (Because of the always sensor, of course.) But in the other tiny empty bar that comes up, click on and type in the name of the cube that is displayed in the panel to the left of the screen. Most likely &quot;Cube&quot;. DAHHHHHH! Now play the game, and move the cube. YES! you've done it. Have you? If you've done it right, you will have a moving cube and a tracking camera.

You can make objects other than the camera follow another object, so have fun with your tracking and movement knowledge.

== Overview ==

Like Muggles, the wizarding world obtains and records information through '''''books'''''. They use books for reference, research and information gathering.

Houses of the Wizarding community also have books in cooking, housework and references. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students devote most of their time in the library to doing their homework, and sometimes borrow library books to read in their own common room. Not all books in the Hogwarts library can be accessed by the students. Some of them are in the Restricted Section of the library, and books in that section contain particularly advanced magic and information about the Dark Arts. In order to borrow books in the Restricted Section, students need a signed permission slip from a professor.

Flourish and Blotts is the main supplier of school and other books, and is located in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

== Analysis ==

Curiously, there does not seem to be any Wizarding fiction, apart from the collection of comic books of &quot;''The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle''&quot; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s room. Granted, most of the work produced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] seems to be largely fictional, however it is not classed as fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:extends}} is a Java keyword. 

Used in {{java:class}} and {{java:interface}} definition to declare the class or interface that is to be extended.

Syntax:
{{java|code=
public class MyClass extends SuperClass 
{
  //...
}
 
public interface MyInterface extends SuperInterface
{
  //...
}
}}

In Java 1.5 and later, the &quot;extends&quot; keyword is also used to specify an upper bound on a type parameter in Generics.
{{java|code=class Foo&lt;T extends Number&gt; { /*...*/ } }}

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: ie  → i.e. using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will get you to use two common modelling methods, spinning and extrusion. We will make a mug and then, in the second part, tweak the materials so that it has highlights, reflections and diffusions like a real mug.
This tutorial assumes that you know your way around Blender by now. So long as you've modelled a couple of things before you should be fine.

== Begin ==

*Start a new Blender session and delete the default view. 
*Now go into front view. (NUM1 key)
*Add a mesh circle with about 12 vertices.
*Rightclick on one vertex and delete it to break the circle. You should have a string of vertices left.
*Arrange the vertices into a shape like in the picture. This is a cross-section for half of the mug.
[[Image:Blender_Mugshape.jpg]]
*You might notice I have more than 12 vertices in my pic. To add a new one select the one you want to connect it to, hold CTRL and click the left mouse button (LMB). 
*Try to make sure that your two vertices for the two ends are as close to the middle as you can get them. If they are a little bit off, don't worry we will fix this after we spin the mug. Also, make sure to put enough vertices on the outside. These will be where your handle comes out so if you're going for close to a real thing pay attention to these, although again you will be able to edit them later.

== Spinning ==

*To make the mug 3D, we will need to spin it. In editing tab, see editing tools, under &quot;spin&quot; button, there are three settings. Set rotation to 360, steps to 12 and keep turns at 1. Press NUM7 for top view then press &quot;spin&quot;.
[[Image:Blender_Beforespin.jpg]]
*This is what it should look like.
[[Image:Blender_Afterspin3d.jpg]]
*Now to make it look pretty, see the &quot;modifiers&quot; tab. Add a subsurf modifier and set it to one or two levels. Now press &quot;set smooth&quot; in Links and Materials to make it really smooth. Press tab to jump out of edit mode and admire your handiwork.
[[Image:Smooth.jpg]]
*Now you may notice a crease in the shading of your mug at the moment. Go back into edit mode, select all the vertices, press w and select &quot;Remove Doubles&quot;. This should sort it out. This happens because we spun the vertices 360 degrees, and a copy of the vertices was made on top of iteself. Also, the vertices at the bottom of the mug will not be properly lined up, and therefore we won't have a solid 3d shape at the moment. Press NUM7 to go into top view, and zoom in a lot and you should see a ring of vertices. 
[[Image:Blender_Centerverticestop.jpg]]
*Select only these and press w, select merge and &quot;at center&quot;. They should turn into a single vertex. Now press ctrl-num7 for the reverse top view (bottom). Do the same.

== Extruding the Handles == 

*Now for the handles, which we will do by extrusion. Select any four vertices as in the picture. 
[[Image:Blender_Extrusionselect1.jpg]]
*Press E and pull them out a little with the mouse.
*Select the lower two vertices of the now selected face and pull them up a little using the G button. Now do the same for the bottom.
*Go back to the top end of the handle. Select this face and extrude it again. Now rotate it down, then grab it and move it in a bit. Repeat until you get something like this.
[[Image:Blender_Finalextrusion.jpg]]
*Switch to face select mode and select the two faces at each end of your (nearly-)handle, as shown. 
[[Image:Blender_Endselected.jpg]]
*Now press x and select faces. Switch back into vertex select mode and select the four outer vertices like in picture. Press f to make a new face. Repeat for the 3 other sides until your mug has one whole handle.
*Now you may now be thinking that your mug is too fat or too tall or the handles are too thick. Never worry, we can easily fix this. If you want to make your mug taller, for example, go into side view with the NUM1 key. select everything and note the axis in the lower left corner of the 3d window. Choose whichever is pointing up, then press S then that key(i.e. X, Y, or Z). You should see a line going up, meaning that your scaling is constrained in that direction. Move the mouse until it looks nice. You can also adjust the shape of the handle by moving the vertices that control it.
*Heres a final model. Coming soon, making this render realistically using materials.
[[Image:Blender_Final.jpg]]

== Materials == 
( Unfinished)

*Ok, here's a mug i did before with a simple 3point lighting setup and a plane to put it on. Note the lack of oversampling, 50% size and X and Y parts. All of these will make our render faster without compromising (much ) quality ( though you will want to turn oversampling on for your final render) Also note that the xml option is turned off in the yafray settings, which means that the X and Y settings actually apply for Yafray.

First add a new texture to the mug. Do this by going to the Materials tab under Shading. Go to the color sliders and pick a good color by clicking on '''col''' and choosing one you like. I like white, but you can choose whatever you want. If you want to add a texture, do so by following the guide in [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Quickie_Texture| the texture tutorial]].

Data suggest that 5% of deadly diving accidents are caused by underwater organisms and the majority are preventable by knowledge of the hazards.  Unprovoked shark attacks are well publicized but represent a small minority of injury and death and are responsible for an average of 6 verifiable deaths per year world wide.

== REPLY from Abdul Nizam - abdulnizam@mail.com ==

Hello BOSS,

WE do understand your &quot;concern&quot;... the life concern of &quot;INTERNET BOSSES&quot; that arise as a consequence of this rapid and revolutionary evolution of Knowledge Technology as it BREAKS ALL TRADITIONAL BARRIERS and forge HUMANE UNITY and ACTION WORLDWIDE - well, guys come on... dont read this kind of page if it hurts your IDEOLOGY so much... simply leave it alone... and see WHO TAKES WHAT! If you are true to your &quot;ACADEMIC&quot; and &quot;INTELLECTUAL&quot; HONESTY as you do try to portray, let WORLD POPULAR NATURAL SELECTION work on WIKI rather trying to IMPOSE your US-centric AUTHORITARIAN &quot;BUSH&quot; CONTROL upon others who choose to use THIS COMMON PUBLIC WIKI MEDIA in MORE HUMANE and CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS than what you can EVER IMAGINE! 

However, if you too happen to be a WAGE WORKER that knows not his real plight in life, please email me for a hearty chat and mutual critique that could pave the way for CREATING NEW VISTAS with WIKIMEDIA and OUR WORLDWIDE UNITY OF WORKERS! 

ALSO i INVITE you to SPEND SOME TIME THROUGH &quot;MIU&quot; Page... mind you, i have done this with nothing more than a few dollars to live with! as much as 10 or 15... given my proper means, definitely we'd make the world shake with the humane power of the workers of the world! and that for the good of every worker that could well include you and your children as well! 

Bye for now,
Abdul Nizam.

:Who said that I was a &quot;Bush&quot; supporter?  All I'm trying to do right now is to talk with you and befriend you rather than be real blunt and simply delete the contributions.  That and I'm trying to point out that a marxist viewpoint is hardly a neutral point of view.  If you are interested, I and others here on this website can help you to explain your viewpoint to mainstream internet users rather than &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; or using keywords that are only understood by people with your viewpoint.  This is an opportunity that you shouldn't pass up, but please pay attention that there is already a &quot;community&quot; that you are trying to join, many of whom don't share your same viewpoint or world view.  If there is going to be a place for many people with many different philosophical opinions to be able to work together for the common good in terms of publishing collaborative textual information, this would be the place.
:As far as being a &quot;internet boss&quot;, I'm flattered that you have put me into that category.  And you havn't really paid attention to how things work on Wikimedia projects for you to make such an assertion.
:I am nothing more than an ordinary Wikimedia user who has worked long and hard to get this particular project, Wikibooks, into a form that can actually do some good in this world.  I've written books (mainly technical manuals and children's books) and have done some cleanup from drive-by vandals who would destroy humanity as a whole if they had the opportunity.  Since I've been working here, my peers (other ordinary users) have elected me to have some &quot;extra&quot; privileges which include deletion privileges and user monitoring to help keep this project from becoming random gibberish from idiots who would destroy hours of effort in just a few seconds.  I take that opportunity very seriously, but otherwise my opinion is just as valid as yours, and I hope that you can join us.  Please don't fight me or any of the other admins as the &quot;enemy&quot;, but try to understand where we are coming from and why we do the things we do.  We genuinely want to be helpful and make a quite revolution:  Where textbooks are freely available that you don't need to pay extortionist prices from commercial textbook publishers to get a glimpse at human knowledge.  That is the role of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

== POV Issues ==
While I want to thank you for contributing to Wikibooks, I want to remind you about some of the pages listed above in the standard welcome message to all new users.

In particular, you are attempting to create a forum for establishing a labor union here on Wikibooks.  That is explictly against project policy, and we strive to maintain a ''neutral point of view'' for all content that is added here.  I know this is a difficult concept to grasp, but what it essentially involves is that while you can write ''about'' a political party or philosophy, you can't advocate ''for'' that political philosophy.

In particular, you explicitly reverted my adding a speedy delete to [[&quot;UNITE&quot; - INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ICT WORKERS]].  I am willing to listen to reasoned explainations for why I might be wrong (I often am wrong), but reversions like this without comment are simply going to make me angry and force me to more drastic measures.  Besides, this should have been done as a redirect as well.

I realize that [[Marxian International University]] has been edited on Wikibooks for several months now, and under the radar of most Wikibooks contributors.  I do have some issues with it, on a number of levels, and I am asking for you to justify its existance on Wikibooks.  Rather than getting into a public argument, I'm trying to see what your intentions really are with this content and perhaps help you to understand exactly what Wikibooks is all about.  This is not a public webhosting site, as there is a specific goal that we have in mind with developing Wikibooks.  This project is an outgrowth of Wikipedia where authors on Wikipedia wanted more freedom to develop a topic in much more depth than a typical encyclopedia article.  Specifically, textbooks were cited as the primary focus of this project.

This really appears as an attempt to set up a whole new Wikimedia sister project.  For things of that nature, I would strongly recommend that you look at [[meta:Proposals for new projects]].

I am trying to work with you, and I don't want to offend you in any way.  I hope that you can understand what we do here and try to work with us instead of trying to fight &quot;the powers that be&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:48, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== VfD discussion ==

There are several votes in favor of deletion at [[WB:VFD]], and I think that the final concensus will be one of deletion. The theoretical materials of marxism or socialism are acceptable subjects here on wikibooks, but an obviously biased page such as this, expousing and preaching a particular viewpoint is not acceptable. I won't take any quick or drastic actions yet, but this page most likely will be deleted. I suggest you find a new venue to host this material soon, so that you dont lose any of your hard work. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:27, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Linkspam ==

I am removing your website links from the staff lounge. Things like that constitute linkspam, and is not acceptable. Wikibooks is not a platform for selfpromotion. Repeated offenses could get you banned from wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

:I am blocking both you, and [[User:Haunfaer]] for repeated linkspam, and sockpuppeting in bad faith. The block term will be 1 week for you, and infinite for your puppet. If you linkspam again after the 1 week duration, you will be blocked indefinately. What you are doing is not polite, and not appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:41, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
=== Alex Horovitz ===
I'm actually doing a lot of work with ASP right now (writing a book with a friend on .NET 3.0 ) and I find the biggest issues are twofold:

* While WebObjects is an environment where you are developing a software application where the User Interface happens to utilize HTML and a web browser, ASP.NET is all about developing a website that happens to do some application like stuff from time to time. (e.g. the session object is a big dictionary that cannot be extended, page navigation and pushing objects around from page to page is a lot more difficult, you'll find you end up doing a lot more work in the area of processing events - more like a windows desktop app, etc... ) 
* ADO and the way data access and controls are managed do not (easily) allow you to separate data access from business logic (ala the creation of true Entities) so you will need to either (a) build that overhead or (b) - more likely - just learn to live without it.

That being said, it is possible, just plan on missing a lot of the really convenient stuff you get out of the box with EOF and WO because of the adherence to a MVC point of view...

The value of diagnostic testing is overestimated.  For many conditions the likelihood of a disease in the population selected at random is small, on the order of one in a thousand.  Arguably that likelihood is increased if the sample is instead the population of individuals who have self selected or been referred to an orthopedic office. All diagnostic tests have both false positive and false negative results which by traditional statistics or Bayesian inference can be calculated to define the likelihood of the patient having the disease if a given diagnostic test is positive.  The strength of evidence provided by a diagnostic test is going to be influenced by the baseline likelihood of disease in the sampled population.  The more specialized the provider in dealing with a specific set of problems the higher the likelihood that a larger proportion of that population has definable pathologies of a certain category.  A diagnostic test may be exceedingly unhelpful, not to mention cost ineffective when used as a population screen and yet be reasonably useful in the hands of a subspecialist who may order the test.  The likelihood that a positive result is a true positive is increased in the latter case.  While it may be true that for an especially rare condition the likelihood in the face of a positive test result may still be less than 1 in 2, the fact of a positive diagnostic test may have increased the likelihood that the disease is present by a factor of 10 relative to the general population of patients in that office. Thus for the specialist and the patient the chances for a successful outcome by virtue of the accurate identification of the pathology in question has been improved.  It should be emphasized however that the uncertainty in by no means eliminated.

|The players are racing to capture pieces as quickly as possible
}}

Race positions occur when the two elephants each take control of an opposing trap as in [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=18233&amp;s=w this game] diagrammed at right.  In a race position, both elephants are clearly free, so [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Mobility | elephant mobility]] is of secondary importance.  The critical issue is which elephant can do more damage more quickly.

Race positions are rare because they typically require one player or the other to have misjudged the position in a costly way.  The player who is going to lose the race shouldn't have raced in the first place.  The ultimate loser will wish he could rewind the game to the move on which he used his elephant to attack rather than defend.

By the same token, however, it is important to know how to play in a race position, so as to be able to judge beforehand whether or not to race.  One strategic point is that an elephant assisted by other pieces usually makes progress faster than an unaided elephant.  Another point is that an advanced rabbit makes an attack much more potent by threatening to make goal, and may force the opposing elephant to break off its attack, wasting a couple of moves to cross over and defend.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|Goal threats trump capture threats.
}}
In the position at left, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=22509&amp;s=w this game] in the 2006 Arimaa World Championship, Silver is on move.  Each player is threatening goal.  As soon as one player is forced to defend with his elephant, the game will essentially be over, because the other player will capture the little attacking pieces near the trap where the attack has just been abandoned.  In other words, both players have staked the game on the outcome of this race.

Silver should consider using his camel to push the d6-rabbit back to d5.  It may endanger the silver camel to bring it nearer to the gold elephant, but in a goal race it may be worth sacrificing a camel to buy time.  Meanwhile if Gold ends Silver's goal threat by capturing the g3-rabbit, the silver elephant will respond by heading home for defense and capturing the gold f4-camel in f6.  Therefore Gold would have to keep racing instead. 

Because the cost of losing a race is so high, and because the side with more pieces committed usually makes progress faster, counter-attacks in Arimaa are rare.  Usually as soon as one side commits multiple pieces to an attack, the other side defends, hoping to gain a useful hostage or frame, and eventually win slowly due to superior elephant mobility.

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Large brains are humans' most distinctive anatomical feature. Our brains are about four times bigger than chimpanzees' and gorillas' brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brains use twenty times the calories of muscles at rest. Brains require maintaining a constant temperature. Large brains are easily injured, and make childbirth difficult. Intelligence has many costs, yet doesn't directly help an animal survive (e.g., a big brain doesn't make you run faster or survive colder weather).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors' brains began to enlarge about two million years ago. Two million years is short in evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;

== The Triune Brain ==

&lt;p&gt;Our brains comprise three distinct structures, representing three evolutionary periods.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Paul. ''The Triune Brain in Evolution: Role in Paleocerebral Functions'' (Plenum, 1990, ISBN 0306431688).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest, deepest, and smallest area is the ''reptilian brain''.&lt;ref&gt;A.k.a. basal ganglia or extrapyramidal motor system. Panksepp, Jaak. ''Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions'' (Oxford, 1998, ISBN 0-19-509673-8), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The reptilian brain controls the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. It enables aggression, mating, and reaction to immediate danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mammals evolved the &lt;i&gt;limbic system&lt;/i&gt;. This is the middle layer of our brains, surrounding the reptilian brain. The physiological features unique to mammals are in the limbic brain, e.g., the hypothalamus system for keeping us warm.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limbic brain also produces emotions. Emotions facilitate relationships. Mammals, unlike reptiles, care for their young. Mammals evolved brains hardwired for mother-child and other relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|The most common reaction a reptile has to its young is indifference; it lays its eggs and walks (or slithers) away. Mammals form close-knit, mutually nurturant social groups-families-in which members spend time touching and caring for one another. Parents nourish and safeguard their young, and each other, from the hostile world outside their group. A mammal will risk and sometimes lose its life to protect a child or mate from attack. A garter snake or salamander watches the death of its kin with an unblinking eye.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, T., Amini, F., Lannon, R. ''A General Theory of Love'' (Random House, 2000, ISBN 0375503897), 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;|Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini, and Richard Lannon&lt;br&gt;''A General Theory of Love'' (2000)}}

&lt;p&gt;The ''cerebral cortex'' (or ''neocortex'') is the newest, outermost area of our brains. The oldest mammals, e.g., opossums, have only a thin layer of cerebral cortex. Rabbits have a little more, cats a bit more. Monkeys have a substantial cerebral cortex. Humans&amp;#151;and only humans&amp;#151;have an enormous cerebral cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, T., Amini, F., Lannon, R. &lt;i&gt;A General Theory of Love&lt;/i&gt; (Random House, 2000, ISBN 0375503897), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human reptilian brain and limbic system is similar is size and structure to other animals. I.e., our ancestors evolved a huge cerebral cortex, while the older brain areas didn't change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex learns new things.{{citation needed}} Animals with little or no cerebral cortex act only as their genes program them to act.{{citation needed}} Animals with a cerebral cortex can find new foods, survive in new environments, or change their mating tactics to improve reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human cerebral cortex goes beyond learning new foods and survival skills. Our brains can think in abstractions. We communicate via symbols (e.g., language), consider the past and future, and sacrifice our personal interests not only for our families (as other mammals do) but also for ideas (e.g., honor and country).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts between brain areas lead to relationship difficulties.{{citation needed}} In a conflicted brain, the older area wins. In contrast, an individual with an ''integrated'' brain&amp;#151;i.e., who uses his or her whole brain&amp;#151;solves relationship problems.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

=== Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny ===

&lt;p&gt;A child's development mimics its species' evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infants live in their reptilian brains. They eat, breathe, crawl, sleep, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children live in their limbic brains. They feel emotions strongly. They use emotions to form relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adolescents live in their cerebral cortexes. They strive to become unique individuals. They quest to find abstract principles to live by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adult relationships invert childhood development.{{citation needed}} Men and women use cerebral cortex abstractions (e.g., gender roles) to attract opposite sex partners. If a couple then feels limbic brain emotionally connected &quot;chemistry,&quot; they form a relationship. If the relationship goes well, sooner or later they're in bed, using their reptilian brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love develops a child's limbic brain.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, T., Amini, F., Lannon, R. &lt;i&gt;A General Theory of Love&lt;/i&gt; (Random House, 2000, ISBN 0375503897), 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Unloved children fail to develop limbic brains capable of emotional intimacy. Such an individual can relate on a reptilian level&amp;#151;e.g., food, warmth, sex&amp;#151;or on a cerebral cortex level&amp;#151;e.g., excelling at accounting or the law&amp;#151;but have difficulty with intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

==Natural vs. Sexual Selection==

&lt;p&gt;In ''The Origin of Species'' (1859), Charles Darwin wrote that species evolve via random mutations. Environmental changes&amp;#151;e.g., changing food sources, predation, climate&amp;#151;favor one mutation over another. He called this process ''natural selection''.

&lt;p&gt;The conventional view is that our smarter, larger-brained ancestors invented tools, and then dominated their smaller-brained relations. The archaeological facts don't support this &quot;man the toolmaker&quot; hypothesis.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors first used stone tools 2.5 million years, or 100,000 generations, ago.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, Alice B. ''Humans: An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology'' (Routledge, 1998, ISBN 0-415-91985-1), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This book has about 50,000 words. To refer to the first human as your &quot;great-great-great&amp;#133;grandparent,&quot; you'd have to replace every word in this book with &quot;great,&quot; and you'd need two books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one million years, or near the end of the first book, our ancestors' brains were more than double in size. Archaeologists can see slight improvements in their stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, Alice B. ''Humans: An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology'' (Routledge, 1998, ISBN 0-415-91985-1), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;500,000 years ago&amp;#151;halfway through the second book&amp;#151;our ancestors' brains were nearly as big as our brains. Our ancestors started using fire.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, Alice B. ''Humans: An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology'' (Routledge, 1998, ISBN 0-415-91985-1), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Fire enabled them to move from Africa to colder Europe and Asia.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50,000 years ago&amp;#151;eight pages from the end of the second book&amp;#151;our ancestors' brains reached modern size. Their stone tools became thinner and sharper. They carved small ornamental figurines from ivory, shell, and stone. They created beautiful cave paintings. They built the first ocean-going boats.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, Alice B. ''Humans: An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology'' (Routledge, 1998, ISBN 0-415-91985-1), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5,000-10,000 years ago&amp;#151;the last page of the second book&amp;#151;our ancestors developed agriculture. Poor nutrition made farmers' bodies and brains smaller. They invented writing and metal tools. They invented the bow and arrow-a weapon that seems primitive to us.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archery.org/what_is_archery/history.htm, http://www.usarchery.org/naapub/history.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors' brains enlarged ''before'' technological advances. Our ancestors' brains were required for each new technological innovation. Tool use was one of many uses for our large brains. Something else drove human brain evolution.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

===Sexual Selection===

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/i&gt; (1871), Darwin wrote that natural selection failed to explain human evolution.{{citation needed}} Instead, he proposed an alternative theory. Species evolve when males and females select each other for certain qualities. He called this &lt;i&gt;sexual selection&lt;/i&gt;. Biologists ignored this idea for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Geoffrey F. ''The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature'' (Doubleday, 2000, ISBN 0385495161), p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female mammals, in general, are more selective than males. Females in most mammal species do most of the work of producing and raising children. In contrast, fathering offspring is less work, so males aren't so choosy.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|The exertion of some choice on the part of the female seems almost as general a law as the eagerness of the male.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. [http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-descent-of-man/ The Descent of Man] (Prometheus, 1871, ISBN 1573921769).&lt;/ref&gt;|Charles Darwin, ''The Descent of Man'' (1871)}}

&lt;p&gt;Females choose males with features that make the males less able to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R.L. (1972). &quot;Parental investment and sexual selection,&quot; in B. Campbell (ed.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man 1871-1971''. (Aldine, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; E.g., a peacock's bright colors make him visible to predators, and his huge tail slows his escapes. His beautiful tail communicates to peahens that he's an especially fit individual, i.e., he's so fast that he can escape predators despite his heavy tail. Sexual selection is, in general, the opposite of natural selection.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural selection advances via slow environmental change.{{citation needed}} Natural selection advances evolution only in harsh environments (e.g., predation, climate change).{{citation needed}} Natural selection produces animals better able to survive&amp;#151;usually smaller{{citation needed}}, more efficient, and less conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, sexual selection advances with each generation. Sexual selection produces rapid evolutionary changes. Sexual selection advances evolution in stable environments. Sexual selection produces animals (especially males) less able to survive, with bigger, brighter, or exaggerated features.&lt;/p&gt;

==What's Sexy About a Cerebral Cortex?==

&lt;p&gt;Humans' oversized brains could have evolved due to sexual selection. But what's sexy about an enlarged cerebral cortex? Women don't say, &quot;Look at the cerebral cortex on that dude! I want to have his children!&quot; Our ancestors must have instead been attracted to cerebral cortex ''behaviors''.

&lt;p&gt;Our cerebral cortexes enable many behaviors, e.g., speech and language. But what's striking about the cerebral cortex is how much of it is ''not'' dedicated to specific behaviors. The human cerebral cortex has billions of general-purpose neurons, capable of learning any new idea. Why were our ancestral mothers and fathers&amp;#151;unlike any other animals&amp;#151;sexually attracted to partners who could learn new ideas?{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

===Monogamy and Lying===

&lt;p&gt;Most nonhuman mammal fathers have little or no involvement with their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. [http://www.calacademy.org/calwild/summer2000/html/diamond.html Diamond's Hope: An Interview with Science's Multifaceted Storyteller], ''California Wild'', Summer 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Male gorillas kill infants fathered by other males. Male chimpanzees help all the youngsters in their group, but they don't know who fathered each child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human evolution may have begun when fathers helped raise their children, giving the children a survival advantage. Among hunter-gatherers today, children without fathers are more than twice as likely to die during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado, A.M., Hill, K.R. &quot;Paternal effect on offspring survivorship among Ach&amp;eacute; and Hiwi hunter-gatherer: Implications for modeling pair-bond stability,&quot; in B.S. Hewlett (ed.), ''Father-child relations: Cultural and biosocial contexts'' (Aldine de Gruyter, 1992), pages 31-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monogamy could cause a conflict between two reproductive strategies. A man could try to have sex with many women, risking rejection from women, violence from other men, or his fatherless children not surviving. Although initially more offspring might be conceived this way, such a man might father no surviving children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or a man could choose to be in a monogamous relationship, and actively raise his children. Such a man would father only a few children, but his children would likely survive and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman could have sex with a desirable (e.g., high-status, tall, strong, handsome) man, and risk competing women taking him from her. Or she could choose a stable, monogamous relationship with a less-desirable man whom no one other woman wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Sexual Lying Could Have Driven Cerebral Cortex Development ===

&lt;p&gt;Getting caught reduces a liar's reproductive success. Catching liars increases the lie-catcher's reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lying requires imagination, quick thinking, and, above all, thinking of new lies. Catching lies requires imagination, quick thinking, and a long memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are cerebral cortex activities. Effective liars also match their emotions to their lies. You catch lies when an individual's emotional state doesn't match his or her words.{{citation needed}} Effective lying requires integrating one's cerebral cortex with one's limbic brain.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man or woman with a larger cerebral cortex, well-integrated with his or her limbic brain, is better able to sexually lie, and to catch sexual lies. Such men and women became our ancestors.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

In 1999&amp;ndash;2000, Thomas David Kehoe took two relationships counseling courses in a graduate school psychology program and was surprised to learn that neither course had a textbook. One course had an excellent reading list. Using these sources Thomas David Kehoe put together a relationships counseling textbook. In 2003, Thomas David Kehoe published ''Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships.''

Not many people bought the book, so Thomas David Kehoe decided to make the book available free at Wikibooks.  That contribution formed the first version of the book here, which we the Wikibooks community are now free to improve!</text>

Hello and welcome to Wikibooks! I'm sorry to say that your book, [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer/cover]], might not be appropriate for our site, however. Wikibooks must be textbooks on subjects taught at accredited institutions. If you can show that such an institution does teach this subject and you intend to write this book in the format of a textbook, then it can become a part of Wikibooks, Otherwise, it will have to go. Fortunately, your work will not have been done in vain! A good place for your content exists at [[Wikia:Buffy]]. I recommend you move your book there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New Name needed ==

We are pretty successful on [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/September 2005 voting|Book of the month]] - however the issue of [[WB:NC]] has arissen and it seems we need a new name for our book.

Since [[WB:NC]] prescribes that the Book name is also used for the templates and category I am in favor of a short name like [[Ada]] or prehaps [[Ada 2006]]. For the later we would need to wait until the [http://www.adaic.com/standards AdaIC] finaly agrees on a name (or have they already).

For the Chapters I believe the Subpage seperator &quot;/&quot; will suit us better then the namespace seperator &quot;:&quot;.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:04, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

: Note also that [[WB:NC]] has been superseded by [[WB:NP]], although it's largely the same. As you can see from this page, I've recommend the '/' delimiter, since newbies who add pages almost always fail to provide backlinks, and the 'flat' structure to make it easier to reorganise the structure later, although you may prefer to include a minimal hierarchy if you have hundreds of pages. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:04, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

::It is also needed to change the names of the categories to something like [[:Category:Ada Programming:Ada 2005 feature]] (supposing the new title is &quot;Ada Programming&quot;). I also propose to change the name of the categories [[:Category:Ada unfinished article]] and [[:Category:Ada empty article]] because in Wikibooks there are no articles but &quot;modules&quot; (this is no the Wikipedia). --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:36, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

:Note that we also have families of templates that start with [[Template:Ada 2005]], [[Template:Ada 95]] and [[Template:Ada 83]] (and also a single template called [[Template:Ada2005]], but this is a redirection to [[Template:Ada 2005]]) like those that point to the ARM: [[Template:Ada 95/RM1]]. Maybe we must also create the following redirections to the wikibook: [[Ada 2005]], [[Ada 95]] and [[Ada 83]]. How many redirections are allowed for a Wikibook? In my opinion if the naming conventions forbid us to use those template names the naming policy is too restrictive --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:47, August 8, 2005 (UTC)
::Well, maybe we can use, instead of [[Template:Ada 2005/RM1]], &quot;just&quot; [[Template:Ada/2005/RM1]] and have only one additional domain name (it's a lot of work, we need a tool! The same for [[Template:Adakw]] -&gt; [[Template:Ada/kw]]). It's true that every wikibook cannot &quot;polute&quot; the namespace as desired. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 17:36, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes, we need a tool. I am annoyed because [http://pywikipediabot.sourceforge.net pywikipedia bots] lack a rename tool. It can rename a category but not a list of pages. For the pages all it can do is to fix the redirects that are created after moving a page so the referring pages link to the new name. For templates, it can replace a template instantiation by another. I don't know whether it would be easy to make a renamer tool based on its framework or from scratch. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:43, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Ada 2005 ===

:According to [http://www.adacore.com/multimedia/pdfs/Ada05_rational_00.pdf Ada05 rational] they have accorded to call it Ada 2005.

::''There has been much discussion on whether the language should be called Ada 2005 or Ada 2006. For various reasons the WG9 meeting in York in June 2005 decided that the vernacular name should be Ada 2005.''
: I think &quot;Ada&quot; is too short, better &quot;Ada Programming&quot; or &quot;Programming in Ada&quot;. &quot;Ada 2005&quot; would be a good marketing  name and not so short, but I still prefer to see the word programming on it. But no strong opinion on that. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:51, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Ada Programming ===

: As for long names I prefer [[Ada Programming]] - if only for the venable (and cheaty) [http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm TIOBE Programming Community Index].
::I think that [[Programming in Ada]] will also work for this purpose. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:36, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

: However the [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] prescribes that the Book name, and not a short form of it, is used for Templates and Categories. Especialy for Templates this would hurt us since we use templates in code samples.

:: Remember that [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] is still proposed policy. I don't like very much that point of the policy. I have given arguments against it in [[Wikibooks talk:Naming conventions]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

::: If your suggestion gets acceptet I would support [[Ada Programming]]. - Strange that [[User:suruena|suruena]] has not said anything yet....

::::Hello again --I've returned for a few days, I'm on vacations--. I don't like that the title refers to the version of the language covered because it is also useful for people not using the new admendment, and all we want that in the future the Wikibook will be updated for the next revisions of Ada. Maybe the &quot;subtitle&quot; can include this (not a part of the page name). 
::::[[Ada Programming]] sounds OK for me, but I'm not a native English speaker. Maybe if we post to comp.lang.ada we will have valuable ideas. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:36, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

::Why the naming policy prescribes the title &quot;[[Ada Programming]]&quot;? --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:36, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

==== [[How to Program in Ada]] ====

=== Existing name ===

There are more than three hundred books in amazon.com about Ada (but there are some editions of the ARM and the Rationale, and several conference proceedings). When searching for &quot;programming in Ada&quot;, besides the well known &quot;Programming in Ada 95&quot; of John Barnes, there are several books named &quot;Programming in Ada&quot; or &quot;Programming in ADA&quot;, but also &quot;Programming with Ada&quot;. I suppose there are no problems, but can we choose an existing name for the wikibook? --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 16:17, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

: See [[m:Avoid Copyright Paranoia]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:03, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:Don't worry about this. Only a registered mark could forbid the usage and for that you should give a fully new word, not a common english phrase. All that could be said if we choose &quot;Programming in Ada&quot; is that we haven't been original. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:43, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Separator ===

Should we vote also for the separator? Or is there agreement on using &quot;/&quot; after the renaming? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:43, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

: I like the &quot;/&quot; separator (without surrounding white spaces, as stated in [[WB:NP]]) because it's the recommended one for new wikibooks. It has the advantage of the links to the parent pages. But, can these links be removed? --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 09:51, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

: I too like the &quot;/&quot; separator - It is also the standart seperator for URL (http://host/path/doc, ftp://path/file.ext, etc. pp) - it gives the pages name more a normal html fell.

I think that these are the major steps that must be done. Please, feel free to add any step or to change anything. When we've reached an agreement the migration can start. When does the poll for choosing the new title end? Maybe next monday, August 15? --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 14:08, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with all the points except for category names. We should use the same separator used for other pages: [[:Category:Ada Programming/Empty module]]. About deletions, I am in favour of removing old categories and templates, and leaving the module redirections given that it may exist external pages pointing to current modules (e. g. Spanish interwiki links, although these ones will be corrected sooner or later). --[[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:22, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

::OK, I've just changed the colon separator of the categories with a slash. Note that the proposal for the new categories change slightly the name because in Wikibooks there are modules, not articles.
::Also, I've also added the possibility or adapting to the domain name the image of Ada Lovelace, but maybe we can just delete this image and use the same image form the Commons [[:Image:Ada Lovelace 1838.jpg]]. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 21:05, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

I think that the migration plan is nearly finished, if you found any problem or a missing step please, make any needed change.
I'll try to convert every template to the new naming convention this weekend, because the new title poll ends the next monday and I will be at travel since the next tuesday. I will try to work in the migration as much as possible, it would be fine that we have finished it before September because it could be the next book of the month. We can achieve both. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 08:22, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

=== Helpful substitute patterns ===

 :%substitute/\V[[Programming:Ada:/[[Programming\/Ada\//g
 :%substitute/\v(\[\[Programming\/Ada\/.{-})@&lt;=\:(.{-}(\]\]|\|))@=/\//g

=== Categories and templates ===

I have used the old navigational templates parameters ([[Template:Ada/Navigation 1]], etc.) for adding all the pages to the new category [[:Category:Ada Programming]]. This has the benefit that during the transition all the pages are attached to both categories until we delete or modify the old category from all pages, i.e no two different sets of pages in two categories. The inconvenience is that the category added through a template is not immediately visible in the category page. I don't know whether the category is refreshed when each page is edited or when a category cache is outdated. What do you think about this? Should we use categories in templates? If the answer is no, we can delete the categories from the templates when all the pages have been updated. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:22, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

:It's a good idea to mark the category in the navigation templates during the transition, but I think that later it's preferable to use categories in templates only in special cases, like to tag Ada 2005 features. Aside the problems with the cache, some pages should not be put into [[:Category:Ada Programming]], like the category page itself or [[:Category:Ada programming language]]. Of course in that pages a text substitution can be used instead a template usage, but anyway I prefer not to use this category inside the template. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 09:29, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

=== Migration (nearly) finished ===

There are some minor points to do, but currently the migration to the new naming policy can be considered finished:

* The aliases must be registered
* The image with the type hierarchy must be moved (Manuel, as the uploader, maybe you want to do that), and then request the removal of the old image.

And probably there are links in some pages that haven't been modified.
Also, note the new usage of the [[:Category:Ada programming language]]. I think that this is sound, and no Wikibook can be title that way because it is lower case, however the [[:Category:C programming language]] and [[:Category:C plus plus programming language]] have a different use. What do you think about this? --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 14:20, August 26, 2005 (UTC)

:  I see that [[:Category:Ada programming language]] is fixed as well now  - I guess we can archive this discussion now . --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:12, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1952, the [[../Declaration of Independence/]] and the [[../Constitution/]] came to join the [[../Bill of Rights/]] (which was placed in 1938) at the [[../National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. In fact, the documents did not receive the name &quot;Charters of Freedom&quot; until 1953. Where were the Charters of Freedom before then? This article will tell you about their history. 

[[Image:Us declaration independence.jpg|250px|thumb|The United States Declaration of Independence]]
==History of the Declaration of Independence (1776-1921)==
On July 19, 1776, Congress resolved &quot;that the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile of &quot;The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America,&quot; and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress. Timothy Matlack, an assistant to Charles Thomson, the secretary of the Continental Congress, did the engrossing (calligraphy with large letters) on a single sheet of parchment. On August 2, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed by the delegates. 

The Declaration of Independence, probably rolled up like other parchment documents of the time, moved with Congress from city to city throughout the Revolutionary War. Each time the document was used, it would have been unrolled and re-rolled. 

In September 1789 the Secretary of Congress transferred the Declaration to the custody of the Secretary of State, and then it moved with the national government, from New York to Philadelphia and then in 1800 to [[w:Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]]. 

In 1814, when the British attacked Washington, D.C., the Declaration of Independence was evacuated, first to an unused gristmill near Chain Bridge over the [[w:Potomac River|Potomac River]] and later to a private home near [[w:Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg, Virginia]]. By 1817, the Secretary of State Richard Rush noted that the &quot;hand of time&quot; had faded the signatures. 

In 1820, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams contracted with William J. Stone to engrave a facsimile of the Declaration, it was completed in 1823. It is because of Stone's engraving plate, now in the National Archives, that we know what the Declaration of Independence looked like.

In 1841, when the new Patent Office building opened (now the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery at Seventh and F Streets, NW), Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent the Declaration of Independence and other interesting documents (such as General Washington's commission in the Revolutionary Army) to be exhibited for public viewing, and it remained there, exposed to natural light, for thirty-five years. During its stay at the Patent Office, the combined effects of aging, sunlight, and fluctuating temperature and relative humidity took their toll on the document, and observers remarked on its worn and faded appearance.

The Declaration of Independence was exhibited at Independence Hall in Philadelphia for exhibit at the Centennial National Exposition in 1876, and when it returned to Washington, D.C. in 1877, it was placed on exhibit at the new State-War-Navy Building (now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) next to the White House.

In 1892, a new steel case was constructed, and plans were made to send it to [[w:Chicago|Chicago]] for the World's Columbian Exposition, but at the last minute it was decided that due to the fading of the text and the deterioration of the parchment, the Declaration of Independence could no longer be safely exhibited and the plans were cancelled. The Declaration was carefully wrapped and stored flat in the State Department library until 1921.

==History of the Constitution (1787-1921)==
The Constitutional Convention met in [[w:Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1787, and on September 16-17, 1787, Jacob Shallus, an assistant clerk of the Pennsylvania State Assembly, engrossed the Constitution on four sheets of parchment. Delegates signed it on page four. The Constitution, like the Declaration, passed to the custody of the Department of State in 1789, moved with the government, and was evacuated to Leesburg in 1814. The Constitution was never exhibited, and there are only a few mentions of it in the historical records.

[[Image:Bill_of_Rights_Pg1of1_AC.jpg|250px|thumb|The United States Bill of Rights]]
==History of the Bill of Rights (1789-1951)==
The joint resolution of Congress proposing twelve amendments to the Constitution, like the laws of the first Congress, was engrossed on a single sheet of parchment by a congressional clerk, William Lambert, in September 1789. The Speaker of the House, Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, and the president of the Senate, John Adams, signed it. By 1791 three-fourths of the states had ratified articles three through twelve, and they became the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights.

Unfortunately, practically nothing is known about the Bill of Rights between 1789 and 1938, except that it was kept with other signed original laws and resolutions, moved with the government, and although not specifically mentioned, was probably evacuated to Leesburg in 1814.

In 1938, the State Department transferred the original laws and resolutions of Congress, including constitutional amendments, to the National Archives. The first known photograph of the Bill of Rights was made to illustrate the National Archives annual report in 1941. From September 1947 to January 1949, the Bill of Rights was the featured document on the tour of the [[../Freedom Train/]], which carried 126 historic documents to 322 cities. The Bill of Rights was on exhibit in the National Archives Building from September 1949 to January 1951. During the Korean War, the Bill of Rights and other documents of high intrinsic value were sent to the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New York.

==History of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution (1921-1952)==
From 1921 to 1952 the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution share a common history. In 1920 a committee of scholars investigated and made recommendations for the permanent preservation and possible exhibition of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. A year later, President Warren Harding signed an executive order transferring custody of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution from the State Department to the [[w:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]]. The next day, the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, went to the State Department, signed a receipt, placed the Declaration and Constitution on a pile of leather mail sacks and a cushion in a Ford Model-T truck, returned with them to the Library of Congress, and placed them in a safe in his office. Putnam asked Congress for a special appropriation to create a dignified exhibit so that visitors to Washington could view the documents in a &quot;sort of shrine.&quot; Congress gave him twelve thousand dollars, and the new exhibit opened in 1924. For the first time the Constitution was placed on exhibit, next to the Declaration of Independence. Newspapers reported that after almost 150 years of traveling the two great documents had finally found a permanent home.

In 1926, Congress made its first appropriation for a National Archives Building. At the laying of the cornerstone on February 20, 1933, President Herbert Hoover announced that &quot;the most sacred documents of our history— the originals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States&quot; would be placed on display there. Later that year, architect John Russell Pope selected Barry Faulkner to paint two large murals for the Exhibition Hall, the subjects of which were the signing of those two great documents. The murals depict Thomas Jefferson presenting the Declaration of Independence to John Hancock and James Madison presenting the final draft of the Constitution to George Washington.

In 1934 President Franklin Roosevelt selected the first Archivist of the United States, R.D.W. Connor, and they both believed the Declaration and Constitution belonged in the new National Archives Building. When reporters asked, Connor declined comment but gave reporters a copy of Hoover's speech. Librarian Putnam declared that President Hoover &quot;made a mistake.&quot; The two great documents were at the Library of Congress by executive order of the President and an act of Congress (the appropriation to build the exhibit), and they would remain there in their shrine instead of moving to the &quot;lobby&quot; of the National Archives Building. Connor was furious, but he remained silent. He owed his job to the recommendation of J. Franklin Jameson, chief of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress, and Connor had promised Jameson he would not take the initiative in seeking the transfer of the documents. Ironically, it was Jameson, the dean of American historians, who suggested the people to be included in the Faulkner's two great murals and approved his sketches. Privately, Connor talked to President Roosevelt several times about transferring the documents to the National Archives, but they agreed it would be best to wait until Putnam left the scene.

Then, World War II intervened. In December 1941, the Library of Congress sent the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to the bullion depository at [[w:Fort Knox|Fort Knox]], Kentucky, for safekeeping. By September 1944, it was decided to return the documents to their permanent exhibit at the shrine in the Library of Congress. The new Archivist of the United States, Solon Buck, had no intention of pressing for their transfer to the National Archives.

==The Charters of Freedom at the National Archives (1951-present)==
On September 17, 1951, there was a grand ceremony at the Library of Congress for the reopening of a permanent encasement for the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, newly sealed in helium by the Bureau of Standards. The distinguished guests included President Truman, the new Librarian of Congress, Luther Evans, and the new Archivist of the United States, Wayne Grover.

President Truman admitted that preserving the parchments might prove difficult, but the ideas in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States would never perish and they would continue to give energy and hope to new generations in the United States and in other countries. Truman also said the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, were just as fundamental a part of our basic law.

Truman then added a sentence, in his handwriting, to the reading copy of his speech: &quot;I hope these first ten amendments will be sealed up and placed alongside the original document. They are just as important.&quot;

While delivering his speech Truman slightly changed his own sentence. He said he hoped &quot;the first ten amendments will be put on parchment and sealed up.&quot; And the Bill of Rights was not &quot;''just'' as important,&quot; but &quot;the ''most'' important part of the Constitution.&quot;

A few weeks later, Wayne Grover and Luther Evans met for lunch and together hatched the plot to fulfill President Truman's request— to seal the Bill of Rights in helium and exhibit it alongside the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in the National Archives Building.

Working together secretly, they agreed it would be necessary to formally clear the transfer with the President, congressional leaders, and Senator Theodore Green, the chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library. All favored the transfer. On April 30, 1952, Evans provided the agenda for the committee meeting, with the second item being &quot;Transfer of certain documents to the National Archives.&quot; Evans went to the meeting alone because he knew that some of his colleagues at the library were hostile, and he wanted the committee not just to approve but to order him to transfer the documents, which it did unanimously. That led to seven months of remodeling of the National Archives Exhibition Hall and planning for the transfer.

The ceremony leaving the library on Saturday, December 13, 1952, was a spectacular event. The commanding general of the Air Force Headquarters Command formally received the documents at the Library of Congress at 11 a.m. Twelve members of the Armed Forces Special Police carried the five parchment pages, encased in helium-filled glass cases and enclosed in wooden crates, through a cordon of eighty-eight servicewomen down the library steps. The boxes were placed on mattresses in an armored Marine Corps personnel carrier. A color guard, ceremonial troops, the Army Band, the Air Force Drum and Bugle Corps, two light tanks, four servicemen carrying submachine guns, and a motorcycle escort paraded down Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues to the Archives Building. Both sides of the street along the parade route were lined by Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Marine, and Air Force personnel. The general and the twelve special policemen arrived at the National Archives Building at 11:35 a.m., carried the crates up the steps, and formally delivered them into the custody of the Archivist of the United States.

Two days later, at 10:15 a.m., on Monday, December 15, 1952, the formal enshrining ceremony was equally impressive. Officials of more than one hundred national civic, patriotic, religious, veterans, educational, business, and labor groups crowded into the Exhibition Hall. The chief justice of the United States presided. After the invocation by the chaplain of the Senate, the governor of Delaware (the first state to ratify the Constitution) called the roll of states in the order in which they ratified the Constitution or were admitted to the Union. As each state was called, a servicewoman carrying the state flag entered the Exhibition Hall and remained at attention in front of the display cases circling the hall. President Truman announced that &quot;the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are now assembled in one place for display and safekeeping.&quot; Senator Green briefly traced the history of the three documents, and the Librarian of Congress and the Archivist of the United States jointly unveiled the shrine. Finally, Chief Justice Vinson spoke briefly; the chaplain of the House of Representatives gave the benediction; the United States Marine Corps Band played the Star-Spangled Banner; the President was escorted from the hall; the bearers of the flags of the forty-eight states (Alaska and Hawaii were not states yet.) marched out and the ceremony was over.

Thus opened the new exhibit for the three parchment documents, together for the first time in one place and with a new collective name never before used: &quot;the Charters of Freedom.&quot; Where did that phrase come from? President Truman must be given credit for first expressing the idea in 1951 of exhibiting the Bill of Rights with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But the three documents did not become the Charters of Freedom until 1953, when the National Archives published &quot;The Charters of Freedom&quot;, an exhibit catalog that included facsimile copies of all six parchment sheets.

In his speech, President Truman said &quot;we are engaged here today in a symbolic act. We are enshrining these documents for future ages. . . . This magnificent hall has been constructed to exhibit them, and the vault beneath, that we have built to protect them, is as safe from destruction as anything that the wit of modern man can devise.&quot; Truman was right, but now the wit of modern man has devised something better— the new encasements, which will house the charters beginning September 17, 2003.

In these new encasements, the eighteenth century meets the twenty-first century. Sophisticated monitoring systems will allow conservators to periodically check the condition of the parchments, and the sealed cases will provide a stable environment. As the latest in the line of custodians of these documents, the National Archives and Records Administration is working to ensure that future generations will be able view them and be inspired by them.

== Question about finals with the added &quot;r&quot; ==

There seems to be a discrepancy between this and the (en.)wikipedia about the pronunciation of the finals with the added &quot;r&quot;.  For example, here it says

:-air = {{IPA|[aɪɻ]}} as in '''ai''' + '''er'''

while http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Pronunciation_of_finals describes

:-air = {{IPA|[aɻ]}} as in '''ar'''

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Mandarin#Finals:

:''As a noun suffix (Traditional: -兒, Simplified: -儿). The suffix combines with the final, and regular changes occur as a result. The following chart shows how the finals from the above chart are affected by the addition of this suffix: ... The attached {{IPA|/ɻ/}} simply removes the codas {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, and removes the coda {{IPA|/ŋ/}} by [[nasal vowel|nasalizing]] the nucleus.

Anyone know if one or the other correct? [[User:18.78.2.125|18.78.2.125]] 02:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

An Auror is &quot;a Dark wizard catcher&quot;. They are an elite group of witches and wizards, loyal to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], whose mission is to fight against and capture the forces of the Dark Arts.

== Analysis ==

The Aurors are like a police force, and sometimes work as intelligence agents. They have the authority to arrest malefactors like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and at times have been given authority to use deadly force against Death Eaters in particular.

=== Training ===

It takes three years to become an Auror after attending [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. A candidate to become an Auror should meet the following requirements:

*minimum of five [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#Examinations_Given|N.E.W.T.s]] with no grade under &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#Grades_Classification|Exceeds Expectations]]&quot;
*recommended N.E.W.T. subjects are:
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]]
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]]
**[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]]

The fifth N.E.W.T. subject is left open to the candidate, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] evidently selects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] as his fifth. One would assume that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Arithmancy|Arithmancy]] would equally be acceptable.

If the candidate meets the above requirements he or she must also pass the following requirements:
*background check for criminal record
*&quot;a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office.&quot;

When accepted, the candidate continues on training. Once one becomes an &quot;Auror trainee&quot; they will be taught one of the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

* There are 2 types of flow :

'''a) Pulsatile flow'''

Represented by cycles. 

Each cycle consists of 2 parts:

1.	A working part (where V of blood flowing increases to max).

2.	A resting part (where V of blood flowing decreases to 0. 

E.g. if the cycle occurs in 1 sec, 100 mL pass in 0.5 sec and 0 mL pass in the next 0.5 sec.

[[Image:Pulsacont.jpg]]

'''b) Continuous flow'''

Represented by a constant line.

The line can be considered as cycles, but with the time of resting part = 0 (always working).

E.g. if the cycle occurs in 1 sec, 50 mL pass in 0.5 sec and 50 mL pass in the next 0.5 sec. 


* ''Note:'' In lungs, the force that was acting on the walls was IPP, from outside the lung. In arteries, the force acting on the walls is the blood itself from inside the artery.

== Cardiac work ==

Assuming a:

-	Volume rate = V / t = 100 mL / sec.

-	Pressure rate = P / t = 100 mm Hg / sec.

And noting that W = PV, 3 cases are considered:

'''1) Continuous flow with rigid arteries'''

Constant continuous output at 100mL / sec.

Constant pressure = 100 mm Hg

Thus, W = 10000 (mmHg)(mL/s) = 1.3 J


'''2) Pulsatile flow with rigid arteries'''

P is 2 times the 1st case since radius is constant and all flow occurs in half the time. 

Thus, P = 200 mmHg.

Thus, W = 20000 (mmHg)(mL/s) = 2.6 J


'''3) Pulsatile flow with very compliant arteries'''

P in the vessel remains constant no matter how much fluid has been added:

When blood is added, the walls of the vessels balloon outwards, carrying a surplus of blood. This keeps P low.

When heart stops adding blood, as soon as some blood is drained, some blood in the balloon moves into the normal vessel. The walls move inwards by recoiling forces, maintaining P constant. 

Thus P remains 100 mmHg.

Thus, W = 10000 (mmHg)(mL/s) = 1.3 J

[[Image:Arteries flow.jpg]]

'''Note'''

Case 2 and 3 are ideal cases. In real organisms, arteries have certain compliance so that P↑ slightly as blood is added and P↓ as blood is drained.

The more compliant the artery, the less work a pulsatile heart needs to do and the lower the P needed to pump the blood.

== Arterial pulse ==

* Rate and intensity of pulse can be used in diagnosis. 

* In this case, the artery is pressed from all directions by a band around the arm.

* When P done on artery = blood pressure, a resonance sound is heard.

* Normal count rate = 72 / min. Normal blood P = 80 (diastolic) and 120 (systolic).


== Arteries functions ==

1)	The heart pumps blood in arteries as a pulsatile flow. Moving from great arteries to capillaries, the compliance of blood vessels converts the pulsatile flow into a continuous one by the time it reaches the cells.

2)	Allow heart to rest during half the cycle (they do the other half of the work).

3)	Reduce work done by heart (if they weren’t compliant, W would have been doubled).

4)	Decrease blood pressure to a normal value.

5)	Allow us to measure rate and intensity of pulse for diagnosis.


== Effect of cholesterol deposits on blood pressure and flow ==

High blood pressure (hypertension) is generally caused by factors such as the renin-angiotensin system, salt and water retention etc.. Contrary to popular belief hypertension is usually a cause of cholesterol deposits rather than being caused by these. Hypertension damages the artery walls and allows atheromatous plaques to form.  Once cholesterol has been deposited in an artery wall perfusion is reduced for a given level of blood pressure:

[[Image:Cholesterol deposits.jpg]]

'''1) From continuity and Bernoulli’s equations'''

From the continuity eqn, A1v1 = A2v2.

Due to cholesterol deposits, A1 &gt; A2 ----&gt; v1 &lt; v2.

From Bernoulli’s equation, ½ ρv2　　+ ρgh + P = constant.

Thus, since v1↓ ----&gt; P1↑


'''2) From Poiseuille’s law'''

C = ∆V / ∆P = (∆V/t) / (∆P/t) = ∆Q / (∆P/t) ----&gt;   ∆P / t = ∆Q / C

Thus, as cholesterol deposits on walls, it makes them rigid (decreases their compliance).

Thus, as C↓    (∆P/t) ↑           i.e. P1↑  


'''Conclusion from both views'''

Blood pressure would need to increase to ensure a given level of tissue perfusion downstream of a plaque. This does not always occur with localised plaques and patients can report symptoms of underperfusion. In the heart underperfusion can lead to angina and sudden heart attacks, especially if a plaque becomes detached (e.g.: coronary thrombosis). Atheromatous plaques are usually fairly localised in the initial stages of the disease. In places such as the kidneys, where regulatory mechanisms exist to ensure adequate blood flow, the existence of atheromatous plaques can cause the further elevation of blood pressure. In the case of the kidneys the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system depends upon pressure sensors that may be downstream from plaque, these will then signal incorrectly that the systemic blood pressure is low and cause water retention and other reflex events to raise blood pressure over the whole body.

* Arteriosclerosis = general term for build up of cholesterol and fibrous tissue in artery walls. Calcification or even ossification can occur within old sclerosed artery walls.Arteriosclerosis decreases the diameter and compliance of arteries, which increases the work done by the heart.

* Atherosclerosis = a form of arteriosclerosis where deposits of cholesterol and fibrous tissue occur on the walls of '''large''' arteries.

== Effect of exercises on blood pressure ==

* R = ∆P / ∆Q ---&gt; ∆P = (Qi – Qo) R

Where Qi = cardiac output (artery inflow), Qo = artery outflow

* During exercises, the cardiac output must increase to supply muscles.

* The resistance of the vascular beds (R) is reduced by local and central reflexes to allow adequate perfusion of the muscles. These are much larger than any changes in resistance due to variations in arterial compliance.

* ''Note:'' ∆P / t = (Qi – Qo) / C. Thus, a severely atherosclerotic person doing exercises (low C) experience higher ∆P than normal person.

== Effect of blood vessel diameter on viscosity ==

* Viscosity (η) = a frictional constant associated with the flow of a given liquid in a given system.

*&lt;math&gt;R = 8 \eta L / \pi  r^4&lt;/math&gt; The resistance of a tube of diameter &quot;r&quot; decreases with the fourth power of the radius. This means that 10,000 1mm pipes have the same resistance to flow as one 10 mm pipe. The capillary beds contain many more vessels than the arteries or veins but less than might be expected for the observed flow rates. The circulation avoids excessive resistance in the capillary beds as a result of a curious property of blood known as the Fahraeus and Lindqvist effect: blood is a non Newtonian fluid because it contains large biconcave RBCs.


'''1) When blood flows in arteries of large r'''

RBCs have great random motion: some move horizontally, others vertically, and others with an angle. Thus, internal friction is great, which increases viscosity. 

Thus, η↑.

[[Image:Diameter effect on blood P.jpg]]

'''2) When blood flows in capillaries of small r'''

RBCs have no random motion: each RBC must move singly, one after the other. Thus, internal friction is minor, which decreases viscosity.
 
Thus, η↓.

Thus, R doesn’t increase and capillaries don’t get too much P, so they have a lower resistance to flow.

== Peripheral resistance ==

* Peripheral resistance = resistance of the blood vessels between the aorta and the right atrium.

* The greater the peripheral resistance, the greater the difficulty that blood has to leave the arteries and hence the greater the cardiac work for a given cardiac output.

* Peripheral resistance can be changed by the action of the autonomic nervous system, hormonal factors etc.

* Effect of peripheral resistance: increasing peripheral resistance at a given level of cardiac output will increase blood pressure in the arteries.

== Blood pressure in different parts of the body ==

* ½ ρv2　　1 + ρgh1 + P1 = ρv2　　2 + ρgh2 + P2

* If the person is sleeping, h1 = h2. Assuming A1 = A2 ---&gt; v1 = v2 ---&gt; P1 = P2. Thus, all body receives the same P = 80/120 mmHg

* If the person is standing upright, P at the level of the heart (measuring at the arm) is 80/120 mmHg.

* If we measure at a lower level, blood pressure increases by ρgh (because blood loses some P.E), where h is the perpendicular distance between heart and the given point.

* If we measure at a higher level, blood pressure decreases by ρgh.

&lt;!--* Thus, a person with hypertension should always have his head at a level higher than his heart (i.e. standing up). He should not sleep on a bed because this would cause the high P of the heart be equal to P in brain, which would cause severe problems. He should thus sleep on a chair. He should never stand upside down (on his head like in Yoga) since this would increase the already high P by ρgh, all this P in brain, which could cause death.--&gt;

[[Image:Upside-down man.jpg]]

* Example: in the previous figure, a person has his legs up (C) and his head down (A).

PA = PB + ρgh. 

PB = PC + ρgh’.

If θ and d are given, h can be calculated by h = d sin θ.

==Venous return, venous compliance and blood pressure==

The rigid pipe model of haemodynamics is applicable when considering any instantaneous flow of blood from the arteries to the veins. The instantaneous blood flow is equal to:

&lt;math&gt; F = \frac {P_a - P_{vb}} {R-R_v}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous blood flow
&lt;math&gt;P_a&lt;/math&gt; is instantaneous arterial pressure
&lt;math&gt;P_{vb}&lt;/math&gt; is instantaneous venous vascular bed pressure
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is total peripheral resistance
&lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt; is venous resistance

Over any period of time, especially periods greater than the interval between heartbeats, hemodynamics is controlled by the factors that control &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_{vb}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt; and right atrial pressure.  The cardiac output is equal to the summation of the instantaneous blood flow over a second.

The most important feature of the operation of the heart from the viewpoint of haemodynamics is that it nearly always pumps any blood that enters through the right atrium through the lungs and out of the left ventricle. This simplifies the analysis because the cardiac output is always equal to the venous return.

The venous return depends upon the resistance to flow and pressure difference between the venous vascular beds, including the splanchnic vena cava, and the right atrium: 

&lt;math&gt;F_{venousreturn} = \frac {P_{vb} - P_{ra}}{R_v}&lt;/math&gt;

Physically the circulation is like a pump connected to a slightly elastic pipe (arteries) that joins to a fluid resistance (vascular bed) that in turn links to a set of rather floppy, elastic bags (veins, liver etc.). The veins contain much of the blood so even a small slackening of the tone in the venous walls can lead to pooling of the blood in the veins outside the thoracic cavity. When this occurs, such as when standing suddenly on a hot day, the patient may faint (syncope). In practice the circulation is intermediate between an open and a closed fluid system, with many features of the open system.

[[Image:biomechanicsmodel.gif]]

In the short term venous return, and hence cardiac output, is maintained by a continuous modulation of venous tone. Blood pressure is maintained by adjusting both the venous return and the total peripheral resistance.  The total peripheral resistance is regulated largely through contracting the walls of arterioles.

In the longer term the volume of blood is probably the most important regulator of haemodynamic variables because this sets the pressures in the great veins and hence venous return. Pressures in the circulatory system can directly influence blood volume. Low arterial pressure causes the release of renin in the kidneys and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system causes an increase in sodium retention and hence blood volume. Atrial naturetic peptide is a hormone released as a result of stretching the right atrium and this causes a decrease in blood volume through sodium excretion. The control systems for blood pressure and cardiac output are complex and finely tuned so factors such as baroreflexes, lymphatic return, heart failure, elevated diuresis etc. can entirely mask blood volume changes over time.</text>

# From the Wikipedia entry:

The Great Indian Comedy Show is a half-hour standup and sketch comedy show in Hindi. The original episodes are aired three times a week (Monday to Wednesday), with reruns on Sunday evening, on Star One, which is a part of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Star TV network. It has been on air since October 2004, without any season breaks--the concept of seaons being entirely nonexistent on Indian television. The show is hosted by Shekhar Suman, in charge of the standup routines, and the ensemble cast for the sketches features various comedians of the Indian TV Industry.

The show is created by Sailesh Dave (pr. Dah-way), a well-known TV producer whose previous credaits include Movers &amp; Shakers, a talk show on Sony Entertainment Television (SET) from 1997-2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have found several discussions about -compensate, I will try to add more exactitude about this flag.

* compensate N.N (default 1.0) for descaling lightmap/vertex/grid data to compensate for ingame overbrighting. 4.0 is a good value for Quake 3 if used in combination with -gamma 2.2 


*if you're compiling for vq3, you could use -gamma 2 and -compensate 4 in addition to that line, hipshot...
there are explanations of -gamma elsewhere in the forum, screenshost showing the effect are here. Basically, -gamma fixes the shittiness of the overbright color ramp,   the end result being a truer range of color.
A side effect of -gamma is that overbrighting becomes extra extra gay. You can cheat that in vq3 with the -compensate switch. Use -compensate 4 and your -gamma map will look pretty in vq3 without forcing people playing it to turn r_overbrightbits off.
If you're compiling for games/mods that don't use overbrighting, you don't have to worry about -compensate.


*ydnar: -compensate compensates for r_mapOverbrightBits, not r_overbrightBits. The former controls lighting data scaling in the BSP, the latter sets screen gamma to set virtual overbrighting.


*...
-meta -vis -light -fast -gamma 1.4 -compensate 3 -bounce 8 -samples 3
with the gamma and compensate, I think they make the lightmaps look better but your need to tweak your light values in your shaders and map entities to use them, probably lower them by about 40%, also I don`t think those two options slow the compiles down but I might be wrong about that.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a plan for propadeutic lessons teaching the student the Greek alphabet and its pronunciation (including letter combinations like γκ etc.). The goal is to introduce letters one by one so as not to overwhelm the student. In order to raise his confidence and provide feelings of success, words used for illustration and exercises shall mostly be understandable without any knowledge of Greek: Greek words that come from English (e. g. κέικ), Greek words that other languages borrowed (e. g. δημοκρατία), common personal names (e. g. Άννα, Κώστας) and names of countries or places whose name is not very different in Greek (e. g. Ιράν, Αμερική).

The letters and diphthongs are the following (those already presented in the lessons are shown in bold characters):

'''α''' - '''ε''',αι - '''ι''','''η''','''υ''',ει,οι,υι - '''ο''','''ω''' - '''ου'''&lt;br /&gt;
αυ,ευ,ηυ&lt;br /&gt;
'''γκ/γγ''','''κ''','''γ''','''χ''' - '''μπ''','''π''','''β''','''φ''' - '''ντ''','''τ''','''δ''','''θ''' - '''τζ''',τσ,'''ζ''','''σ/ς''' - '''μ''','''ν''' -  '''λ''','''ρ'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''ξ''','''ψ'''

Besides, there is the stress symbol '''΄''' (τόνος) which is used to show which syllable is stressed, the diaeresis symbol '''¨''' (διαλυτικά) which is used to separate two vowels of a two-character vowel, while the question mark in Greek is like the English semicolon ''';''' (ερωτηματικό) and the Greek semicolon is written as an upper-dot '''·''' (άνω τελεία). Finally, the quotation marks are '''«''', '''»''' (εισαγωγικά).

Here's a proposed introduction order of letters, with example words that can be used. This is a work in progress. Please add more words and change the order of letters if it allows the introduction of more words earlier:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Implementing Search ==

=== Introduction ===

This article describes how to implement a basic content search in Umbraco.

Please send any comments or corrections to df at darren hyphen ferguson dot com.

=== Pre-Requisites ===

You should have some experience of creating Umbraco Templates and Document types.

You will need to download the following files:

Umbraco Utilities:
http://old.umbraco.org/frontpage/download/extensions/umbracoutilities.aspx [file no longer exists]

Umbraco XSLT Search:
http://www.learningmill.org/bonus/umbraco/SearchResults%201.0%20with%20XSLT.zip [file no longer exists - visit http://old.umbraco.org/frontpage/download/extensions/umbracoutilities/umbsearchresult.aspx for instructions][file no longer exists]

Finally, you'll need some pages in Umbraco. Obviously, if you don't have anything to search, you won't have any results!

=== Install Umbraco utilities ===

Rename the Umbraco utilities zip file that you downloaded and rename it as umbracoUtilities.umb (Windows sometimes automatically adds a .zip extension)

Log in to your Umbraco installation as a user that has access to the Developer tab.

Right click on the ''''Macros'''' Icon in the ''''Developer'''' pane and click ''''Import package''''.


[[Image:Importpackage.jpg]]


In the resulting popup window use the ''''Browse'''' button to locate umbracoUtilities.umb and then click the ''''Load Package'''' button.


[[Image:Importpackagepopup.jpg]]


On the following screen you will need to check the ''''Accept License'''' checkbox and click the ''''Install Package'''' button.


[[Image:Acceptlicense.jpg]]


Assuming that all goes well you will be presented with a confirmation screen telling you that Umbraco utilities was successfully installed.

You will be prompted to populate the Search index which you should do.

=== Creating a search form document type and template ===

In order to search Umbraco content you will need a form that makes an http post of a search term. The form input containing this search term should be named ''''search'''' and is typically an HTML input element with it's attribute type set to text.

You may include your form in a master template, or navigation XSLT file, but for the purpose of this turorial we will assume that the search form resides within it's own template.

Click on ''''Settings'''' in the Umbraco dashboard. in the ''''Settings'''' pane on the left hand side right click ''''Document Types'''' and then click ''''Create''''.


[[Image:Createdoctype.jpg]]


In the resulting popup window type ''''Search Form'''' (or whatever you like) into the ''''Name'''' text field and check the ''''Create matching template'''' checkbox. Click the ''''Create'''' button.


[[Image:Createnodetype.jpg]]


If you are familiar with Umbraco you may want to add some Tabs and Properties to your new Document Type at this point. If you are relatively new, don't worry, you can always come back and do this later.

In the ''''Settings'''' pane on the left hand side of the Umbraco GUI click on the plus icon to the left of the ''''Templates'''' folder to expand the list of templates. Locate and click on the ''''Search Form'''' template that you created in the previous step of this example.


[[Image:Choosesearchform.jpg]]


Paste the following into the ''''Template'''' textarea:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Search Umbraco&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;/result.aspx&quot;&gt;
			&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/form&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Click the ''''Save'''' icon (which looks like a floppy disk).

This is really basic web dev stuff, no trickery here. If you feel the need to add CSS classes, Javascript validation or anything else here, feel free. The only thing that you may need to modify is the form action. The action '''/result.aspx''' specified above assumes that you are able to create a page at the root of your umbraco content tree. Don't panic if you can't. I will mention how to replace this URL later.

=== Creating the search page ===

Click on the 'Content' icon in the Umbraco dash board. Right click on the Top level content node in the ''''Content'''' pane on the left hand side of the Umbraco GUI. Click ''''Create''''.


[[Image:Createsearchform.jpg]]


In the resulting ''''Create Page'''' popup select the ''''Search Form'''' Document type that you created in the previous step using the ''''Choose Document Type'''' drop down. In the name text field type ''''Search'''' and then click the create button.


[[Image:Createpage.jpg]]


'''Note:''' if you don't see your Document type in the list of options then there are obviously issues with how you have set up the structure of Document types within Umbraco. Resolving this problem is outside of the scope of this tutorial, but is quite simple to resolve and the fine folks on the Yahoo mailing list will no doubt set you straight within minutes.

We are starting to get somewhere now. You will see that the Search node has appeared in the ''''Content'''' pane on the left hand side of the Umbraco GUI. You will see that it is greyed out, so click on the ''''Save and publish'''' icon (a globe and a floppy disk combined).


[[Image:Searchpage.jpg]]


'''Note:''' It's a cosmetic issue, but you may not want your Search page icon to be a folder. You probably know how to change this, but if not it's back to the mailing list again.

We've nearly got this section wrapped up, but let's just check that our Search page works ok. Due to a small bug in Umbraco, you'll notice that the ''''Link to document'''' in the right hand frame of the GUI still says 'This item is not published'. To remedy this, click on your search page in the left hand ''''Content'''' pane and the ''''Link to document'''' should change to say '/search.aspx'.

Click on the ''''Link to document'''' URL and you should see something like this:

[[Image:Searchform.jpg]]

Ok, it isn't very pretty, but we are well on our way.

=== Creating a Search results document type and template ===

We created a document type and template for the search form and the basic steps for creating your Results document type and template are exactly the same. I'm not going to repeat all the diagrams here, so if you struggle, just use the step by step diagrams and instructions in the previous section.

In the settings section of Umbraco Create a document type called ''''Search Result'''' with a matching template.

In the ''''Content'''' section of Umbraco Create a page of type ''''Search Result'''' called 'Result'. Save and publish the page. Click on the page in the left hand ''''Content'''' pane so that you can see it's URL which confirms that it has been published (remember when i mentioned that you may want to change the form action? Well this is the url you need).

Now we have a search form that submits to a page that will show the search results. It's time for the final step. Adding the search functionality.

=== Adding search functionality ===

==== Creating the search XSLT ====

In the Umbraco ''''Sections'''' Pane, click on ''''Developer''''. In the ''''Developer'''' pane on the left hand side of the GUI right click ''''XSLT Files'''' and click ''''Create''''.


[[Image:Createxslt.jpg]]
 

In the resulting popup window Check the ''''Create Macro'''' checkbox and type ''''SearchResult'''' in the Filename text box. Click the ''''Create'''' button. '''Note:''' You can leave the ''''Choose a template'''' drop down as it is because we will be updating the newly created file in the next step.

Extract 'SearchResults 1.0 with XSLT.zip' to your local PC. Using your favourite text editor copy the contents of 'SearchResults.xslt' to your clipboard.

In Umbraco click on the SearchResult.xslt file that you have just just created in the ''''Developer'''' pane on the left hand side of the GUI. Paste the contents of your clipboard into ''''Source'''' textarea replacing the existing contents.


[[Image:Pastexsl.jpg]]


Click on the save icon (that looks like a floppy disk).

'''Note:''' There will be plenty of time to customise this XSL later, this tutorial just focuses on getting a basic search working.

==== Setting up the search Macro ====

In the ''''Developer'''' pane on the left hand side of the Umbraco GUI expand the list of Marcos by clicking on the plus icon next to the ''''Macros'''' folder. Locate the Macro that you created in the previous step (X S L T Search Result) and click on it.


[[Image:Selectmacro.jpg]]


'''Note:''' I am unsure why Umbraco adds the spacing into 'X S L T Search Result' but it doesn't matter.

Click on the ''''Parameters'''' tab and enter the following parameters for your Macro.

&lt;pre&gt;
ALIAS          NAME                           TYPE
------------   ----------------------------   ------------
source         Source                         contentTree
search         Search String                  text
maxPerPage     Results to display per page    number
searchFields   Umbraco fieldnames to search   text
page           Page Number                    text 
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should end up with a screen that looks like this:


[[Image:Macroparams.jpg]]


Ensure that you save the changes by clicking on the save icon (that looks like a floppy disc).

==== Insert the Macro into the Search Result Template ====

Let's go back and edit our ''''Search Result'''' template. In case you'd forgotten, you click on ''''Settings'''' in the Umbraco ''''Sections'''' pane and it's in the Templates folder.

Right now, it should be empty, so lets put some skeleton HTML in. Just paste the following into the ''''Template'''' textarea:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Search Umbraco&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
               
        &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Place your cursor in the textarea '''between''' the open and closing '''body''' HTML tags. Click on the ''''Insert Macro'''' button (the icon look like two angled HTML tag brackets, you will get a tooltip when you rollover the button the confirm it is the right one.


[[Image:Beforemacro.jpg]]


In the resulting popup window choose 'X S L T Search Result' from the drop down list and click ''''OK''''.


[[Image:Choosemacro.jpg]]


The following screen asks for some values for the Macro parameters. These demand a little explanation.


[[Image:Macroparamsb.jpg]]


By clicking on ''''Choose Item'''' next to the Source parameter you can browse Umbraco's content tree and specify a node under which the search should be performed. I have tried, but I can't seem to get this working from the root node. Maybe someone out there knows how?

The value '[@search]' in the ''''Search string'''' field tells us that the search term is going to be supplied as an part of the HTTP request (remember the text input called 'search' that we created in the form right at the beginning of the tutorial?).

''''Result to display per page'''' is exactly what it says. Just make sure that you specify a number. I've used 10 for this example.

''''Umbraco fieldnames to search'''' is again fairly self explanatory, but you will have to supply field names that are relevant to your own Umbraco installation. You can specify as many fields as you like as a comma delimited list.

''''Page Number'''' has the value '[@page]' which means that it will be part of the http request. The XSLT file we installed earlier takes care of paging through results, so you don't need to do anything special.

Click the OK button, and notice how Umbraco has inserted a Macro tag into our template.

The final '''But VERY IMPORTANT''' step is to surround the Marco tag with Umbracos 'ASPNET_FORM' tag so it looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?ASPNET_FORM&gt;
&lt;?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias=&quot;XSLTSearchResult&quot; source=&quot;-1&quot; search=&quot;[@search]&quot; maxPerPage =&quot;10&quot; searchFields=&quot;Keywords,Description&quot; page=&quot;[@page]&quot;&gt;&lt;/?UMBRACO_MACRO&gt;
&lt;/?ASPNET_FORM&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Thats it! Make sure that you save the changes to your template by clicking the save (floppy disc) icon.

=== Testing the Search ===

Browse back to the search page you created and have a go. If it doesn't work, then please let me know what I missed out in the article.

=== Conclusion ===

I hope you found this helpful.

Articles like this only evolve, if those who read it send me updates, errors, bugfixes and so on, or as this is a Wiki, just update as you see fit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[wikipedia:Python programming language|Python]] ==

The Pyhon code does not actually work: center is only set once to &lt;math&gt;len (seq) / 2&lt;/math&gt; and then never changes =&gt; the function will always return &lt;math&gt;- 2 - len (seq) / 2&lt;/math&gt; - unless &lt;math&gt;search &lt; seq [0]&lt;/math&gt;. 

This clearly shows that algorithm-code-snippets '''must always''' be accomplished by a test suite to be useful to the reader.

Of course only the [[Ada Programming]] authors make the effort. And to allow myself a little ranting: It show the difference between a community of software-engineers and community of code-hackers.

== [[wikipedia:C++ programming language|C++]] ==

I added two separate C++ implementations, one that is recursive and probably better for learning, and one that is generic.  The generic one should be good for people learning to write generic algorithms via C++ templates.

== Format ==

I think this should be the format of our book.

== Chu Nom and Chu Han ==

I put Han Nom after Quoc Ngu because they are not in common nowadays.--[[User:Muzmuz|Muzmuz]] ([[User talk:Muzmuz|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Muzmuz|contribs]]) 06:58, 10 September 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tonguing == 

The Tongue is used as an &quot;air stopper&quot; between the airstream (from the player's mouth) and the mouthpiece, a clarinetist never stops the airflow with her diaphragm, the air is merely interrupted by the tongue in a way specific to the musical context. It can be thought of as stones skipping over water, your tongue literally bouncing over air. 

==Exercise 1==
First exercise when we start tonguing is to set up the reed and the mouthpiece, as you normally would, but take it off the clarinet (with the barrel too) and begin to play long sustained notes allowing each to be about 8-10 seconds long, now when you want to shortly interrupt the sound, while blowing (playing notes) use the tip of the tongue and make the consonant sound of the letter &quot;t&quot; (if you find that &quot;t&quot; doesn't float your boat, use &quot;d&quot;). This is only a tiny interruption in the sound and should be approx 1/64 of a beat (a minute amount). 
You have now learned the basic legato tonguing, this is used in situations for example when you have a bar of ta's (Crotchets- For all those non-French note value people) that are just a bar of ta's, they are separated by a light tongue in an even manner. It would be appropriate to practice the tonguing of ta's or 2 beat notes (Crotchets or minums) with your mouthpiece/barrel setup and then move on to Tee-Tees (quavers, grouped into 2's) with the sound &quot;t t&quot; and learn to control the speed and dynamic of your tonguing. Then move on to music, put your clarinet together and play a song all tongued and then play it all slurred, and then play it as written. You will get better and find out how your tongue is most comfortable with practice.

'''Part 3: FABRICATION PROCESSES'''

[[w:Fabrication_%28semiconductor%29| Microfabrication]] is largely concerned with making microchips by batch processing silicon (and an increasing number of different materials) wafers into individual chips in a cleanroom facility. Cleanrooms are used because dust must be avoided. The parts of a microchip are much smaller than the average dust particle, and a single particle can wreak havoc in a sensitive process (not only making a fault at some point on the wafer, but also contaminating process equipment)
The processes can roughly be divided into Additive and etching processes that wither add or remove material, and lithography that creates patterns on the surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women have two, conflicting instincts when choosing men. On the one hand, women have the natural imperative to select optimal genetic traits, one way of making that selection easy is through hierarchically superior men, a.k.a. &quot;alpha&quot; males. On the other hand, women want men who can materially provide for their families, commit to a long-term relationship, and enjoy interacting with children, a.k.a. &quot;good relationship skills.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

== &quot;Alpha&quot; Males ==
&lt;p&gt;What kind of &quot;alpha&quot; male are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a gorilla, you're big and strong. You're twice the size of a female. You establish your physical dominance over any male you meet. You live with your harem of two to five females. Your females are monogamously faithful to you. Your penis is one inch long. Sex is quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a gibbon, you mate monogamously for life. You live with your mate and your children. You sing to your mate. She sings back to let you know where she is. You and your mate are the same size and look identical. You start each morning with a half-hour of loud hooting to frighten other gibbons away from your forty acres of forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a chimpanzee, you live in a group of fifty individuals. When a female is ovulating, she has sex with every male in the group. You have a large penis, large testicles, and ejaculate lots of sperm. You reproduce not because you dominate females or other males, but because your sperm is more active than other males' sperm (i.e., you're healthier than other males).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a baboon, you live in a troop that varies from 10 to 200 individuals, depending on habitat, time of year, and predation.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, J. E. 1969. &quot;Natural primate troops and stochastic population models,&quot; ''American Naturalist'' 103:455-477. Cohen, J. E. 1971. &quot;Social grouping and troop size in yellow baboons,&quot; ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress of Primatology'', 1970 March 2-5 3:58-64. Cohen, J. E. 1972. &quot;Aping monkeys with mathematics,&quot; In  Tuttle, R. ed. ''The Functional and Evolutionary Biology of Primates''. Aldine-Atherton, Chicago. Samuels, A. and Altmann, J. 1991. &quot;Baboons of the Amboseli basin: demographic stability and change,&quot; ''International Journal of Primatology'' 12:1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; You make friends with other males. When another male threatens you, your friends back you up. You avoid fighting. Fighting leads to injuries, and lions eat injured baboons.&lt;ref&gt;Sapolsky, Robert. &quot;Gorilla Tactics,&quot; ''Men’s Health'', March 2002, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt; You also make friends with females. Female baboons mate with their male friends. They like males who have many friends.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Women Go For Tail Feathers ===

&lt;p&gt;Among the Ach&amp;eacute; hunter-gatherers of Paraguay, the men hunt big-game animals. They bring home a big animal about one day in ten. They return empty-handed the other days. Men, on median, bring in 4,663 calories per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ach&amp;eacute; women gather plants and small animals, and care for their children (see [[../How Our Ancestors Lived/]]). The amount of food a woman brings home depends only on how many hours she spends laboriously picking and processing foods. Women, on average, bring in 10,356 calories per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an Ach&amp;eacute; man brings home a deer, he shares it with other families, not only with his wife and children. Why do Ach&amp;eacute; men hunt large animals, only to give away this relatively rare food? Why not help their wives gather food? Such a man could easily bring home enough plants and small animals for two wives and their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ach&amp;eacute; women view big-game hunting like peahens view peacocks' tail feathers. Big-game hunting shows that a man is physically and mentally fit. Giving away meat shows that he has more than enough strength and skill to survive. Women like men with many friends, and giving away meat maintains friendships. Men give meat to lower-status individuals to show their superior place in the social hierarchy (see [[../Communication Styles#The Great Male Hierarchy|The Great Male Hierarchy]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extramarital sex isn't unusual among the Ach&amp;eacute;. When asked who had fathered their children, Ach&amp;eacute; women named, on average, 2.1 possible fathers for each child. On the list of possible fathers, the best hunters' names came up most often.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Status ===

&lt;p&gt;Women prefer high-status men.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary Psychology (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, ISBN 0-205-19358-7), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In workplace affairs, men are equally likely to have sex with a superior or subordinate woman. Women, in contrast, are seven times more likely to have sex with superior, rather than subordinate, men.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ofﬁce Sex &amp; Romance Survey,&quot; special to MSNBC, May 8, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious}}

&lt;p&gt;Many societies expect the sons of leaders to become leaders. Women who want &quot;alpha&quot; sons marry &quot;alpha&quot; husbands. E.g., the 2000 presidential election was between the son of a president, the son of a senator, the son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals, and the son of a wealthy banker (George W. Bush, Al Gore, John McCain, and Bill Bradley).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To attract women, improve your social status. Give away stuff to make friends. Help less-fortunate individuals, to show that you're above average. Lead groups, e.g., captain your softball team. Dress well, Speak well.

=== Money ===

&lt;p&gt;If money attracted women, Bill Gates would be sexier than the Beatles in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women are conflicted about money. Women want &quot;alpha&quot; males who show off their money like peacocks show off their tail feathers, e.g., buying a round of drinks in a bar. But women also want &quot;relationship&quot; men who put their paychecks into a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show off your money to attract a woman's attention. Then talk about the home you're buying to make her want a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hunter-gatherer ancestors owned nothing but what they could carry to the next campsite. Accumulation of wealth wasn't possible. Women's cerebral cortexes have learned to appreciate accumulated wealth, but their brains aren't hardwired for this. In a conflict, women tend to choose their more basic instinct&amp;#151;love&amp;#151;instead of their newer appreciation of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Confidence and Stress ===

&lt;p&gt;Ach&amp;eacute; men gamble on bringing home a deer one day in ten, instead of choosing the safety of helping their wives gather food. Gambling&amp;#151;and a man's life in general&amp;#151;is stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mammals produce glucocorticoid hormones in stressful situations. Too much glucocorticoid causes health problems. In male and female primates, high-status individuals produce minimal glucocorticoid in stressful situations. Low-status individuals produce too much glucocorticoid.&lt;ref&gt;Sapolsky, Robert M. &quot;Hormonal correlates of personality and social contexts: from non-human to human primates,&quot; in &lt;i&gt;Hormones, Health, and Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, edited by C. Panter-Brick and C.M. Worthman (Cambridge, 1999, ISBN 0-521-57332-7), 18-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress&amp;#151;&quot;the fear of fear itself&quot;&amp;#151;physically hurts low-status individuals. Stress doesn't affect the health of high-status individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confident men&amp;#151;who believe that their powers or circumstances can handle stressful situations&amp;#151;attract women.&lt;ref&gt;Louis, Ron. ''SEXpectations'' (MPC, 1997, ISBN 0961317744), 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  To attract women and improve your health, take a stress-reduction class. Learn to handle stressful situations with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common belief that men are hardwired to be alone (&quot;go to their caves&quot;) after a stressful day and that women are hardwired to talk to a supportive partner is a misconception. The former is the ''avoidant attachment style'' and the latter is the ''secure attachment style''. It's true that attachment styles are hardwired in adults, and it's true that this distinction is of paramount importance in relationships (mismatched partners have more relationship difficulties, and avoidant individuals have more relationship difficulties in general) but the hardwiring results from the individuals genetics and childhood peer influences. Men and women can have either attachment style.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Looks, Height, and Strength ===

&lt;p&gt;Women rate tall, strong, athletic males as &quot;very desirable&quot; marriage partners. Women are almost twice as likely to value physical strength in men, as men are to value physical strength in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most women have to be realistic and would settle for a male just slightly taller than themselves, whilst prefering men with feminine-looking faces. E.g., women prefer Leonardo DiCaprio to Tom Selleck.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, G. Hickford, C., Jeffrey, L. &quot;Sex-typicality and attractiveness: Are supermale and superfemale faces super-attractive?&quot; ''British Journal of Psychology'', 91, 125-140 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American women prefer men 5'11&quot; (180.34 cm) or taller.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. ''Evolutionary Psychology'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, ISBN 0-205-19358-7), p. 117; &quot;Tall men 'top husband stakes',&quot; BBC News, 14 August, 2002, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2190461.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Tall men receive more personal ad responses than short men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're short, study Japanese. Then vacation on Guam, the Hawaii-like American island where Japanese women vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never-married women are more likely to prefer physical attractiveness. Conversely, divorced and widowed women are more likely to select good character over physical attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Language Skills ===

&lt;p&gt;Men with good language skills attract women.  Women love talking. To improve your language skills, take a creative writing class. Or memorize a few romantic poems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or learn a foreign language. The words ''conjugate''&amp;#151;to form variations of a verb&amp;#151;and ''conjugal''&amp;#151;relating to marriage&amp;#151;come from the same root word. Foreign women will think that a man who can conjugate verbs correctly in their language will make a good husband.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Age ===

&lt;p&gt;Women select personal ads primarily by age.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. ''Evolutionary Psychology'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, ISBN 0-205-19358-7), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Women select men who are, on average, three and a half years older. Older men, in general, have more social status and emotional maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worldwide average age difference between brides and grooms is three years. Americans marry closer in age.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Abstract of the United States (U S. Department of Commerce), Table 56, &quot;Married Couples by Differences in Ages Between Husband and Wife: 1999&quot; www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/statab/sec01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1890, the average age at which men first married was 26. Women married at 22.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/ms-la/tabms-2.txt No data were recorded during World War Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first half of the twentieth century, increasing affluence enabled younger men to support families. Secondary education and increased leisure time facilitated dating. Dating sometimes led to sex, pregnancy, and early marriage. In 1956, men married at 22, women at 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA approved oral contraceptives in 1956. The U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973. Women delayed motherhood to start careers.&lt;ref&gt;Murstein, Bernard. ''Paths to Marriage'' (Sage, 1986, ISBN 0803923821), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, men married at 27, women at 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couples now live together from the age that their parents' generation married. The average man now first lives with a woman, either in marriage or as an unmarried couple, for the first time at 22. The average woman moves in with a man at age 20 or 21.&lt;ref&gt;Laumann, Edward O., Gagnon, John H., Michael, Robert T., Michaels, Stuart. ''The Social Organization Of Sexuality: Sexual Practices In The United States'' (University of Chicago, 1994, ISBN 0-226-46957-3), 477-479.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couples that marry younger than 25 have dramatically higher divorce rates.&lt;ref&gt;Parker-Pope, Tara. &quot;How Eye-Rolling Destroys A Marriage; Researchers Try to Predict Divorce Rate,&quot; ''The Wall Street Journal'', August 6, 2002, p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt; Our brains' prefrontal lobes don't mature until 25.&lt;ref&gt;Amen, Daniel G. ''Making a Good Brain Great: The Amen Clinic Program for Achieving and Sustaining Optimal Mental Performance'' (Harmony, 2005, ISBN 1400082080).&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;executive decisions&quot; brain area is where we make good judgments. Automobile insurance rates drop at 25 because drivers with mature prefrontal lobes get into fewer accidents. Similarly, men and women make better relationship decisions after 25. (If you want to marry younger than 25, and you live in a culture where it is accepted to ask your parents to arrange a marriage for you, then give it a try; That idea sounds radical but it has worked for thousands of years.)&lt;/p&gt;

== Relationship Skills ==
Women want men who'll stay in a faithful, long-term relationship. But a woman can't predict a man's behavior twenty years in the future. Women instead look for signs that a man is relationship material.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Predictability ===

&lt;p&gt;Women prefer men who have a steady job, are dependable, and are emotionally stable.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. ''Evolutionary Psychology'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, ISBN 0-205-19358-7), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; A predictable man may be boring, but a woman feels that she can predict his behavior twenty years into the future. Unpredictable, &quot;flighty&quot; men turn off women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., if you want to date a certain waitress, eat at her restaurant every day for months, at the same time each day, ask for the same table, and order the same meal (and leave the same big tip).&lt;/p&gt;

=== Home Ownership ===

&lt;p&gt;One of the highest factors correlating with likelihood of a man to marry is home ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, K.M., South, S.J. &quot;Contextual Inﬂuences on Young Men's Transition to First Marriage,&quot; ''Social Forces'', 74 (1996), page 1110.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own a home, when asking a woman out, give her your business card and write your home address on the back. She'll drive by and look at your home. On a date, talk about your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't own a home, say that you've been looking at homes to buy. Women enjoy talking about buying homes.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Family Relationships ===

&lt;p&gt;Another sign that a man will be a good husband and father is his relationship with his family. Show women photos of yourself playing with your nieces and nephews. Invite your date to meet your siblings or cousins and their nieces and nephews (meeting your parents and grandparents is less effective).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men positively interacting with children attract women. Men who ignore a child in distress turn off women. Women's favorite pinups show bare-chested, muscled men holding smiling babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men have no preference for women interacting with children versus women alone.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. ''Evolutionary Psychology'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, ISBN 0-205-19358-7), 121-123.&lt;/ref&gt; E.g., men like pinups of bare-chested women, but not holding babies.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Astrology and Personality Types ===

&lt;p&gt;Astrology and personality types fascinate women. They hope to predict the future of their relationships. However, zodiac astrology is a pseudoscience and should not be relied on for important life decisions. Personality types, on the other hand, are real and demonstrable. Talk about personality types on dates (see [[../Emotional Control Systems|Personality Types]]). &lt;/p&gt;

== Emotional Connection ==

&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal lobes (part of the cerebral cortex) enable affect-regulation, or the&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|ability to regulate our emotional reactions, control our impulses, or moderate the survival reflexes of our ancient reptilian system.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. ''The Biology of Transcendence: A Blueprint Of The Human Spirit'' (Park Street, 2002, ISBN 0-89281990-1), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;|Joseph Chilton Pearce, ''The Biology of Transcendence'' (2002)}}

&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal lobes are our most recently evolved brain area.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. ''The Biology of Transcendence: A Blueprint Of The Human Spirit'' (Park Street, 2002, ISBN 0-89281990-1), 40-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the last area to develop in each individual&amp;#151;maturing between the ages of 15 and 25.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. ''The Biology of Transcendence: A Blueprint Of The Human Spirit'' (Park Street, 2002, ISBN 0-89281990-1), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women want emotionally mature men. An emotionally mature man changes his emotions as situations change&amp;#151;or to change a situation. Although his limbic brain experiences a wide range of emotions, his higher self (his prefrontal lobes) stays constant. Such an individual is capable of a long-term relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., in ''Roxanne'' (1987), a man insults Steve Martin. Martin at first shows anger at the insult. But then he switches to humor. Martin first makes jokes about himself. Then he switches the subject of his wit to the other man, making a crowd laugh at the man. The other man shows only one emotion&amp;#151;anger&amp;#151;in response to each of Martin's changing emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that your emotions are like a car with a standard transmission. To shift from one emotion to another, you shift through neutral. In neutral, you quiet one emotion before shifting to another emotion. When you quiet your own emotions, you can feel your partner's emotions. Buddhists call this state ''egoless''. Christians say ''selfless''. When you feel your partner's emotions, you can select the best emotion for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Fear Reduces Us to Reptilian Responses ===

&lt;p&gt;You meet an attractive woman. Your cerebral cortex imagines your friends' envy if she goes out with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your limbic brain fears that she'll reject you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your reptilian brain wants to have sex with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a conflicted brain, the older brain area wins. You're capable of having sex with her. Your reptilian brain is perfectly functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your limbic brain is warning, &quot;Don't emotionally connect with her! You'll get hurt!&quot; You're unable to feel her emotional state. She seems like a beautiful statue in a museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've locked out your cerebral cortex. Language is a cerebral cortex activity, so you can only stare at her breasts and mumble incoherently.

{{quote|When integrated, [the triune brain] offers us an open-ended potential; an ability to rise and go beyond all constraint or limitation. But when that integration fails, our mind is a house divided against itself, our behavior a paradoxical civil war&amp;#151;and we become our own worst enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. &lt;i&gt;The Biology of Transcendence: A Blueprint Of The Human Spirit&lt;/i&gt; (Park Street, 2002, ISBN 0-89281990-1), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;|Joseph Chilton Pearce, ''The Biology of Transcendence'' (2002)}}

=== Developing Awareness of Choices ===

&lt;p&gt;Cerebral cortex activity won't get you out of an internal conflict. E.g., repeating positive statements (&lt;i&gt;affirmations&lt;/i&gt;) while blocking awareness of your emotional state won't help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, connect to your limbic brain. Feel your emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow down. When you react quickly, your brain selects &lt;i&gt;myelinated&lt;/i&gt; or habitual responses. Instead of going with your first reaction, pause and breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine your choices. Imagine alternative responses.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|No one needs to be completely hemmed in by circumstances; no one needs to be the victim of his biography.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, George. ''The Psychology Of Personal Constructs'', (Routledge, 1955, ISBN 0415037980).&lt;/ref&gt;|George Kelly, ''The Psychology of Personal Constructs'' (1955)}}

&lt;p&gt;Think through your general fear to specific fears. E.g., you fear that she'll say that you're too old for her. Imagine different responses you could make to that rejection:&lt;/p&gt;
When Hugh Hefner first asked Barbi Benton out, she said, &quot;Well, I've, uh, never dated anyone over 23 before.&quot;
Hef responded without hesitation, &quot;That's okay. Neither have I.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Michael. &quot;The Young and the Rest,&quot; ''Screw'', January 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll no longer feel fear. What seemed like an insurmountable problem now looks like a variety of choices, each leading to a positive conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagining different possible futures is a cerebral cortex activity. Feeling emotions is a limbic brain activity. Imagining your emotions in various scenarios connects your cerebral cortex and limbic brain. You unblock your internal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Play a Game ===

&lt;p&gt;When an unexpected event upsets you, the problem isn't the event. The problem is that you don't know how to respond. When you're upset you fail to see positive opportunities. You see only that your plans are blocked. Instead, stay flexible and look for opportunities in unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a man sees a woman sitting in a bar booth. He walks over, bends down to talk to her, and bonks his head on a lampshade hanging over the table. Momentarily stunned, he stands there while the lampshade swings back and bonks his head a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says, &quot;Excuse me. Let me do this again.&quot; He returns to his bar stool. He comes back to the woman, puts his hand calmly on the lampshade, bends down, and introduces himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened to one of my friends. He and the woman dated for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He managed his fear by playing a game. Play boosts emotional experience, and develops relationships with other individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children play obvious games. Adults play subtle games. Let's make my friend's game more obvious:&lt;/p&gt;

; Shift to a pretend world. : He said, in effect, &quot;I'm going to ''pretend'' to meet you.&quot; In pretend worlds we're less afraid of showing emotions.

; Focus on a bipolar construct. : Psychologists call a pair of opposite ideas a ''bipolar construct''. A literature major would say ''irony''. Whatever you call it, when an individual does two, opposite things at the same time, we laugh. In this game, the bipolar construct was being cool vs. being clumsy.

; Exaggerate emotions. : If my friend had played the game to entertain a child, he would've amplified his emotions. E.g., he returns to his bar stool. Then he pretends to see the woman for the first time. His eyes pop open and his jaw drops. His hand shakes and he nearly spills his beer in his lap. He exaggerates preening in the bar mirror, then swaggers over.

; Repeat the game : If he were playing the game to entertain a child, he'd bonk his head on the lampshade&amp;#151;three times. Then he'd repeat the skit. He could repeat it thirty times and the child would laugh every time.

; Exchange roles. : If he were entertaining a child, he'd trade places with the child. The child would pretend to be clumsy Joe Cool.

; Make your game physical and unstructured. : Children play physical, unstructured, non-competitive games. Adults play abstract, non-physical, structured, competitive games, e.g., spectator sports, casino gambling, ballroom dancing, and board games. My friend's game was physical (bonking his head on the lampshade) and unstructured (he didn't hand out a sheet of rules).

; Schedule playtime. : For your next party, tell your guests that the first hour will be games, e.g., Twister.

=== Laugh to Connect Your Limbic Brain and Cerebral Cortex ===

&lt;p&gt;Only humans laugh. Other animals express emotions as they occur. Our emotional regulation stops us from suddenly expressing unexpected emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cerebral cortex sends emotions it doesn't know how to regulate to our speech area, and we laugh. We associate laughter with humor because humor is always unexpected. But humor isn't one emotion. Humor is any emotion we can't regulate. Because different individuals regulate different emotions well or poorly, different individuals laugh at different events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sense of humor attracts women. Laugh in emotional situations, e.g., when you do something embarrassing. Laughing connects your limbic brain and cerebral cortex, enabling better awareness of your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Reveal a Secret to Emotionally Connect ===

&lt;p&gt;In 1957, a young man arrived in Nashville. He stuttered, but played guitar, and could sing without stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon he had a job performing with Minnie Pearl, the country comedienne. Pearl encouraged him to talk on stage. He refused, afraid that the audience would laugh at his speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pearl replied:&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|Let 'em laugh. Goodness gracious, laughs are hard to get and I'm sure that they're laughing with you and not against you, Melvin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nefsky1997&quot;&gt;Nefsky, Art. Letter from Mel Tillis, Sept. 30, 1997, http://www.nefsky.com/tillis.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;p&gt;The singer developed humorous routines about his stuttering. Audiences laughed. His career took off.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|Word began to circulate around Nashville about this young singer from Florida who could write songs and sing, but stuttered like hell when he tried to talk. The next thing I knew I was being asked to be on every major television show in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nefsky1997&quot;/&gt;|Mel Tillis}}

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to share a secret. Women share secrets with girlfriends to emotionally connect (see [[../Communication Styles#Women's Support Circles|Women's Support Circles]]). But don't whine about your problems. Instead, talk confidently about a secret to show that you've turned a weakness into strength.&lt;/p&gt;

== Entertainment Skills ==

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment expresses emotions. Effective entertainers emotionally connect with their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment integrates limbic brain emotions with cerebral cortex imagination. When an entertainer expresses an old emotion in a new way, we applaud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other animals do the same mating rituals generation after generation. E.g., peahens never get bored watching peacocks show off their tail feathers. Like peahens, older women enjoy 300-year-old operas. But young women want only new music, the latest clothes, and the coolest actors. Their greatest put-down is &quot;that's so ten minutes ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|Mankind might well be a tool-making and tool-using species, but nothing so separates us from the lower animals than our almost comic enthusiasm for the new, new thing.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Nick. &quot;New Machines&amp;#151;New Dreams and New Worries,&quot; ''The Wall Street Journal'', February 27, 2002, p. A18.&lt;/ref&gt;|Nick Schultz, editor of TechCentralStation.com}}

&lt;p&gt;Effective entertainers have integrated brains. Conversely, to improve your brain integration, develop your entertainment skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertaining men attract women. When a man's performance makes a woman feel emotionally connected, her limbic brain tells her that she's in a long-term relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman with an integrated brain responds, &quot;I want a long-term relationship with this man. I'll buy his CDs (or watch his movies). I'll feel as if I've known him for years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman with a poorly integrated brain might try to have a physical relationship with the man, even though her cerebral cortex tells her that he'll never commit to a relationship with her. In a conflicted brain, the older area wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment skills can make women ignore a man's faults. E.g., Woody Allen's sense of humor attracts women, even though he's small, scrawny, and married his stepdaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Soon-Yi Previn is the adopted sister of Woody Allen’s biological son Satchel (now Seamus) Farrow. Westbrook, Bryan. &quot;Frequently Asked Questions About Woody Allen,&quot; http://www.geocities.com/~madcap/Woody/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; (At least he's a family man.)&lt;/p&gt;

=== Women's Entertainment Skills ===

&lt;p&gt;Male entertainers, in general, have both male and female fans. Female entertainers, until recently, had only female fans, and had fewer fans than male entertainers. E.g., your local ballet company has fewer fans than your professional basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Masculine individuals (generally, but not always, men) use entertainment skills to attract sexual partners. Feminine individuals (generally, but not always, women) use entertainment skills to keep a partner in a long-term relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a woman who makes her husband laugh each day, and makes his heart ache when she sings lullabies to their children, has a husband who's not going to leave her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legendary King Shahryar took a new woman to bed each night, and then killed each woman in the morning. One woman saved herself by telling a story with a cliffhanger ending. Shahrazad kept this up night after night, spinning Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Sinbad the Sailor, and other stories into ''One Thousand and One Arabian Nights'' (circa A.D. 1000).&lt;/p&gt;

=== Truth and Lying in Art and Entertainment ===

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment skills increase reproductive success so effectively (i.e., get women to have sex with men, and get men to stay with women) that sexual selection for entertainment skills may have driven our ancestors to evolve larger cerebral cortexes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Geoffrey F. ''The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature'' (Doubleday, 2000, ISBN 0385495161).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art and entertainment are lies, from the point of view of the liar. E.g., when an actor playing Hamlet says that he's going to kill his stepfather, the actor isn't threatening his stepfather's life. A painter creates an image that looks real, but isn't. A poem makes us visualize a scene we don't see. Novels and movies take us into worlds we've never experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But art and entertainment are truthful, from the point of view of the audience. Effective artists and entertainers communicate emotions that &quot;strike a chord&quot; in the listener or viewer. They tell the truth not about themselves&amp;#151;e.g., you don't want to know that an actor is afraid of forgetting his lines, or is hoping that a movie producer might be in the audience and offer him a better-paying job&amp;#151;but instead quiet their own emotions and emote the audience's feelings.&lt;

=== Religion and Evolution ===

&lt;p&gt;Art, entertainment, religion, and reproductive success are entwined.{{citation needed}} Religious men and women sing in church or synagogue, dramatically recite Bible stories, dance at rituals, etc. Most societies encourage religious men, e.g., rabbis, to marry and produce large families. Men prefer to marry religious women, because they're more likely to be sexually faithful.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors' sexual preference for partners with deeply moving emotional skills may have driven them to evolve brains capable of spiritual thought. I.e., evolution enabled humans to think spirituality, and, conversely, spiritual thinking may have driven human evolution.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

===Consumerism as Runaway Sexual Selection===

&lt;p&gt;For our ancestral fathers, entertainment was &quot;do it yourself.&quot; Dinner was killing and roasting an animal. After dinner, they played music, danced, or told epics of their heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|Now consider what happens in modern courtship. We take our dates to restaurants where we pay professional chefs to cook them great food, or to dance clubs where professional musicians excite their auditory systems, or to films where professional actors entertain them with vicarious adventures. The chefs, musicians, and actors do not actually have sex with our dates. They just get paid. We get the sex if the date goes well. Of course, we still have to talk in modern courtship, and we still have to look reasonably good. But the market economy shifts much of the courtship effort from us to professionals. To pay the professionals, we have to make money, which means getting a job. The better our education, the better our job, the more money we make, and the better the vicarious courtship we can afford. Consumerism turns the tables on ancestral patterns of human courtship.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Geoffrey F. &lt;i&gt;The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature&lt;/i&gt; (Doubleday, 2000, ISBN 0385495161), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;|Geoffrey Miller, ''The Mating Mind'' (2000)}}

{{quote|I can't stand dinner and a movie.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Julia. &quot;Centerfolds On Sex,&quot; ''Playboy'', May 2001, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;|Julia Schultz, ''Playboy'' centerfold}}

{{quote|Onstage, I make love to 25,000 people&amp;#151;then I go home alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janisjoplin.net/kozmic/quotes.html&lt;/ref&gt;|Janis Joplin}}

&lt;p&gt;Consumerism hotwires our brains' relationship circuits. Cars, shopping malls, television, and Julia Schultz's ''Playboy'' poses hit these neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women are especially susceptible to consumerism.{{citation needed}} E.g., on eBay, women described 11% of their shoes as &quot;sexy.&quot; Men described only 0.005% of their shoes as &quot;sexy.&quot;{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumerism makes us work longer hours to buy more stuff for our mates. Women have less time to exercise and look attractive. Men have less time to practice entertainment skills. Couples have less time together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of consumerism range from environmental destruction to anti-American hatred. Runaway consumerism&amp;#151;not war, crime, or disease&amp;#151;is the greatest threat to human survival.{{citation needed}} Focus on relationships, not buying stuff. You'll be happier and your grandchildren will have a planet to live on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If human existence were as long as two copies of this book, for all but the last page of the second book&amp;#151;10,000 years&amp;#151;humans lived in small bands of hunter-gatherers. Archaeologists call this era the Paleolithic, or &quot;early Stone Age.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

== Idyllic Lifestyle ==

&lt;p&gt;The hunter-gatherer lifestyle is better than the agricultural lifestyle in many ways. Hunter-gatherers moved around. They saw new vistas and ate different foods. Most appealing, they met other groups of people. In contrast, farmers are stuck in one place all their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherer diets were nutritious. They ate a wide variety of meat, fish, and plants. For example, the Yupic natives of coastal Alaska ate more than thirty species of mammals, birds, fish, and shellfish.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, Alice B. ''North American Indians: A Comprehensive Account'', 2nd Edition (Prentice Hall, 1992, ISBN 0-13-624362-2).&lt;/ref&gt; Starvation wasn't an issue in places with multiple food sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, agricultural diets are mostly corn, potatoes, wheat, or rice. These starchy foods lack protein, vitamins, and minerals. Better diets made our hunter-gatherer ancestors bigger (with bigger brains) than many modern people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men enjoyed hunting. They skillfully crafted weapons. They roamed far from home. They used intelligence to find animals. They used speed and strength to kill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women enjoyed socializing while gathering plants, snaring small game, and preparing food. Their children played around them, or stayed in camp with their elderly relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherers had many hours of leisure. Climates that required minimal shelter and clothing had little of the &quot;housework&quot; of our culture. In harsh climates, people could do little in the winter or during storms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small populations lived in large areas. Contagious diseases were unlikely to spread. Changing camps&amp;#151;before waste accumulated&amp;#151;stopped endemic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many cultures describe their ancestors as coming from an idyllic Garden of Eden or &quot;land of milk and honey.&quot; These ancestral memories may be true.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Margaret. ''Women in Prehistory'' (Univ of Oklahoma, 1989, ISBN 0806122374), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Roman Cornelius Tacitus described a hunter-gatherer tribe in first-century Lithuania, as&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|astonishingly savage and disgustingly poor. They have no proper weapons, no horses, no homes. They eat wild herbs....The women support themselves by hunting, exactly like the men....Yet they count their lot happier than that of others who groan over field labor.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Cornelius. ''The Agricola and the Germania'' (Viking, 1971, ISBN 0140442413), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;|Tacitis, ''Germania'' (circa A.D. 100)}}

&lt;p&gt;People continue to live as hunter-gatherers in northern Canada, the Australian outback, and central Africa. Contemporary hunter-gatherers live only on land that no one else wants, e.g., deserts, jungles, or frozen tundra. Their lives are difficult not because they're hunter-gatherers, but because they live on the worst land. 10,000 years ago, our ancestors lived good lives on abundant, temperate lands.&lt;/p&gt;

== Egalitarian Groups ==

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherers were egalitarian. A large animal has more meat than one family can eat. A hunter loses nothing by giving away the extra meat to other families. When the hunter comes home empty-handed, he can expect other men to share their kills. Because hunter-gatherers can't store meat, they measure wealth by social connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Matt. ''The Red Queen'' (Penguin, 1995, ISBN 0140245480).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherers couldn't accumulate wealth. They couldn't store food. They didn't build permanent houses. Each person owned only what he could carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With nothing to steal, violence was minimal and warfare nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men and women were equally responsible for producing food. They had equal status in hunter-gatherer societies. Hunter-gatherer societies have fixed gender roles, but everyone learns all basic skills for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each individual had equal opportunities to speak to the group. Each individual made his own decisions. A band that disagreed about a decision could split into two groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Margaret. ''Women in Prehistory'' (Univ of Oklahoma, 1989, ISBN 0806122374), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older people were libraries of knowledge, before the invention of writing. A band with an old woman might survive a flood or a drought, because she remembered what people did when a similar disaster happened decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children learned by observing adults, not through rote learning. Adults raised children to think independently. Children had to survive in case of disaster or separation from the group. Because hunter-gatherers live in small bands, boys and girls play together and behave more alike than children in larger societies.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Judith Rich. ''The Nurture Assumption'' (Touchstone Books, 1998, ISBN 0684857073), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limited Polygyny ==

&lt;p&gt;Most hunter-gatherers were monogamous. Most hunters could provide only enough meat for one wife and her children. The best hunters could support two wives (polygyny).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tacitus described a Neolithic (late Stone Age) German tribe as having&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|One wife apiece&amp;#151;all of them except a very few who take more than one not to satisfy their desires, but because their exalted rank brings many pressing offers of matrimonial alliances. The dowry is brought by husband to wife...gifts [such as] oxen, a horse and bridle, or a shield, spear and sword...she in turn brings a present of arms to her husband.&amp;#133;The woman must not think that she is excluded from aspirations to manly virtues or exempt from the hazards of warfare.&amp;#133;She enters her husband's home to be the partner of his toils and perils, that both in peace and war she is to share his sufferings and adventures.&amp;#133;Clandestine love-letters are unknown to men and women alike. Adultery is extremely rare.&amp;#133;Girls too are not hurried into marriage. As old and full-grown as the men they match their mates in age and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Cornelius. The Agricola and the Germania (Viking, 1971, ISBN 0140442413), 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;|Tacitus, ''Germania'' (circa A.D. 100)}}

== Were Our Ancestors Monogamous or Polygamous? ==

&lt;p&gt;Biological and anthropological evidence suggests that our ancestral mothers were mildly polyandrous, i.e., women had more than one male sexual partner per birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female gorillas are monogamous. Gorilla testes are one-quarter of the size of human testes (adjusted for body size). In contrast, female chimpanzees average 13 male sex partners per birth. Chimpanzee testes are three times the size of human testes (adjusted for body size). The size of human testes suggests that our ancestral mothers had several male sexual partners per birth.&lt;/p&gt;

As [[../How Women Select Men#Women Go For Tail Feathers|noted]], the Ach&amp;eacute; hunter-gatherers are moderately polyandrous, with each child having, on average, 2.1 possible fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''Why Is Sex Fun?'' (BasicBooks, 1997), p.98.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biological and anthropological evidence also suggests that our ancestors were mildly polygynous, i.e., that men fathered children with more than one woman. In polygynous species, e.g., gorillas, males are bigger than females (''sexual dimorphism''). Males that win fights with other males mate with several females. Male gorillas are twice the size of females. In contrast, among monogamous species, e.g., gibbons, small males breed as often as large males. Gibbon males and females are the same size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men are somewhat larger than women, suggesting mild polygyny. This biological and anthropological evidence for polyandry and polygyny suggest that our ancestors were moderately polygamous (men with more than one woman and women with more than one man).&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. ''Evolutionary Psychology'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, ISBN 0-205-19358-7), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural Societies ==

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture started about 10,000 years ago. Women planted wild wheat and barley seeds near their camps, so they wouldn't have to walk far to collect grain. But someone had to stay and protect the crops from animals and other people. At first, elderly individuals did this. They spent their time making pottery containers to store grain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherer women could carry only one child. They spaced children about four years apart, because a four-year-old could walk all day. Women married as adults, strong enough to carry a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, agricultural women didn't have to carry their children everywhere. They spaced children a year or two apart, producing larger families. Teenage girls married and reproduced before they were full-grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture and bigger families caused a vicious circle of increased food, but also increased population.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Margaret. Women in Prehistory (Univ of Oklahoma , 1989, ISBN 0806122374), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; More labor had to go into working the fields, to produce enough food to feed everyone. More men had to farm. Fewer men hunted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals in agricultural societies became specialized. Some individuals did nothing but make pottery. Others became blacksmiths, shepherds, or soldiers. Specialization increased productivity, but population increases kept pace. Successive generations didn't live better.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Animal Husbandry and the Origins of Wealth ===

&lt;p&gt;Farmers owned land. Some land was better than other land. Farmers owned plows and other tools for farming. They owned pottery and buildings for storing food. They built permanent houses, living in one place for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domesticated animals became an additional source of wealth. Dogs and pigs first came into camps to eat garbage. Children raised baby animals after hunters killed the animals' mothers. Farmers first raised domesticated animals for meat. Over time, men figured out how to harness large animals to plow fields, and to produce milk and wool.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Margaret. ''Women in Prehistory'' (Univ of Oklahoma , 1989, ISBN 0806122374), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man who owned a pair of sheep, cattle, or hogs soon had more livestock. A shepherd can watch one hundred sheep as easily as he can watch ten sheep. Economies of scale become possible. Some men became rich&amp;#151;and poor men became their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Matt. ''The Red Queen'' (Penguin, 1995, ISBN 0140245480).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Livestock made violence a profitable way of life. Stealing cattle was easy, especially for men skilled as hunters. For the first time, people owned a resource worth stealing. Cattle raids led to killing people, which led to warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Margaret. ''Women in Prehistory'' (Univ of Oklahoma , 1989, ISBN 0806122374), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage and Divorce ===

&lt;p&gt;Wealthy men supported larger families. Their wives spent more time producing children, and less time working outside the home. High-status men in agricultural societies had dozens or even hundreds of wives. Because high-status men had so many wives, many subordinate males had no wives or children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherer societies accepted divorce. Because individuals own only what they can carry, it's easy to split up. Divorce was economically impossible for farmers. A couple with fields, a house, and a barn couldn't divide the property in half. The individual who wanted out of the marriage had to leave empty-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Helen. ''Anatomy of Love: A Natural History of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray'' (Fawcett Books, 1995, ISBN 0449908976), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many immigrants to the United States and its western frontier were men leaving their marriages and land, looking for new land and new marriages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;California Stories,&quot; ''To The Best of Our Knowledge'', Wisconsin Public Radio, January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative Patterns ===

&lt;p&gt;By the Neolithic era, we see the negative patterns of our own culture:&lt;/p&gt;

* A few wealthy, powerful men.
* Many poor, powerless men.
* Women valued for their ability to produce children, not for their minds.
* Women confined to their homes.
* Teenage girls marrying before reaching physical and intellectual maturity.
* Malnourishment in the best of times. Corn, wheat, potatoes, etc. don't provide balanced nutrition. Starvation in years of drought, flood, insects, etc.
* Many people living in close quarters spread diseases.
* Shorter lifespans, due to malnutrition and disease.
* Long hours of specialized, repetitive, mind-numbing work.
* War with neighboring tribes.
* Violence between bachelor men.
* Children disciplined into obedience, punished for independent thinking, and rewarded for working quietly in a group.
* Lack of support for teenagers' needs to feel that they are unique, special individuals. Punishment of teenagers who assert their individuality.
* Old women became useless and disrespected, as books replaced them as sources of knowledge.
* Poor self-esteem. It's easier to make people work like slaves if they believe they're slaves. A philosopher observed, &quot;The remarkable thing isn't that some men are slaves. The remarkable thing is that some men believe that they're slaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;I recall that as a quote from Aristotle in one of Charles Van Riper's books. But I searched Aristotle and was unable to find the quote.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherer societies encouraged some individuals to develop transcendent abilities, e.g., prescience, communication with a spirit world, or physical feats such as firewalking. Speculatively, transcendent abilities could develop in the pre-frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex. Only humans have pre-frontal lobes. This is the most recent brain area to evolve, and, between the ages 15 to 21, the last to develop in each individual (see [[How Women Select Men#Emotional Connection|Emotional Connection]]). A young person who receives support and guidance from a mentor to develop transcendent experiences might develop pre-frontal lobe capabilities that would otherwise be lost. The institutional religions of the agricultural era may have set back brain evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. ''The Biology of Transcendence: A Blueprint Of The Human Spirit'' (Park Street, 2002, ISBN 0-89281990-1).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cities and Civilization ===

&lt;p&gt;Cities developed about 5,000 years ago. Civilization increased social stratification&amp;#151;i.e., the rich became richer, and the poor became poorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Village leaders became warlords, then kings, then emperors. Military organizations dominated regions, instead of occasionally raiding a neighboring village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When primate brain size is compared to the number of animals in social groups, and then extrapolated to human brain size, humans appear to be hardwired for living in groups of about 155 individuals. If we live in a larger community, we put people into groups instead of thinking of them as individuals. I.e., communities of less than 155 individuals don't have &quot;us and them&quot; thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, civilization enabled new ideas to spread faster. New ideas breed more new ideas. Competitive individuals try to outsmart each other&amp;#151;making everyone smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|A critical mass of people with such knowledge can multiply growth still further-essentially by creating knowledge clusters in which generally like-minded people bounce ideas off each other and compete. This dynamic is one reason why incomes are higher in cities than in rural areas and why nations that are already technologically advanced will quickly become more so.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Bruce, reviewing ''The Elusive Quest for Growth by William Easterly'' ((MIT Press, 2001, ISBN 026205065X), ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 18, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;|Bruce Bartlett}}

== Industrial-Information Society ==

&lt;p&gt;We're living in a third era. The Industrial-Information Age began in 1437, when Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better information enabled technological advances&amp;#151;and, in a virtuous circle, technological advances produced better information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved communication enabled oppressed peoples to organize themselves against autocratic rulers. Examples of liberation movements range from the American (1775-1783) and French Revolutions (1789-1795) to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the women's movement of the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Democracy vs. Women ===

&lt;p&gt;Democratic revolutionaries replaced aristocracy. The Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, stated, &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/declaration/declaration.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson intentionally excluded women.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|This new United States government was going to be the opposite of a court. All of the things that are features of court life&amp;#151;like kings, and absolute power, and courtiers, and the interplay of personal interests, and face-to-face politicking, and &lt;i&gt;influential women&lt;i&gt;&amp;#151;all of those things became anathema to the founders of this brand-new republic. Thomas Jefferson, who had been an ambassador in France, had particularly seen those court women ruling and having control over all kinds of official business, and he loathed it.&lt;ref&gt;Allgor, Catherine. ''Parlor Politics: In Which the Ladies of Washington Help Build a City and a Government'' (Univ Pr Virginia, 2000, ISBN 08139199832000).&lt;/ref&gt;|Catherine Allgor, ''Parlor Politics'' (2000)}}

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Jefferson envisioned an open government, with no behind-the-scenes politicking&amp;#151;and no women.&lt;ref&gt;Allgor, Catherine. ''Parlor Politics: In Which the Ladies of Washington Help Build a City and a Government'' (Univ Pr Virginia, 2000, ISBN 08139199832000).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revolutionaries took power from the old rulers&amp;#151;the few powerful men, and most women. They gave power to the powerless&amp;#151;the majority of men. The United States didn't allow women to vote until 1920. Switzerland gave women the vote in 1970. Women aren't allowed to vote today in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Hunter-Gatherer Values in the Industrial-Information Age ===

&lt;p&gt;The industrial-information age enables us to return to our hunter-gatherer instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hunter-gatherer groups, everyone was economically equal. No individual owned more than he could carry. Today, poor Americans enjoy the standard of living&amp;#151;as measured by cars, televisions, air conditioners, etc.&amp;#151;that the middle-class enjoyed a generation ago.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, M., Alm, R. ''Myths of Rich &amp; Poor'' (Basic Books, 1999, ISBN 046504784X). The Internet is turning scarcity-based economic rules upside-down, suggesting that Information Age economics will be based on abundance. See ''Managing Open Source Projects'', by Jan Sandred.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherer groups had minimal violence. Violent crime is dropping in the United States. Fewer international conflicts occur. By 2100, violence and war may be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hunter-gatherer groups, men and women had equal status. Women's rights are among the achievements of the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherers were mildly polygamous. We practice mild polygamy in the form of &quot;serial monogamy.&quot; Like hunter-gatherers, we allow divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter-gatherers enjoyed seeing new scenery and meeting new people. Today, working class men and women admire long-distance truckers. Professional class men and women enjoy travel to &quot;unspoiled&quot; third-world countries. We all increasingly appreciate social diversity and the natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Delayed Reproduction to Reduce Overpopulation ===

&lt;p&gt;According to some writers, men should have their sperm frozen before 35, and wait until 40 or 45 to start a family, and women should wait until 30.{{citation needed}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older couples have the maturity for long-term committed relationships. They are more likely to have the emotional maturity to raise children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing that economic conditions are good nationally, older couples have accumulated wealth. At least one parent doesn't have to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couples that marry later are less likely to divorce.
&lt;p&gt;Delayed reproduction slows population growth. If a 40-year-old couple have two children, and the parents live to 76, net population growth is zero. In contrast, a 19-year-old couple with two children increases the population &lt;i&gt;seven-fold&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#151;when such a couple dies, two children, four grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Effects of Television on Children's Brain Development ===

&lt;p&gt;Before television, children listened to adults telling stories. Imagining a story stimulated a child's cerebral cortex. Vicariously feeling the adult's emotions stimulated the child's limbic brain. Acting out a story (a central activity in Waldorf schools) integrates the reptilian brain, limbic brain, and cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, television provides visual and auditory stimulation, leaving nothing for the child to imagine. Children become emotionally attached to television actors, but the emotions are one-way (i.e., the actors don't love the children). Sitting still doesn't develop a child's reptilian brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, doctors espousing the new germ theory of disease told mothers not to touch their infants. Fifty years ago, doctors told mothers not to breastfeed. Many of these infants died. The surviving infants didn't receive the emotional relationships needed for limbic brain development.&lt;ref&gt;S. Provence and R.C. Lupton, ''Infants in Institutions'' (New York: International Universities Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; To future generations, allowing children to watch television may seem as barbaric as not allowing mothers to touch or feed their infants.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. ''Evolution's End: Claiming the Potential of Our Intelligence'' (Harper San Francisco, 1992, ISBN 0-06-250732-X).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Great Male Hierarchy ==

&lt;p&gt;Women don't think that all men were created equal. In most species, females prefer to mate with certain males. Females' preferences created the Great Male Hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchies have many advantages. Leaders provide for the welfare of men below them. Subordinate men support the leaders. Every man has a job to do. Leaders make and execute decisions quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New men can join the hierarchy at any time-at the bottom. No time is wasted deciding who likes or dislikes whom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ego boosts&quot;-praise and appreciation that boosts a man up the hierarchy-can be more important than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

{{quote|It is with baubles that battles are won.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electric-rain.net/Effects/Axiom.html&lt;/ref&gt;|Napoleon Bonaparte, creating the Legion d'Honour medal}}

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, fear of embarrassment-a fall down the hierarchy -makes soldiers risk their lives. An insult-a shove down the hierarchy-&quot;drives a man to distraction&quot; or makes him ignore more important goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hierarchical model works with a dozen men, or a million men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men in a hierarchy have no need to put down any other man. They establish rules. The rule of law supplants force and violence. The organization runs smoothly. Courts and justice systems are hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of hierarchies is that high-status individuals can abuse low-status individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Robert W. Rankism: Somebodies, Nobodies, And The Abuse Of Power. http://www.breakingranks.net/book/book.html&lt;/ref&gt; A male hierarchy with thirty million members-e.g., Nazi Germany-has far more potential for abuse than a thirty-member women's circle.&lt;/p&gt;

== Women’s Support Circles ==

&lt;p&gt;Women form egalitarian support circles. When a woman has a problem, the other women in her circle help her. This structure promotes sharing of resources. Support circles take care of each member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women compliment each other and put themselves down to say, &quot;You're in my circle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having set jobs, at different times individuals have different roles. A woman with resources or skills needed today helps her sisters. They'll care for her at another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women play games to socialize. In contrast, men play to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of women's support circles is that they're effective only up to about thirty members. Decisions require consensus. Women's circles can talk and talk and talk instead of making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in a circle exclude other women. Women gossip to say, &quot;You're in my circle.&quot; Women make &quot;catty&quot; remarks to exclude individuals from their circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only five women head Fortune 500 companies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Inside Story,&quot; Working Mother, October 2001, http://www.workingwoman.com/oct_2001/inside_04.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; But few women are homeless. The top and bottom of the Great Male Hierarchy are far apart. Women's egalitarian instincts keep them from society's depths as well as its heights.&lt;/p&gt;

==Women's Culture, Men's Culture==

&lt;p&gt;In most societies, women spend most of their time with other women, and men spend most of their time with other men. North American society is unusual in that we have few rules enforcing this, but men and women still generally follow this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women's culture isn't monolithic. Some groups of women read fashion magazines, others look to Oprah Winfrey as their role model, while other women are devoted to their horses. But, in general, women like to be with other women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men like to engage in activities with other men. Watching sports, drinking beer, going hunting and fishing, etc. The difference between men's and women's cultures is that men welcome women into their cultures, when women want men to stay out of their cultures (although there are exceptions to both these assertions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a woman who likes to watch football and drink beer will be welcomed at any sports bar. She'll receive plenty of attention from the men (e.g., they'll buy her beer).(However, this may not be the case at a small-town gambling establishment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a (straight) man who shows up at an aerobics class wearing a leotard will be ignored by the women in the class. They won't buy him a sports drink at the juice bar afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious problem is that the women will think that he's there just to pick up women. The women won't think he's there because he likes aerobics. In contrast, at the sports bar the men will assume that a woman is there to see the big game (the same reason the men are there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtler problem is that women may assume that any man who tries to join their culture is a loser. For example, a friend invited me to the aerobics class she taught at a health club. (She warned me not to try to pick up any of the women.) Through 95% of the class I was having mishaps. All the brightly colored gym equipment was beyond my abilities to control. E.g., my big bouncy ball kept bouncing around the room, instead of staying between my feet. I was hopelessly off the beat in any exercise that required rhythm. I excelled at the few exercises that required upper body strength, but the women ignored that. I laughed and had fun, but my friend (the instructor) pretended not to know me, and none of the women in the class talked to me. No one offered to show me how to use the brightly colored springy thingies, for example. In contrast, if a woman shows up at a bowling club, men will be happy to show her how to hold the ball, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when a woman joins a men's culture, she quickly figures out who are the alpha males, and is happy to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a man tries to join a women's culture, the women might form &quot;buddy circles&quot; to talk and exclude him. A woman who doesn't have a buddy circle will get out her cellphone to avoid him trying to talk to her. The man trying to join a women's buddy circle conversation is a major faux pas (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faux_pas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that women have power and opportunities that men lack. This power is balanced in several ways. Young, attractive women are welcomed into men's cultures, but less attractive women are ignored. And women who are too engrossed in their women's groups can find themselves without a man in their lives. For example, when my running club goes out to dinner the handful of women sit at one end of a long table, while the ten or fifteen men sit around the rest of the table. One night I put a Kleenex pack on the table in front of me, while I talked to the men on my side of the table. Our conversation was interrupted by two women asking for Kleenexes. Both were crying, and when I listened to their conversation I heard them commiserating about being thirty-something and not having boyfriends. One was saying that she'd now decided to accept that she could be happy on her own, without a man in her life. I felt like telling them to stop sitting together at one end of the table and go sit among the men, and they'd soon have boyfriends. Instead, she'd decided to stay with her girlfriends and try to be happy without a man.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Men: &quot;Report Talk&quot; ===

Men communicate to establish social hierarchies, examples being when:

* They put each other down, showing off, or boasting.
* They talk about things they did, a.k.a. &quot;report talk.&quot;
* They issue orders or commands-&quot;Bring me a beer!&quot;
* &quot;Anger as a greeting.&quot; A man makes a verbal challenge. If the other man stands up to him, they respect each other.
* Men disagree to show superiority. E.g., a man admires a Honda motorcycle. His buddy replies that Harley-Davidson motorcycles are better.
* Men refuse offers of help. This shows that a man is independent. Dependence indicates low status.
* Men tend to find something positive in negative situations. &quot;No, I didn't catch any fish, but I tried my new outboard motor.&quot; Expressing unhappiness admits failure.
* Men offer advice. Advice taken shows that the advisor is smarter. In contrast, fixing another person's problem communicates subservient status.
* Men talk more in public. High status men talk the most. Men interrupt each other, to increase their talk time.
* Equal men prefer to talk sitting side-by-side, not looking at each other.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, Deborah. I Only Say This Because I Love You, (Random House, 2001, ISBN 0-679-45601-5), 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; Driving is ideal for a conversation with a man. Men talk to each other face-to-face only within a hierarchy (e.g., a boss sitting at his desk), or in a confrontation.
* &quot;Playful insults and teasing put-downs are a common way that men and boys show affection and intimacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, Deborah. I Only Say This Because I Love You, (Random House, 2001, ISBN 0-679-45601-5), 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women: &quot;Rapport&quot; Talk ===

Women communicate to establish egalitarian support circles:

* Supporting each other-&quot;You're doing great!&quot;
* Complimenting each other.
* Agreeing or saying &quot;we're the same.&quot;
* Putting themselves down-&quot;I'm not smart like you!&quot;
* Making suggestions, especially to do things together- &quot;Let's clean the house today&quot;-instead of issuing orders.
* Asking for help, and offering help, to show rapport and equality.
* Instead of offering advice, women do the work themselves.
* Preferring intimacy to independence.
* Talking more in private.
* Gossiping or telling each other secrets, to demonstrate equality and intimacy.
* Women prefer to talk sitting face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, Deborah. I Only Say This Because I Love You, (Random House, 2001, ISBN 0-679-45601-5), 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel threatened when approached from behind.

=== Men Should Learn to Speak &quot;Woman-ese&quot; ===

&lt;p&gt;Men have to learn two languages: &quot;man-ese&quot; to get to the top of the Great Male Hierarchy (and so attract women), and &quot;woman-ese&quot; to make a woman feel the equality, kindness, and support she's used to receiving from other women. Speaking &quot;woman-ese&quot; is the most important dating skill a man can learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men at the top of the Great Male Hierarchy often have the worst relationships with women. Smart men devote years of higher education to learn &quot;lawyer-ese&quot; or &quot;computer-ese.&quot; Then they spend one weekend in a John Gray seminar learning &quot;woman-ese.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, practice your &quot;woman-ese&quot; with every woman you meet. Make every woman feel good about herself. This includes old ladies, cleaning staff, and your sister-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men with overdeveloped cerebral cortexes look down from their corner offices and wonder why women go for losers. The leader of a three-punk motorcycle gang, who plays guitar and knows the words women want to hear, scores all the women he wants. An MBA managing sixty employees can't get a date, if he only knows how to talk about business.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Men's Mistakes ===

* Interrupting--women's #1 complaint. When your date is talking, repeat silently to yourself: Let her talk.
* When women talk about their problems, men often give advice for &quot;fixing&quot; the problem. Women instead are asking for emotional connection.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John. Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus (HarperCollins, 1992, ISBN 006016848X).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Put-downs. Never tell a woman that she's ugly, stupid, short, or fat. Not even when you're joking.
* Don't argue, disagree, or correct facts. Listen for things a woman says that you can agree with, instead of listening for points to disagree about.
* Lecturing. Nothing is more boring to a woman than a man endlessly talking about his work or hobbies. Women smile, nod, and act interested, because this is how women listen. Men interpret this as encouragement to continue talking.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, Deborah. You Just Don't Understand (Ballantine, 1990, ISBN 0345372050), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To improve your conversation skills, imagine that your date is silently asking &quot;How is this conversation relevant to me?&quot;
* Lack of eye contact. Don't stare at a woman's breasts, behind, or pelvic area--this is highly offensive.  Don't make sexually charged compliments. When in doubt about these, just don't. Don't look at other women.
* Not listening. At least half of &quot;good communication skills&quot; is listening. (However, researchers have found that the commonly taught marital counseling technique of &quot;active listening&quot; doesn't improve relationships.)&lt;/p&gt;
* Sometimes, if you ask a woman a question, her reply will not necessarily be the one she wants to give. Females tend to expect males to read their mind and say either 'yes dear' or 'no, we're doing this'. Picking the wrong one at the wrong time is disastrous, but use that hunter's risk assessing ability that has been precisely sculpted over eons of time.

=== Women's Mistakes ===

* Don't say &quot;no&quot; when you mean &quot;yes,&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; when you mean &quot;no.&quot;. Also avoid saying &quot;maybe&quot; or relying on the male to pick up subtle signals.
* Most women aren't adept at &quot;man-ese&quot; and shouldn't speak it, e.g., &quot;trash talk&quot; after a game (unless you desire a hearty dead-arm or a wedgie).
* While interrupting a woman will cause her to pause and maybe listen but silently harbour a scathing grudge, more often than not a man will simply continue to talk over the top of her. 
* If a man talks about a problem, he is probably subconsciously asking you to help him fix the problem. Women manage to realise the first half of this and overtly offer a solution. This will often be rejected because the solution wasn't provided by the male. That mistake causes perfectly good solutions to go unused.
* Don't argue or overtly disagree. Listen for things a man says that you can agree with, instead of listening for points to disagree about. 
* Lack of eye contact, especially don't look at other men. Also too much eye contact may enrage the male.
* Nagging. With reference to the above, men give orders and rarely enjoy taking them from subordinates. However, men are often looking for some kind of 'damsel in distress' situation and if you reconstruct the order into a request they will most likely oblige (unless it is rinsing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, this is a feat yet to be accomplished independently of nagging).
* Trying to stop a fight that has already begun. Big mistake, about a hundred reasons not to do it. Just don't.

=== Emotional Communication ===

&lt;p&gt;Emotional messages hide in factual communications.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman, John. The Relationship Cure (Crown, 2001, ISBN 0609608096).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Morrow Mayo's essay &quot;To See It Fall&quot; is composed only of scientific facts and objective narration, yet it gives a sense of strong disapproval to the settlers' cutting down of the Brobdingnagian sequoia.

&lt;p&gt;Emotional messages can be verbal, e.g., inviting a woman to a party. Or emotional messages can be nonverbal, e.g., offering a man a place to sit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotional messages can be positive (e.g., &quot;I like you&quot;) or negative (e.g., &quot;I don't like you&quot;). Responses can be positive, negative, or ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good communicators respond to the emotional message as well as to the factual message. Good communicators respond positively to negative and ambiguous emotional messages.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Dating: Ambiguous Responses to Positive Emotions ===

&lt;p&gt;In dating, the most common communication problem is ambiguous responses to positive emotional messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a man asks a woman out to a movie Friday night. His factual message is about the movie. His emotional message is, &quot;I feel romantic attraction to you. Do you feel attraction to me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman responds, &quot;No, I have other things to do Friday night.&quot; She's responding negatively to the factual message, and ambiguously to the emotional message. She's thinking, &quot;You're probably a loser, but I'm not 100% sure, and the other men I'm dating are losers too, so keep asking me out. Maybe some night I'll be so desperate that I'll go out with you. God, I hope not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man responds, &quot;What about seeing a hockey game Saturday night?&quot; The woman again responds, &quot;No, I have other plans Saturday night.&quot; They can go on for weeks without asking or answering the deeper message. Miscommunication wastes their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman could directly answer the emotional message. She could say, &quot;I think you're attractive. Let's get together another time.&quot; Or, &quot;I don't find you attractive and don't want to do anything else with you.&quot; It's hard to imagine that a woman would speak directly. You can see why we hide emotional messages in factual statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the man could clearly communicate his deeper message: &quot;Do you feel attracted to me?&quot; Again, it's hard to imagine a man directly asking an emotional question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clearly communicating emotional messages will improve your relationships. Try it. At first you'll say embarrassing things. With practice you'll master emotional communication.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Relationships: Respond Positively to Negative Emotions ===

&lt;p&gt;In relationships, the most common communication problem is negative responses to emotional messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a couple agrees to meet at a restaurant. He's twenty minutes late. She points this out (a factual message) and her body language and vocal tone communicate that she's angry (an emotional message).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He responds negatively, &quot;Only twenty minutes. What's the big deal? Last week you were thirty minutes late.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative, ignored, and ambiguous responses don't change your partner's negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful couples respond positively to negative messages. E.g., he responds, &quot;I'm late because my boss gave me a lot of work, but all day I was counting the minutes until we'd be together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Playful Partnering ===

&lt;p&gt;Relationship masters use humor to respond to negative emotions. The key word in that sentence was masters. Humor used badly will get you into deeper trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play a game (see page 16). E.g., you're twenty minutes late. Ask your partner to pretend to be angry. She looks at her watch, paces, and says, &quot;He's one minute late. He doesn't love me. Now he's two minutes late. I should have married Fred the accountant. He was boring but punctual...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You pretend to be somewhere else. You dreamily think aloud, &quot;I love her cute little nose, I love her kissable lips....Oh no, look at the time, I'm late! She hates it when I'm late! I'd better stop and buy her flowers. No, that'll make me more late!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you meet. She expresses anger, impersonating Jack Nicholson in The Shining. You express drippy, romance novel love. If she doesn't laugh, you get drippier, until she's laughing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now repeat the game, switching roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You acknowledge that you understand her emotional message, and switch your partner from negative to positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Emotions Are Contagious ===

&lt;p&gt;Consciously or unconsciously, people mimic each other's emotions. We infect each other with our emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm. The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference (Little, Brown, 2000, ISBN 0-316-31696-2), 84-85. Referring to Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. Emotional Contagion. &lt;/ref&gt; Your emotional state results primarily from the people around you, not from what you do or think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't get dates, maybe you're infecting people with negative emotions. No one wants to be infected with anger, distrust, anxiety, or low self-esteem. Instead, infect people with positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Women's Dating Lies ===

{{quote|I felt a kind of pleasure in accepting at face value all the counterfeit currency she had passed off on me.&lt;ref&gt;Flem, Lydia. Casanova: The Man Who Really Loved Women (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1997, ISBN0-374-11957-0), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;|Giacomo Casanova, 18th-century Italian lover}}

==== Jealousy ====

{{quote|My guy and I have a loving relationship, but...I crave attention from other men. I flirt with every guy in the bar, including men my friends are after. I never take it any further than that, but I get off on making men swoon. Is there something wrong with me?&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Irma. &quot;Ask Irma: Agony Advice,&quot; Cosmopolitan, October 18, 2002, http://magazines.ivillage.com/cosmopolitan/experts/agony/qas/0,12750,284429_536411,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;|letter to Cosmopolitan}}

&lt;p&gt;Women are twice as likely as men to intentionally cause jealousy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women cause jealousy to test the strength of the relationship, and to increase their partners' commitment. Jealousy increases sexual passion.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is As Necessary As Love and Sex (Free Press, 2000, ISBN 0684850818).&lt;/ref&gt; Jealous couples are more likely to marry. Revenge, bolstering self-esteem, and punishment aren't typical reasons for women to use jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;

==== Boyfriend Lies ====

&lt;p&gt;25% of women living with men say they don't intend to marry their partners. Most explained that their partner's income or education was too low.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Wendy D. Journal of Family Issues, 2002 November. http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20021121/hl_nm/marriage_relationships_dc&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These women wanted monogamous relationships, so they &quot;hooked up&quot; with a boyfriend. But they're not satisfied with their boyfriend, so they're keeping their eyes open for better prospects. If the boyfriend realizes this, he might cheat or end the relationship. Navigating through this dilemma sometimes requires lying:

* A man asks a woman's friend whether she has a boyfriend. &quot;Yes,&quot; the friend replies, &quot;but she wants to break up.&quot; He asks her out. She rejects him, saying that she has a boyfriend.
* A woman flirts with a man. When he asks her out, she says that she has a boyfriend.
* A woman accepts a lunch date with a man. After he pays the bill, she starts talking about her boyfriend.
* A woman refuses a date, saying that she recently broke up with a boyfriend and needs time to recover. Two weeks later she has a new boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message in all these examples is &quot;I'm not 100% satisfied with my boyfriend so I checked you out, but you're not worth leaving my boyfriend for.&quot; He refuses to hear that he's inferior to another man. He instead accuses her of lying. (She may also be trying to make her boyfriend jealous.)&lt;/p&gt;

=== Men's Dating Lies ===

&lt;p&gt;We have different rules for interactions between friends and strangers (see &quot;Adult Friendship,&quot; page 86). Men's dating lies cross the boundary between friends and strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man may feel that he knows his object of desire, and so believe that they're friends. He may have watched her and overheard her conversations with her friends. Or, in this electronic age, he may have seen her on television or listened to her music and feels that he knows her. But as long as he's a stranger to her, he should interact with her according to the rules of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or a man may think that acting like a friend

== 
will make a woman like and trust him. That works with equal partners. E.g., two men meet while fishing. If they're friendly to each other, they become friends (see &quot;Equality,&quot; page 84). In contrast, imagine going into a bank to ask for a loan. There's nothing wrong with being friendly, but friendliness won't affect whether you get the loan. Dating is like applying for a loan. If a woman decides not to go out on a date with you, being friendly isn't going to change her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

==== Unsolicited Gifts ====

&lt;p&gt;Friends give each other unsolicited gifts. Friends don't expect anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive an unsolicited gift (e.g., a man finishes People magazine while eating lunch at a restaurant, and then gives it to the waitress), say that you don't want it but you know someone (e.g., a co-worker) who'd like it. If the giver backpedals and insists that the gift is only for you, don't accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

==== Solving a Problem ====

&lt;p&gt;Friends help each other solve problems. But friends don't overplay minor problems into major problems. And friends don't cause problems, and then offer to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a man and woman arrive at a hardware store after it closes. He asks what she needs to buy, and she replies that she has a leaky faucet. It's OK for him to say that another store across town is open late. It's not OK for him to insist that she accompany him to the other store, and insist that she let him fix her leaky faucet.&lt;/p&gt;

==== Refusing to Hear &quot;No&quot; ====

&lt;p&gt;Your best friend says that she doesn't want a birthday party this year. You ignore her &quot;no,&quot; reserve the back room of her favorite restaurant, invite all of her friends, and decorate the room with banners and balloons. Your friend has a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not OK for a stranger to refuse to hear &quot;no.&quot; If a woman gives in to a minor allowance, e.g., carrying her groceries up to her apartment, she'll give in to bigger advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more about recognizing predatory men's lies, read ''The Gift of Fear'', by Gavin De Becker (1997).&lt;/p&gt;

[[w:Reptile|Reptile]]s — and unemotional people — always react the same way to events. [[w:Mammal|Mammal]]s, in contrast, select from a variety of reactions. Emotions enable flexible responses to environmental stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, Jaak. Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions (Oxford Univ, 1998, ISBN: 0195096738), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional control systems are hardwired into mammalian brains.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, Jaak. Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions (Oxford Univ, 1998, ISBN: 0195096738), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists have identified ten emotional control systems{{citation needed}}. These emotions are:

# Seeking and [[w:anticipation|anticipation]]; energetic, goal-directed searches for food, shelter, mates, etc.
# [[w:Homeostasis|Homeostasis]] — balance of oxygen, water, temperature, etc. — and the discomfort of deprivation and pleasure of relief.
# [[w:Anger|Anger]] and rage, when another animal steals our resources (food, shelter, mate).
# [[w:Fear|Fear]], and fearful anticipation of the future.
# [[w:Separation anxiety|Separation distress]], e.g., when a mother and child lose each other. This is the basis of anxiety and panic.
# Sexuality and [[w:lust|lust]].
# Nurturance and maternal behavior.
# Fun, joy, and playing to create social bonds.
# Sorrow, grief, and loneliness.
# The sense of self.

These neural pathways are the basis of personality types{{citation needed}}. While everyone has all ten emotional control systems, different circuits are stronger or weaker in different individuals. A neural pathway that an individual uses often becomes myelinated or stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph Chilton. Evolution's End: Claiming the Potential of Our Intelligence (Harper San Francisco, 1992, ISBN 0-06-250732-X), 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; E.g., a mother develops strong maternal instincts.

An individual's personality type is the emotional control system she uses most often. One of the goals of personal growth is to strengthen underused emotional control systems. An immature individual responds to all events with the same emotion.

== Archetypes ==

Personality types repeat in human experiences generation after generation. These archetypes appear in the ancient world as gods and in myths and folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Andrew. Critical Dictionary of Jungian Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Archetypes appear in the modern world as celebrities, movie formulas, and recurring news events.

The above ten emotional control systems, plus several speculative circuits, form the fifteen personality types in the following chapters. The speculative emotional control systems are

* Valuing the past through tradition, ritual, and ceremony (Hera).
* Homemaking (Hestia).
* Skillful use of tools, especially controlling fire (Hephaestus).
* The quest for meaning (Dionysus). 

Additionally, Poseidon symbolizes the limbic brain not integrated with the cerebral cortex, and Apollo symbolizes the reverse.

Individuals embody different archetypes at different life stages. E.g., a young woman may embody Aphrodite, the goddess of romantic love and feminine beauty. In her 30s, she becomes Demeter, the mother. Later she embodies Hestia, making a beautiful home. Or she may pursue a career, embodying Athena.

The transition between archetypes can be difficult. E.g., an Artemis woman

{{quote|...in her twenties and thirties may resent her suitors and keep them at a distance or choose only those who would never qualify as lifelong partners. For her, dating partners may be temporary liaisons to share an adventure, men who need a lot of distance, or female lovers. Then, in her forties, she may be shocked to find herself feeling lonely and depressed as Artemis recedes from center stage, her developmental needs may suddenly contradict the ruling archetype, requiring emergence of a new pattern, such as Demeter, the goddess of motherhood. If her ego remains identified with the old pattern, this transition can be confusing and painful.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, C., Wolf, S. Romancing The Shadow: Illuminating The Dark Side Of The Soul (Ballantine Books, 1997, ISBN 0345417399), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;|Connie Zweig and Steve Wolf, ''Romancing the Shadow'' (1997)}}

== Opposites Attract ==

Similar personalities cause marital problems. E.g., Artemis and Ares look similar, but competition drives the couple apart. The easy road to divorce is to match your spouse's archetype.

In a successful relationship, a partner responds to his partner by selecting an emotion opposite to her emotional state (see &quot;[[../Conflict#Opposite Relationships|Opposite Relationships]]&quot;). But opposite personalities are immediately painful. E.g., your wife embodies Hestia and buys every item in Martha Stewart's catalog. You embody Hermes and suggest taking a vacation-hopping freight trains. You'll argue and disagree. But handled well you'll &quot;get on like a house on fire.&quot; In the long term, this will produce a happy marriage-and balanced individuals{{citation needed}}.

Encourage your spouse to embody your opposite archetype. You embody his opposite. E.g., an Athena woman who married an Apollo man (similar personality types) should develop her Artemis energy (his opposite). He should develop his Poseidon side (her opposite). But don't do this at the same time-Artemis and Poseidon don't match.

Ideally, a couple uses all fifteen archetypes, at different times. But most couples stay with a few main archetypes. You need a village of relationships to use all the archetypal pairs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I do not think that the most common use of a force is in card magic.  The magicians choice (equivoke) is used in almsot every area of magic, and I would say that this is the &quot;most common form it takes&quot;.  

Additionally, do you really think it's a good idea to give them your script word for word.  Rather, wouldn't it be better to give them a lesson on writing scripts, and maybe give them an example trick which they should try to write a script for.  This is the approach that I take when teaching magic classes, and it works quite well.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
== What is Parkour? ==
Parkour is a physical discipline inspired by human movement, focusing on uninterrupted, efficient forward motion over, under, around and through obstacles (both man-made and natural) in one's environment. Such movement may come in the form of running, jumping, climbing and other more complex techniques. The goal of parkour is to adapt one's movement to any given obstacle.

According to founder [[w:David Belle|David Belle]], the spirit of parkour is guided in part by the notions of &quot;escape&quot; and &quot;reach&quot;, that is, the idea of using physical agility and quick thinking to get out of difficult situations, and to be able to go anywhere that one desires.

== How can I start? ==
In order to begin, all you have to do is research, maybe get some friends in it, then go out and try some stuff. It is strongly urged that beginner traceurs start small at first, then gradually try harder techniques as their abilities grow. Parkour can be a dangerous practice, particularly when traceurs do not observe their surroundings correctly during a run.

=== Equipment ===
The only things you need to begin your parkour training are a pair of good running shoes, comfortable clothes, and the necessary safety precautions. When choosing clothing for parkour, remember that comfortable clothing should not be overly baggy, as excess fabric may catch on obstacles. Necessary safety precautions include knowledge of the landscape you are training on. Always check behind obstacles to ensure there are no hidden dangers, such as rocks, sticks or secondary obstacles.

=== Exercises ===
Before doing more advanced parkour, you must first begin by doing exercises. It is necessary to condition your body, and as parkour is a very physical activity, it is advisable to have a routine which includes stretches and exercises. This wikibook includes descriptions of several useful exercises in the [[Parkour/Exercises|Exercises]] chapter. Exercises are important in parkour because many of the techniques require one to use muscles that usually aren't worked out and strong so all kinds of exercises, targeting all muscles on your body, must be done to be able to do the moves properly.

=== Your first run ===
Before doing your first parkour run, it is recommended that you warm up your muscles with a light jog and a series of stretches to reduce muscle strain or harm during your first run. Try a regular run with low objects, such as small boulders, benches or low rails/fences to start off, then slowly progress to harder things. If you are unsure of where to practice, consider local parks or school yards. In recent years parkour's increased popularity has led to indoor parkour facilities in some cities. 
[[File:Medien AG Alfred-Teves-Schule Projekt Parkours 2007.jpg|thumbnail|300px|A traceur practicing in a parkour facility]]

===Physical requirements===
* ''Development of physical force''
A very important requirement of parkour is physical development. Arm and leg strength are the key for success in Parkour.
* ''Development in the motive coordination''
The training routine takes to the earnings of more experience for new obstacles and help in the motive coordination. With time, Parkour helps one learn the movements of the body and teaches balance and control.  Knowing the limits of the body creates an adaptation for new atmospheres and challenges.
* ''Psychological strength''
A unique aspect of Parkour is the emphasis placed not on strength of body, but regarding personal fear and lack of self trust. A traceur may experience fear of getting hurt when confronting new techniques or situations. Ultimately it is important for traceurs to trust themselves if they wish for their technique to develop. Parkour is about pushing the limits of the human body as well as the human mind.
* '' Growth in the mobilization of obstacles ''
With the training it is possible to develop an atrevecia vision for obstacles. Which is the easiest road? Which is the most difficult? Is it possible to jump here? The routine takes to the naturalness of movements in new atmospheres.
* '' Controlling adrenaline ''
In scary situations or during falling, the heart beats fast and adrenaline is felt all throughout the body. The training of the movements or courses helps the traceur overcome the prescribed physical response to flail. He or she will then think about the movement. '' What seems difficult today he or she has to be to seem easy tomorrow. ''
* '' Helps in the personal search ''
Within Parkour exists philosophy and roads to the discovery of the limits of oneself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:do}} is a Java keyword.

It starts a do-while looping block. The do-while loop is functionally similar to the while loop, except the condition is evaluated ''after'' the statements execute

Syntax:
{{XCode|1=&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
do {
    //statements;
} while (condition);&lt;/source&gt;}}

For example:

{{XCode|1=&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
do {
    i++;
} while ( i &lt; maxLoopIter );&lt;/source&gt;}}

==Most important teaching of the Buddha==
Something surprised me and made me think. It was about a story when the Buddha himself was teaching for days about 'impermanence', 'selflessness', 'cause and affect', and so on.  At the end he said the most important think.  &quot;Do not be dogmatic, do not be caught up with any teachings and ideas, even Buddhist one.&quot;  Those are not the truth.  Those are only instruments to understand impermanence and selflessness, but those are not absolute truth.  So do not be caught up with the notion of impermanence and selflessness, because if you do you are not better of then if you stay with permanence and the self.  I was confused, I did not understand. I thought he was just playing with words. 

But if those are only instruments to get us closer to the absolute truth, what is the absolute truth then? The absolute truth can not be described by words, it needs to be experienced.  In Buddhism the absolute truth is nirvana.  Again it looks like an easy escape. What we like to know the most can not be described, so what's the point.  I felt angry and frustrated.  But he pointed out that in our life there are lots of thinks that can not be described by words.  It did not occur to us, at least not to me. I had the illusion that most of simple thinks can be described by words. 
 
Let’s do an experiment. Imagine that you meet a person who came from Mars and never tasted and apple. Apple looks a simple think. Your job is to describe in words how the apple tastes.  Good luck.  You could say it is a bit sweet and watery, but that is not exactly the truth. The apple needs to be experienced in order to know precisely.  Apple taste like apple. When the Buddha was asked to explain nirvana.  His reply was: That is it is.  Nirvana can not be described by words, it needs to be experienced. 

Not only that but nirvana is free from all concepts and notions.  So to reach nirvana we must be free from all concepts and notions. We need to be free from notion of good and bad, right and wrong.  

I think the main aim of the Buddhist teaching to help us first intellectually understand, with the help of those instruments we talked about before, that we must be free from thinking in terms of good and bad, being and not being, right and wrong.  It teaches us that we do not have independent existence that we all depend on each other not only for survival, but also for happiness.  Not only we can not live alone, we can not be happy alone.  Feeling compassion and doing good acts get us closer to happiness.  

But then it warns us that this intellectual understanding could be a danger if we form a strong attachment to it.  If we are taken over by this understanding, if we are caught up with it, if we take it as THE truth, and we feel the need to defend it by any means.  If that happens then we are not better of than not having acquiring this understanding in the first place.   Our focus should be on experiencing or going closer to experience happiness (nirvana), rather than, thinking about it.  (So instead of caught up in the notion how healthy and delicious an apple is, take one.  The apple has to be tasted.)  I feel this is a very important point that we should not be caught up with the any teaching.  This gives us an open mind, knowing that many roads leads to the absolute truth. 

== Many roads lead to nirvana (to kingdom of God) ==
If the teaching is not the truth, just a help to reach the truth, then it should not matter what road  I take to get there. I am not attached to any of them. I should not expect others to take my road.  
This should help to make harmony among religions.  We all want the same think, but we may go in different ways to get it.

Also it should help to make harmony between religion and science.  They both search for the meaning of life, the reason for our existence.  But again both of their teachings are not the truth, they are only instruments to get there.

Science is usually good at asnwering the '''How?''' question, and not so good at answering the '''Why?''' questions. 
Religion is usually good to give an answer to the '''Why?''' question, but not so good to answer the '''How?''' question. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 04:26, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

== What is the Meaning of life ==

What is the meaning of life?  The non-creationist simple answer could be to survive. But then you could ask why should I survive? Because natural selection selected you to survive.  Natural selection made sure that you want to survive.  Those who did not want to survive died out.  How natural selection started is a different story.  And why natural selection started in the first place?  Were there any reason for natural selection to start?
[[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 02:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

Genes exist so DNA molecules can survive. --&gt; People exist so their genes can survive. --&gt; Civilization exist so people can survive.
 
DNA molecules build the genes. --&gt; Genes have the information to build people's body. --&gt; People have the knowledge to build civilizations. --&gt; Civilization has the power to alter and destroy all of that. Civilization would change or replace Genes, would change or replace people if evolution and natural selection demands it, in order the civilization to survive. 

Genes depend on DNA. --&gt; People depend on Genes. --&gt; Civilizations depend on people, for the time being.

== Not healthy to be a nice guy ==

People who suffers deadly genetic diseases, usually labeled as nice guys. The definition of nice guys in this context is those people who have different tolerances for themselves and for others.

They tolerate almost abuse from others, at the same time they are nice to them.
This kind of behaviors may turn on some &quot;bad&quot; genes that can cause the illness.

So, it is not enough to apply the golden rule, that says: “You should do things to others that you’d like them to do to you.” We need to add: “You should only tolerate things from others that they would tolerate from you.”  , and apply the double golden rule.

That explains why women do not like &quot;nice guys&quot;, &quot;nice guys&quot; may develop illness, and evolution made them avoid nice guys.

== Wait!!!! ==

Hi Ervinn,

Please don't do &quot;copy and paste&quot; pagemoves (like the ones in programming). Instead, use the &quot;move&quot; button on the top of the page, which preserves the contributions history.  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

: Hi John, I reply here, I hope you'll get it. Thanks for the advise, I was thinking about what the best way to merge. I've used &quot;move&quot; before on a page that did not exist on the keep-version of the book.  Some cases however, simular pages already existed on both books. How to merge them? Should I move them and then delete on the keep-version of the book, if not needed. Will the contribution history be kept on the deleted pages?  If yes, then I agree, that first the pages should be moved, and that what I will do. Thanks for your note again, and I would appreciate if you let me know if you've got my note here. Thanks -  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 17:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

::Hi again, yes, pagemove won't work if there's a page there already (even if it's a crappy little stub, unfortunately). The best way to handle this is:

:::1. Blank the destination page

:::2. Add {{tl|delete|reason}} to the page, and also have it redirect to the page that you intend to move (so that you can fix any links in the meantime while waiting for the deletion). 

:::3. Don't worry... I make it a point to empty the speedy deletion category daily, so it won't be long before the deed is done. 

::(BTW, I'm posting about this on the staff lounge too) --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)


::: Hi John, Thanks for your reply. I have one more question. Don't we loose the history of the destination page when we delete? Is it not the same I did, just the other way around? We still need a &quot;copy and paste&quot;, if we need to keep content from the destination page. Do I miss something? Please explain. 
::: Also, I think wiki technologhy missing a merge functionality, right now. Hopefully that will be solved in the future. May be you could post a recommendation to solve this. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 13:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

::::Yup, it's lost. But if it's just a stub, it probably doesn't have much of a history, and if it's being deleted, then the history doesn't matter anyway. Sort of a philosphica bind, eh? I'd say that the more developed page should take precedence, but that's just me. If it was of real concern, it may actually possible to delete the destination page, move the material, and then restore the old edits...I'll do some experimenting and see if that's true. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

== Redirects... ==

Hi Ervinn... You can either mark them for speedy (just put {{tl|delete}} on the page), or just leave them there... they're not hurting anything :). Nice job moving that whole book! I'm doing that to another book, and know how much work it is :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

== Image tags ==

Hi Ervinn,

I know you left an edit comment saying to mark your images as self-made, but actually ''you'' have to do that.

== Syntact vs Syntax ==

Hi Ervinn, could you clarify your use of the word 'syntact' in your articles about Java keywords.  Is it a spelling error (instead of 'syntax') or just a term I'm unfamiliar with? [[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 23:57, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

:Spelling. Feel free to correct them. Thanks,[[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== SVG ==

I was looking through the Java wikibook and noticed that many of the diagrams were encoded as jpegs.  It would be much better if you could upload SVG versions of them.  At the moment, I don't have the time to work on them myself and it would be best if they were done in a consistent style.  Thanks. [[User:Mikm|Mikm]] 07:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
:Clarification: I would be happy to work on them myself.  I just think it would be best if one person does it. [[User:Mikm|Mikm]] 07:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the note. What do you mean by SVG? If that is a better format, I'll be consider it in the future. Thanks, again. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 14:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
:Check out [[w:SVG]].  Basically, it is a vector image format that's excellent for simple diagrams.  Also, great job with the Java wikibook.  It's in a much, much better condition than I left it :) [[User:Mikm|Mikm]] 05:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Microprocessor Design]] ==

I saw some of your edits on this book, thanks for helping! I created this book last week, as a place to store my class notes. I'm glad to see other people helping out already! I'm going to continue working on this book as the semester progresses, but you are welcome to add whatever you want to it as well. If you need anything, please let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
: I was programming in Assembly languages long, long time ago. I write down what I still remember, hope it can be used by someone. And I hope I can learn something new as well.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 20:33, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

== Links ==

I assumed that's what was meant in [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]].  Quote: 
&quot;Wikibooks modules use wikilinks rather sparsely, and only to reference technical or esoteric terms that are critical to understanding the content. Most if not all wikilinks should simply be removed. See Wikibooks:Dewikify for details&quot;
But I could be wrong - I'm relatively new. --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 15:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

: I agree that there should be no unrelated links in the page different from the topic discussed. Wikipedia are full of unrelated links that can be confusing. One obvious example when they make a year ,let say, year [[w:1999|1999]] as a link.
: My understanding of the 'dewikify' process is when a page is copied over from wikipedia, those links should be removed.
: The page in question is an overview page, and the links are meant to let the reader find additional information about the topic. Obvious link could be removed, however. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 20:51, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

Good question. I have put some musings on the page but I dont know the answer. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:15, 19 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

To find some exercises for Parkour I suggest we find some of the exercises used in other sports that are part of Parkour i.e Climbing, Gymnastics, running, long jump, high jump ~~CarbonUnit

Martial Arts Bodyweight exercises look good as they build lean/function (less injure-able) muscle. ~~CarbonUnit</text>

2) Inhale deeply and pull your arms in as if you were rowing a boat.

3) Exhale and lower your buttocks while raising your heels and lowering your hands behind your back until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Keep your back perpendicular to the floor. If you have done this correctly you should feel it in your thighs.

4) Swing your arms straight out in front of you and stand up.

:Greetings and welcome to Ancient Egyptian Civilization. Here you will be able to immerse yourself in the greatest and most interesting culture of all time! If you have a passion for Mystery, or even just a passing interest of the ancient world, Egypt has something for you! Did you know that we are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV63 still uncovering Ancient Egypt to this day?]. I hope that each time you leave this course site, you will have taken away yet another bit of information about Egypt. So without further delay - please enjoy the course!

:Unfortunately, this is a necessary part of the process, but we will try to keep it short and to the point. While copyright infringement is all around us in the world, this course, everyone parcitipating in it, and wikipedia as a whole, do not tollerate this illegal behavior. The great thing about Wikipedia is that, we are all working together to make learning free for all. As such, the volunteer staff and your fellow participants are '''ALWAYS''' willing to help you upload content legally. So if you are at all confused or you are unsure of how to keep it legal - '''just ask for help'''! 

:When it comes to plagarism - we would like to point out that wikipedia is based on the premise that accuracy is derived from many minds comming together to compile information. At Wikiversity - If we only have one person writing articles, essays, notes etc. and many more people copying that source - we still end up with one source of information. The purpose of this course, and Wikiversity in general, is to gain a fuller understanding of subject matter - not to just copy and memorize. In the end - we value your personal contribution much more than copied information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:break}} is a Java keyword.

Jumps (breaks) out from a loop. Also used at {{java:switch}} statement.

For example:
{{java|code=
for ( int i=0; i &lt; maxLoopIter; i++ ) {
   System.out.println(&quot;Iter=&quot; +i);
   if ( i == 5 ) {
      break;  // -- 5 iteration is enough --
   }
}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:void}} is a Java keyword.

Used at method declaration and definition to specify that the method does not return any type, the method returns {{java:void}}. It is not a type and there is no void references/pointers as in C/C++.

For example:
{{java|code=
public void method()
 {
   //...
   return;   // -- In this case the return is optional
 }
}}

== Overview ==

A '''''Metamorphmagus''''' is a witch or wizard who has the ability to change their appearance at will, without the need for a wand, spell, or potion.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Metamorphmagy is a very rare ability, and one that the witch or wizard must be born with. There is no way to train to become a Metamorphmagus.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], who we first meet in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', is a Metamorphmagus. She tells Harry that the ability helped her greatly in the Concealment and Disguise in her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] training. Throughout the fifth book, she changes her hair color and style very frequently, although her favorite hair style is short, spiky, and bright pink. She also changes the shape of her nose between bites at dinner, to entertain her fellow diners.

== Analysis ==

Throughout much of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], we see that Tonks is not using her Metamorphmagus ability at all. Harry believes that she is mourning someone, and her sorrow is either preventing her from changing her appearance, or else is simply leaving her uninspired to do so. We never find out if the actual ability to change her appearance has been lost. We do find out that the loss is temporary, however.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Sirius Black is related to Tonks – they are cousins. Could he also have some Metamorphmagus ability? Could that have helped him when he went through the spells necessary for him to become an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]?

I have a problem with this article: &quot;House&quot; has more than one meaning, and the fact that this article is in the Places section means that the focus of the article should be on the building of the Gaunts. However, the description, dating back to when the article was created, is about the Gaunt Family, which would rather belong in the Characters section... -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 10:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
:I agree with this assessment. I'll tweak it when I get a chance. There should actually be two articles, one for the place, because stuff happens there albeit fifty to seventy years ago, and one for the family because the family is important also.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, if this is the best we can do then its no wonder creationists are making so much progress. I know it is not helpful to criticise without assisting but this isn't even at the level of my GCSE (16 year old exams for non-Brits) textbooks. This is a summary, it doesn't explain any of the hows, whys and so forth. I am sorry, I know someone has probably worked hard on this, but it needs much more detail.

I fixed some of the grammar on this and i agree with the guy above. People should really learn to put &quot;a&quot; and &quot;the&quot; in between their words... [[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 19:49, 9 July 2006 (UTC)



I expanded the &quot;Gene First/Metabolism First&quot; portion. I'm not an expert per se on the subject, however, there was a good article in SciAm a few issues ago dealing with this subject, so I did my best to summarize. If there are any errors, please be sure to correct them. I'm a astrophysics major, so I might be a bit off on some of it. Hope it helps though.

==Introduction==

The so called &quot;sticky&quot; consonants in Finnish are L N R and S and they behave in a particular &quot;sticky&quot; manner when adjacent to the powerful vowel E.  The properties of these letters cause pronunciation effects in Finnish and these pronunciation effects are very regular and are reflected in Finnish orthography (i.e. the spelling of the written word)

Learning about the properties of these letters will help you to understand more about consonant gradation and the changes that occur, especially in verbs.

==Types of effects==

===Consonant degradation effects in consonant clusters===

LT &gt; LL consonant degradation  - T drops but sticky L retains a memory of the T as a long LL
:so '''aalto''' ''wave'' becomes '''aallot''' ''the waves (e.g. the beach)''  in the nominative plural. 


NK &gt; NG consonant degradation  - K drops but sticky N retains a memory of the K as NG 
:so '''Helsinki''' becomes '''Helsingin''' in the genitive

RT &gt; RR consonant degradation  - T drops but sticky R retains a memory of the T as a long RR
: so '''parta''' ''beard'' but '''parran väri''' ''beard colour''.  


ST = ST does not degrade - Sticky S holds the T completely and prevents ST from degrading to SD
:so '''rakastaa''' ''to love'' forms '''rakastan''' ''I love'' (and definititely not 'rakasdan' as it would if we followed the usual t to d degradation pattern).

We can see that S is slightly different and is somehow more 'sticky' than N, L or R.

===In Nouns===

===In Verbs===
====Type 3 verbs====
Sticky L N R and S are implicated in the special group of verbs dubbed as Verbs Type 3. This group includes verbs like mennä, tulla, purra, and päästä.  These verbs have stem forms ending in  L, N, R or S. 

We will begin, not by thinking of how the verb is used when conjugated for person and only later will we consider how the infinitive is formed. 

This requires us to think of the verb as having two parts, a stem containing the basic verb meaning and an ending containing information about the person performing the action considering

:'''men-''' stem of the word ''go''  
:'''tul-''' stem of the word ''come''
:'''pur-''' stem of the word ''bite''
:'''pääs-''' stem of the word ''get to/from or be allowed to get to/from''

The present/future tense stem forms add -e- before the personal ending or -i- in the imperfect or simple past tense.

:'''men-''' ''Go''  so '''menen''' ''I go/I will go'', '''hän meni''' ''He went''
:'''tul-''' ''come''  so '''tulet''' ''You go/You will go'' '''he tulivat''' ''They came'' 
:'''pur-''' ''bite'' so '''puretko kynsiäsi ?''' ''do you bite your nails?'' '''purin kieleni''' ''I bit my tongue''
:'''pääs-''' ''get to/from'' so '''pääsen kotiin sunnuntaiaamuna.''' ''I'll get (to) home on Sunday morning'' '''soitin Timolle heti kun pääsin tänne''' ''I called (to) Timo as soon as I got here''.

SO you can see that in the present tense we add e to the stem before adding the personal ending and in the past tense or imperfect we add i before adding the personal ending.

The dictionary forms of these verbs are made by adding a or ä to the stem according to the standard rules of making the first infinitive, but the sticky nature of the L N R and S can have one further effect on the stem which will now need to examine.

With stems ending N L or R, the letter is doubled before adding the first infinitive a or ä, so in effect we get a rather strong consonant at the end of the dictionary forms.

:'''men-''' becomes '''MENNÄ''' ''to go'' 
:'''tul-''' becomes '''TULLA''' ''to come''
:'''pur-''' becomes '''PURRA''' ''to bite''

S is again a little exceptional but perhaps for obvious reasons. It does NOT double the S before adding the infinitive -a or -ä (that would make -ssa or -ssä and thus appear like a nominal in the inessive case!) BUT INSTEAD ADDS T before adding the -a or -ä.

:'''pääs-''' becomes '''PÄÄSTÄ''' ''to get to/from'' or ''to be allowed to get to/from''

So all these verbs with stems ending in N L R or S form consonant clusters at the end of the dictionary forms which are therefore either NN LL RR or ST followed by the first infintive -A or -Ä according to standard vocal harmony rules.

So far this has been relatively easy to follow. 

Now it gets little more complicated.

Whenever this strong cluster appears in the infinitive ending, it can weaken the last strong consonant or consonant cluster in the stem.  This is because Finnish does not allow two strong consonants or consonant clusters to be separated by a single vowel. This is, more or less a '''phonetic rule''' rather than a grammar rule, but because it affects the phonetics, it carries over into the spelling.

: '''TyöskeNTelen suomen kielen opettajana''' ''I am working as a Finnish language teacher''
: '''TyöskeNTelin suomen kielen opettajana''' ''I worked as Finnish lanaguage teacher''
: '''Haluaisin työskeNNeLLä suomen kielen opettajana''' ''I'd like to work as Finnish Language teacher''

The strong LL cluster weakens the immediately preceeding NT cluster to NN. 

So in summary:-

: ''' RULE:  When the verb stem has a final consonant  L, N, R or S, followed by e (present) or i (past tense), adding the infinitive end -A/Ä will cause the N L or R to be doubled and S will add T before the infinitive A/Ä.'''

And one other rule applies in this case

: '''RULE:  When forming the double LL NN RR or ST cluster to make the infinitive form of the verb, a preceding strong consonant before the stem ending is weakened.'''

A useful fact about all these verbs is that this rule is reversible and so it can also be said that

:'''RULE: if the dictionary verb form ends NN RR SS or ST followed by -A/-Ä, then the A/Ä is dropped as well as the immediately preceding consonant. Before adding the personal ending add e for the present/future tense or i for the past tense. If, to the left of the N L R or S there is a weak form consonant or consonant cluster, it is strengthened in all of the present/future/imperfect forms.'''

:'''PHONETIC RULE: Finnish does not allow two strong consonants or consonant clusters to be separated by a single vowel. If grammar rules create a strong consonant in the final syllable of a word, preceding strong grade consonant or consonant cluster will be weakened.

However, as we shall see below, the participle forms that are used to form certain past tense forms have weak rather than strong grade rather like the infinitive.  However, we can use the phonetic rule to predict the form of the particple with absolute certainty, so there is no need to panic!

The past participle ending for most verbs is -NUT (or -NYT according to vocal harmony, or '''-NEET''' if plural). But if the verb stem ends in sticky L R or S, it will have the ending -LUT -RUT -SUT (or LYT -RYT or SYT according to harmony). So sticky S L N and R strike again!  Because the verb stem also ends in L R N or S, in practice all verbs in Type 3 have past participle endings '''-NNUT -LLUT -RRUT -SSUT''' (or '''-NNYT, -LLYT, -RRYT''' or '''-SSYT''') or '''-NNEET -LLEET -RREET''' or '''-SSEET''' if plural.  (The past or second participle form is used when forming the negative imperfect, the perfect and the pluperfect forms), 

:'''Mennä &gt; Mennyt  Olen jo mennyt kaupassa''' ''I've already been to the shop'' 
:'''Tulla &gt; Tullut  Olin jo tullut kaupasta kun...''' ''I had already come from the shop when...'' 
:'''Purra &gt; Purrut  En purrut kynsiäni'''  ''I did not bite my nails''
:'''Päästä &gt; Päässyt  Valitettavasti emme päässeet kävelemään''' ''Unfortunately, we didn't go walking 


Because these forms all carry NN LL RR or SS, we can use the '''phonetic rule''' we learned earlier to predict with certainty that any verb carrying a stong grade stem form will have weakened form in the participle  - i.e. it will be weak grade in the participle as we as the infinitve but strong in the forms with personal endings.

So 

:'''Työskennellä''' ''to work''
:'''Työskentelin''' ''I worked''
:'''En työskennellyt''' ''I did not work''


Double LL forces the adjacent NT cluster to weaken to NN in both the sticky infinitive ending &quot;-LLÄ&quot; as well as the sticky participle ending &quot;-LLYT&quot;.  The same rule applies to all the verbs in this group where N L R or S is doubled to form either the participle or the infinitive ending.

====Type 1 verbs - past tense====

Type 1 verbs (where the first infinitive ends in two vowels) have a special subgroup in the formation of the past tense due to the influence of one of these sticky letters. 

The subgroup applies to verbs that have a letter l, n, or r followed by t and aa or ää when followed by a t in Some behave differently to others in the way the simple past tense is formed. 

'''Type 1 Verb  (standard form) - '''

'''Aikoa'''  ''To Intend''
:'''Minä aion''  ''I intend''
::'''Minä aioin'''  ''I intended''

'''Leipoa'''  ''To Bake''
:'''Minä leivon'''  ''I (will) bake''
::'''Minä leivoin'''  ''I baked''



'''Type 2 Verb (with sticky l, n, r affecting the simple past tense)'''

'''Lentää'''  ''To Fly''
:'''Minä lennän'''   ''I (will) fly''
::'''Minä lensin'''  ''I flew''        
:::NT &gt; NN &gt; '''NS''' in past tense       

'''Hiertää'''  ''To Rub
:'''Minä hierrän'''  ''I (will) rub''
::'''Minä hiersin'''   ''I rubbed
:::RT &gt; RR &gt; '''RS''' in past tense

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Major Cleanup and Revision==

I've taken a look at this article and it was quite frankly terrible. I've removed most of the jargon or self-references to someone's in-development project (The casual reader cares about what you've named an enemy why?), as well as about four or five copyright notices which were scattered throughout. I also removed a few sections which either had no text or no meaningful information (Such as the Paths header with just &quot;Suck&quot; underneath).

Right now I'm working mostly off of memory, which is why this remains vague. I'm planning to come back on Sunday, July 2nd and cleaning and extending this article if nobody else gets around to it by then.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{java:case}} is a Java keyword.

This is part of the {{java:switch}} statement, to find if the value passed to the switch statement matches a value followed by case.

For example:
{{java|code=
int i = 3;
switch(i) {
case 1:
   System.out.println(&quot;The number is 1.&quot;);
   break;
case 2:
   System.out.println(&quot;The number is 2.&quot;);

== About this Template ==

This is a navigational template used for the [[Modern Physics]] wikibook. This template automatically produced a backlink to the main page of the book, and, if provided with an optional parameter, will produce a second-level backlink as well. for instance, {{tl|ModernPhysicsNav}} will produce:

{{ModernPhysicsNav}}

While {{tlx|ModernPhysicsNav|Electromagnetism}} will produce:

{{ModernPhysicsNav|Electromagnetism}}

This template assumes that the main table of contents is found at [[Modern Physics]], and that sub-sections are located at &quot;Modern Physics:SUBSECTION:Contents&quot;.

=== 2nd and 3rd Parameters ===

Also, two more optional parameters have been added to allow for a link to the previous page and the next page. These parameters can be left out entirely, if one or both links are not needed. For instance, {{tlx|ModernPhysicsNav|Waves|Light|Beats}} Will produce:

{{ModernPhysicsNav|Waves|Light|Beats}}

If the naming convention of the [[Modern Physics]] book is changed, this template must also be changed.

This template automatically includes the target page in [[:Category:Modern Physics]].
[[Category:Modern Physics|Nav]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{java:switch}} is a Java keyword.

It is a branching operation, based on a number. The 'number' must be either {{java:char}}, {{java:byte}}, {{java:short}}, or {{java:int}} primitive type.

Syntax:
 {{java:switch}} ( &lt;integer-var&gt; )
 {
    {{java:case}} &lt;label&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;;
    {{java:case}} &lt;label&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;;
    ...
    {{java:case}} &lt;label&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;;
    {{java:default}}: &lt;statements&gt;;
 }
When the &lt;integer-var&gt; value match one of the &lt;label&gt;, then:
The statements after the matched label will be executed including the following label's statements, until the end of the {{java:switch}} block, or until a {{java:break}} keyword is reached.

For example:
{{java|code=
int var = 3;
switch ( var )
{
   case 1: 
      System.out.println( &quot;Case: 1&quot; );
      System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
      break;		  	
   case 2: 
      System.out.println( &quot;Case: 2&quot; );
      System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
      break;
   case 3:
      System.out.println( &quot;Case: 3&quot; );
      System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
      break;  	
   case 4:
      System.out.println( &quot;Case: 4&quot; );
      System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
      break;      
   default:
      System.out.println( &quot;Case: default&quot; );
      System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
      break;	      
}		
}}
The output from the above code is:
 Case: 3
 Execute until break
The same code can be written with if-else blocks&quot;:
{{java|code=
int var = 3;
if ( var == 1 ) {
   System.out.println( &quot;Case: 1&quot; );
   System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
} else if ( var == 2 ) {
   System.out.println( &quot;Case: 2&quot; );
   System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
} else if ( var == 3 ) {
   System.out.println( &quot;Case: 3&quot; );
   System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
} else if ( var == 4 ) {
   System.out.println( &quot;Case: 4&quot; );
   System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
} else {
   // -- This is the default part -- 
   System.out.println( &quot;Case: default&quot; );
   System.out.println( &quot;Execute until break&quot; );
}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{java:default}} is a Java keyword.

This is an optional part of the {{java:switch}} statement, which only executes if none of the above cases are matched.

== Optimizing Code for Speed - Outline ==

* Introduction
** In what kind of programs is optimization required?
** When to optimize?
** When not to optimize?
* Guidelines to Optimization
** Make sure you have automated tests with good coverage. (So nothing gets broken in the process, and to give fodder for the profiler).
** Make sure your code is modular enough. 
** Profile using a Profiler.
** Code review.
* Order of Complexity Optimizations
** Explanation
** What is order of complexity?
** Reducing order of complexity
*** Examples
**** Lookup should be considerably less than O(n)
**** A Balanced Binary Tree instead of a sorted array.
**** A hash instead of a balanced binary tree 
**** Counting Sort/Radix Sort
**** Joel on Software's Back to Basics' Shlemiel's the Painter syndrome - O(n^2) instead of O(n)
*** Showing that the algorithm is of the lowest complexity.
** Reverse Order of Complexity Optimizations - sometimes lower complexity algorithms would have a larger factor
*** The Median O(N) algorithm - usually a O(N*log(N)) sort would be preferable.
*** Counting sort for large objects.
* Factor Optimizations
** What are factor optimizations?
** The Motivation for Factor Optimizations
** Examples: 
*** Using Pointers to structs instead of an array of structs
*** Reducing the memory consumption.
**** Note about the Memory/Speed trade-off &quot;myth&quot;.
*** Parallelization:
**** Note about Amdahl's Law.
*** Putting the most commonly used variables in the struct's beginning. (Linux kernel)
*** Copy-on-write
*** Caching
*** Avoiding Copying alltogether
*** Inline Functions
*** Schwartzian Transform
** Call for a catalog of optimizations
* Changing the Dependencies
*# Using different libraries or your own self-coded routines.
*# Switching to a faster language (or optimizing critical code in a  different one). Languages hierarchy:
*#* Assembler &gt; C &gt;= O'Caml &gt; Java, .NET &gt;&gt; Perl, PHP &gt; Python, Ruby, Tcl
* Optimizing by Reducing Feature-Set:
** Less code -&gt; less memory consumption -&gt; faster code.
** Less features -&gt; less if's and stuff -&gt; faster code.
*** Violating the &quot;0, 1, Infinity&quot; Law.
** By compromising on security:
*** less sanity checks, input checks, etc. lead to faster code.
**** code that does not contain a lot of checking for malloc() failure, etc. will run faster because it does not have a lot error handling.
***** &quot;Here be dragons&quot;.

      <comment>/* 3. Interview at least two teachers with the following questions: */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|2|1944|Vocational|General Conference}}
==1. What education is needed for teaching the following: a. Elementary school, b. Secondary school, c. College==
The requirements necessary to become a teacher vary dramatically from country to country, and in the United States, it varies from state to state. In general, a four year bachelors degree is required to teach elementary school, though often there is no direct &quot;degree&quot; in elementary education. Rather, the education certification is the &quot;minor&quot; one earns while receiving a bachelors' degree. If one is planning to teach in secondary school, the teacher often receives a degree in the subject of interest, and certification (whether denominational and/or state), as a minor or fifth year of education. Both elementary and secondary certifications require student teaching, which is either one-quarter or one-semester in length, depending on the program.

The path to becoming a college professor is much more varied. College professors eventually earn a doctorate in the area of their particular interest and giftedness. However, they may get that degree immediately after they finish a bachelors' or masters' degree, or years later either before they began teaching at a college level or after they have begun their professorship (but usually before they become full professors). College professors are specialists in their field of study, which means they have often been professionals in that field for a number of years prior to entering the college teaching scene.
==2. What is re-certification?==
Recertification is when you have someone’s certification or qualification renewed.
Teacher recertification is the way that teachers keep &quot;current&quot; in the issues that affect their classrooms, their teaching style, and most importantly, their students. Most students think that their teachers get the summer off. In reality, most teachers spend a large portion of each summer attending summer school, taking additional classes that will help them be better teachers. In most cases, re-certification requirements require that a teacher earn a certain number of college credits every three years.

There are a variety of certifications and endorsements available to teachers. In the SDA teaching system, a teacher begins with a basic certification, after three years and some classes and tests, a teacher may receive a standard certification. After a significant number of years and education (usually a masters' degree) a teacher is eligible to receive a professional certification.

==3. Interview at least two teachers with the following questions:==
*'''a. Why did you choose to become a teacher?'''
*'''b. What part of teaching do you like the best?'''
*'''c. What part of teaching do you like the least?'''
*'''d. What do you do to get ready for a school year?'''
*'''e. What do you do to get ready for a school day?'''
*'''f. What teacher-related activities do you do after school is out each day?'''
*'''g. What are some qualities of a good teacher?'''
*'''h. What are the responsibilities and duties of a teacher?'''

When interviewing a teacher, please keep the following tips in mind:

1.  Teachers love to tell stories, and love to spend time with people... be prepared to listen!

2.  Because teachers love people, they often have a hard time saying &quot;no&quot; or &quot;could we do the interview later?&quot; even when they are really busy and have lots of demands on their time.  So, be polite and alert to what might be going on in the teacher's life and try to find a time not too near test week, a holiday, or the beginning or end of a term.  

3.  Take good notes.  Teachers love to see that you care enough to write it down!

4.  If your selected teacher is okay with it, record your interview on an audio or video device.  This will allow you to go back and &quot;review&quot; what you've learned from the interview.

5.  Don't limit yourself to this list of interview questions.  Get your heart involved in the interview, and learn what you can about the teacher and what it is like to be one.  This is a special one-on-one opportunity you have with a special person.  Make the most of it!

==4. Explore the Bible and the book Education by Ellen G. White to learn what teaching methods Jesus used. Present a three-minute oral report on what you learned.==
The Bible can be searched online at http://www.biblegateway.com. The Ellen White writings can be viewed and searched online at http://www.whiteestate.org/search/search.asp

==5. If you are 16 years old or younger, do the following for a minimum of 40 minutes per week for three weeks.==
*'''a. Assist a teacher in designing and preparing a bulletin board.'''
*'''b. Assist a teacher in preparing learning aids.'''
*'''c. With the supervision of a teacher, teach a child or class at least one concept.'''
==6. If you are older than 16 years, do three of the following:==
*'''a. Teach an adult's or children's Sabbath School class for a minimum of six weeks.'''
*'''b. Teach in one day in each department of Vacation Bible School.'''
*'''c. Teach two Honors from the Honors Handbook.'''
*'''d. Assist in teaching requirements for one of the AY classes, culminating in investiture.'''
*'''e. Teach at least one year in an elementary or secondary school or in a college.'''

==Historical notes==
When the original Honor for Teaching was accepted in 1944, it was for adult Master Guides and had only one requirement: &quot;Have five years of professional teaching experience on the elementary, secondary, or college level.&quot;- Junior Missionary Volunteer Handbook, revision of 1957.

Many Honors have grown and changed over the years.  Today we focus on development that allows our youth to participate in and earn any Honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi all!

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; My most up-to-date profile is [[wikipedia:User:Shlomif|'''my English Wikipedia Profile''']].

My name is Shlomi Fish, and I'm an Israeli programmer, writer (of creative stories and aphorisms, articles, essays, lectures, blog entries or comments and web content), and also an amateur mathematician and an even more amateur artist. I'm also active in promoting and advocating various Open Source and Open Content technologies and resources in Israel and on the Internet.

[http://www.shlomifish.org/ My home-site] is maintained by me, and contains many things I've written and placed online, as well as links to other places by me. [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22shlomi%20fish%22 A Google Search on my name] also has many useful links (as are similar searches like that for &quot;shlomif&quot;). 

I've been contributing to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php/User:Shlomif English wikipedia], to the [http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%A9:Shlomif Hebrew Wikipedia] and to [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Shlomif the English wikiquote], to other public wikis around, and may contribute to other wikimedia projects in the future.

I've started my first wikibook - [[Optimizing Code for Speed]]. Here's [http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ my contact information].

I now started a new wikibook - [[How to Achieve Software Quality]], needed as a prerequisite for [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] after the book [[How to Write a Program]] which I'm unhappy with was set as a prerequisite for it.

===Special Typography Symbols===
: &amp;nbsp; 00A0 non-breaking space - invisible forced space.
: - 00AD soft hyphen - is shown where it is inserted in a word if the word is too long for the line and breaks just after the soft hyphen. Otherwise the hyphen is invisible. In several wordprocessors soft hyphen can be entered by holding the control key and at the same time pressing the hyphen key, and is shown as a hyphen with gray background.
: &amp;nbsp; 200B zero-width space - provides a non-printing word separator, an invisible line break opportunity
: &amp;nbsp; 200C zero-width non-joiner - non-printing character to separate two characters that would otherwise produce a ligature

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page lists brief explanations for the functions used in [[Programming:Message-Passing Interface|MPI]].
----
 int MPI_Send( void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, 
               int tag, MPI_Comm comm )

This sends the contents of &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; to the destination of rank &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; while the receiving end calls &lt;code&gt;MPI_Recv&lt;/code&gt;.

----
 int MPI_Recv( void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, 
               int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status )

This fills the &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; with data comming from to the source of rank &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; while the sender  calls &lt;code&gt;MPI_Send&lt;/code&gt;.

----
 int MPI_Bcast ( void *buffer, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int root, 
                 MPI_Comm comm )

This sends the contents of &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; to all other processes. So afterwards the first &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; elements of &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; is the same across all nodes. [http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Bcast.html]

The performance of &lt;code&gt;MPI_Bcast&lt;/code&gt; can be between &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(\log_2 N)&lt;/math&gt;.[http://www.pdc.kth.se/training/Talks/MPI/Collective.I/less.html#perf_bcast_image][http://www.llnl.gov/computing/mpi/moody.pdf]

==MPI 2.0 Connection commands==
 int MPI_Open_port(MPI_Info info, char *port_name)
This creates a port to which other processes can connect. The buffer passed as &lt;code&gt;port_name&lt;/code&gt; string must be at least &lt;code&gt;MPI_MAX_PORT_NAME&lt;/code&gt; long and will contain a unique identifier which other processes will need to know in order to connect.

----
 int MPI_Comm_accept(char *port_name, MPI_Info info, int root, MPI_Comm comm, 
                     MPI_Comm *newcomm)
After calling &lt;code&gt;MPI_Open_port()&lt;/code&gt;, this function waits for a connection.

----
 int MPI_Comm_connect(char *port_name, MPI_Info info, int root, MPI_Comm comm, 
                       MPI_Comm *newcomm)
This opens a connection to another process which is waiting on &lt;code&gt;MPI_Comm_accept()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;port_name&lt;/code&gt; argument must be the same as the result of the other process's &lt;code&gt;port_name&lt;/code&gt; returned from &lt;code&gt;MPI_Open_port&lt;/code&gt;.

==Reduction==
The following functions reduce arrays of data across processors to scalars on one or many processors by applying simple functions such as summation.
----
 int MPI_Scan ( void *sendbuf, void *recvbuf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,
                MPI_Op op, MPI_Comm comm )

See [http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-11-html/node85.html].

----
 int MPI_Allreduce ( void *sendbuf, void *recvbuf, int count, 
                     MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op op, MPI_Comm comm )

This performs an operation specified by &lt;code&gt;MPI_Op&lt;/code&gt; on all nodes to each node's &lt;code&gt;sendbuf&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if node 0 had &lt;code&gt;{0, 1, 2}&lt;/code&gt; and node 1 had &lt;code&gt;{3, 4, 5}&lt;/code&gt; in its &lt;code&gt;sendbuf&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, and if both called &lt;code&gt;MPI_Allreduce(sendbuf, foo, 3, MPI_INT, MPI_SUM, world)&lt;/code&gt;, the contents of the buffer pointed to by &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; on both would be
: {0+3, 1+4, 2+5} = {3, 5, 7}


Performance for ''P'' processes: &lt;math&gt;O(N\log P)&lt;/math&gt;.[http://www.llnl.gov/computing/mpi/moody.pdf]
----
 int [http://www.nersc.gov/vendor_docs/ibm/pe/am107mst83.html MPI_Comm_split](MPI_Comm comm, int color, int key, MPI_Comm *newcomm);

&lt;code&gt;MPI_Comm_split()&lt;/code&gt; creates a new communicator in each process. The resulting communicators are common to the processes that provided the same &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; argument. Processes can opt not to get a communicator by providing &lt;code&gt;MPI_UNDEFINED&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, which will produce &lt;code&gt;MPI_COMM_NULL&lt;/code&gt; for that process.

For example, the following code splits &lt;code&gt;MPI_COMM_WORLD&lt;/code&gt; into three communicators &quot;colored&quot; 0, 1, and 2.

 #include&lt;iostream&gt;
 #include&lt;mpi.h&gt;
 
 using namespace std;
 
 int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   MPI_Init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
   int rank;
   MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank);
   MPI_Comm comm;
   MPI_Comm_split(MPI_COMM_WORLD, rank % 3, -rank*2, &amp;comm); // The keys need not be positive or contiguous.
   int rank2;
   MPI_Comm_rank(comm, &amp;rank2);
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My rank was &quot; &lt;&lt; rank &lt;&lt; &quot; now &quot; &lt;&lt; rank2 &lt;&lt; &quot; color: &quot; &lt;&lt; rank % 3 &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
   MPI_Finalize();
 }

Run with eight processes, this output the following (in undefined order):
 My rank was 0 now 2 color: 0
 My rank was 1 now 2 color: 1
 My rank was 2 now 1 color: 2
 My rank was 3 now 1 color: 0
 My rank was 4 now 1 color: 1
 My rank was 5 now 0 color: 2
 My rank was 6 now 0 color: 0
 My rank was 7 now 0 color: 1

== Nonblocking asynchronous communication ==
The following functions work together to allow nonblocking asynchronous communications among processes.[http://www.amath.washington.edu/~beowulf/mpi/noblock.html] One process sends while another receives. The sender must must check that the operation is complete before erasing the buffer. &lt;code&gt;MPI_Wait()&lt;/code&gt; is a blocking wait whereas &lt;code&gt;MPI_Test&lt;/code&gt; is nonblocking.

&lt;code&gt;MPI_Isend()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MPI_Irecv()&lt;/code&gt; calls need not be in order. That is, process 42 could call &lt;code&gt;MPI_Irecv()&lt;/code&gt; three times to begin receiving from processes 37, 38, and 39 which can send at their leisure.

----
 int MPI_Isend(void* buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request);
---
 int MPI_Irecv(void* buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request recvtag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status);
----
 int MPI_Wait(MPI_Request *request, MPI_Status *status);
----
 int MPI_Test(MPI_Request  *request, int* flag, MPI_Status* status);


Example code:

&lt;pre&gt;
#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;mpi.h&gt;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  MPI_Init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
  int rank;
  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank);
  MPI_Comm comm;

  int sources[] = {3,4,5};
  int dest = 1;
  int tag =42;
  if (rank == sources[0] || rank == sources[1] || rank == sources[2]) {
    double x[] = { 1*rank, 2*rank, 3*rank};
    MPI_Request r;
    MPI_Isend(x, 3, MPI_DOUBLE, dest, tag, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;r);
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Process &quot; &lt;&lt; rank &lt;&lt; &quot; waiting...\n&quot;;
    MPI_Status status;
    MPI_Wait(&amp;r, &amp;status);
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Process &quot; &lt;&lt; rank &lt;&lt; &quot; sent\n&quot;;
  } else if(rank == dest) {
    double x[3][3];
    MPI_Request r[3];
    for (int i = 0; i !=3; ++i) {
      MPI_Irecv(x[i], 3, MPI_DOUBLE, sources[i], tag, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;r[i]);
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Process &quot; &lt;&lt; rank &lt;&lt; &quot; waiting for &quot; &lt;&lt; sources[i] &lt;&lt; &quot; on recv.\
\n&quot;;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i !=3; ++i) {
      MPI_Status status;
      MPI_Wait(&amp;r[i], &amp;status);
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Process &quot; &lt;&lt; rank &lt;&lt; &quot; got &quot; &lt;&lt; x[i][0] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; x[i][1] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;\
&lt; x[i][2] &lt;&lt; &quot;.\n&quot;;
    }
  }

  MPI_Finalize();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
