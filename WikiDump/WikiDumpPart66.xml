      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

Since 1890 sentence pedagogy was an integral part of composition instruction. Sentence types were classified, grammatical types were taught, and students would practice by writing each of the different kinds. 
 
Francis Christensen published &quot;A Generative Rhetoric of Science&quot; in 1963, advocating that students be taught sentience construction by beginning with simple sentences then gradually make them more complicated. And in 1978 Lester Faigley conducted experiments that proved this method's effectiveness. At this same time, other schools of thought developed. In 1963 Edward P.J. Corbett advocated for the use of imitation as a tool for teaching sentence construction, and in 1957 Noam Chomskey theorized that sentence combining could help students produce better sentences. And some petitioned for the elimination of formal grammar instruction, arguing that it stripped context, was dehumanizing, and lacked creativity. 

Of the three forms of sentence rhetoric (the “generative” rhetoric of Francis Christensen, classical imitation, and sentence combining) this article will concentrate on classical imitation as evidence indicates that copying and writing to sentence patterns as the most effective way to teach students sentence rhetoric.

==Objectives and Benefits of Imitation==

In imitation, students study a sentience and then attempt to imitate its structure. This process encourages students to engage in problem solving and to use analytical skills to achieve their objectives. It engages students in an active manner and allows students to practice stylistic dexterity. 

An added benefit of imitation is that it provides students with the opportunity to practice their critical reading skills, and to write in a number of different styles which they can use to develop their own authorial voice. Imitation also helps teach the subject of sentence composition in a way that avoids dry, academic terms, and instead offers students a hands-on approach that empowers students by letting them write.

This is not to say that students can’t (or shouldn't) learn the eight parts of speech. Identifying them in the models is a can be an integrated way to teach enough traditional nomenclature that you and your students can actually talk about language.
[edit]

==Why Daily Oral Language Doesn't Work==

Daily Oral Language is the most widely used set of sentence construction activities. This method of instruction uses exercises in which  students to correct mistakes in sample sentences. This method is ineffective as it includes only negative examples and it concentrates on small aspects of sentence construction, such as spelling and punctuation. Daily Oral Language is divorced from any kind of context, involves very little critical thinking, and does not engage students in actual act of writing. In contrast, classical imitation encourages the use of positive examples, and focuses on larger and more important issues of sentence construction.

As an instructor, be aware of the limitations of activities like Daily Oral Language, which seem like quality activities but fail to reflect a proven pedagogical theory.

==The Exercises==

The linked [[rhetoric and Composition/Teacher's Handbook/Teaching Sentence Structure/Exercises|exercises]] are examples of various types of sentence forms (simple, compound, complex, etc.) which instructors may use for imitation activities. 

Once the models are copied, student write pastiches—their own sentences, but using the form, perhaps even the verb tense or person, of the model sentence that they have copied.  These sentences can be reviewed as a class, or they can be written in writing journals and checked periodically.

Some of these are simple creations of the author.  Others are examples taken from books that were models of this type of instruction in the 1960s and ‘70s but have gone out of print (Gorrell, Weathers).  They are listed in the bibliography, and probably can be found via an internet search.

''Students are to copy the model sentence and then write 2 or 3 (or more, if you choose) sentences using the same structure—no more, no less.

1980-1986 Frank joins FOXHOUND.

i do not believe he would be able to obtain the highest rank if he hasnt joined yet this needs to be corrected.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|Active Server Pages|Database Access Using ADO|Appendix A: Language_Reference}}

= Objectives =

In this chapter we will discuss the use of server-side includes (SSI) to simplify the process of building and maintaining a website.  For maximum flexibility, I use SSI for both site templates and common code modules (libraries).

= Content =

Server-side includes have been around long before Active Server Pages was ever conceived.  Basically, it was designed as a web server extension that looked for special macros contained inside of HTML comments.  Nearly all webservers support at least some subset of server-side includes.  The most useful of these macros is the &quot;server-side include&quot;.

So when a web page is accessed, the web server would first scan the source file (or resource) that the visitor requested.  If no processing macros were found, then this file is simply delivered to the user without modification.  When a macro is found, the web server will do the appropriate processing of the macro (completely replacing the HTML comment with the appropriate results).  All of this is done before the content gets delivered to the user (or the remote host).

== What it Does ==

The specific processing directive we are interested in here is the server-side include.  This allows you to import the contents of another document into the current one.  This is extremely useful for reusing common blocks of ASP code and HTML.  One of the most common uses of this is for creating a website template.  

Another popular use is for creating code libraries that can be included in the web pages where you need them.  I typically create a generic site-wide library that all pages must include, a header and footer template, a database library, an e-mail library and a form processing library.  By reusing common code, you can eliminate the errors that may occur when you copy code from one page to another.

There are two different types of server-side includes we will discuss here: &quot;virtual includes&quot; and &quot;file includes&quot;.  The only difference is in the way that they access the directory structure for the website.

== Virtual Includes ==

A virtual include will import the contents of another file based on the document root of the webserver.  The path to the file should begin with a slash ('''/''') which represents the root of the website (not the root of the filesystem).

Internet Information Server (the default webserver for Microsoft Windows) may be configured so that you cannot use a '''File Include''' to import the contents of a file from a parent directory.  In this case, you will need to use the '''Virtual Include''' to accomplish this task.

Shown below is an example of two virtual includes used to pull in a ''header'' and ''footer'' template into the current page.  Contained within an HTML comment (delimitted by '''&amp;lt;!--''' and '''--&amp;gt;'''), you will see the processing directive ('''#include virtual''').  The path and filename inside the quotes is the resource we want to bring into the current document.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- #include virtual=&quot;/lib/header.asp&quot; --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!-- #include virtual=&quot;/lib/footer.asp&quot; --&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It is important to note that you can import many different types of files into the current document.  You should realize that the webserver simply replaces the contents of the ''included'' file directly into your HTML document.  Also, you cannot embed any preprocessing macros inside an ASP code block (delimitted by '''&lt;%''' and '''%&gt;''').

The include process works recursively, so that if you include one file that //also contains// server-side include directives, then those will be included recursively so that all macros are processed.

== File Includes ==

Another type of include statement is '''#include file'''.  This statement works just like the '''virtual include''' except that the path to the file must be relative to the directory where the current page resides.  In other words, you cannot access the directory structure starting from the document root (meaning the root of the website.)

Below is the same example as before with the virtual includes replaced with file includes.  When running this script under IIS, you may get an error when trying to access a parent directory in this manner.  For this reason, I prefer to use virtual includes whenever possible.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- #include file=&quot;../lib/header.asp&quot; --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!-- #include file=&quot;../lib/footer.asp&quot; --&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Alternatives to Server-Side Includes ==

Active Server Pages contains a couple of statements that work similar to server-side includes.  These are also useful for the same purposes as server-side includes.  However, none is a substitute for the other.  They all have their different purposes and you should know when to use each.

=== Server.Execute ===

This will execute another Active Server Page file from the website.  You can do this conditionally using the '''If Then''' ... '''End If''' syntax.  This is different from the server-side include statement which will be executed wherever it appears.

Another difference between this statement and a server-side include is that all variables, functions and classes defined in the calling script '''will not be accessible''' in the executed script.  This is a huge barrier to using this as an include and it is the main reason why I prefer server-side include to this statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
If Application(&quot;ShowForum&quot;) Then
	Server.Execute(&quot;/module/forum.asp&quot;)
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

I have used this to build a modular web portal application with good success.  Through a control panel, the user can configure which modules they would like to display on their website.  The template engine checks this configuration and pulls in only the modules that we need to display and arranges the layout accordingly.

=== Server.Transfer ===

The '''Server.Transfer''' statement is similar to '''Execute''' in that it executes an external ASP file on the webserver.  However, unlike '''Execute''', this function does not return control to the calling script.  Instead, control is transferred to the script and, when the script finishes execution, the processing of the request terminates.

This is useful for use as a redirect.  Basically, you test for certain conditions in your script and transfer control to another script based on which condition is met.  So maybe you could have a login page that contains a form which posts to itself.  If the user login is authenticated, you can transfer processing to a member control panel.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
If bIsLoggedIn Then
	Server.Transfer(&quot;/account/index.asp&quot;)
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

You should note that if any HTML is output to the browser before the '''Server.Transfer''' statement is reached, the output of the new ASP file will be appended to the HTML that has already been output.  While you could do a standard redirect using the ASP built-in statement '''Response.Redirect''', that would discard any HTML that has already been output and rebuild the response from the beginning.

= Summary =

Server-side includes provide a powerful mechanism to reuse code in Active Server Pages.  You can use it to create a website template, code libraries, and HTML modules which may be reused throughout your site.

The two types of include statements are the '''virtual include''' and the '''file include'''.  Use the '''virtual include''' to include ASP or HTML files using a path specifier that begins with a slash ('''/''') denoting the document root of your website.  The '''file include''' includes the content of a file with a path specifier that is relative to the directory of the calling script.  The contents of the external file will be imported into the original document before any ASP code is processed.

Alternatives to server-side include the '''Server.Execute''' statement which executes the external file as a ''stand-alone'' script and then combines this output with the output of the calling script.  The other is the '''Server.Transfer''' statement which passes control over to the external script 
permanently (control never returns).

= Review Questions =

* What does a server-side include do?
* What are the two types of server-side includes?
* What happens if you include a file which contains server-side includes?
* What are some alternatives to the server-side include?
* Explain how these alternatives work to execute external ASP code

= Exercises =

* Create the include files (header and footer) for a real simple HTML template
* Write a virtual server-side include to import the HTML template files.
* Write some ASP code to call '''Server.Execute''' to display a weather module
* Write some ASP code to call '''Server.Transfer''' to log off a user from a member area.

ADP calls this emulation the Common Reality Architecture (CoRA, though there are references to it being RealityX when it was first ported to *nix). The relevant dealer services segment never sold anything but Reality-based products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

&lt;!-- I'm not sure if these are screens -- or if these are ADP Package (or if they are both). One of our clients didn't have TRIM or EXTERIOR COLOR CODES, adp said they were standard the issue was said client did not have VMS; ADP said very few clients don't have VMS. --&gt;

== w.e.b.Suite ==
[[Image:ADP_WEBSUITE_REFLECTION_ABOUT.png|thumb|right|Right click &amp;rarr; About of the web applet that connects to the Elite system]]
The '''w.e.b.Suite''' application is a graphical web interface (written in PHP&lt;ref&gt;Or, at least that is terminal extension of the files hosted. See [http://cake.pushtotest.com/pipermail/users/2005-May.txt an internal troubleshooting post by ADP for more info]&lt;/ref&gt;) to the traditional ''Elite'' system. The underlying ''Elite'' is freely accessible through one of the tabs. The caveat here is the WS system deprecates the older dial-in interface in favor of a tcp-connection, VPN, or remote-desktop connection. Traditionally, ADP resold PC Anywhere, presently they use a secure VPN solution, presumably based on Securelink.

Normally, you would access an Elite System through ADP's standalone Reflection application; however, ''w.e.b.Suite'' uses a frame in application that is essentially a telnet client of sort for a web browser.

I've heard the '''w.e.b.Suite''' product referred to ''w.e.b.Suite 2000'' (as compared to their totally different system ''w.e.b.Suite 1000''). It remains unclear if ADP will officially market this as the 2000 series.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook is to become an online textbook on the kinematics and dynamics of robots. One of its purposes is to provide a more theoretical and in-depth look into the field of robotics mechanics.

==Table of Contents==
# [[/Description of Position and Orientation/]]
# [[/Serial Manipulator Position Kinematics/]]
# [[/Serial Manipulator Differential Kinematics/]]

==Software==
The '''Robotics Toolbox''' is a public MATLAB library that can be downloaded for free from [http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html]. It would be nice if some example code would eventually be added to the different examples this wikibook is to contain.

Another free interesting robotics toolbox for MATLAB, released under GNU GPL license is '''DAMAROB''':
[http://www.damarob.altervista.org/index.html?referrer=wikibooks www.damarob.altervista.org]
This toolbox evaluates kinematic and dynamic model of a manipulator in ''symbolic''-math ''matrix'' form.
(that is Jacobian, Inertia, coriolis-centrifugal, gravity matrices)
It provides html documentation with examples and includes exclusive features as WRL model generation for 3D animations, closed loop inverse kinematics algorithms, robust and adaptive control algorithms.

I feel a bit pretentious telling others how to be happy when I still haven't graduated high school. Anyone with a psychology or sociology degree would be greatly appreciated. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 20:39, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

== What pronoun should be used? ==

For example, should we write, &quot;One must work hard to attain happiness,&quot; or &quot;You must work hard to attain happiness&quot;? Whichever way is decided, we should be consistent. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 01:34, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

: I must agree that u might be still be missing some experience about life and happiness to tell others how to get happy. And I presume every body would be happy if human lifetime and intelligence would not be too limited for that.

: So instead writing how to make others others happy it might be better idea to write how to make your self happy.

: Thus I propose pronoun &quot;I&quot;. Example &quot;I have no idea what pronoun is and that's make me happy.&quot;

: If might be good idea to ask happy people to help you to write how they got happy. Old people tend to have experience of different life phases and life  as whole, so they might be good source of some overall ideas of being happy trough your live. 

: My top 3 ways to get happy are
:# Just being happy, not worrying and taking life lightly.
:# Doing well in sports (etc. task) that I like. ( Risky as can failure can cause unhappiness  )
:# Knowing that I have everything I need to be happy. ( Risky as it is easy to think that I need something that others have or want to have )

:: The problem with the first person pronoun is that it referrs to the author and not the general case. As Wikibooks is a collaborative project, this would be cumbersome. Once could imagine a book on the collection of personal anecdotes, but this book has a different approach.
:: Remarkably, people don't always seem to be able to predict or explain what makes people happy. Happy people might attribute their happiness to a cause which has served others poorly so only asking those who've been served well by the method will not reveal how well it works. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:41, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== Protect happiness book ==
This book is very important. There are three bothering signs, poluting it. Could I just remove them?
The most absurd one is &quot;to merge with Guide to Success and Fulfillment&quot;.
I believe editors should avoid merging all books in one huge book, because it weakens the book personality and importance. Variety is good. Besides: Happiness and Success are two different topics. [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 12:19, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

: Calling the merger tag absurd and saying that the tags are &quot;poluting&quot; the page is rather harsh langugage. These were put up on good faith in the interest of improving both books.
: I do, however, agree that these books are valuable as they take different approaches and have somewhat different scope. I've removed the merger tag from these books and left the link as a related wikibook.
: The other tags are useful and I think they should stay. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:41, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Results and interpretations of research into the relative happiness of religious and non-religious people differ. Research in the United States has shown that religious people are generally happier, but comparative studies of different countries in North-America and Europe seem to indicate that it is more a question of belonging to a group, rather than the actual religious or spiritual practice.

It has also been shown that religious activities such as praying, trigger a unique part of the brain that is not active during any other activity.

See also what Wikipedia has to say about the [[w:Happiness#Correlation_with_religious_involvement|correlation between hapiness and religious involvement]].

&lt;br&gt;
-The Dalai Lama

Humans are social by nature. Early people lived in tribes, and our psychology reflects that. In more ways than one, the more that you give, the more you receive.
A study has shown that people who volunteer are happier and healthier, regardless of income.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politicalstudies.org/pdf/pattie.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Money can't buy happiness&quot;==
To a certain point, this phrase is false. Countries with higher GDPs per capita are generally happier, but the correlation once GDP/capita exceeds 20K/year is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa590.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Much Money do we Really Need?==
&lt;small&gt;(See also [[../Prioritizing/]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whenever you make a major purchase, you should consider how the emotional value of the purchase would compare to the monetary value. Say you've saved $20,000 over a long period of time. What will make you happier - buying a new car, or buying a used car and donating $1000 to ten different charities, and knowing you've made a positive difference in the world?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many teachers of writing from all over the world have viewed this wikitext and wondered if it would be appropriate for their classroom. There are obviously some big changes you'll have to make if you're accustomed to a traditional printed textbook. This chapter will address some of the more common questions teachers have when considering adopting this or any other wikitext into their syllabus.

==Issues of Access==
One of the biggest worries teachers have about online materials of any sort is that some of their students may lack the knowledge, equipment, or desire to access them. What good is a freely available textbook if students and teachers can't afford computers and internet connections?

The information found within the Rhetoric and Composition wikibook belongs to the public good.  As an instructor, you may copy and disseminate the information found within this book.

*If access is an issue for some, feel free to print copies of the information found within this book.
*If knowledge of use is an issue, create an online information search.  In this way, students become more familiar with the wiki design.  Also, they will learn the techniques being taught within the book.
*If desire is an issue, challenge the student to educate you, the instructor, on the information found within.  Students may not want to use an online text due to a belief that their instructor does not know how to use the online text.  By giving the student this directive, they may feel empowered by the assignment.

==Issues of Accountability==
One of the most commonly raised issues regarding wikitexts (or wikis in general) is accountability. Who, if anyone, is responsible for verifying the claims and information published on a wiki?   This discussion is also at the center of any type of online research.  Who are the major contributors and authors of this wikibook?  How often is this book reviewed by the major authors?  Do earlier versions of the wikibook still exist, in case information is changed?

The main body of this Rhetoric and Composition wikibook has been authored by University faculty and Graduate students (the majority of whom are specializing in rhetoric and composition), within the course curriculum of a Minnesota State University.  This particular wikibook is frequently reviewed for content, and the information within the Rhetoric and Composition wikibook is regularly edited and monitored for changes to content.  

These students and faculty, along with a family of online rhetoricians, work to maintain the credibility and accountability of the Rhetoric and Composition wikitext.

If you feel information has been modified or changed to state incorrect information, or you have asked students to print out pages from a wikibook and the printed version you have is different, you can view all the earlier forms of a page found within the book.  At the top of each wikipage is a tab labelled ''History.''  

If you click on this tab, you will find a listing of every earlier version of the wikibook page.  The date and author will also be listed.  You even have the ability to view two versions of the page at the same time.  In this way, you can verify the student's copy of the book.

===Wikitexts vs. Printed Texts===
Many teachers and students find reading text on a printed page easier and more comfortable than reading online.  Yet, in today's era of internet access, students may find locating information via a computer or cell phone connection more appealing.  If technology is available, students may opt for the web instead of the printed page.

You may be deciding which type of text is best suited for your classroom.  If you are, please refer to the following sections to help with that decision:

===Benefits of a Printed Text===
Computer access may not be necessary for particular classrooms. Many classrooms also do not have adequate access to computers, and printed texts can be a more practical option. Students can purchase the same textbook edition as their instructor, ensuring that everyone has access to the same knowledge in a classroom. The style and format of printed texts present much more variety than those found on wikis, and an effective text may present an aesthetically pleasing layout. 

Thousands of composition textbooks are available on the market, and a successful text will provide a sound theoretical approach to pedagogy, thorough chapters on writing topics, and tips for helpful writing strategies. Printed texts may also include excerpts from articles, novels, and other works of literature. A valuable printed textbook may also provide sample student essays. Teachers can readily select a printed text that follows a focused pattern desirable for their teaching style and goals.

===Benefits of a Wikitext===
The wikitext is an open resource and may be freely copied and distributed. As an instructor, you are allowed to disseminate the information found within the Rhetoric and Composition Wikitext. Much like any other wiki on the Internet, the wikitext is able to provide new information through an ongoing and openly edited process. Although pages are not subject to a formal peer review process, anyone and everyone with access to the wikitext may contribute and edit content. 

Unlike a printed textbook, the wikitext is not limited to a page count. The wikitext provides a highly focused and synthesized approach to information activities for any classroom with a writing component. On the wikitext, only the information needed is provided, making for an excellent reference for students and teachers. All earlier versions of the book are accessible on the web.

===Drawbacks of a Printed Text===
In printed texts, the information contained may be outdated. If a lengthy text is used in a classroom, teachers must select which topics and activities are most important their teaching goals. Printed texts may not cover rules and topics about new technologies. Printed texts are also limited to a page count, and if revised, a new edition must be reprinted and redistributed. Most printed texts must be purchased, which can be a hardship for both students and teachers.

===Drawbacks of a Wikitext===
The information contained on a wikitext can be changed by anyone, regardless of their knowledge or credentials. Access to wikitexts may also pose an issue for some classrooms. Computer access is necessary, at least once, to locate information within the book. 

Wikitexts may not provide the same thorough content and supplementary materials that quality printed textbooks offer. While the Rhetoric and Composition Wikitext provides handouts and sample lesson plans, Wikitexts usually cannot provide excerpts from other published textbook materials, such as letters, essays, poems. This wikitext provides a highly focused guide that can be referenced for essential information and activities.

==Wikitexts vs. Other Online Texts==
As you're probably well aware, the Rhetoric and Composition Wikitext is not the only solution for instructors looking for an online composition text. Several of the major commercial textbook publishers are now offering online or CD-ROM editions of their popular printed editions, as well as a plethora of companion websites and supplementary materials. 

Electronic books (also referred to as e-books, ebooks, digital books, and e-editions) are now an option for many teachers and students. While many electronic books are the digital representation of a different edition in print, some are &quot;born digital&quot; and do not have a printed counterpart. Electronic textbooks often cost slightly less than versions of the same book in print. 

As electronic textbooks are mainly accessed through the Internet, they have been resisted by some authors and composition specialists who see a threat in distributing written material that can be saved and disseminated without publisher approval. Teachers should avoid requiring electronic textbooks unless all students have access to the appropriate devices to read them (e-readers, tablets, or computers).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Teaching Writing as a Process&lt;/h2&gt;

Though some composition theorists are now challenging and complicating the idea of writing, most accept that diverse writing instruction involves going beyond simple matters of correctness. By viewing writing as a process, not just as a product, the critical thinking behind all genres of writing is validated on an equal level. The best composition instruction thereby offers students guidance and experience ain the various stages of the writing process. 

Composition instruction focused entirely on the &quot;product,&quot; that is, the final draft submitted by the student, is more and more often being seen as ineffective. Students are given a specified topic, such as abortion or capital punishment, and told to write an essay that establishes and defends their position on the issue. 


&lt;h2&gt;Teaching Revision&lt;h2&gt;
Give students examples of how many ways they can revise their papers.  The following are some examples:

&lt;h4&gt;Delete words, sentences, or even whole paragraphs&lt;h4&gt;
* Original: The man who was sitting in the seat in front of me was so tall that I couldn’t see the screen.
* Deletion: The man '''who was sitting''' in the seat in front of me was so tall that I couldn’t see the screen.
* Revised: The man in the seat in front of me was so tall that I couldn’t see the screen.

&lt;h4&gt;Add words, sentences, and paragraphs&lt;h4&gt;
* Original: I was enjoying the holiday.
* Revised: I was enjoying the holiday, lying on the grass with sun warming my back while I listened to music.

&lt;h4&gt;Rearrange words, sentences, and paragraphs&lt;h4&gt;
* Original: I enjoy watching double feature horror movies on Halloween evening.
* Revised: On Halloween evening, I enjoy watching double feature horror movies.

&lt;h4&gt;Substitute words, sentences, or paragraphs&lt;h4&gt;
* Original: Aunt Ellen is a doctor.
* Revised: Aunt Ellen is an orthopedic surgeon.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revision vs. Editing&lt;h2&gt;

Explain the difference between revising and editing to your students.  Editing refers to the mechanics of the writing, such as grammar, punctuation and spelling.  Revision involves looking at the content of the essay, including tone, audience, and evidence.


&lt;h5&gt;Checklist&lt;/h5&gt;
Give students a checklist to use when revising their papers.  It may help to...

Does my writing have a clear focus?

Do I need to add more details?

Is my writing organized in a way that makes sense?

Are there unnecessary parts I should leave out?

Is my writing style appropriate for my purpose and audience?

Have I chosen the most specific words possible?

Do my sentences vary in length and pattern?


&lt;h2&gt;Peer Review&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Remember your audience&lt;/h4&gt;

1.   How much does the audience already know about this topic?

2.   What can I tell them that they do not know?

3.   Will my topic interest some audience members more than others?

4.   How can I make my topic more interesting to all?

5.   If I take a stand on an issue, will my audience agree with me?

6.   If not, what interests or needs do they have through which I might change their minds?

7.   Do they generally agree with my main points?

8.   What are the interests and goals of most of my audience?
&lt;b&gt;Provide clear expectations&lt;b&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rubric examples&lt;h2&gt;

Once you have set clear expectations for your students, it is important to provide them with some guidance...  Here is one example of a very generic rubric.

* Thesis statement is specific and clear _____/5

* Main points in intro. are appropriate and clear _____/5

* Body further proof of thesis _____/10
 
* Sources are used to prove thesis _____/5

* Mechanics do not detract from quality of essay _____/10

* Conclusion restates thesis and reviews main points _____/5

Is that so?

What about [[wikipedia:Fast_Ethernet#100BASE-T2]] which supposedly uses PAM-5?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Is A Body System? ==

A '''''body system''''' is a groups of organs that work together to perform a main body function.

== The Nervous System ==

A '''''nervous system''''' carries messages to and from the brain and spinal cord and all other 
parts of the body. It is composed of two divisions: central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of the nerves that branch out from the central nervous system to the muscles, skin, internal organs, and glands. 

The '''''brain''''' is a mass of nerve tissue that acts as the control center of the body. It has three major parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. 

The '''''spinal cord''''' is a thick column of nerve cells that extends from the brain down through the spinal column. It carries messages between the brain and body.

The nervous system is composed of cells called neurons. A '''''neuron''''' is a nerve cell that is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. It consists of a cell body, an axon, and dendrites. An axon is an elongated fiber that carries impulses away from the cell body to the dendrites of another neuron. Dendrites are branching fibers that receive impulses and carry them to the cell body.

A '''''reflex action''''' is an involuntary action in which a message is sent to the brain via the spinal cord, is interpreted, and is responded to immediately.

== The Cardiovascular System ==

The '''''cardiovascular system''''' transports nutrients, gases, hormones, and cellular waste products throughout the body. The cardiovascular systems consists of blood, blood vessels, and heart. 

The '''''blood''''' carries nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and cellular waste products to and from cells. The average adult has about ten pints of blood. Blood is composed of plasma and blood cells: red and white blood cells. '''''Plasma''''' is the liquid component of blood that carries blood cells and dissolved materials. '''''Red blood cells''''' transport oxygen to body cells and remove carbon dioxide from body cells. Red blood cells contain large quantities of hemoglobin (iron-rich protein). '''''White blood cells''''' attack, surround, and destroy pathogens that enter the body and prevent them from causing infection. 

There are three major parts of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. The '''''arteries''''' carry the blood away from the heart. A '''''vein''''' is a blood vessel that returns blood to the heart. A '''''capillary''''' is a tiny blood vessel that connects arteries and veins. 

The '''''heart''''' is a four-chambered muscle that pumps blood throughout the body. The chambers are called the atria and ventricles. An '''''atrium''''' is one of the upper two chambers of the heart. A '''''ventricle''''' is one of the lower two chambers of the heart.
A '''''vena cava''''' is one of two large veins that returns blood rich in carbon dioxide to the right atrium. The '''''aorta''''' is the main artery in the body. It branches into smaller arteries through which blood flows to all parts of the body.

'''''Heart Rate''''' is the number of times the heart contracts each minute. '''Pulse'''is the surge of blood that results from contractions of the heart. '''''Blood pressure''''' is the force of blood against the artery walls.

== Immune System ==

The '''''immune system''''' removes harmful organisms from the blood and combats pathogens. It is composed of lymph, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, thymus, and spleen. 

'''''Lymph''''' is a clear liquid that surrounds body cells and circulates in lymph vessels. 
A '''''lymph node''''' is a structure that filters and destroys pathogens. 
The '''''spleen''''' is an organ on the left side of the abdomen that filters foreign matter from the blood and lymph. 

''''''Immunity'''''' is the body's resistance to disease-causing agents. An '''''antibody''''' is a special protein that helps fight infection. 

The '''''thymus gland''''' is a gland that causes white blood cells to become T cells. A '''''t-cell''''' is a white blood cell that destroys pathogens. A '''''B Cell''''' is a white blood cell that produces antibodies.

== Respiratory System ==

The '''''respiratory system''''' provides body cells with oxygen and removes carbon dioxide that cells produces as waste. Air enters the respiratory system through the nose or mouth during inhalation. Mucus in the nasal passages and sinuses warms and moistens the air and traps dust particles and pathogens. 

Air moves from the nose or mouth through the pharynx to the trachea. The '''''pharynx''''' is the throat. the '''''epiglottis''''' is a flap that covers the entrance to the trachea when a person swallows foods or beverages. The '''''trachea''''' is a tube through which air moves to the lungs. 

The air then enters the '''''bronchi''''' which are two tubes through which air moves to the lungs. The '''''lungs''''' are the main organs of the respiratory system. The '''''bronchioles''''' are small tubes divided into alveoli. The '''''alveoli''''' are microscopic air sacs.

== Skeletal System ==

The '''''skeletal system''''' serves as a support framework, protects vital organs, works with muscles to produce movement, and produces blood cells. There are 206 bones in the skeletal system of an adult.

A '''''bone''''' is the structural material of the skeletal system. '''''Periosteum''''' is a thin sheet of outer tissue that covers bone. It contains nerves and blood vessels. '''''Bone marrow''''' is the soft tissue in the hollow center area of most bones where red blood cells are produced.

'''''Cartilage''''' is a soft, connective tissue on the ends of some bones. It acts as a cushion where bones meet. 
A '''''ligament''''' is a tough fiber that connects bones together. 
A '''''joint''''' is the point where two bones meet.

== Muscular System ==

The '''''muscular system''''' consists of muscles that provide motion and maintain posture. There are more than 600 muscles in the body. Muscles are divided into two major groups. A '''''voluntary muscle''''' is a muscle a person can control. An '''''involuntary muscle''''' is a muscle that functions without the person's control. 

There are three types of muscles tissues in the body: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac. '''''Smooth muscle''''' is involuntary muscle tissue found in many internal organs. '''''Skeletal muscle''''' is muscle tissue that is attached to the bone. It helps your body move. '''''Cardiac muscle''''' is a unique kind of muscle tissue found only in the heart. It differs from other tissues in its structure. Its contractions are generated by nerve stimulation. 

A '''''tendon''''' is tough tissue fiber that attaches muscle to bones.

== Endocrine System ==

The '''''endocrine system''''' consists of glands that control many of the body's activities by producing hormones. A '''''gland''''' is a group of cells, or an organ, that secretes hormones. A '''''hormone''''' is a chemical messenger that is released directly into the bloodstream.

The '''''pituitary gland''''' is an endocrine gland that produces hormones that control growth and other glands. It is located below the hypothalamus in the brain and is about the size of a pea. The pituitary hormones do the following: 
*regulate the development of bones and muscles
*affect the reproductive organs 
*affect the functioning of the kidney, the adrenal gland, and the thyroid glands
*stimulate the uterus to contract during childbirth

The '''''thyroid gland''''' is an endocrine gland that produces thyroxine. '''''Thyroxine''''' is a hormone that controls metabolism and calcium balance in the body. '''''Metabolism''''' is the rate at which food is converted into energy in body cells. 

The '''''parathyroid glands''''' are endocrine glands that secrete hormones that control the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the body. 

The '''''pancreas''''' is a gland that produces digestive enzymes and insulin. '''''Insulin''''' is a hormone that regulates the blood sugar level. If the person fails to produce enough insulin, a person develops diabetes mellitus. '''''Diabetes , or diabetes millitus,''''' is a disease in which the body produces little or no insulin. 

The '''''adrenal glands''''' are endocrine glands that secrete several hormones, including adrenaline. '''''Adrenaline''''' is a hormone that prepares the body to react during times of stress or i an emergency. The two adrenal glands are located on the kidneys. 

The '''''ovaries''''' are female reproductive glands that produce ova and estrogen. '''''Ova''''' are egg cells, or female reproductive cells.'''''Estrogen''''' is a hormone produced by the ovaries that stimulates the development of female secondary sex characteristics and affects the menstrual cycle. 

The '''''testes''''' are male reproductive glands that produce sperm cells and testosterone. '''''Testosterone''''' is a hormone that produces the male secondary sex characteristics.

== Digestive System ==

The '''''digestive system''''' breaks down food into nutrients that can be used by the body. It allows nutrients to be absorbed by body cells and eliminates waste from the body.  '''''Digestion''''' is the process by which food is changed so that it can be absorbed by the body's cells. 

The mouth contains '''''salivary glands''''' that release saliva, which contains a chemical that begins the digestion of carbohydrates. '''''Saliva''''' is a fluid that helps soften food so that it can be swallowed more easily. 

When food is swallows, it moves into the '''''esophagus,''''' a tube connecting the mouth to the stomach. Food passes to the stomach by the process of '''''peristalsis,''''' a series of involuntary muscle contractions. 

The '''''stomach''''' is an organ that releases acids and juices that mix with the food and produces a thick paste called chyme. 

The '''''small intestine''''' a coiled tube in which the greatest amount of digestion and absorption takes place.  

The '''''liver''''' is a gland that releases bile to help break down fats, maintain blood sugar level, and filter poisonous wastes. 

The '''''gall bladder''''' is an organ that stores bile. 

The '''''pancreas''''' is a gland that produces digestive enzymes and insulin.

The '''''large intestine''''' is a tube extending from the small intestine in which undigested food is prepared for elimination from the body.

The '''''rectum''''' is a short tube at the end of the large intestine that stores wastes temporarily. 

The '''''anus''''' is the opening to the outside of the body at the end of the rectum.

== Urinary System ==

The '''''urinary system''''' removes liquid wastes from the body and maintains the body's water balance. The organs of the urinary system are the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. 

A '''''kidney''''' is an organ that filters the blood and excretes waste products and excess water in the form of urine. 

A '''''ureter''''' is a narrow tube that connects the kidneys to the urinary bladder. The '''''urinary bladder''''' is a muscular sac that stores urine. 

The '''''urethra''''' is a narrow tube extending from the urinary bladder to the outside of the body through which urine passes out of the body.

== Integumentary System ==

The '''''integumentary system''''' covers and protects the body and consists of skin, glands associated with the skin, hair, and nails. The skin is the largest organ in the body. 

'''''Melanin''''' is a pigment that gives the skin its color and protects the body from ultraviolet rays of the sun.

The '''''epidermis''''' is the outer layer of skin cells. These cells are constantly shed and replaced.  The '''''dermis''''' is a thick layer of cells below the epidermis that contains sweat glands, hair follicles, sebaceous (oil) glands, blood vessels, and nerves. 

A '''''sweat gland''''' is a gland that helps the body get rid of wastes, such as salt. A '''''sebaceous gland''''' is a small oil-producing gland that helps protect the skin. '''''Sebum''''' is the oil produced by sebaceous glands. 

A '''''wart''''' is a contagious growth that forms on the top layer of skin. 

'''''Ringworm''''' is a skin condition that causes small, red, ring-shaped marks on the skin.

'''''Keratin''''' is a tough protein that makes up nails and hair. '''''Hair''''' is a threadlike structure consisting of dead cells filled with keratin.

==1. Name the various metals that can be used in metal craft. ==
Metals suitable for use in metal craft include:
* Tin
* Aluminum
* Copper
* Galvanized steel (duct work)
* Brass (an alloy of copper and zinc)
* Bronze (an alloy of copper and tin)
* Silver and gold (especially in foil form)

==2. Complete one project using metal foil tooling. Complete the project by antiquing and framing. ==
Metal foil tooling is done by placing a piece of foil on top of a soft but firm surface and then making impressions with a stylus.  The work surface can be a piece of scrap linoleum, leather, or crafting foam.  The stylus is often a small wooden stick with a point on it, but you can also use a ballpoint pen or a pencil.  A dowel about the same diameter as a pencil can be sharpened with a pencil sharpener to make an effective stylus.

The metal crafter can place a drawing on top of the foil and trace it with the stylus, or draw the design free hand.  Once the image has been impressed in the foil, it can be placed in a frame.  You can use something as elaborate as a picture frame, or as simple as craft sticks glued together.  

Low cost kits are available with all the necessary materials at craft stores, hobby shops, and online retailers.

==3. Complete one project using metal punch. ==
A punch is a hard metal rod with a shaped tip at one end and a blunt butt end at the other that is usually struck by a hammer. A variety of punches are used in engineering, but often the purpose is to form an impression of the tip on a workpiece.  You can also use a nail set, a pick, or even a nail (though a nail will make squarish holes) instead of a punch.

Draw out your design on a piece of paper.  It should be a simple line drawing with no shading.  Then draw dots on the lines indicating where you will punch a hole.  Fasten the drawing to a piece of sheet metal with tape.  The sheet metal can be copper, tin, or aluminum (such as flashing), all of which are generally available at home improvement centers and hardware stores.

Place a piece of scrap plywood on your work surface to protect it, and then place a piece of scrap linoleum on top of that.  Your piece of sheet metal goes on top of the linoleum.

Carefully place the tip of the punch on one of the dots in your drawing and strike the butt end of the punch sharply with a hammer.  It should take only one blow.  Then move the punch to the next dot and repeat until you have punch a hole (or merely made an indention) on every dot in your drawing.  Remove the paper and admire your work.

Punched panels are often used to decorate the doors of a pie safe.

==4. Complete one project using drilling, riveting, and bending of metal such as a simple candle holder. ==
An easy project to make that might be of special interest to a Pathfinder is a reflector oven.  Baking with a reflector oven is a requirement of the [[../../Recreation/Fire Building &amp; Camp Cookery|Fire Building &amp; Camp Cookery]] and [[../../Recreation/Camping Skills IV|Camping Skills IV]] honors.  This particular design folds flat for easy stowing in a backpack.  It can be made from aluminum flashing, eight hinges, a pre-made grill, a drawer handle, some rivets, and a couple of nails.  
[[Image:Reflector oven.jpg|thumb|400px|Reflector oven]]
The first step is to find a grill or a grate that you can use in the oven.  The grate can be easily removed and is not modified in any way, so if necessary, it can be &quot;borrowed&quot; from a toaster oven, hibachi, etc.  The only requirement is that it be rectangular.

[[Image:Reflector oven.png|thumb|300px|Dimensions of the triangular side panels]]
Once you have a grill, you can begin laying out the other pieces which are all sized according to the dimensions of the grill.  Cut out the triangles that will form the side panels.  These triangles should be the same width as the shortest dimension of the rectangular grill.  The triangle's height should equal half this same dimension.  Make four of these and punch a hole on the corner where the right angle is formed.  You should also trim the sharp corners so that they are rounded (and thus present a smaller hazard to the end-user).

Once the side panels are cut out, use the long dimension of the triangle (the hypotenuse) to set the width of the top and bottom panels.  The length of these pieces should be equal to the longest dimension of the grill.  Once these pieces are cut out, you need to put a small ''X'' crease in them to stiffen them.  This can be done by either laying them over a length of upturned angle iron and tapping the crease in with a rubber mallet, or by laying it flat on a floor, and then laying a stiff straight-edge (such as a yardstick) wherever you want the crease.  Then work your way under the free end as you hold the straight-edge firmly in place.

Next it is time to drill some holes in the flashing.  Clamp all four triangles together and lay a hinge along the bottom edge (the one which is as long as the grill is wide).  Mark where the holes should go, and drill through all four pieces at once.  This will ensure that the holes are all located identically.  Next, clamp the top and bottom panels together and lay one of the triangles on top of them, lining up the matched dimensions.  Mark the holes and drill them out.  Do this to both sides.  Finally, decide where you would like two more hinges along the back of the oven, mark the hinge holes, and drill them out.

The hinges should be secured to the panels with rivits rather than with screws.  You can use pop rivets, but you will need to &quot;peen&quot; them over so that the hinges can fold flat.  This can be done once the rivets have been attached by the pop-riveter by placing them on the face of an anvil (or on the face of a sledge hammer), and then hammering the unfinished end of the rivet until it is completely flattened.

Pay special attention when attaching the hinges that the hinges will fold in the right direction.  It is very easy to put a hinge on backwards.  If you do this, simply drill through the rivet to remove it, and try again.

Once all the hinges are in place, you may slip the grill in place.  Secure it by running a nail through the holes punched in the right corner of the triangular panels.  Pass the nail through the first hole starting on the inside of the oven.  Flex the edge the panel inwards so that the nail can pass through the grill (see photo).  The nail should next pass through the hole in the lower triangle, back to the inside of the oven.  Insert the second nail on the other side.

Once it is assembled, find the balance point for mounting the drawer handle in the top panel.  Ideally, the grill should remain level when it is lifted by this handle (you might even want it to tip backwards slightly).  Drill holes for the screws.  If the screws are too long (after all, they are designed to go through a wooden drawer face, not a thing sheet of aluminum flashing), you will need to cut them shorter with a hacksaw.  Then attach them firmly.

To use the oven, load the items you wish to bake onto the grill and place it within the fire ring of a nice bed of hot coals.  Prop the back up with a rock (perhaps a rock fro mthe fire ring).  Keep an eye on your baked goods and turn them over if necessary.

==5. Demonstrate properly the use of the following:== 
===a. Tin Snips ===
[[Image:Left-right-snips.jpg|thumb|200px|Left-cutting (red) and right-cutting (green) tin snips.]]
Tin snips are tools used to cut thin sheet metal. They use the same principles as common scissors, but are able to handle thicker and harder material. There are three different types of tin snips; straight cutting, left cutting, and right cutting. Straight cutting in a straight line, left cutting snips (usually red) will cut in a curve to the left, and right cutting snips (usually green) will cut in a curve to the right.

In practical use the red snips pictured will be used in the right hand, for straight or curving cuts, with the base material to the right being cut neatly and the left hand will be pulling away a spiraling offcut. The green snips work in the opposite fashion in the left hand, with the waste being on the right.

Lastly, The compound snip will allow you to cut thicker gages or harder metals more easily.  They are normally a last resort.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===b. Pop rivet ===
[[Image:Blindrivettool.jpg|thumb|right|Pop rivet tool]]
[[Image:Blindnieten.JPG|thumb|left|Three pop rivets]]
Pop rivets are made from flared aluminum tubes and a stem (or mandrel) through the center. The stem has a small ball at the end which has a diameter great than that of tube.  The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially pop riveting tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. The ball at the end of the mandrel expands the end of the rivet and the mandrel snaps. 

The rivet is placed in a pre-drilled hole and is set by pulling the mandrel head into the rivet body, expanding the rivet body and causing it to flare against the reverse side. As the head of the mandrel reaches the face of the blind side material, the pulling force is resisted, and at a predetermined force, the mandrel will snap at the break point of the mandrel.

To set a pop rivet, insert the stem into the nozzle of the riveting tool, then place the rivet's tube into a pre-drilled hole.  Position the river such that the flared portion is held firmly against the surface of piece to be riveted, and squeeze the handles together.  You should be able to squeeze them until the rivet &quot;pops&quot;, or the handles have traveled their full distance.  If that happens, release the handle and squeeze again.  The tool will grip the stem in a different place.  You may need to repeat this a few times until the rivet pops.  After it pops, release the handle, and let the stem slide out of the tool's nozzle.  A successful rivet joint depends on maintaining contact between the rivet's flared face and the material being riveted.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===c. Electric drill===
[[Image:Battdrill.jpg|thumb|Electric drill]]
[[Image:Titanium nitride coating.jpg|thumb|left|Twist bit]]
An electric drill is used for boring holes in materials - in the case of metal crafting, that material would be the metal being worked.  Typically, one would use a twist bit made of high carbon steel, high speed steel, or cobalt steel for drilling holes in metal.  Low carbon steel bits are not suited to drilling holes in metal, as they quickly lose their cutting edges.  Drills and bits are typically only used for boring small-diameter holes in metal.  

To drill a hole in metal, first use a centering punch to make a small indentation in the metal so the bit does not ''wander''.  Then clamp the piece of metal securely to a piece of scrap wood.  When the bit penetrates to the other side, it will have a tendency to grab the piece and spin it around at high speed.  This can be dangerous, especially if it catches a finger, and thus, it is very wise to clamp it securely so that the piece stays put.  Once it is clamped, put on a pair of safety goggles and then place the tip of the bit in the indentation made with the centering punch and hold it perpendicular to the piece (that is, if the piece is perfectly horizontal, the bit will be perfectly vertical).  If the bit is not perpendicular (straight in), it will have a greater tendency to wander.

Gently squeeze the trigger on the drill - as more pressure is applied to the trigger, the drill will turn the bit faster and faster.  If the bit wanders off the mark, stop and recenter it.  If it does it again, get out the center punch and knock a deeper indentation in the piece.  

As you squeeze the trigger, gently press downward on the drill, but don't overdo it.  If you press too hard, you risk breaking the bit (yes, it happens, and that's why safety goggles are important).  Continue to hold the bit perpendicular to the piece.  When the bit breaks through the other side of the piece, you need to have the bit rotating at a high speed, and you should not let up for a few seconds.  If you stop too soon, the hole will not be circular.  It is best to drill part way into the scrap wood supporting the piece, as the side flutes on the bit will cut the sides of the hole, and this will help you make a ''round'' hole.  With the bit still turning, pull the bit out of the hole (it's easier to do when the bit is rotating).

===d. Metal file ===
[[Image:FilesFlat-Smooth-2ndCut-Bastard.jpg|thumb|Files with progressively coarser teeth (left toright)]]
[[Image:NeedleFiles.jpg|thumb|left|Needle files]]
Files have forward-facing cutting teeth, and cuts most effectively when pushed over the workpiece. Drawfiling involves laying the file sideways on the work, and carefully pushing or pulling it across the work. This catches the teeth of the file sideways instead of head on, and a very fine shaving action is produced. There are also varying strokes that produce a combination of the straight ahead stroke and the drawfiling stroke, and very fine work can be attained in this fashion. Using a combination of strokes, and progressively finer files, a skilled operator can attain a surface that is perfectly flat and near mirror finish. The grooves in a file may became clogged during use, causing the file to lose its cutting ability and trapped shavings can scratch the work surface. A file card can be used to clean the file.

Files should always be used with a handle, otherwise the naked tang can injure the operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page gives the solutions to all the problems in the optional homework.  Please try to solve the problems yourself before you look here.  The solutions are given in [[w:algebraic chess notation|algebraic chess notation]].

== Optional homework 1 ==

=== Problem 1 ===

This is a standard endgame position.  White sacrifices his h-pawn in order to queen his g-pawn.

:1. Kf4 Kg7
:2. Kf5 Kh8

Any other move allows the h-pawn to queen.

:3. Kg5

Or Ke5 or Ke6, but not Kf6?? stalemate.

:3... Kg7
:4. h8=Q+ Kxh8
:5. Kf6! Kg8
:6. g7 Kh7
:7. Kf7 Kh6
:8. g8=Q Kh5
:9. Qg3 Kh6
:10. Qh4 mate.

=== Problem 2 ===

:1. Kb7!

White must not allow Black's king to reach c7 or c8 because White will not be able to queen the pawn.  This is a special rule that applies only for a pawn on the edge of the board.  Black's king will either stalemate White's king in the h8-corner, or it will block the pawn and be stalemated itself.

After the text move, White advances the pawn directly to h8 in 5 moves.  There is nothing Black can do to stop this.

== Optional homework 2 ==

=== Problem 1 ===
The Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez is defined by the following moves to open the game:

:1. e4 e5
:2. Nf3 Nc6
:3. Bb5 a6
:4. Bxc6 dxc6

Now if White plays

:5. Nxe5?!

Black responds

:5... Qd4!

Black's queen forks the e5-knight and the e4-pawn.  White must defend or withdraw the knight and give up the pawn.  Thus, Black achieves material equality with a slightly better position.

White's usual moves in the Exchange Variation are 5. O-O and 5. d4.

=== Problem 2 ===

This position can arise in the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined.  The first moves are 

:1. d4 d5
:2. c4 e6
:3. Nc3 Nf6
:4. Bg5 Nbd7
:5. cxd5 exd5

Now if White plays

:6. Nxd5??

Black responds

:6... Nxd5!
:7. Bxd8 Bb4+
:8. Qd2 Bxd2+
:9. Kxd2 Kxd8

Black exchanges queens and winds up a knight ahead.  Even though Black's knight on f6 was pinned to the queen, it can still move, so in this particular variation, it protects the pawn on d5.  This is a well-known trap, played by Daniel Harrwitz in the 1850s.

White usually plays 6. e3 or 6. Nf3 instead.  These moves provide an escape from the bishop check on b4, so Black must protect the d5-pawn with 6...c6 or 6...Be7.

== Optional homework 3 ==

=== Problem 1 ===

The game Z. Djordjevic vs. M. Kovacevic, 1984, began with the following moves:

:1. d4 Nf6
:2. Bg5

This is the Trompowski-Torre attack.

:2... c6
:3. e3??

This move cuts off the bishop from returning to d2.  3. Nf3 or 3. Bxf6 were called for, but almost any move (such as 3. c4) would have allowed White to save his bishop by withdrawing it to d2.

:3... Qa5+

White resigned, as he loses his bishop to a queen fork while his king gets out of check.  

This is the shortest serious tournament game in history, according to Tim Krabbé's chess records website.

=== Problem 2 ===

The game K. Shirazi vs. J. Peters, 1986 began with the following moves:

:1. e4 c5
:2. b4!? 

This is the Sicilian Wing Gambit.

:2... cxb4
:3. a3 d5!
:4. exd5 Qxd5
:5. axb4??

White must play 5. Nf3 (or 5. Bb2) to prevent what happens next.

:5... Qe5+

Black's queen forks the White king and rook.  White must get his king out of check, then Black captures the rook on a1.

Overwhelming response to this is to keep the page, although there have been some suggestions that it could stand to be cleaned up and expanded. Besides the original nomination, there have been no votes to delete the material, and no outstanding justifications to delete it. 2 days is more then enough time to demonstrate that there is no significant reason to delete the page, and no community support for such an action anyway.

I belive that this is not what should be included in a how things work book for children. Who would want their children (within this book's target audience) learning about nukes? [[User:Palmtree3000|Palmtree3000]] 04:32, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

:{{Neutral}} I'm not pro-censorship (some people would probably say that I am), and I do think that there is plenty of room around here to have a book about this topic. However, you are right that maybe the target audience of this is maybe not appropriate. I would perhaps advocate that we rewrite this page into &quot;How Things Work/Nuclear Power&quot; or something like that (which could still cover the same fundamentals of nuclear mechanics, which is really the important point here), and possibly start a book that would cover both nuclear power, nuclear weapons, etc. I.e. we could have a book about &quot;Applications of Nuclear Power&quot; that would cover both civilian and military facets of this same issue. In other words, we keep this material, produce a new book, and give a much more comprehensive coverage of the material to multiple audiences. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:38, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

:'''Very Strong Keep''' - I have absolutely no idea what part of [[WB:DP]] this page would possibly violate, and no real reason to delete this page other than somebody with a strong bias against weapons of warfare of any kind.  Who would want their children learning about nukes?  I would.  I have children between the ages of 5 and 13, and I have taught them some of the simple basics of nuclear bombs and how they work.  My father (who studied nuclear engineering in college) taught me about the topic when I was a kid.  This particular Wikijunior module is very poorly written...just a stub really.  But that isn't justification for deletion.  I see no reason why this topic can't be covered with a genuine NPOV module and simplified to be explained for children.  In addition, there is absolutely no information that could be presented here that would allow a child to take a Wikijunior module like this and make their own nuke in their basement...presuming they had access to materials such as concentrated uranium ore or a supply of Plutonium.  BTW, I think that a module about nuclear reactors would also make a very useful topic, but ought to be something in addition to learning about nukes.  These devices exist, and if you live in a democracy this is something that IMHO ought to be a part of your educational experience, so you can make informed decisions when you exercise your voting franchise.  It is a subject that most adults could use at least a Wikijunior level of education before they made decisions about the topic...and unfortunately many don't have when they cast their ballots.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:02, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

:{{keep}}, I agree with Rob here, though the module can use some cleanup, it is a topic which parents can decide whether they want their kids to know about it or not (its kind of like, do you want kids to know about the different drugs that are out there before they are exposed to them? I'd say yes since it helps them to know what their effects are before people try to convince them to use them, but I'm sure there are a lot of people who would disagree).

'''Object to Speedy Close''' - Wikibooks is not censored for the protection of minors, but Wikijunior definitely '''is'''. {{keep}} I believe the article should be kept. However I would object to anything that was an instruction manual for making a weapon.

:I can't find any policy, Wikijunior or otherwise, which states that Wikijunior is censored for the protection of minors.

::[[WB:WIWJ]] &quot;Wikijunior is: '''kid friendly'''. Our books are written with children in mind.&quot; Call it censorship, call it whatever you like. Material which is not kid friendly should not be included in Wikijunior, period. End of conversation. It's '''asinine''' to suggest that the Wikibooks community should not be able to discuss the suitability of a particular article within Wikijunior for children. If that's the case, then Wikijunior needs to find a new home, or close up shop. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:59, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

:::Wikibooks overall is not censored for minors, but it has become the standing tradition to allow the primary contributors to a book (or namespace) to determin what's appropriate for a book (or namespace). 

::::Wikibooks is censored by consensus. The point of the &quot;Wikibooks is not censored&quot; statement is not to show that all content is permissible, but instead to reduce our liability for cases where readers are witness to vandalism. What it means is that things may appear on our website which have not been explicitly censored, although the fact is that things become censored over time as readers find nonsense and remove it. VfD is an example of that process, where we censor material. Wikijunior is censored, by consensus, to be suitable for children. However, wikijunior still may be a temporary home to things that children should not see (vandalism). That this effect, the statement &quot;Wikbooks is not censored for the protection of minors&quot; is not applicable (and in a literal sense, it is blatantly untrue). 
::::Like anywhere else on Wikibooks, we can evaluate whether a particular book suits the needs of it's target audience. If it does not, we can change the target audience (ie, move the book out of wikijunior) or change the subject matter to suit the audience. These can both be considered forms of censorship. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:10, 20 November 2007 (UTC)

*{{keep}} WikiJunior is aimed at young people up to the pre-teen, and I can say from experience that I wanted to know about them when I was a preteen (in the Reagan vs. Andropov era). I'm sure there are Indian and Pakistani kids that are as worried about nukes now as we were then, and at having some understanding about what nukes are and how they work can help demystify them a bit (it can't make them less scary, unfortunately). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:06, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Keep}}}''' - The module clearly needs work, but there's nothing wrong with having it. The module does need to be kid-friendly, which can certainly include the history, and how it works (which is the point of this book). As long as the content is age-appropriate (ie not an instruction manual because it wouldn't be appropriate to the audience, but ''not'' because it might be dangerous or whatever that argument was supposed to be) it can stay. [As an aside, this ''was'' closed a tad soon] '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:19, 20 November 2007 (UTC)

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:08, 7 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;''The worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself.''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-Mark Twain

Although placing sentimental value on something or someone can be emotionally useful, attachment can become risky. If the object of interest changes, the result can be devastating in many ways. In other words, one should have good self-esteem to be happy. Without a definite &quot;you&quot;, actions feel meaningless.

This is not the same as complete detachment from the world around you. Not defining yourself in terms of other things is not the same as ignoring the outside world.

==Defining Success==
Some people judge themselves on how much money they make, or how many home runs they hit. If you're a human of superhuman ability, this is usually not a problem. But the fact is, most of us are not superhuman. It is impossible for everyone to be above average.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article mainly seems to focus on revision and not on generating texts. As there don't seem to be any topics in the Teacher's Handbook about teaching pre-writing techniques, I wonder if this would be the place to put the teaching of the other stages of the writing process. 

Maybe this section could explain presenting the traditional &quot;Prewriting, Writing, Proofreading&quot; steps in a more nuanced and advanced way, and how to give the three steps a more dynamic relationship to one another. 

NCTE's beliefs about writing (http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/writingbeliefs) go into detail about using writing as a tool for thinking. As this article seems to be about moving away from teaching writing as a product-centered process, there might be room for a discussion about writing as a process of exploration and discovery. In the words of NCTE's website, &quot;The writing process is not one of simply fixing up the mistakes in an early draft, but of finding more and more wrinkles and implications in what one is talking about.&quot;

I added some possible categories under &quot;Revision&quot; in the &quot;Writing as a Process&quot; category.  I thought maybe we could put some sample lessons plans here, etc.  Please delete any categories you think may not work.  I took notes as we discussed revision tonight in class and used those as headings.  --[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] ([[User talk:Kyoung|talk]]) 03:48, 7 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Greetings, and welcome!  This is hopefully the start of a project to fill the shelves of the Wikibooks library with textbooks of all the basic sciences (pre-clinical) at a medical school level.  This project was inspired by the very well done [[Human Physiology]] Wikibook.  For current medical students, this is a great way to reinforce the material you are learning and another incentive to know the information well.  For professionals in the field, this is an opportunity to stay up to date with the most current research and data.  &lt;i&gt;Medical Physiology&lt;/i&gt; hopes to accomplish the first in what are many other books in the basic sciences to allow greater access to those in the field of medicine and those who wish to understand these topics at a greater level.  Please contribute and help Wikibooks become a learning tool for us in the act of creating the texts, and to future generations in being able to truly be an active learner in the field of medicine!

      <comment>/* Renal Blood Supply */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Medical Physiology|Respiratory Physiology|Acid-Base Physiology}}

==The Basics==
The functioning of kidneys can be divided into three major categories: 
# '''Excretory''', in that the kidneys ensure excess substances are excreted in urine appropriately
# '''Regulatory''', in that the kidneys regulate a constant volume and composition of body fluids.  This is accomplished by altering the excretion of solutes and through water balance (osmoregulation)
# '''Endocrine''', in that the kidneys are where three hormones are synthesized and secreted: renin, erythropoietin, and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.

==Renal Anatomy==
Located in the retroperitoneal cavity of the body, the kidneys are bean-shaped organs that have three main regions.  In the outer region is the '''cortex''', which is just deep to the kidney capsule.  In the central region is the '''medulla''', which is itself divided into two parts, the ''outer medulla'' and the ''inner medulla''.  Within the outer medulla, there are two &quot;stripes&quot;: an outer stripe and an inner stripe.  At the deepest tip of the inner medulla is the '''papilla''', which empties into the major and minor calyces, pouch-like extensions of the ureter.  From here, the ureter extends into the bladder, where urine is stored until elimination.

===The Nephron===
'''Nephrons''' are the functional units of the kidney.  There are about 1 million nephrons in each kidney.  The nephron is composed of two smaller entities: a glomerulus and a renal tubule.  The '''glomerulus''' is a capillary network that emerges from an afferent arteriole.  It is surrounded by the '''Bowman's capsule''' or '''Bowman's space''', which is continuous with the first part of the nephron.

The first step in urine formation is the ultrafiltration of blood across the '''glomerular capillaries''' into the Bowman's space.  From here, the nephron is a tubular structure that carries out reabsorptive and secretory functions via epithelial cells.

Beginning with the Bowman's space, nephron structure is composed of:
# Proximal convoluted tubule
# Proximal straight tubule
# Loop of Henle (which consists of a thin descending limb, a thin ascending limb, and a thick ascending limb)
# Distal convoluted tubule
# Collecting ducts

Each section has its own unique function, which will be explored in detail later in this chapter.

====Types of Nephrons====
There are two types of nephrons:
# '''Superficial cortical nephrons''', which have their glomeruli in the outer cortex.  They have shorter loops of Henle, which dip only into the ''outer'' medulla.
# '''Juxtamedullary nephrons''', which have their glomeruli near the corticomedullary border.  They have larger glomeruli, and thus have higher glomerular filtration rates (GFR).  Juextamedullary nephrons' loops of Henle dip deeper into the ''inner'' medulla and papilla, and are vital in the concentration of urine.

==Renal Blood Supply==
Blood arrives at the kidney through the '''renal artery'''.  The renal artery branches into the interlobar arteries, arcuate arteries, and the cortical radial arteries.  

The smallest of the arteries divide even further into sets of ''arterioles''
* '''Afferent arterioles''' supply blood to the ''first'' capillary network, the '''glomerular capillaries'''.  This is where ''ultrafiltration'' occurs.
* From the glomerular capillaries, blood flows to the '''efferent arterioles''', which supply blood to the ''second'' capillary network, the '''peritubular capillaries'''.  From the peritubular capillaries, blood exits through the small veins and finally, the renal vein.
 
'''In Summary:''' Renal a. &amp;rarr; Segmental a. &amp;rarr; Interlobar a. &amp;rarr; Arcuate a. &amp;rarr; Interlobular a &amp;rarr; Afferent arterioles &amp;rarr; Glomerular capillaries &amp;rarr; Efferent arterioles &amp;rarr; Vasa recta &amp;rarr; Peritubular capillaries &amp;rarr; Small vv. &amp;rarr; Renal v.

However, there is a difference between the vasculature of the superficial cortical nephrons and the juxtamedullary nephrons.
* The '''superficial cortical nephrons''' have peritubular capillaries which branch off the efferent arterioles, and provide nutrients to the epithelial cells which are present there.  In addition to serving the epithelial cells, these capillaries supply the blood for ''reabsorption'' and ''secretion''.
* The '''juxtamedullary nephrons''' have a special structure within the peritubular capillaries, called the '''vasa recta'''.  The vasa recta is a long, hairpin-shaped set of blood vessels that run next to the loops of Henle.  It also functions as ''osmotic exchangers'' for the concentration of urine.

==Body Fluids==
Water is the main constituent of the internal body environment, comprising an average of '''60%''' of body weight.    
===Water Distribution===
====Total Body Water (TBW)====
About '''60% of body weight''' is comprised of water.  There is a slight variation depending on gender and the amount of fat in the body.  (Water content is inversely proportional to fat content)  ''Women'' have ''lower percentages'' of water compared to ''men''.  This is because women have a higher percentage of adipose tissue.

Thus,
* ''Thin men'' have the higher percentage of weight as water at ''~70%''
* ''Obese women'' have the lowest percentage of weight as water at ''~50%''

How is this clinically relevant?  This is because changes in body weight can be used to estimate any changes in the body water content.

Total body water (TBW) is distributed between two major compartments: the '''intracellular fluid (ICF)'''  and '''extracellular fluid (ECF)'''.  

Of TBW,
* '''~2/3''' is in ICF
* '''~1/3''' is in ECF

When expressed as ''body weight'',
* '''40%''' of body weight is in ICF (2/3 of 60%)
* '''20%''' of body weight is in ECF (1/2 of 60%)
** ECF is further divided into two compartments
*** Interstitial Fluid (ISF) (3/4 of the ECF)
*** Plasma (1/4 of the ECF)
*** A negligible third compartment, the ''transcellular compartment'' includes the cerebrospinal, pleural, peritoneal, and digestive fluids.

====Intracellular Fluid (ICF)====
''''Def.'''' the water inside the cells, where all solutes within are dissolved

It consists of '''2/3 of TBW''' (or 40% of body weight).  The major cations are '''K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;'''.  The major anions are '''proteins''' and '''organic phosphates''' (e.g., ATP, ADP, AMP)

====Extracellular Fluid (ECF)====
''''Def.'''' the water outside the cells

It consists of '''1/3 of TBW''' (or 20% of body weight).  ECF is further divided into two separate compartments: 
# Plasma, the fluid that circulates in the blood vessels.
** Aqueous compartment of the blood
** Constitutes about 50% of blood volume (the other 45% is consisted of blood cells, such as RBC, WBC, platelets).
*** The percent of blood volume that are made up of RBC is called the '''hematocrit'''.
**** This is ~45%, and higher in males.
** Plasma proteins make up about 7% of plasma
*** Thus, only 90% of plasma is ''plasma water''
# ISF, which bathes the cells.
** An ultrafiltrate of plasma
** Has nearly the same composition as plasma (with the exception of plasma proteins and blood cells)

The major cation of ECF is '''Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''', and the major anions are '''Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''Bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)'''.

===Volume of Body Fluid Compartments===
===Movement of Water Between Compartments===
====Isosmotic Volume Contraction ''(Diarrhea)''====
====Hyperosmotic Volume Contraction ''(Dehydration)''====

====Hyposmotic Volume Contraction ''(Adrenal Insufficiency)''====
====Isosmotic Volume Expansion ''(Salt Infusion)''====
====Hyperosmotic Volume Expansion ''(High Salt Intake)''====
====Hyposmotic Volume Expansion ''(SIADH)''====

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preteens and teens often have opportunities to be child-sitters. A child-sitter is a person who provides care for infants and children with the permission of a parent or guardian. Young people may look after a younger brother or sister or be asked by a neighbor or other adulte to look after their children. Teachers and other adults have a role in preparing young people to be child-sitters. Preteens and teens need to learn how to care for young children three to eight years old.

== Preparation for Child-Sitting ==

A responsible child-sitter is prepared. A responsible child-sitter is:

* Observant and alert
* Calm during emergencies
* Able to follow instructions
* Trained in first aid and familiar with universal precautions
* Able to recognize safety hazards
* Able to communicate with adults
* Able to communicate with young children
* Able to supervise young children
* Patient
* Friendly

== Caring For Infants and Toddlers ==

Learning the characteristics of infants and toddlers allows a young person to know what to expect when child-sitting. Newborns to one-year-olds need to feel secure, like to be with people, cry when hungry or uncomfortable, like to touch and hold things, like to look at hands and faces, and like to put things in their mouth. One-year-olds to three-year-olds need to feel secure; wnat to be independent; want to eat, drink, and get dressed without help; like to play, build things, and watch what others are doing; like to do the same thing over and over again; and may have temper tantrums if they don't get what they want. 

A responsible child-sitter never leaves the infant or toddler alone. They never shake or hit an infant or toddler. Young people need to consult a parent or adult if an infant or child persists in a behavior they find difficult or inappropriate. They need certain skills to provide responsible care for an infant or toddler. These skills include the following:

* Knowing what to do when a baby cries
* Knowing what to do if they suspect an infant/toddler is sick
* Knowing how to diaper a baby
* Knowing how to bathe a baby
* Knowing how to give a baby a bottle
* Knowing how to burp a baby
* Knowing how to pick up and hold a baby

== Caring For Young Children ==

Children three to five years old share common characteristics, as do five to eight year olds. Three to five year olds enjoy playing with friends and communicating with others, like to  learn numbers and play simple games, like to be independent and do things for themselves, like to learn new words and names for things, can be very active, and can be very aggressive. Five to eight year olds need to socialize with others besides family members, want to be part of conversations with family members, usually have more self-confidence than three to five year olds, like to ask questions about almost everything, and are influenced by what adults say and do. A responsible child-sitter needs to know the following skills:

* Knowing what to do when a child is afraid
* Knowing what to do if a child has a tantrum
* Knowing how to help a young child
* Knowing what to do when a child refuses to go to bed
* Knowing what to do if a young child appears to be sick

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''''learning style''' is the way a person gains and processes information. Educators have identified four types of learners: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, and Global.

'''Visual Learners'''

A '''''visual learner''''' is a person who learns best by seeing or creating images and pictures. Visual learners do the following:

* Picture the words they hear or read

* Store what they see, read, or hear in images or pictures rather than in words

* Perform better on written tests than on oral tests

''Tips for Visual Learners''

1. Take notes and review them often

2. Color-code or highlight notes to be reviewed

3. Make a mental picture of key words

4. Remember lists by using a mnemonic (memory-assisting) device or code

'''Auditory Learners'''

An '''''auditory learner''''' is a person who learns best by listening or discussing a topic. Auditory learners do the following:

* Remember what they hear

* Can repeat word for word what someone else had said

* Can remember every word of a song

* Would rather listen than take notes

* Perform better on oral tests than on written tests

''Tips for Auditory Learners''

1. Tape-record information you need to recall

2. Play the tape several times when studying

3. Read or say information aloud to yourself

4. Study by having someone give you an oral test

5. Make a song of words or facts you need to remember

'''Kinesthetic Learners'''

A '''''kinesthetic learner''''' is a person who learns best by acting out something, touching an object, or repeating a motion. Kinesthetic learners do the following: 

* Remember objects they have touched

* Remember facts from being in a role play

* Perform better on tests requiring deomonstration than on oral or written tests

* Can act out a story or concept

''Tips for Kinesthetic Learners''

1. Associate information with a feeling of smell

2. Role-play situations in which you recall facts

3. Demonstrate concepts you have learned

4. Make a story to help yourself remember facts

A '''global learner''' is a person who learns best by combining visual, auditory, and kinesthetic ways of learning.  

''Tips for Global Learners''

1. Assess which learning style works best for you in specific situations.

2. Experiment with the tips given for the other types of learners.

== Learning Disabilities ==

A '''''learning disability''''' is a disorder in which a person has difficulty acquiring and processing information. 

'''The Different Types of Learning Disabilities'''

'''''Dyslexia''''' is a learning disability in which a person has difficulty spelling, reading, and writing. People who have dyslexia may reverse letters and numbers. They may read from right to left. 

'''''Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)''''' is a learning disability in which a person is restless and easily distracted. People who have ADD cannot keep their attention focused on what they are doing. They have difficulty completeing tasks. They may daydream.

'''''Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)''''' is a learning disability in which a person is easily distracted and also is hyperactive. To be hyperactive is to not be able to sit still or stand still. People who have ADHD cannot keep their attention focused on what they are doing. They are restless and fidgety. They may be impulsive. 

'''''Tracking Disorder''''' is a learning disability in which a person has difficulty following a series of words or images. People who have tracking disorder have difficulty staying on the same line as they read. Or they may have difficulty catching a baseball thrown from the outfield to home plate. 


== Learning About Support For People With Learning Disabilities ==

People who have difficulty acquiring and processing information can take diagnostic tests to find out if they have a learning disability. If they have a learning disability, a plan to increase their learning can be drawb up. A variety of professionals will work with these individuals and their parents or guardians. These professionals may include a counselor, school pyschologist, teacher, and tutor. Schools may offer special education classes for students with disabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Infancy consists of the period from birth to about two years of age. The first years of life are a time of incredible growth and development. Although there is uniformity in the growth and devleopment of most children, no two children develop exactly alike. Children differ in physical, cognitive, social, and emotional growth patterns. They also differ in the ways they interact with and respond to their environment as well as play, affection, and other factors. An understanding of infant growth and development patterns and concepts is necessary for parents and caregivers to create a nurturing and caring environment that will stimulate optimal growth in young children.

== Types of Development ==

'''''Physical Development''''' refers to physical changes in the body and involves changes in weight, height, motor skills, vision, hearing, and development of the senses and perceptions. Physical growth is rapid during the first two years of life. WIth each physical change, a child acquires new abilities. By repeating motor actions, an infant builds physical strength and muscular coordination. 

'''''Cognitive Development''''' refers to the development of cognitive skills such as reasoning, language acquisition, problem solving, and knowledge acquisition. Children learn through their senses and through mulitple interactions with people and things in the environment. As children grow and interact with their environment, they go through various stages of cognitive development.

'''''Emotional Development''''' is the expression of feelings about one's self, others, and things. '''''Social development''''' is relating to others. These two types of development are placed together because they are closely interrelated growth patterns and are referred to as social-emotional development. Social-emotional development includes developing feelings of self-esteem, trust, and friendship. It also includes developing skills to socialize and interact effectively with others. 

== Developmental Milestones ==

'''''Developmental milestones''' are the physical or behavioral signs of development or maturation in infants and children. Observing developmental milestones helps to determine the growth and development  progress of an infant over time.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Danger}}

The experimental details given here are given in good faith and are believed to be safe and workable methods. However, '''the authors cannot take responsibility for the consequences of performing these experiments.''' 

The experiments are written for experienced science teaching staff to use as instructions for a supervised class of students. The experiments are not designed for students or inexperienced members of the public to perform without supervision. If you wish to attempt the experiments, ensure that you have completed a legally adequate risk assessment beforehand and that you work within the constraints of the risk assessment.

All ethanedioates are toxic. Wear gloves when handling these compounds. Put surplus ethanedioate in the beaker provided. Disposal of ethanedioate is achieved by adding acidified potassium manganate (VII) and warm water, and then running to waste with a large volume of water.

==Preparation of iron (II) ethanedioate==

Propanone is highly flammable and should not used near sources of ignition.

When a solution containing Fe&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; ions is treated with a slight excess of a solution containing ethanedioate ions (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, otherwise known as oxalate ions), a bright yellow solid is precipitated. This compound is iron (II) ethanedioate hydrate, FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; • 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Fe(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) →

FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; • 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (s) + (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

1.	To 50.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.200 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; iron (II) ammonium sulphate (Fe(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) add a slight excess&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.2 mol dm-3 sodium ethanedioate solution, with steady stirring.

2.	Allow the solid precipitated to settle and test the supernatant liquid to check that precipitation is complete&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;.

3.	Vacuum-filter the precipitate, wash with a little propanone&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;, and suck as dry as possible at the pump.

4.	Carefully dry the precipitate at 100 C and then weigh it&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;.

a What volume of sodium ethanedioate should you use for a slight excess?

b How can you test the precipitate to make sure that no more iron is left in the solution?

c Propanone boils at 56 C and is miscible with water in all proportions. Suggest why the solid precipitate is washed with propanone and why this is effective.

d How do you know that the sample is completely dry?

From the mass of your final sample, calculate the percentage yield.

==Analysing The Iron (II) Ethanedioate Sample==

Iron (II) ethanedioate is oxidised by potassium manganate (VII) at 70 oC to give a number of products:

6 KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 24 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 

6 MnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 20 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 24 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 5 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;


This reaction can be used to titrate iron (II) ethanedioate to establish how many moles we have.

1.	Weigh your pure, dry sample of iron (II) ethanedioate.

2.	Precisely weigh three 0.2 g samples of iron (II) ethanedioate into three separate conical flasks.

3.	Record the mass of each sample.

4.	Add about 50 cm3 of 1 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; (‘bench’) sulphuric acid to each sample flask.

5.	Warm to about 70 C.

6.	Titrate the warm samples with a burette filled with 0.02 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is important to maintain the temperature at above 70 oC to ensure that the ethanedioate ions react completely. Monitor the temperature and add boiling deionised water to the flask if necessary.

For each titration calculate:

1.	How many moles of KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; were used (concentration x volume)

2.	How many moles (what amounts) of FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; were present (According to the balanced chemical equation, 6 moles of KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; will react with 10 moles of FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

3.	What is the molar mass of FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.xH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (mass divided by amount)

43.	How many moles of water were present (the molar mass of FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is 143.87 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and the molar mass of one mole of water is 18.02 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

Evaluation: How close is your answer to the correct answer?

What errors can you identify? Can you quantify these errors?

The main error is probably related to the purity of your sample.

Calculate the percentage yield of iron (II) ethanedioate:

What mass of iron (II) ethanedioate did you make?

How many moles (what amount) of iron (II) ions are present in 50 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.2 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; solution?

What is the mass of this amount of iron (II) ethanedioate?

Express the mass you made as a percentage of the theoretical mass. This is the percentage yield.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Six Pack flight instruments.jpg|thumb|right|The basic six-pack.]]Six primary flight instruments have become standard in any instrument panel and, since the early 1970's, these have been arranged in a certain, standard layout commonly referred to as the 'six pack'. They are laid out in two rows of three instruments each. The top row, left to right, contains the Airspeed Indicator (ASI), the Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Altimeter (Alt). The bottom row contains the Turn Coordinator (TC) the Directional Gyro (DG) and the Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI). A quick summary of these instruments follows:

==The Airspeed Indicator (ASI)==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:True Airspeed Indicator.jpg|thumb|100px|right|True Airspeed Indicator.]] --&gt;The ASI indicates airspeed, or the speed at which the aircraft is traveling through the air. It is a differential pressure gauge that measures the dynamic pressure of the air through which the aircraft is flying. Dynamic pressure is the difference in the ambient static air pressure and the total, or ram, pressure caused by the motion of the aircraft through the air. These two pressures are taken from the pitot-static system.
Beginning pilots need to remember that airspeed will include local wind and does not necessarily equate to ground speed. Throttle back a Cessna 150 in slow flight with a stiff head wind and you could be flying in one place or even backwards.

==The Attitude Indicator (AI)==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Attitude Indicator.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Attitude Indicator.]] --&gt;As discussed earlier, the AI informs the pilot of his or her attitude in space.  This is accomplished by fixing the case of the instrument to the aircraft and measuring the displacement of the case with reference to a fixed gyroscope inside.

==The Altimeter (ALT)==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Altimiter.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Altimeter.]] --&gt;The altimeter looks somewhat like the face of a clock and relays to the pilot her altitude, measured by the expansion or contraction of a fixed amount of air, acting on some springs.  As the airplane climbs or descends the relative air pressure outside the aircraft changes and the altimeter reports the difference between the outside air pressure and a reference, contained in a set of airtight bellows.

==The Turn Coordinator (TC)==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Turn coordinator.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Turn Coordinator.]] --&gt;The TC relays the rate of turn for the aircraft.  The instrument is only accurate when the turn is coordinated, that is that the airplane is not skidding or slipping through the turn.  For a skid, imagine a car that is understeering, where the front wheels do not have enough traction to overcome the car's momentum and the front of the car is thus plowing through the turn, resulting in a turn radius that is larger than that commanded by the driver).  A slip is a bit more difficult for you to imagine unless you're a pilot already.  This results from an aircraft that is banked too steeply for the rate of turn selected.  To correct the slip all the pilot has to do is increase back pressure on the yoke to pull the airplane 'up' into a tighter turn, such that the turn rate is in equilibrium with the bank angle.

The major limitation of the older turn-and-slip indicator is that it senses rotation only about the vertical axis of the aircraft. It tells nothing of the rotation around the longitudinal axis, which in normal flight occurs before the aircraft begins to turn. A turn coordinator operates on precession, the same as the turn indicator, but its gimbals frame is angled upward about 30° from the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. This allows it to sense both roll and yaw. Therefore during a turn, the indicator first shows the rate of banking and once stabilized, the turn rate. Some turn coordinator gyros are dual-powered and can be driven by either air or electricity. Rather than using a needle as an indicator, the gimbal moves a dial that is the rear view of a symbolic aircraft. The bezel of the instrument is marked to show wings-level flight and bank angles for a standard rate turn.

==The Directional Gyro (DG)==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Directional gyro.gif|thumb|100px|right|Directional Gyro.]] --&gt;A magnetic compass is a dependable instrument used as a backup instrument. Although very reliable, it has so many inherent errors that it has been supplemented with gyroscopic heading indicators.

The gyro in a heading indicator is mounted in a double gimbal, as in an attitude indicator, but its spin axis is horizontal permitting sensing of rotation about the vertical axis of the aircraft. Gyro heading indicators, with the exception of slaved gyro indicators, are not north seeking, therefore they must be manually set to the appropriate heading by referring to a magnetic compass. Rigidity causes them to maintain this heading indication, without the oscillation and other errors inherent in a magnetic compass.

The heading of the aircraft is shown against the nose of the symbolic aircraft on the instrument glass, which serves as the lubber line. A knob in the front of the instrument may be pushed in and turned to rotate the gyro and dial. The knob is spring loaded so it disengages from the gimbals as soon as it is released. This instrument should be checked about every 15 minutes to see if it agrees with the magnetic compass.

==The Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)==
&lt;!--[[Image:Vertical speed indicator.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Vertical Speed Indicator.]]--&gt;
The VSI reports your climb or descent rate in feet per minute.  Typically, non-pressurized airplanes will climb comfortably at about 700 fpm (if they can) and descend at about 500 fpm.  Descent rates faster than this cause discomfort on the occupants which can be felt in your ears.  Pressurized airplanes can climb and descend much more rapidly and still maintain the cabin rate of change at about these levels, since the cabin altitude is not related to the ambient altitude unless the pressurization system fails.

== Suggested merge--your thoughts? ==

I saw the suggested merge between the human physiology and medical physiology textbooks and hoped to get your input on the matter. In what ways would you like the medical physiology textbook to be different than the existing human physiology textbook? I am open to changing the human physiology textbook to be more rigorous or to have more emphasis on medical applications. If you think your goals could be reached by modifying the existing textbook then I would be happy to collaborate with you on such a project. I look forward to hearing from you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Imperatives''' express direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. For example: ''run!, don't walk, be carried''. 

==Present active imperatives==
===singular===
For the singular imperative, the infinitive of the verb without the ''-re'' is used.
{| border = 1
|-
|'''infinitive'''
|
|'''singular imperative'''
|
|-
|portāre
|to carry
|portā
|carry!
|-
|respondēre
|to respond
|respondē
|respond!
|-
|mittere
|to send
|mitte
|send!
|-
|audīre
|to listen
|audī
|listen!
|}
===plural===
Plural active imperatives for the 1st, 2nd and 4th conjugation are formed by removing the ''-re'' from the end of the verb and adding ''-te''. In the 3rd conjugation, ''-ere'' is removed from the infinitive and ''-ite'' is added.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unless you are planning to raise a child, it is likely that you will spend 40 hours a week doing some sort of paid work. As a result, choosing a profession can be as important of a decision as choosing a spouse.

When college students decide on a major, a common question is, &quot;Should I choose the major that will make more money, or choose the one I enjoy most?&quot;

There is no simple answer to this question. Some students have financial constraints, and need to pay off debts and support their families. For them, a good paying job is essential. Other people enjoy making money, so their answer to the question would be, &quot;both.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans have an unusual relationship with animals - we have domesticated many species of them, and interact with them almost as if they were our children.

Owning a pet can teach children responsibility, and help elderly people stay healthy. Dogs can also help people people maintain a consistent exercise schedule.

See what Wikipedia says about the [[w:Pet#Health_benefits|health benefits of pets]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book was created on December 7th, 2007 for the purpose of keeping the Wikipedia article on [[w:Vehicle Identification Numbers|VIN]]s under control. It will start off as a consolidation of all VIN-related code tables that were included on Wikipedia.

The final state of this book will most probably consist of the full explanation of VIN-obtainable information, and how to decode said VINs.

{{Info|The term &quot;Vehicle Identification Number&quot; or &quot;VIN&quot;, as used throughout this book means Vehicle Identification Numbers from 1980 onwards.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==World Manufacturer Identifier==
The first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the '''World Manufacturer Identifier''' or '''WMI''' code. A manufacturer that builds fewer than 500 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to General Motors in the United States), 1G1 represents Chevrolet passenger cars; 1G2, Pontiac passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet trucks.

===WMI Regions===
The first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture. Common auto-manufacturing countries are noted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For a full list of current VIN decoding for Ford, [https://www.fleet.ford.com/maintenance/vin_tools/default.asp check their website].

[[w:Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company]] uses the following [[w:Vehicle identification number|VIN]] formats and codes.

==American Ford==
===American VIN format===
Ford does not directly encode the platform name in the VIN, 
although much other information is included there.  
Instead, the company uses a series number to identify a vehicle type.  
Ford's VIN format is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

===American restraint types===
The [[w:air bag|restraint type]] is specified as character four of the American Ford VIN for passenger cars.

===American models===
The [[w:list of Ford vehicles|model]] type is specified in positions five through seven of the American Ford VIN.  The first position specifies the model line or [[wikt:marque|marque]], the next is the series, the last is the vehicle type.  The type often indicates the engine size, driven wheels, body style, and similar factors.

&lt;!-- let's split these into tables for each column --&gt;

==Ford Australia==
===Australian VIN format===
Ford Australia have used the same basic system for chassis numbers on Australian assembled vehicles since the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cortina-mk1.com/identify.php Australian assembled MK1 Cortina chassis number decoding&lt;/ref&gt; When Australia went to mandatory 17-digit VINs in 1989, the Ford chassis numbers became 17-digit VINs by the addition of 6FPAAA ahead of the original numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.pcug.org.au/~jcarroll/capri/vincode.htm Decoding of Australian Capri VINs&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of some L-series (Louisville) trucks fitted with other brands of engine, engine numbers match the VIN with the 6FPAAA omitted.

Subaru uses a '''17-character VIN''' format and code for vehicles sold in the United States.  These rules also largely apply to the Saab 9-2x, a badge-engineered Subaru Impreza WRX wagon.

==Subaru VIN code==

The following sample is the sequence and meaning of each character in the Subaru VIN:


&lt;center&gt;

&lt;td rowspan=6&gt;Sequential production number
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">General Motors uses the following VIN formats and codes.

==American GM==
===American VIN format===
GM has traditionally encoded the platform as the fourth character of the VIN. Other content includes an engine code and manufacturing plant. GM's VIN format is as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border=1&gt;

&lt;td&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=6&gt;Sequential number
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Platform codes===
GM used a lettered system of automobile platform codes for three decades. These letters were used as the fourth position of the VIN. Though today's GM platforms use Greek characters, they are still encoded with Latin characters in the fourth position. Position five encodes the specific model and trim level of the vehicle.

&lt;/center&gt;

===American restraint types===
The restraint type is specified as character seven of the American GM VIN for passenger cars.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1
&lt;/center&gt;

===American engine codes===
GM encodes the engine type in character 8 of the VIN. The following table outlines the various engines encoded there:

====Engine codes for passenger cars====

Mistake on the engine code M, this M code comes out on the 1995 - 1999 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and the engine is an RPO L82 3.1 SFI engine.

VIN code T also designates a 3.1 V6, the base engine in the 1990-92 Camaro/Firebird platform, and VIN code 8 is much better known as the L98 5.7 V8 TPI, standard in the 1985-91 Corvette and optional in the 1987-92 Camaro/Firebird platform .  

Missing Entry: 1985-1988 Pontiac Fieros have a 9 engine code for the 2.8L L44 V6.

Missing Entry: The 2009 Corvette uses a W engine code for the 6.2L LS3 V8.

Missing Entry:  Vin Code V for 2.4 L LE9  2.4L MFI   I4

Warning: Issues with the decoding are related to year/model combinations. Such as the 4.1 V6 is not included in the list, however it was used on El Dorada and some Cadillac models. Each Year has different break down for each code, a complete list would be a subject of its own. Along with Plants and some model break downs over years.

Missing Entry: 1991 Limo with engine code 7, is not listed. According to one source the limo engine is a 5.7L.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Volvo Cars|Volvo Cars]] uses the following [[w:VIN|VIN]] codes and formats:

These VIN number decoding and designation is used primarily only for the North American Market.
European and other Asian markets use another nomenclature systems.

Volvo Car Corporation is a registered Swedish based company that was headed by parent group FoMoCo PAG until 2010 when [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company Ford Motor Company ] sold it to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_Geely_Holding_Group Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.] The Volvo Car Corp still has concerns with its past parent AB Volvo when it comes to vehicle safety systems, crash testing, engines, ocean races, and some parts.

Volvo Car Corp uses World Manufacturer Identifiers beginning with YV and 4V[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIN].

== Volvo VIN History and Updates==
The Volvo Cars group started using a standard VIN pattern in 1976 on the 164 and 240 series vehicles. Since the VIN specification had not been defined yet, the codes are a somewhat different configuration than modern VIN codes yet still contain much of the same information. The most distinguishable features are the 2 character manufacturer identifier &quot;VC&quot; and 15 character length.

In 1981 Volvo changed the VIN pattern in accordance with the ISO Standard 3779 for vehicle VIN numbers. Volvo cars sold in North America from 1981 to 1991 had a VIN pattern that is slightly different than Volvo cars produced after 1991. The most significant changes in the post 1991 VIN were the 5th and 8th position characters. The 5th character was changed from representing the safety equipment to represent the body style and safety equipment. this also helped ease the integration of front wheel drive configurations (850 series) into the existing VIN pattern. It seems likely that the old (81-91) position 8 character was combined with the position 5 codes in 1992 which resulted in new codes in the 5th character position. This left the 8th character position open to represent the engine emission control setup. 

With the discontinuation of the rear wheel drive models, Ford aquisition, and new series designations (C, S and V series and later XC) in 1999, Volvo VIN patterns changed again. The main change came again to the 5th character representing body style and safety equipment. After 1998 the 5th character changed to represent the vehicle platform. While the information being represented by the character position was somewhat backwards compatible with the codes used prior to 1999, it should be considered representational of a different data set. After 1999 the 4th character should also be considered representational of a new data set for vehicle code to with the change of series designations.

In 2008 the U.S. National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration decided to change the structure of the VIN pattern. For modelyear 2010 and forward all cars with marketcode 31 and 39 (USA and Canada) position 4-5 change places with position 6-8 (i.e. 12345678 becomes 12367845).

      <text xml:space="preserve">From 1948 to the early eighties, Land Rover used for their cars chassis numbers of their own format. These formats are described in the table below. Since 1980 Land Rover deploys the standard 17-character Vehicle Identification Number ('''VIN'''), complying with international standards. 

Car details can be derived (decoded, calculated) from the chassis numbers and the VIN. Typically, the model (Defender, Discovery, Range Rover, Freelander), model type (station wagon, three/four door, etc), wheel base (90 inch, 100 inch, 110 inch, etc), engine, LHD/RHD, gearbox, and model year is included in the VIN. 

==Chassis number formats over the years==
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Format&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;17-characters, International VIN, 1980-later&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;SAL..............&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;17-characters, Int. VIN for LR do Brazil    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;93R..............&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;17-characters, Int. VIN for AAD, 1985-1995  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AAD..............&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;17-characters, US/Canada VIN, 1987-later    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.................&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;14-characters: is actually the 17-char&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;VIN missing the SAL bit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9-character numbers, 1955            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17.6.....&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9-character numbers, 1956 to 1961    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1........&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9-character numbers, 1950            &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;L........ or R........&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9-character numbers, 1962 to 1979    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.........&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8-character numbers, 1948 to 1949    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.8......&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8-character numbers, 1950 to 1953    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.6......&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8-character numbers, 1954 to 1955    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.7......&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7-character numbers, 1948 to 1949    &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.......&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6-character numbers, ???? prototypes &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;110F..&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3-character numbers, 1948 prototypes &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;R.. or L..&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

There have been many changes in the field of e-learning. The biggest difference is that the learner generates content. As an example,the content of the book titled with &quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Web_2.0_and_Emerging_Learning_Technologies Web_2.0_and_Emerging_Learning_Technologies]&quot; is constructed by learners who take part in the collaborative acedemic project [http://php.indiana.edu/~cjbonk/Syllabus_R685_Fall_of_2007.htm  Curt Bonk] from Indiana University,USA &lt;sup&gt;[http://php.indiana.edu/~cjbonk/Syllabus_R685_Fall_of_2007.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

The technology and tools which support the learner to produce content have made rapid proliferation, almost, worldwide, since the emergence of blog. These technologies and tools can be divided into two types. One is to help the users to create content, such as [http://www.flickr.com Flickr], [http://www.youtube.com  YouTube], [http://www.slideshare.net Slideshare], and  [http://www.haokanbu.com  Haokanbu] from China, etc. The other is to assist users to adopt new ways of managing knowledge and improving efficiency, such as RSS,Tag,Social Bookmarking,etc. The generic term for these different technologies and tools is social software, and its purpose is to support group interaction&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications_reports_articles/opening_education_reports/Opening_Education_Report199/]&lt;/sup&gt;.

('''Blogs and wikibooks are parts of a PLE but not everything. I consider PLE a concept, rather than a website, software, or any other online community.  In addition to some examples of web 2.0 software and websites, a deeper illustration of the emerging concept should be provided.''')

In addition, the development of open source exercises a great influence on education&lt;sup&gt;[http://oedb.org/library/features/how-the-open-source-movement-has-changed-education-10-success-stories]&lt;/sup&gt;. Open source projects such as MIT's OCW, OpenCourseWare Consortium, Wikipedia, including Linux and OpenOffice,etc., offer more opportunities.

All these changes have showed that the learner has more power controlling the learning environment. This was described by Stephen Dowens(2007) in that the management of learning
migrates from the institution to the learner&lt;sup&gt;[http://partners.becta.org.uk/page_documents/research/emerging_technologies07_chapter2.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;.This is the premise of what the PLE explores.

('''A personalized learning environment (PLE), as the name suggests, is personal and differs individually. In an introduction of the concept of PLE, I expect a general idea at first and later some details and examples, which might be clearer for readers who have no idea of PLE before.''')

The most commonly grown hellebores are the hybrid types. 

==Description==
Hybrid hellebores are clumping, low-growing plants with evergreen foliage and showy flowers in winter and spring.

==Growing Conditions==
These plants grow well in both full sun and dense shade.

==Varieties==
Numerous cultivars are available in the trade, and the plants freely hybridize so that seedlings are often quite different from the parent plants.

==Uses==

&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

'''''Spiraea thunbergii''''' ('''Thunberg's meadowsweet''', '''Baby's Breath Spiraea''', or ''Thunberg's Spiraea''') is a plant in the [[../Rosaceae|rose family]], native to Japan and China, and a popular landscape shrub in southeastern U.S.

==Description==
''Spiraea thunbergii'' is a small, long-lived shrub with thin, flexible stems. The flowers are white, borne in early spring (late March to early April) and late fall. It reaches a height of 1.5-1.8 meters (4-6 ft) and is about as wide. The alternate, simple, almost linear leaves are semideciduous.

==Growing Conditions==
Grows and flowers best in full sun.

==Varieties==
This species forms an interspecific hybrid with ''Spiraea japonica'' L. fil. &lt;ref&gt; [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200620/000020062006A0748826.php Horticultural Research (Japan)(2006): Floral Characteristics of Interspecific Hybrids between Spiraea thunbergii Sieb. ex Blume. and S. japonica L. fil.] &lt;/ref&gt;

In the horticultural trade one can obtain several varieties  of ''Spiraea thunbergii'', such as 'Mt Fuji' (white flowers), 'Ogon' (bright yellow flowers), 'Mellow yellow' and 'Fugino pink'

==Uses==
This plant produces phytotoxic cis-cinnamoyl glucosides and cis-cinnamic acid &lt;ref&gt; [http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=750839 Phytochemistry. 2004 Mar., v. 65, no. 6 p. 731-739] &lt;/ref&gt; The plant-growth inhibition characteristics can be used against diverse species as lettuce (''Lactuca saliva''), pigweed (''Amaranthus retroflexus''), red clover (''Trifolium pratense''), timothy (''Phleum pratense''), and bok choy (''Brassica rapa'' var ''chinensis''). The characteristics of these natural chemicals indicate a potential role of cis-cinnamic acid and its glucosides as [[../Allelopathy|allelochemicals]]  (chemicals, released from plants, that cause an interaction between plants and other living organisms) for use as plant growth regulators and weed suppression in agricultural fields and in natural ecosystems. &lt;ref&gt; [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16779039 Journal of chemical ecology 2005, vol. 31, no3, pp. 591-601] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
Prune in spring just after flowers. Can be grown as a cutback shrub, or trimmed as a hedge.

==Propagation==
Propagated by stem or root cuttings.

==Pests and Diseases==

'''Red bean paste''' (in Chinese: 红豆沙, or '''hóngdòushā''', meaning &quot;red bean sand&quot;, due to it texture) is a sweet paste used for many things in Chinese, Japanese and Korean cuisine. It is made from mashed [[Cookbook:Azuki Bean|adzuki beans]] (known as red beans in Chinese), mixed with sugar.

A range of texture from coarse and gritty to fine and smooth is possible. For a coarse paste, boil the beans for less time and mash by hand. For a fine paste, boil for longer and use a blender to mash the beans.

75ml sounds like a lot of oil, but it is required to drive out the water properly.

==Ingredients==
*200ml dried [[Cookbook:Azuki Bean|adzuki beans]]
*Water as needed for soaking and boiling
*150ml [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*75ml vegetable or peanut [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying

==Procedure==

# Wash the beans, checking for and removing any that are damaged or diseased. Soak the beans in cold water for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight. This softens the beans slightly and reduces the cooking time greatly.
# Drain the beans and rinse once soaked.
# Place into a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil.
# Simmer the beans for 1½-2 hours, until soft and disintegrating slightly. Longer boiling will result in a smoother paste. Remember to top up the water occasionally so the beans don't boil dry and burn.
# Drain away the water.
# Depending on the desired texture, mash the beans by hand (coarse) or in a blender (fine) until they are as you want. Note that the paste is very thick, so if using a blender, it is easier to do it a bit at a time.
# Stir in the sugar. You should now have a thick but damp paste.
# Preheat the oil in a frying pan or wok, and fry the bean paste, using a spatula or spoon to stir, until the water has been driven off. The bean paste will now be quite dry, with a slightly grainy texture.
# Cool, and store in an airtight container until needed. This paste will keep for at least a week in the fridge.

==Uses of Red Bean Paste==

Red bean paste is used in many recipes:
*As a filling for [[Cookbook:Baozi|Baozi]]
*As a filling for [[Cookbook:Daifuku|daifuku]]
*As a filling for mooncakes
*As an ingredient in red bean soup
*As a filling for tangyuan, boiled glutinous rice balls
*For zongzi, made of steamed or boiled rice and red bean paste
*Spread on toast, much like peanut butter or jam

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Definition of Personal Learning Environment (PLE)'''


In 1999, Bransford suggested “knowing where one is in a landscape requires a network of connections that link one’s present location to the larger space.(Bransford, 1999:127). The idea of PLE makes this statement concrete. Every individual has his or her own network of learning from schools, friends, libraries or the Internet. Greeno (1999) stated “learning to live in an environment is learning your way around, learning what resources are available, and learning how to use those resources in conducting your activities productively and enjoyably” (Greeno, 1991:175). This perspective has not changed but could be applied to the emerging idea of PLE as well. An individual not only can be educated through traditional schooling but can learn multiple resources now readily available through technology, even get an online degree. 

The idea of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) was initially discussed in 2001 by Olivier and Liber, later many others contributed to enrich the concept, such as, Stephen Downes, Ray Sims, Mark van Harmelen, George Siemens, James Farmer, Michelle Martin, Scott Wilson, Steve Barth, Terry Anderson, Will Richardson, and David
Delgado to name a few. Simply, PLEs help people control and arrange their own learning process and provide supports to “(1) set their own learning goals (2) manage their learning; managing both content and process and (3)communicate with others in the process of learning and thereby achieve learning goals.” 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment

The term, PLE, also suggests “a collection of tools, brought together under the conceptual notion of openness, interoperability, and learner control.”(George Siemens) http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002884.html


An authoritative definition of PLEs does not yet exist. However, various ideas could be found on the Internet: 

(1)“the heart of the concept of the PLE is that it is a tool that allows a learner (or anyone) to engage in a distributed environment consisting of a network of people, services and resources. It is not just Web 2.0, but it is certainly Web 2.0 in the sense that it is (in the broadest sense possible) a read-write application.” (Stephen Downes, 2006) and Downes describes PLE as “an aggreation of tool, service,people and resources.” 

(2) “a collection of tools, brought together under the conceptual notion of openness, interoperability, and learner control.” http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002884.html

(3) “a facility for an individual to access, aggregate, configure and manipulate digital artifacts of their ongoing learning experiences.” (Ron Lubensky)
http://members.optusnet.com.au/rlubensky/2006/12/present-and-future-of-personal-learning.html 

(4) “a collection of free, distributed, web-based tools, usually centered around a blog, linked together and aggregating content using RSS feeds and simple HTML scripts.” (Sean FitzGerald) http://seanfitz.wikispaces.com/creatingyourple



A PLE is a concept, rather than a website, software or any online community. PLEs change, grow and cover various medium. Within traditional, formal, education a PLE was never a focus because the environment was created by the teacher or an admisinstration. Now, with advanced communication technology, individuals can and should be encouraged to construct their own learning maps or PLEs. 

Here’s an example of a PLE, a mind map of Ray’s PLE : http://simslearningconnections.com/ple/ray_ple.html. 

An individual could establish his or her own PLE by a personal blog with web links and RSS subscriptions, or one can combine his or her institutional education and other learning resources with a LMS (Learning Management System). ANother example, is a PDA that is Internet enabled. PLEs differ from time to time, case by case.

      <comment>/* Plural case examples */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a short overview of the grammar of the Serbian language. It is not meant to be a comprehensive set of lessons, but rather a reference to complement word entries in Wiktionary.  Although this is an overview of Serbian grammar.

==Grammar==
===Gender===

There are three grammatical genders in Serbian: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Each noun has its own grammatical gender, while adjectives correspond to the gender of the noun.

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;3px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gender&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Optional pronoun&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Example&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine, singular&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;taj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[muškarac]] (man)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine, singular&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ta&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[žena]] (woman)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter, singular&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[dete]] (child)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine, plural&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ti&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''muškarci''' (men)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine, plural&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;te&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''žene''' (women)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter, plural&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ta&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''deca''' (children)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Gender of the subject also affects the verbs in the past tense. For example, if a person was working, the verb '''to work''' ('''raditi''') will change depending on the gender of the subject. If the subject is the first person singular '''I''' ('''ja'''), the verb will change depending on who is speaking to either male or female form. E.g. a male may say: &quot;Ja sam radio&quot; (I worked), while a female may say: &quot;Ja sam radila&quot;.

=== Number ===

There are two grammatical numbers: singular and plural. Three common suffixes for plural are '''i''' (usually for masculine nouns), '''e''' (usually for feminine nouns), and '''a''' (usually for neuter nouns). For example: 
:automobil  -&gt; '''automobili'''
:flaša  -&gt; '''flaše'''
:pismo -&gt; '''pisma''' 

Some nouns have only plural form, so one word has to be used for both. E.g. pantalone or naočare.

==== Collective nouns ====
A special case of nouns are collective nouns. They are not a separate grammatical number but a basic noun form and designate a group of things which are numerous and uncountable.  For example: 

:javorov '''list''' (&quot;maple leaf&quot;, designates just one leaf)
:'''listovi''' u herbarijumu (&quot;leaves in a haerbarium&quot;, there are several leaves and the exact number is known)
:'''lišće''' u šumi (&quot;bunch of leaves in a forest&quot;, designates a bunch of leaves as an entity)

=== Cases ===

The Serbian language uses seven cases, for both singular and plural, for nouns and adjectives.  Adjectives follow the noun in declension.

====Singular case examples====

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;3px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Case name:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Answers question:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Used to describe:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sentence example:*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

====Plural case examples====

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;3px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Case name:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Answers question:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Used to describe:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sentence example:*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

:''*Please note that there are several declension patterns depending on the word that is being used.  Normally, words of same ending and gender follow the same pattern.  Sometimes, even if the gender is the same, the word might not have the same declension pattern.''
:''**Please note that in Serbian, in the genitive case, the question asked is '''of who''' or '''of what''' and NOT '''whose'''.  There is a difference between '''of who''' (od koga) and '''whose''' (čiji) in Serbian.''

==Proper writing (orthography)==
===The alphabets===
Serbian language can be written either using Latin (latinica) or Cyrillic (ćirilica) script, the ONLY slavic language to do so.  Both scripts were in common usage in much of Yugoslavia. Each letter represents only one sound and vice versa. The two alphabets can be transliterated between each other letter for letter.

*''Please note that in the Latin script '''Lj''', '''Nj''', and '''Dž''' are each considered as one letter corresponding to Cyrillic '''Љ''', '''Њ''', and '''Џ''' respectively.''
*''Also, because of the different fonts and keyboard styles, the Latin letter '''Đ''' is sometimes written as '''Dj'''.  Both are accepted and correct, however, '''Đ''' is the more preferred one because it is the ''official'' letter in the alphabet.''

Serbian Latin alphabet compared to Serbian Cyrillic alphabet in ''azbuka'' order: 
&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;V&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Đ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ž&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Z&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;J&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;L&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Lj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;M&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;O&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;P&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;R&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ć&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;U&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;H &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Č&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dž&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Š&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;А&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Б&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;В&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Г&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Д&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ђ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Е&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ж&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;З&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;И&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ј&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;К&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Л &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Љ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;М&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Н&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Њ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;О&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;П&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Р&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;С&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Т&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ћ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;У&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ф &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Х&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ц&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ч&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Џ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ш&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;v&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;g&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;d&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;đ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ž&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;z&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;i&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;j&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;k&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;l&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; lj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;m&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;nj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;o&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;p&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;r&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;t&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ć&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;u&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;f&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;h &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;č&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dž&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;š&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;а&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;б&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;в&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;г&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;д&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ђ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;е&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ж&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;з&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;и&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ј&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;к&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;л&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; љ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;м&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;н&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;њ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;о&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;п&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;р&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;с&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;т&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ћ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;у&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ф&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;х &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ц&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ч&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;џ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ш&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Serbian Cyrillic Unicode fonts====
Please note that it is recommended for better viewing of Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and their other sister sites that you use fonts which support the Unicode system.  The Unicode Cyrillic font includes Cyrillic characters for Russian, Serbian, and most other languages that use Cyrillic fonts.  However, there is a flaw to the Unicode Cyrillic fonts when it comes to Serbian.  The flaw is in the italic forms of five characters and in the roman (regular) form for one of those characters.  The five characters are:  '''b''', '''g''', '''d''', '''p''', and '''t'''.  Those glyphs displayed currently with Unicode Cyrillic fonts are based on Russian Cyrillic and not Serbian Cyrillic.  Serbian variants can be applied automatically ONLY if supported by the fonts used.  The following is a Unicode Cyrillic letter '''t''' displayed in its roman form first and italic form following:
&lt;center&gt;roman: '''т'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;italic: '''''т'''''&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If the italic form appears as a Latin letter '''m''', then the font is displaying it using the Russian Cyrillic (or current Unicode Cyrillic) system.  
The difference in the italic glyphs for the current Unicode Cyrillic font system and the Serbian Cyrillic can be seen and explained on the following links:
*[http://jankojs.tripod.com/SerbianCyr.htm Serbian Cyrillic Letters BE, GHE, DE, PE, TE]
*[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/Glyph%20Processing/detail.mspx Microsoft's Typography:  Glyph Processing]
*[http://www.unicode.org/standard/where/ Unicode.org - Where is my character?]

====Serbian Italicized Cyrillic letter ш====
Please note that until recently in Serbian the letter '''ш''' used to be displayed as it is displayed currently '''(''ш'')''', '''except''' that it had a '''line''' under it.  It is very unlikely that you will come across this letter online, but if you do, just remember that it is the letter '''ш'''.  Some older fonts do support it and use it instead of ''ш''.

=== Capitalization of words ===
The following words are capitalized in the Serbian language:
*The first word in a sentence: Čovek je šetao gradom.
*The first word in a quoted text: Petar reče: &quot;Sutra ću kupiti automobil&quot;. 
*Personal pronouns and pronoun adjectives used in formal speech: Predlog koji ste Vi izneli je dobar.
*Names:
**Personal names, nicknames and surnames: Ana, Petar, Boris, Jovana, Jela, Jovanović, Petrović.
**Adjectives of personal names only: Anin, Petrov, Borisov.
**Names of buildings: Stari most, Beograđanka, Ajfelova kula, Kip slobode.
**In the names of towns, countries and continents all nouns and adjectives are capitalized: Novi Sad, Sarajevo, Evropa, Sjedinjene Američke Države.
**Ethnicities and nationalities: Amerikanac, Francuz, Nigerijac.
**Citizens of towns: Novosađanka, Sarajlija, Parižanin.
**The first word of a street name is always capitalized, others are capitalized if it is a proper noun: Ulica neznanih junaka, Njegoševa ulica, Ulica Nikole Tesle.
**Names of geographic locations, such as mountains, lakes or rivers are written with the first word capitalized, and the others if they are proper nouns: Jadransko more, Dunav, Bokokotorski zaliv, Ada Ciganlija.
**Names of space bodies: Sunce, Mesec, Mars, Zemlja, Mlečni put.
**The first word of names of institutions are always capitalized, others are capitalized if it is a proper noun: Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti, Osnovna škola &quot;Petar Petrović Njegoš&quot;, Nacionalna štedionica.
**The first word of names of books, magazines and other publications are always capitalized, others are capitalized if it is a proper noun: Vojna enciklopedija, Na Drini ćuprija, Đavo u Sarajevu.
**Names of holidays: Nova godina, Bajram, Božić.

=== Particles ===
====Question particle ''li''====

*The question particle '''li''' is always written separately from other words. For example:
:Da li čitaš knjigu? (Are you reading a book?) or
:Čitaš li knjigu?
*Unless, it is used to form contractions.  A contraction formed by '''li''' particle (normally) occurs by dropping the ''i'' and joining the ''l'' with the previous word.  For example:
:Da l' čitaš knjigu?

====Negation particle ''ne''====
*In front of verbs, '''ne''' is almost always written separately, for example:
:ne umem (I do not know how)
:ne želim (I do not want/wish)
:ne volim (I do not like)
 
*The following verbs are written as one word. They are not really an exception, as they are verbs of their own.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Annotated Bibliography&lt;/h2&gt;
 


The annotated bibliography is the first step to writing a successful research paper. It is beneficial for students as well as instructors.  By assigning an annotated bibliography, students will begin their research long before the actual research paper is due, so they are not scrambling at the last minute to find sources. It also allows the instructor to evaluate the sources before students begin writing their papers.  

There are several elements to be considered when teaching this unit:

* Choosing a topic
* Teaching research-where/how to find sources
* Finding a variety of credible sources
* Teaching proper style and documentation (MLA, APA, etc.)


&lt;h3&gt;Choosing A Topic&lt;/h3&gt;

How do we get students to choose interesting, fresh topics?  One way may be to first ban certain cliched, overdone topics.  Some of these may include: Genocide, abortion, war, the legalization of marijuana, global warming, lowering the drinking age, and gun control.  There will be a collective groan from the class, but they will get over it.  There are many other topics students can write about, and by banning certain topics, students will need to really think about what they want to write about.

'''Brainstorming:''' A quick way to do this is to have students write for a few minutes about topics that interest them.  This will help get the wheels in motion.  

'''The Library:''' Library time is helpful too-let the students browse the internet, magazines, newspapers, books, etc. to give them inspiration. It is helpful to have students go through a library orientation in a classroom computer lab, with special attention paid to researching scholarly databases (such as JSTOR) that may house credible information about their future topics.  

'''Narrowing''':  Sometimes it can be beneficial for the students to have a spectrum of topics to choose from.  For example, requiring the student's topic to be within a time period, like the 1960, can help eliminate cliché topic selections.  Or, narrowing the choice to, for example, a historical figure, social movement, foreign country, or theme, will make the paper seem more manageable. 

'''The Proposal:''' Once students have chosen a topic, it's time to get your approval.  Have students write a one page proposal about their topic.  The proposals should include: the subject of the paper, the stance they plan to take, what they know, what they don't know, what they plan to learn while doing their research, the list goes on... By doing this you can put out any fires before they start. Once they have your approval, the next step can begin.

&lt;h3&gt;Teaching Research-Where/How To Find Sources&lt;/h3&gt;

'''Source Limits:''' One of the first things you will need to determine when assigning the bibliography/research paper is the number and variety of sources students will be required to include.  The students first instinct will be to go straight to the internet for all of their research, so it helps to put a limit on the number of sources you will allow from a particular medium. 

'''The Library''': Again, scheduling library time will be extremely helpful. By doing a library orientation students can become familiar with the many types of resources the library has to offer.  One of the most important tools are the scholarly databases (JSTOR, CQ Researcher), these will help students find scholarly journal articles about their chosen topics. (More examples)

&lt;h4&gt;Finding A Variety of Credible Sources&lt;/h4&gt;

'''Source Types''': Once students have the tools to do their own research, the next step is to help them determine whether or not a sources is credible.  These questions will be helpful for all sources, but particularly for internet sources. Remind students to get bibliography information from all of their sources as they are searching, this will cut down on having to backtrack later.

'''Remember''' to differentiate between they types of sources you want them to have.  Help them to understand the difference between scholarly journals, trade journals, and popular journals.  Sometimes it my be appropriate, especially if the topic is about popular culture, to use non-scholarly sources.

&lt;h4&gt;Evaluating Resources Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

* What type of website is it? A .com is a commercial site, a .gov is a government site, a .org is a non-profit organization, and a .edu is an educational institution.  
* What type of source is it? A book, magazine?  Does the author or publication have any particular bias?
* Who is the source/author? Cites without an author may have questionable validity.
* What are the author's qualifications/expertise?
* When was the web page last updated?  
* Was the source ever in print form?  Video form? 


&lt;h3&gt;Teaching Documentation/Citation&lt;/h3&gt;
Teaching Documentation can be difficult, but the key here is practice. Students need to familiarize themselves with the style guide they will be using.  A good way to do this is simply to bring citation information (author names, titles, etc.) and have students practice finding the correct way to site each source using their text.  Also, bringing in examples of annotated bibliographies will give them a good visual example of what it is supposed to look like.

&lt;h4&gt;Sample Assignment Sheets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Sample Assignment One&lt;/h5&gt;

'''Overview:'''
An annotated bibliography is a list of citations to books, articles, and websites with a small, descriptive paragraph.  Annotated bibliographies generally have the following components: a summary, an evaluation of credibility, and a description of how the source fits in to your paper.

'''Directions:'''
Write an annotated bibliography with 8-10 scholarly sources.  Each annotation should be about 150 words and be in MLA format.  The topic of your annotated bibliography should relate to the topic you choose for your research paper.

'''Your bibliography should include (as a minimum)''':
* One book
* Four scholarly articles or chapters of an anthology (found in person at the library)
* The remaining can be websites, encyclopedias, etc.

'''Grading:'''
The annotated bibliography is worth 5% of your total grade.  

'''Your grade will be determined based on the following components:'''
* Validity: are the sources you have chosen valuable in the field of research?
* Scholarliness: are your sources scholarly, credible, and/or peer reviewed?
* Citation: are your sources documented properly and according to MLA?
* Evaluation: did you evaluate the source in a clear and fair manner?
* Assignment: did you fulfill the requirements of the assignment?


&lt;h5&gt;Sample Assignment Two&lt;/h5&gt;

'''Writing an Annotated Bibliography'''

'''Definition:'''

	An annotation is a brief summary of a book, article, or other publication.  An abstract is also a summary, but there is a difference between the two.  An abstract is simply a summary of a work, whereas the purpose on an annotation is to describe the work in such a way that the reader can decide whether or not to read the work itself.  A bibliography, of course, is a list of writings and is a standard appendage to scholarly books or articles.  An annotated bibliography helps the reader understand the particular usefulness of each item.  The ideal annotated bibliography shows the relationships among individual items and may compare their strengths or shortcomings.


'''Characteristics:'''

	Conventional and accepted rules of good writing should be followed: 1. Brevity and clarity are essential; 2. Avoid abbreviations; 3. Do not report information in the title; 4. Remain objective and avoid introducing personal prejudices.


'''Length:'''

	Although there is no lower limit, annotations should not exceed 150 words.


'''Person:'''

	Third person should always be used.


'''Language and Vocabulary:'''

	Use the vocabulary of the author, as far as possible, to convey the ideas and conclusions of the author; paraphrasing can lead the reader into channels of thought unintended by the author.  In cases where you decide to include a quotation excerpted from the work, set it within quotation marks.  Avoid introducing annotations with superfluous and/or redundant phrases like “The author states,” “This article concerns,” “This new contribution to,” etc.  Also avoid the monotonous starting of sentences with “It was suggested that,” “It was found that,” “It was reported that,” etc.  Annotations in which most sentences end with “are discussed” and “are given” are similarly ineffective.


'''Sentence Format:'''

	Use complete sentences.  Sentence length should vary as much as possible to avoid the unpleasant effect of a series of short, choppy sentences.  Every sentence should convey a maximum amount of information in a minimum number of words.  Overlong, complex sentences should be avoided.


'''Paragraph Format:'''

	Annotations should be one paragraph long.  The paragraph should contain a statement the work’s major thesis from which the rest of the sentences can develop.  You can avoid writing a paragraph that is nothing more than a series of unconnected sentences summarizing separate ideas, arguments, and conclusions, by following the same order of information as the author and by intelligently using transitional words and phrases.


'''Step-By-Step Approach to Annotating:'''

	The following approach to annotating will help you to use your reading time to best advantage.

* Familiarize yourself with the contents of the book or article.  Examining the table of contents, the foreword, and the introduction can be helpful.
* Read as much of the book or article as is necessary to understand its content.
* Outline or make notes of the information you think should be incorporated in the annotation.
* Write a paragraph that covers the spirit of the book or article without undue emphasis on any one or more particular points.
* Individualize annotations in a bibliography; avoid using the same words and repetitive phrasing.
* Write in complete sentences.
* The most effective annotation is tightly written with succinct and descriptive wording.  Annotations are short notes and are normally no more than 150 words.  Verbosity is the major sin.  Brevity and clarity are the goals.
* Grab the attention of the reader at the beginning of the annotation.

I'm also here to learn python, and am confident enough to make corrections/enhancements where i think they should be made.

I don't fully understand the part &quot;Beginning from Python 2.2, you may also define the above example in a way that looks like a normal variable:&quot;. I think it --and the subsequent example-- needs to be expanded and clarified. And i'm removing &quot;Beginning from Python 2.2, &quot;; we don't need the history.

Well when this was written Python 2.3 and 3.0 where either on beta or recently release.  However thanks for the correction as it read more clearer.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

When I see a spambot page like the one you deleted earlier I tend to do a week's block.  Unlikely to affect anyone and quicker (IMO) than placing a tag.  Once in a while the same IP gets used again and a longer block looks worthwhile - I've picked up a couple recently.  I know a few others work like that &amp; a few don't &lt;g&gt;.  I placed a message on the Bangkok user's page btw - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:26, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

:Um, OK ... I had planned to do exactly that, but ... I haven't deleted a spambot page yet. Or have I? Just looked at delete logs for me, and can't spot it. ??? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:53, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

== My first admin question ==

{{user|Barsathi}} has a ton of images that are (apparently) all without license information. They're used in [[Diagnostic Radiology]] and were supposed to get deleted in November of 2006 by [[Wikibooks:WikiProject:Image Cleanup]] (according to the notice at the top of the front page). [[User:Barsathi]] has had plenty of warnings, but I wanted to make sure I'm right to delete all these pictures - it'll rip the book to shreds, which sucks. What do you think? ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:33, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

:G'day Mike, I've been holding off on those images for exactly those reasons. By rule, they should go, but it would rip the book to shreds as you say. The user hasn't registered an email address with Wikibooks either, so we can't email them to ask anything. I reckon we get consensus on one of the staff lounge pages, as I'd hate to be the one to trash that book.
:Regarding the Image Cleanup project in general, I had a run-in with that project last year because they were indiscriminately deleting images without checking for replacements on Commons, working up PD/GFDL replacements of simplistic images, or contacting the original uploaders. Worse, they were unlinking images that later proved to be OK or easily replaceable, thus making it difficult to restore these images into the books that used them. 
:I'd advise that you don't rush into deleting lots of images - take time to assess each one, check for replacements on Commons, see if they can be replaced with Wikimarkup (e.g. tables or mathml), etc. before ripping the heart out of a book.

That range has now been doing the same sort of thing on en quote for info - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:01, 18 July 2007 (UTC)
:So, going to try a range block then? Just on the three, say. Oh, but I see &quot;now&quot; means sometime this year, not &quot;just now&quot;. I also note that one of those IPs has been used for Good, not Evil, on WQ this year. Again, I point out the virtue of short blocks where the IP address is dynamically allocated... [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:13, 18 July 2007 (UTC)
::Grumpy old git!  The blocks are recent!  Dynamic ips - I agree they should be short - however not just because they claim to be dynamic.  For example one on Commons has been editing the same material all year and similar on en wp so I consider the &quot;claim&quot; to be dynamic is not likely to be true.  Something about &quot;you shall know them by their deeds&quot; IIRC --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:37, 18 July 2007 (UTC)
:::The blocks are recent, but the activity on those IPs was May and June, nothing in July. As for deeds, all edits on [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/61.88.131.150 this one] before 18 May were positive. Regarding dynamic IP allocation, [http://wq.apnic.net/apnic-bin/whois.pl?searchtext=61.88.131.150 APNIC] shows them as Optus, which is a major cable, DSL and dial-up provider in Australia, and the block is &quot;ALLOCATED PORTABLE&quot; (i.e. dynamically allocated, not assigned).

== Attack vandals ==

Plus page move/mumfum etc - feel free to indef them always.  Same IP attacked me on Meta within the last week.  CU usually advisable too tho if I'm around I always check block logs!  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:32, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

:Good point. I did wonder about that, but I had checked the box for blocking the latest IP used by that user, and there was no additional information regarding the IP - e.g. I couldn't see whether it was dynamically allocated, nor could I specify separately what the IP block's expiry was, so I decided to go with 3 months as a compromise. Thoughts? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:02, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

::I guess I work on indef blocks on inappropriate username, vandal only accounts, page move accounts, graphics accounts, attack accounts.  This is the issue with needing CU because all you can do is autoblock the IP for a day (&amp; always worth doing that).  Then grab a friendly CU (if they haven't seen it).  For me such info is shareable with those I trust and a blocking admin always comes under that heading.  In practice you can now see both IPs anyway.  I can't find a lot on them across wiki.  The first was used to create accounts on Meta, the second has been used on a couple of other wikis recently for vandal purposes (a very useful aspect of the CU log is that it is searchable!).  I'm guessing both are compromised IPs.  Happy to supply any other info if I can - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:24, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

:::OK, but I know that you patrol block logs, if for no other reason than for checking up on cross-wiki vandalism. Is it worth going further and bringing something to your attention, or better to just block the user indefinitely and leave the IP to you? Without CU, I only have the option of blocking or not blocking the IP for the same period as the user, and I'm a little uncomfortable about indefinite blocks on IPs that may be dynamically allocated. I'd rather block the IP ''and'' the user simultaneously, as you suggest - but not if it means an indef block on an IP I can't inspect. (no, I don't want CU!) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

::::I guess &quot;don't assume&quot; I'll get there maybe.  I should but....  Autoblock is only 24 hours (see me bit above) - you have no choice on the length of IP block time - 24 hours or nothing - all you indef is the username (autoblock for vandal accounts as it gives time to CU).  DL has come up with the fact that they are tor/open proxies anyway now and has reblocked them here (I've done them elsewhere and informed others).

== Early European Government in New Zealand ==

After New Zealand was annexed by Britain, it was initially set up as a dependency of New South Wales. However, by 1841, New Zealand was made a colony in its own right. As a colony, it inherited political practices and institutions of government from the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom Government started the first New Zealand Government by appointing governers, being advised by appointed executive and legislative councils.

In 1852, the British Parliament passed the New Zealand Constitution Act, which provided for the elected house of representitives and legislative council. The General Assembly (the House and Council combined) first met in 1854.

New Zealand was effectively self-governing in all domestic matters except 'native policy' by 1856. Control over native policy was passed to the Colonial Government in the mid-1860s.

'''Star Magnolia''', ''Magnolia stellata'', is a very slow growing perennial shrub or small tree native to Japan with large showy white or pink flowers in early spring before the appearance of the leaves. It is closely related to Kobushi magnolia (''[[../Magnolia kobus/]]''), and is treated by many botanists as a variety or even a cultivar of that species.

''Magnolia stellata'' is a species which may be found growing wild in certain parts of the Ise Bay area of central Honshū, Japan’s largest island, at elevations between 50m and 600m. It grows by streamsides and in moist, boggy areas with other woody plants such as ''[[../Enkianthus cernuus/]]'', ''[[../Corylopsis glabrescens/]]'' var. gotoana and ''[[../Berberis sieboldii/]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhs.org.uk/learning/publications/pubs/garden0306/magnolia.asp&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Description ==
This tree grows 4.6 to 6 m (15 to 20 ft) in height, and spreads to 4.6m in width at maturity. It displays upright oval growth in youth, and spreads and mounds with age. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hort.uconn.edu/Plants/m/magste/magste1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree blooms at a young age, with the slightly fragrant 7&amp;ndash;10 cm (3&amp;ndash;4 in) flowers covering the bare plant in late winter or early spring before the leaves appear. There is natural variation within the flower color, which varies from white to rich pink; the hue of pink magnolias changes from year to year, depending on day and night air temperatures prior to and during flowering. The flowers  are star shaped, with at least 12 thin, delicate tepals- some cultivars have more than 30.The leaves open bronze-green, turning to deep green as they mature, and yellow before dropping in autumn.
They are oblong and about 4 in (10 cm) long by about an 1.5 in (4 cm) wide. 

It produces a reddish-green, knobby aggregate fruit which is about 2 in long and matures and opens in early autumn. The fruit often drops before fully developed, but mature fruit opens by slits to reveal orange-red seeds.

Young twigs have smooth, shiny chestnut brown bark, while the main trunks have smooth, silvery gray bark. Like the [[../Magnolia x soulangeana|saucer magnolia]], it is deciduous, revealing a twiggy, naked frame in winter.
Plants have thick, fleshy roots which are found fairly close to the surface and do not like disturbance.

==Growing Conditions==
[[Image:Star magnolia 8854.JPG|left|thumb|''Magnolia stellata'' in Hemingway, South Carolina]]  This species has become naturalized in parts of North America, after it was introduced in the 1860s, and is a common ornamental in Europe and much of North America. This species was first introduced to the UK in 1877 or 1878, most likely by Charles Maries, when he was collecting for Veitch’s Nursery.

Spring frosts can damage the flowers.  The shrub prefers deep, acidic soil. It may be propagated by seed, or more easily by rooting cuttings taken after the flower buds have formed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridata.com/ref/M/magno_st.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Pieris''''' is a genus of seven species of shrubs in the family Ericaceae, native to mountain regions of eastern and southern Asia, eastern North America and Cuba, known commonly as andromedas or fetterbushes. They are commonly grown as ornamental plants, valued for year-round interest due to bright red new growth in early spring, chains of small, white flowers in mid-spring, and buds that remain on the plant through the winter. Numerous cultivars have been selected for different spring foliage colour. They grow best in a shady spot, sheltered from drying, winter winds.

==Description==
They are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs growing to 1-6 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, often appearing to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below; they are lanceolate-ovate, 2-10 cm long and 1-3.5 cm broad, leathery textured, and with an entire or serrated margin. The young leaves in spring are typically brightly coloured. The flowers are bell-shaped, 5-15 mm long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes 5-12 cm long. The fruit is a woody capsule which splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

'''''Acer rubrum''''' ('''Red Maple''', also known as '''Swamp''' or '''Soft Maple''') is one of the most common and widespread deciduous trees of eastern North America. It ranges from the Lake of the Woods on the border between Ontario and Minnesota, east to Newfoundland, south to near Miami, Florida, and southwest to east Texas. Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity it often attains a height of around 25 metres (82 feet). It is aptly named as its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is most well known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.

Over most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in swamps, on poor dry soils, and most anywhere in between. Elevation is also not a limiting factor in its range, as it grows well from sea level to about 900 m (3,000 feet). Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for maple syrup production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the State Tree of Rhode Island.

==Description==
Though ''A. rubrum'' is generally easy to identify, it is highly variable in morphological characteristics. It is a medium to large sized tree, reaching heights of 18 to 27 metres (60 to 90 feet) and exceptionally over 35 metres (115 feet). The diameter can range from 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 inches), depending on the growing conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Walters | first =R.

The bark is a pale grey and smooth when the individual is young. As the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; The largest known living red maple is located near Armada, Michigan, at a height of 38.1 metres (125 feet) and a bole circumference, at breast height, of 4.95 metres (16.25 feet).&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;

The leaves of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives. As with all maples, they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin. The sinuses are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation.&lt;ref name =&quot;VT&quot;/&gt; When 5 lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the leaves of the related [[../Acer saccharinum|silver maple]], ''A. saccharinum'', are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either glaucous or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to 10 cm (4 inches) long. Furthermore, the leaves turn a brilliant red in autumn.

The twigs of the red maple are reddish in colour and somewhat shiny with small lenticels. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in coulour, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot;/&gt; 
[[Image:Acer rubrum drummondii drawing.png|right|thumb|Drawing showing male and female flower, leaf and samara]]

The flowers are generally unisexual, with male and female flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters, though they are sometimes also bisexual. They appear in spring from April to May, usually coming before the leaves. The tree itself is considered polygamo-diecious, meaning some individuals are male, some female, and some monoecious.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt; The flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx borne in hanging clusters, usually at the twig tips. They are lineal to oblong in shape and are pubescent. The pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth. The staminate flowers contain between 4 and 12 stamens, often with 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ontario&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Goertz | first =D. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Acer rubrum plant description | work = | publisher = Northern Ontario Plant Database | date = | url =http://www.northernontarioflora.ca/description.cfm?speciesid=1000050 | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit is a 15 to 25 milimeter (.5 to .75 inch) long double samara with somewhat divergent wings at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees. They are borne on long slender stems and are variable in colour from light brown to reddish.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot;/&gt; They ripen from April through early June, before even the leaf development is altogether complete. After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==
Red maple seldom lives longer than 150 years, making it short to medium lived. It reaches maturity in 70 to 80 years. Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short taproots with long and developed lateral roots, while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to 25 meters (80 ft) long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;

''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between 5 and 20 cm (2 and 8 inches) in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree 30 cm (1 foot) in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;. Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early Summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next Spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed forest canopy situations. However, one to four year old seedling are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. 

Red maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after clearcutting a 3.4 hectare (8.5 acre) Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than 1.4 m (4.5 feet).&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt; One of its associates, the black cherry (''[[../Prunus serotina/]]''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential allelopathic inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow 30 cm (1 ft) in their first year and up to 60 cm (2 ft) each year for the next few years making it a fast grower.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt; 

The red maple is a used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see [[w:List of Lepidoptera which feed on Maples]].
[[Image:Maple7951.JPG|right|thumb|Male flowers]]
Due to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish Fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief frost free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of the variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;

Red maple frequently hybridizes with Silver Maple; the hybrid, known as Freeman's Maple ''Acer x freemanii'', is intermediate between the parents.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
Numerous cultivars have been selected, often for intensity of fall color, with 'October Glory' and 'Red Sunset' among the most popular. Toward its southern limit, 'Fireburst', 'Florida Flame', and 'Gulf Ember' are preferred. Many cultivars of Freeman's Maple are also grown widely. Below is a partial list of cultivars&lt;ref name=&quot;NCSU&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Evans | first =E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Select Acer rubrum Cultivars | work = | publisher = North Carolina State University | date = | url =http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/factsheets/trees-new/cultivars/acer_rubrum-table.html | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FU&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Gilman | first =E.

*''''Armstrong'''' - Columnar to fastigate in shape with silvery bark and modest orange to red fall foliage 
*''''Autumn Blaze'''' - Rounded oval form with leaves that resemble the silver maple. The fall colour is orange red and persists longer than usual
*''''Autumn Flame'''' - A fast grower with exceptional bright red fall color developing early. The leaves are also smaller than the species.
*''''Autumn Radiance'''' - Dense oval crown with an orange-red fall colour
*''''Autumn Spire'''' - Broad columnar crown; red fall colour; very hardy
*''''Bowhall'''' - Conical to upright in form with a yellow-red fall colour
*''''Burgundy Bell'''' - Compact rounded uniform shape with long lasting, burgundy fall leaves
*''''Columnare'''' - An old cultivar growing to 20 metres (70 feet) with a narrow columnar to pyramidal form with dark green leaves turning orange and deep red in fall
*''''Gerling'''' - A compact, slow growing selection, this individual only reaches 10 metres (30 feet) and has orange-red fall foliage
*''''Northwood'''' - Branches are at a 45 degree angle to the trunk, forming a rounded oval crown. Though the foliage is deep green in summer, its orange-red fall colour is not as impressive as other cultivars.
*''''October Brilliance'''' - This selection is slow to leaf in spring, but has a tight crown and deep red fall colour
*''''October Glory'''' - Has a rounded oval crown with late developing intense red fall foliage. Along with 'Red  Sunset', it is the most popular selection due to the dependable fall colour and vigorous growth.  
*''''Red Sunset'''' - The other very popular choice, this selection does well in heat due to its drought tolerance and has an upright habit. It has very attractive orange-red fall colour and is also a rapid and vigorous grower.
*''''Scarlet Sentinel'''' - A columnar to oval selection with 5-lobed leaves resembling the silver maple. The fall colour is yellow-orange to orange-red and the tree is a fast grower.
*''''Schlesingeri'''' - A tree with a broad crown and early, long lasting fall colour that a deep red to reddish purple. Growth is also quite rapid.
*''''Shade King'''' - This fast growing cultivar has an upright-oval form with deep green summer leaves that turn red to orange in fall.
*''''V.J. Drake'''' - This selection is notable due to the fact that the edges of the leaves first turn a deep red before the colour progresses into the center.

==Uses==
Red Maple is widely grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, except where soils are too alkaline or salty. In parts of the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as occasionally in churchyards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Mitchell | first =A.

Red Maple is a good choice of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. The red maple is excellent at withstanding harsh urban conditions, including tolerance of both dry and wet soils, and a higher tolerance of pollution than sugar maple. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings in narrow strips between a sidewalk and a street. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Reichard| first=Timothy A. |title=Spring Food Habits and Feeding Behavior of Fox Squirrels and Red Squirrels|journal= American Midland Naturalist| month=October| year=1976| volume=96| issue=2| pages=443-450| doi=10.2307/2424082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maple syrup.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A bottle of maple syrup]]
In the lumber industry A. rubrum is considered a soft maple. The wood is close grained and as such it is similar to that of A. saccharum, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has a poorer figure and machining qualities. High grades of wood from the red maple can nonetheless be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making furniture. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.
Red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup, though the hard maples A. saccharum and A. nigrum, the black maple, are more commonly used. One study compared the sap and syrup from the Sugar Maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the Silver Maple, boxelder (A. negundo), and Norway maple (A. platanoides), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDF&quot;/&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

===Toxicity===
The leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are highly toxic to horses. The toxin is currently unknown, but it is believed to be an oxidant due to its destruction of red blood cells and thus causing the blood to be unable to properly transport oxygen, a condition otherwise known as acute hemolysis. The ingestion of 700 grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result. &lt;ref name=&quot;Perdue&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Goetz | first =R.

'''''Veronica persica''''' (also '''Persian speedwell''', '''Large Field Speedwell''', or '''Bird's-eye''') is an annual or winter annual native to Eurasia, but also widespread in the United States, and east Asia (including Japan).

==Description==
The seed leaves are broadly triangular cotyledons, with truncated base.  The short-stalked leaves are broadly ovate, having coarsely serrated margins. ''V. persica'' has weak stems that form a dense, prostrate ground cover.  Tips of stems are often ascending.  Leaves on the lower stems are paired, but are alternate on the upper portion of the stem.  The short-petioled leaves are longer than they are broad and coarsely toothed. 

The flowers are sky-blue with dark stripes and a white center, and they are zygomorphic (they only have one plane of symmetry, which is vertical).  They are solitary on long, slender, hairy stalks in the [[Wiktionary:axil|leaf axil]]s. The fruits are heart-shaped and hairy.

The '''Grey Alder''' or '''Speckled Alder''' (''Alnus incana'') is an alder with a wide range across the cooler parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small to medium size tree 15-20 m tall with smooth grey bark even in old age, its life span being a maximum of 60-100 years. The leaves are matt green, ovoid, 5-11 cm long and 4-8 cm broad. The flowers are catkins, appearing early in spring before the leaves emerge, the male catkins pendulous, 5-10 cm long, the female catkins 1.5 cm long and 1 cm broad when mature in late autumn. The seeds are small, 1-2 mm long, light brown with a narrow encircling wing. The Grey Alder has a shallow root system, and is marked not only by vigorous production of stump suckers, but also by root suckers, especially in the northern parts of its range.

The Grey Alder is a light-demanding, fast-growing tree that is very tolerant and grows well on poorer soils. In central Europe, it is a colonist of alluvial land alongside mountain brooks and streams, occurring at elevations up to 1500 metres. However, it does not require moist soil, and is a colonist of screes and shallow stony slopes. It is sometimes used for afforestation on non-fertile soils which it enriches by means of its nitrogen-fixing nodules. The wood resembles that of the common alder, but is somewhat paler and of little value.

There are four to six subspecies, some treated as separate species by some authors:
*''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''incana'' (Grey Alder). Northern Europe and northwestern Asia, and central and southern Europe in mountains, mainly in the regions of the Alps, Carpathians and the Caucasus.
*''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''hirsuta'' (''A. hirsuta''; Manchurian Alder). Northeastern Asia, and central Asia in mountains.
*''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''kolaensis''. Subarctic northeast Europe.
*''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''oblongifolia'' (''A. oblongifolia''; Arizona Alder). Southwestern North America.
*''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''rugosa'' (''A. rugosa''; Speckled Alder). Northeastern North America.
*''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''tenuifolia'' (''A. tenuifolia''; Thinleaf Alder or Mountain Alder). Northwestern North America.

Several species of Lepidoptera use Grey Alder as a food plant for their caterpillars. See [[w:List of Lepidoptera that feed on Alders]].

[[Image:Cornus mas flowers.jpg|thumb|left|Europea Cornel flowering]]

The '''European Cornel''' (''Cornus mas'') is a species of dogwood native to southern Europe and southwest Asia.
It is a medium to large deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 5-12 m tall, with dark brown branches and greenish twigs. The leaves are opposite, 4-10 cm long and 2-4 cm broad, with an ovate to oblong shape and an entire margin. The flowers are small (5-10 mm diameter), with four yellow petals, produced in clusters of 10-25 together in the late winter, well before the leaves appear. The fruit is an oblong red drupe 2 cm long and 1.5 cm in diameter, containing a single seed.

The fruit is edible, with an acidic flavour; it is mainly used for making jam, but also can be eaten dried. In Armenia, the fruit is used for distilling vodka. In Turkey it is eaten with salt as a snack in summer. Cultivars selected for fruit production in the Ukraine have fruit up to 4 cm long. The species is also grown as an ornamental plant for its late winter flowers.

Its wood is denser than water. A dye can be produced from its bark and tannin is produced from its leaves.

The Intermediate level of this book is for those familiar with the basic elements of conlangs (or of languages in general) who want to learn how to create a conlang with added depth.  It aims to familiarize you with the internal structure of different elements of language, and basic terminology for discussing them.  It assumes prior familiarity with technical terms only up to the minimal level explained by the Beginner level.

== Theory and practice ==

The terminology explained in this level, and the analysis of language structure described by that terminology, are useful '''tools''' for conlanging.  They give you a map with which to navigate the vast territory of language.  However, as you study these useful tools, remember that the map is not the territory.

For one thing, they are tools of ''analysis'', and that doesn't necessarily suit them for ''constructing'' languages.  By breaking something into pieces you can describe it, and then try to figure out how it was put together in the first place; but the way you broke it down probably ''isn't'' the way it was put together, especially if it's something really complex.  Language &amp;mdash; as has been noted in the conlanging community &amp;mdash; is the most complex thing humans do.  Strange natlang features aren't random; if you use linguists' analysis as a menu of things to do, rather than working from ''why and how'' those features come about, your conlang likely won't feel naturalistic.

Linguists' analysis of language may only sometimes work.  There are languages that don't have syllables (or so some linguists figure).  Sometimes it's hard to be sure when things are or aren't separate words.  Words often don't classify neatly into standard parts of speech.  Or, the analysis may be (or may be ''suspected'' to be) purely descriptive, with no causal structure behind it; some linguists have suggested that ''ergativity'' (a feature that has enjoyed some popularity amongst conlangers, and which we'll get to in the Advanced level) is just a superficial characteristic of language, the way &quot;has blue feathers&quot; is a superficial characteristic of some birds that doesn't really tell you anything important about bird biology.

The terminology and analysis offered here ''is'' useful; we need some way to talk about language.  Just don't let it limit your understanding, or your creativity.

== What's in this level? ==

Each section is designed to cover details of a different facet of languages, natural and constructed.  The sections are:
*'''Sound notation''':  Different languages &amp;mdash; or even different dialects of the same language &amp;mdash; may have different rules for how written words should be pronounced.  This section introduces an alphabet for representing just the ''sounds'' of human speech, no matter what language the sounds are being used in. 
*'''Phonetics and phonology''':  How the sounds of a language (phonetics) fit together to form a system (phonology).
*'''Grammar''':  How words change and combine to determine meaning.
*'''History''':  How languages change over time.
*'''Writing systems''':  The many and varied written representations of language.
*'''Tips for adding irregularities to your conlangs''':  Kinds and causes of irregularities in a language.
*'''Exploring new realms''':  Some thoughts on deliberately leaving the beaten path.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

This is an old page, very few people are listed here, and of those that are, very few are active wikibookians. Instant messaging really isn't a common method of communication around here, and a quick glance at this list will show that many of the people aren't using any single common client (which makes communication less likely anyway). For off-wiki communications, there are the mailing list, email, and IRC (which has become relatively popular lately). Also users should be free to post their chat screennames on their own userpages, if they want to be contacted in that manner. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:21, 5 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{vd}}, this has outdated and useless written all over it, and it seems to kinda invite spam to those who are unfortunate enough to be left on the list. I also agree that it's easy enough to list your screenname, email, etc. on the user space if someone wants to contact you, and if they aren't looking for someone specific, that's what the reading rooms are for.

:{{del}} Any personal contact information, if appropriate at all, belongs on a person's talk page. Userboxes already exist that can be used for this purpose, such as {{tlx|User MSN Messenger}} and others could be imported as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:46, 6 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{del}} - I'd have to agree with Darklama here (wow...did I just say that?) 100%.  This is something that IMHO shouldn't be removed from user pages if you are willing to share this sort of contact information, but having a central list like this is almost akin to having a list of e-mail addresses of all Wikibookians.  For those that need real help, they can go to the various user pages.  A list like this is only going to be abused by the people that you don't want to have contacting you in the first place like spammers and vandals.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:11, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

My [[/sandbox]] is here for now.

== Japanese Wikibook discussion ==

Hi Nesnad,

I just added a comment on [[Talk:Japanese#Wow._This_is_a_mess]] which I wanted to draw your attention to as you've been involved in this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:19, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

== Quick Start Japanese ==

Hi Nesnad,

Just in case you drop in again, I wanted to ask you if you had any plans for the Quick Start Japanese you set up in a sub-page of your userpage. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:50, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

Hey Swift, I guess I should put this on your page to since you maybe wont stop by here again soon. Yes, I plan to polish them up soon and publish them here. I have sounds and dialogs, I think it would be quite useful for the community. I have just been busy these days :) [[User:Nesnad|Nesnad]] ([[User talk:Nesnad|talk]]) 05:47, 6 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

Let f(x) be a continuous function on an interval [a,b]. A partition of f(x) on the interval [a,b] is a sequence x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; such that x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=a, x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt;, and such that x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=b. The total variation t of a function on the interval [a,b] is the supremum

t= sup{a|a=&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^{n}\|f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})\|&lt;/math&gt;} and x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is a partition of [a,b]}.

If this supremum exists, the the function is of bounded variation on [a,b]. If a real function is of bounded variation over its whole domain, then it is called a function of bounded variation.</text>

Definition: a sequence of real-valued functions f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(x) is uniformly convergent if there is a function f(x) such that for every ε&gt;0 there is an N&gt;0 such that when n&gt;N for every x in the domain of the functions f, that |f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(x)-f(x)|&lt;ε

===Theorem (Uniform Convergence Theorem))===
Let &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; be a series of continuous functions that uniformly converges to a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

====Proof====
There exists an N such that for all n&gt;N, &lt;math&gt;|f_n(x) - f(x)|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{3}&lt;/math&gt; for any x. Now let n&gt;N, and consider the continuous function &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since it is continuous, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;|x'-x|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)-f_n(x')|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|f(x')-f(x)|\le |f(x')-f_n(x')|+|f_n(x')-f_n(x)|+ |f_n(x)-f(x)| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3} = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; so the function f(x) is continuous.

&lt;!--Perhaps a picture would help illustrate the proof of this theorem--&gt;</text>

Let &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of functions defined on a common domain &lt;math&gt;D\subseteq\mathbb{R}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then we say that &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; converges pointwise to a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; if for each &lt;math&gt;x\in D\,&lt;/math&gt; the numerical sequence &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;. More preciselly speaking:
 For any &lt;math&gt;x\in D\,&lt;/math&gt; and for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an N such that for any n&gt;N, &lt;math&gt;\left|f_n(x)-f(x)\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

An example:

The function

&lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{1+x^n}&lt;/math&gt; converges to the function

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if } |x| &gt; 1\\ \frac{1}{2} &amp; \text{if } x = 1\\ 0 &amp; \text{if } |x| &lt; 1 \\ \end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that a sequence of continuous functions can pointwise converge to a discontinuous function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cofactors==
Consider any column, the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; one. Consider all terms that contain the element a&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;, and factor out a&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;. The sum of all such terms is called the cofactor of a&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;, do be denoted Co(a&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;).

Every term contains exactly one element from the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column. A determinant D can thus be written as a&lt;sub&gt;1k&lt;/sub&gt;Co(a&lt;sub&gt;1k&lt;/sub&gt;)+a&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;Co(a&lt;sub&gt;2k&lt;/sub&gt;)+a&lt;sub&gt;3k&lt;/sub&gt;Co(a&lt;sub&gt;3k&lt;/sub&gt;)+...a&lt;sub&gt;nk&lt;/sub&gt;Co(a&lt;sub&gt;nk&lt;/sub&gt;).

If, in fact the cofactors of a column or row were to be multiplied by some different column and row, its sum would be zero because it would be the same as a determinant with repeat columns and rows.

&lt;math&gt;C_n = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{1n} \\
a_{2n} \\

&lt;math&gt;C_n = \begin{bmatrix}
c_1 \\
c_2 \\
c_3 \\
\vdots \\
c_n \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Where c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k1&lt;/sub&gt;+n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k1&lt;/sub&gt;+n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k2&lt;/sub&gt;+n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;k3&lt;/sub&gt;+...+n&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;kn&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Theorem==
If there is a determinant of order n which is A=a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;, and there are n columns of n elements such that the ith entry of the jth column is equal to a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;, then if one of the columns is a linear combination of the other columns, then the determinant is equal to 0.
===Proof===
Suppose that the kth column is a linear combination of the other column,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; c_1a_{11}+c_2a_{12}+ c_3a_{13} + \ldots + c_na_1n &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; c_1a_{21}+c_2a_{22}+ c_3a_{23} + \ldots + c_na_2n &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; c_1a_{31}+c_2a_{32}+ c_3a_{33} + \ldots + c_na_3n &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; c_1a_{n1}+c_2a_{n2}+ c_3a_{n3} + \ldots + c_na_nn &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then by the linearity of determinants, the determinant is equal to 

&lt;math&gt;c_1\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{11} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{21} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{31} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{n1} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
+
c_2\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{12} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{22} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{32} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{n2} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
+
c_3\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
+ \ldots +
c_n\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

Since all of those matrices have repeat columns, their determinants are 0, and so their sum is 0.

==Rank of a Matrix==
The rank of a matrix is the maximum order of a minor that does not equal 0. The minor of a matrix with the order of the rank of the matrix is called a basis minor of the matrix, and the columns that the minor includes are called the basis columns.

== [[Multibrot_sets]] ==
Hi, I was categorizing pages, and came across this page that you created.  I was wondering if you had inteded it to be part of the fractals book, but at the moment this page is out there as its own book.  Is this intentional? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:07, 19 June 2009 (UTC)


Hi, You are right. I had intended to make it as a part of book about fractals. If you can change it please do it ( I only know how to create new page in proper position and nominate for deletion old one). --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 17:53, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

==[[WB:WikiProject Mathematics|WikiProject Mathematics]]==
Hi, I have been trying to restart the Mathematics project here at Wikibooks.  The aim is simply to provide some community for the editors interested in improving the mathematics coverage here.  Give a place to discuss issues with wikibooks (such as &quot;hey this won't TeX correctly&quot; or &quot;how do I make a nice picture&quot;);  or actual mathematics content.  I know you've been around for a  long time working on [[Fractals]] and thought you might be interested in joining.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:17, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

Thx for invitation. I'm intresting, but I work in very chaotic way. (:-)).--[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 04:07, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

:LOL.  How very appropriate for someone who is editing a book on fractals.  I wonder if your daily edits are similar to your monthly or yearly edits, maybe after some appropriate translation in time?  

:Very good.  Well keep up the good work! If you ever feel like you could use the help of some other mathy types don't hesitate to leave a note on the project talk page. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:28, 7 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]].

You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Hello again,

If you haven't already, please review [[WB:DP|the deletion policy]]. This is not to say that your view expressed so far are invalid, but rather that out policies are not the same as at Wikipedia, though they are similar (many are simple common sense).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The arc length can be used as a derivative for the vector function '''f''', which is denoted '''t'''(x):

&lt;math&gt;t(x)=\frac{df(x)}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since

&lt;math&gt;\frac{df(x)}{ds} = \frac{f'(x)}{s'(x)}= \frac{f'(x)}{|f'(x)|}&lt;/math&gt;

which confirms the fact that it is a unit vector since the dot product with itself is 1. This also verifies a useful formula for the unit tangent vector

&lt;math&gt;t(x)= \frac{f'(x)}{|f'(x)|}&lt;/math&gt;.

The tangent line goes through f(x) and is spanned by the vector t(x). Thus, it is equal to the line spanned by

&lt;math&gt;f(x)+a\frac{f'(x)}{|f'(x)|}&lt;/math&gt;

where a is any real number.

The normal plane at the point f(x) is the plane that is normal to the tangent line, and thus the unit tangent vector. Therefore, its equations is given by

&lt;math&gt;|z-f(x)|\cdot t(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;

where z is any element of the surface, since it must be orthogonal.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:04, 10 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The completion of a metric space is a very important construction of a complete metric space from a possibly non-complete metric space. In effect, it is the ''smallest'' extension of a metric space to a complete version of it.

Definition: Take equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in a metric space X such that two Cauchy sequences are equivalent when they converge to each other i. e. their difference approaches a limit 0. This set of equivalence classes is called the closure of the metric space.

==Theorem==
The completion of a metric space is unique and complete, and forms a metric space under the metric d(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the limit of their difference, where x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are two Cauchy sequences, and this metric is well-defined. Moreover, the subset of the equivalence classes which converge to an element in the metric space X is homeomorphic to X, and any other complete extension of X must contain its completion.
===Proof===

==Example==
One way of constructing the Real numbers is by saying that it is the completion of the rational numbers.

Should address the subject of meat puppets and address historical problem that existed not only on Wikibooks but in sister projects. I'll try to hunt down all that I said on this subject of parallel or &quot;back channels&quot;, I prefer the last definition as it indicates the secondary place on any off site forums.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:17, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

[[m:Cabal|Meta:Cabal]], [[w:WP:CABAL|WP:CABAL]] and [[Meatball:DefendAgainstParanoia]] say more than I ever could say about this proposal. I disagree with the intent of this proposal and suggestions of adding wording about &quot;meat puppets&quot; and/or &quot;back channels&quot;. This proposal sounds like paranoia to me. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:57, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

:To address an issue one must start by identifying it. All of the realities you mention do exist and are part of the human status, arising from our tribal orientation and social structure. I've yet to read the text as it stands but for me it will only be of importance that it states several warnings so to protect the privacy of parallel discussions, the value/relevance they may have on our local discussions and identify the problems of expecting Wikibookians to be aware of any information shared offsite this includes for instance discussions on Meta, Wikipedia that may have an impact on our community.
:Also covering the fragility of such discussions as representative of the community and how they can harm it.
:This has the ability to be a framework that addresses this issues and provide a common ground of understanding this  problems, safeguarding future discussions from the implications.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:16, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

== Other sources/locations ==
Any discussion of significance or facts can only become valid and constructive if they are reflected on Wikibooks, no expectation can be imparted only because a number of Wikibookians seem to be are aware of them, they must be part of the public record, here, as to validate any expectation of mutual understanding of the problems/subjects.
This doesn't mean that providing a simplification/summary of the discussion and a link to a secondary location is problematic, advancing and promoting the Wikibooks project outside of the site should be promoted and providing information and enabling others to participate should be embraced but it must not be expect or consider an obligation.
The primary public location to discuss Wikibooks with other Wikibookians is Wikibooks, that is what constitutes the community common basis of understanding and sharing of information any other channel should be seen as secondary and prone to not be accepted as a valid forum for the community interests (at best it will can only claim to represent part of the community) this also raises other problems verifiability of authenticity, completeness (may lack of intermediary logs) and can lead to the problem of promoting group think (ie: us vs they situations).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:16, 10 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Teaching Oral Presentations''' ==

It has been said that the greatest fear people have is that of public speaking. The comic, Jerry Seinfeld, once remarked on this phenomenon, saying: &quot;Most people would rather be in the coffin than giving the eulogy.&quot; With this fear of public speaking so pervasive, it is no wonder that your students will need some guidance and support when you have them present material in front of the class. No matter what the material the students will be presenting, it is important that you provide them with specific ideas about how they should prepare in order for them to engage their audience in an effective presentation about their topic. Share the following strategies and information with your students.

== '''Presentation Evaluation''' ==

In order to help students feel prepared, it is a good idea to have a rubric to give them before they are going to present so they know exactly what is expected of them and how this grading will be different from that of a paper. The following are all possible areas that you might consider when making up your rubric:
* '''Delivery''' - Does the student make eye contact? Do they project their voice? Is their speech clear? Do they exhibit a presence before the class?
* '''Visual Aids'''- Are the visuals presented successfully? Have they been creatively made and used?
* '''Creativity'''- Does the student show an ability to solve the problems of the assignment in an original way? Do they try unique approaches in the presentation in order to get their information across?
*''' Knowledge'''- Does the student convey their knowledge of the issue fluently? Are they able to answer questions without stumbling? Do they give enough specific details to show a depth of understanding about their topic? Do their examples illustrate the topic in a clear and effective way?
* '''Insight'''- Does the student offer the audience insights about their research/information? For instance, do they offer answers to why this topic is important or how it can affect their audience?
* '''Preparation/Process'''- Does it look like the student has prepared materials and their speech well or does it look like they put it together in a slapdash manner?

== '''What do Effective Speakers Do?''' ==

Offer your students some pointers and practice in the class a few weeks before they will have to give a major presentation. You might offer the following suggestions about how to speak in front of a class such as:

'''Effective speakers do the following:'''
* Get their audience's attention by using strategies such as a personal anecdote, a brief story, or humor.
* Maintain eye contact with their audience as much as they can.
* Enunciate their words well and project their voice so that everyone can hear them.
* Provide an overview of the presentation at the beginning.
* Give strong examples to help explain the main ideas.
* Use transitions to show where one idea ends and another one begins.
* Provide a summary of the main points at the end.
* Anticipate questions that the audience might have and answer them effectively.

To give students the chance to see what it is like to be the center of attention and how they will physically or psychologically respond in such a situation, you can try assigning short speeches weeks or days before they are to give a longer presentation. Depending upon what you are teaching at the time, give students one minute impromtu topics that they can speak informally about in front of the class. Or, you could also assign students a topic a day ahead and then give them one minute to say something cohesive about it in front of the class. The more they practice being in front of a crowd, the better they might feel when called upon to present more material later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====Facilitative Tools====

Different definitions of PLE reflect different perspectives. One is from the perspective of emerging technology and tools which can facilitate the learner to construct a personal learning environment. For example, Sean FitzGerald held the view, &quot;A Personal Learning Environment (PLE) is a collection of free, distributed, web-based tools, usually centred around a blog, linked together and aggregating content using RSS feeds and simple HTML scripts&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[http://seanfitz.wikispaces.com/creatingyourple]&lt;/sup&gt;. George Siemens held a similiar stating, a PLE is &quot;a collection of tools, brought together under the conceptual notion of openness, interoperability, and learner control&quot;&lt;sup&gt; [http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002884.html]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Though people view PLEs from the perspective of emerging technology and tools, there are differences. The main difference is between the construction of a PLE from the learner's or the designer/developers point of view. For example, the PLE project at Bolton University has released the PLE software PLEX&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.reload.ac.uk/plex/]&lt;/sup&gt; 2006 .

The following is a list of emerging technology and tools from the view of the learner.

'''1. Tools to facilitate user created content.'''

Tools to facilitate user to created content can be divided into two categories. One is like Blog,Flickr,Yutube,etc., and the other is like a wiki or [http://docs.google.com google docs] a &quot;mashup&quot; such as, google maps or google earth, [http://www.panoramio.com/ Panoramio]. 

Supporting the user to produce content is a common characteristic but the way of how to organize the content is very different. The former is according to the user identity, so every one has an unique website that accumulates personal content. The latter is according to the content logic itself. 

One can make an extensive list of tools by media type, which the tool mainly supports. For example, here list some tools in China.
*Video,Tudou http://www.tudou.com/
*Audio,8box http://www.8box.cn/

'''2. Tools to facilitate communication.'''

Apart from Email, as main online communication tool, some new forms of communication tools have appeared in recent years,such as [http://www.skype.com Skype] and [http://www.twitter.com Twitter] (called microblog by some people). Similar products of Twitter are found in China such as [http://www.jiwai.com jiwai],[http://www.zuosha.com zuosha],[http://www.fanfou.com fanfou],etc.

'''3. Tools to facilitate social networking.'''

There are services called social network sites(SNSs) which help users to develop a social network . Boyd, d. m., &amp; Ellison, N. B. (2007) argues the public display of connections is a crucial component of SNSs&lt;sup&gt;[http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html]&lt;/sup&gt;. According to the report of 《Sharing Privacy and Trust in Our Networked》(OCLC 2007) SNSs are primarily designed to facilitate interaction between users who share interests,attitudes, and activities, such as Facebook,Mixi and MySpace &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/reports/pdfs/sharing.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''4. Tools to facilitate effectiveness.'''

Tools like RSS Reader and Tag offer a new way for a user to manage information and knowledge effectivly. 

For each kind tool listed above, there are many tools and/or services the user can utilize. Here some examples:

*David Delgado and his PLE,http://eduspaces.net/davidds/weblog/category/ple
*Michele Martin and her PLE,http://michelemartin.typepad.com/thebambooprojectblog/2007/04/my_personal_lea.html
*Ray Sims and his PLE,http://simslearningconnections.com/ple/ray_ple.html

      <comment>/* Changes in first Ionisation Energy within groups and periods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ionisation Energy==
Ionisation Energy is the energy needed to dislodge an electron from the attraction which holds it in an atom/ion/molecule.  The first ionisation energy is the energy needed to dislodge the least powerfully held electron. Second ionization energy is the energy needed to dislodge the second least powerfully held electron etc.

The size of the ionisation energy for an electron is related to the size of the attraction between that electron and the nucleus to which it is bound. 4 factors effect the size of this attraction.

''' The number of protons in the nucleus. '''&lt;br /&gt;
The higher the number of protons in the nucleus the higher its total positive charge and the higher the electrostatic attraction between it and the negatively charged electron.

''' The distance between the electron and the nucleus it is bound to. '''&lt;br /&gt;
Attraction decreases with distance.

''' The number of intervening electrons between the electron and the nucleus - 'Screening' '''&lt;br /&gt;
Intervening electrons have a negative charge which repulses other electrons and reduces the attraction between electron and nucleus.  This is referred to as screening.  Note that intervening electrons do not 'block' attraction as the name suggests rather they reduce attraction by providing an opposing repulsion.

''' Whether or not the electron under consideration is alone in its orbital or paired with another electron '''&lt;br /&gt;
Paired electrons repulse each other and reduce attraction between the electron and the nucleus.

==Changes in first Ionisation Energy within groups and periods==

The First Ionisation Energy '''decreases''' down''' Group II'''. This is because each element has a new shell, increasing the amount of shielding and the atomic radius.

The First Ionisation Energy '''increases''' across '''Period III'''.  This is because:
*The effective nuclear charge increases, due to increase in the number of protons.
*The radius of atom decreases with increasing atomic number, hence more energy is required to remove outer electrons.
*The number of shells remains the same; leading to the same amount of shielding.

There is a drop from Mg to Al because there is a new subshell which is higher in energy (more energy is required to remove the outer electrons).
There is another drop from P to S because both electrons are now filled in the 3p subshell, leading to some repulsion.

== Changes in Atomic Radius ==
Across Period 3 (Na to Ar) as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, the effective nuclear charge increases but shielding by inner electrons is kept  unchanged as new electrons enter the same shell as they are attracted by the protons. This in turn will decrease the atomic radius.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Cherokee is written with symbols invented by Sequoyah in 1819. In his system, each symbol represents a collection of sounds, instead of one letter like in English.

* Cherokee symbol examples: &lt;big&gt;Ꮔ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(nu)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;Ꭽ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ha)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;Ꮭ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(tla)&lt;/small&gt;

==How many people speak this language?==
In the whole world there are only about 15,000 to 22,000 people who can speak this language.
==Where is this language spoken?==
Cherokee is mostly spoken in the United States in the state of Oklahoma and also on the Cherokee Reservation in Great Smoky Mountains, North Carolina. 

[[Image:Cherokee USC2000 PHS.svg||280px]]

==What is the history of this language?==
Although Cherokee has been a spoken language for thousands of years, it was not written down until Sequoyah invented a system in 1819. Today there are newspaper articles and other things written in this language. 

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

John Ross was a French writer who visited the Cherokees in 1621 to learn their language. They said he was the best student they trained. He wrote a book in the Cherokee language called ''Europa'', intended to teach the Cherokee what life was like in Europe.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==

Hello ... &lt;big&gt;ᎣᏏᏲ&lt;/big&gt;  &lt;small&gt;(O-si-yo)&lt;/small&gt;

'''''Corylopsis''''' is a genus of nearly 30 species of shrubs in the witch hazel family, Hamamelidaceae, native to eastern Asia with the majority of species endemic in China but with some also in Japan, Korea, and the Himalaya.

==Description==
They grow to 2-6 m tall, and often with a crown wider than tall. The leaves are ovate with an acute apex and a serrated margin, 4-20 cm long and 3-15 cm broad. The flowers are produced in late winter in pendulous racemes 3-9 cm long with 5-30 flowers; each flower has five pale yellow petals, 4-9 mm long. The fruit is a dry capsule 10-12 mm long, containing two glossy black seeds.

==Uses==
[[image:Corylopsis_Pauciflora_A.jpg|thumb|Corylopsis Pauciflora]]They are often grown in gardens for their very early, yellow flowers. They do have weak branches though, which are often damaged by heavy snow loads. ''Corylopsis'' prefers to grow in semi-shade or shade, protected from strong winds. It grows best on humus-rich soils. The sweetly scented flowering branches keep well in a vase. ''Corylopsis'' also makes good bonsai plants, especially ''C. pauciflora''.

==Maintenance==

'''''Erythronium americanum''''' ('''Trout lily''', '''Yellow trout lily''') is a plant native to woodlands in Eastern North America.

==Description==
Trout lilies are low-growing, colonizing plants with simple, spotted leaves and basal yellow flowers on short stems. The foliage is ephemeral in midsummer, dying back fully by late summer.

==Growing Conditions==
Trout lilies grow best in deep, moist, but well drained soils in deciduous shade. The foliage emerges in late winter, followed by early spring flowers. 

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Among magic-users, the plant is known as Adder's tongue, American Adder's tongue, Serpent's tongue and Adder's mouth.  It is used in healing magic.  A practitioner soaks the plant in cold water and applies it to a wound or bruise until the spot grows warm, then buries the wet herb in muddy ground.  The wound is believed to be cured by this procedure.

Among magic users, Adder's tongue is associated with the planet Venus and the feminine spirit.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:TroutLillyGadsnCo2003.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dense patch of ''Erythronium americanum'', Gadsden Co. [[Florida]]]]
This plant can be difficult in the garden, due to its slow growth and ephemeral nature. The roots are surprisingly deep as well, making transplanting difficult. They do not tolerate heavy foot traffic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Fluid mechanics is the study of how fluids flow.

A fluid is simply a liquid or a gas, or more precisely, a substance that deforms continuously when subjected to a tangential or shear stress, however small the shear stress may be. This means that some materials, such as amorphous solids, colloidal suspensions and gelatinous materials, while not being completely liquids or gases, are fluids so the general theories of fluid mechanics can be applied to them. However, these substances are not commonly studied at introductory fluid mechanics.

Fluid mechanics is a subdivision of continuum mechanics. This means that fluids will be considered as being able to be infinitely divisible, and not as collections of atoms or molecules.

== Fluid Properties ==
In addition to the properties like mass, velocity, and pressure usually considered in physical problems, the following are the basic properties of a fluid:

=== Density ===
The density of a fluid is defined as the mass per unit volume of the fluid.

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac {m}{V}\ &lt;/math&gt;


=== Viscosity ===
Viscosity (represented by &amp;mu;) is a material property, unique to fluids, that measures the fluid's resistance to flow. Though this is a property of the fluid, its effect is understood only when the fluid is in motion. 
When different elements move with different velocities, then the each element tries to drag its neighboring elements along with it. 
Thus shear stress can be identified between fluid elements of different velocities. 

[[Image:Laminar_shear_flow.png‎|frame|center|Velocity gradient in laminar shear flow]]

The relationship between the shear stress and the velocity field was studied by Isaac Newton and he proposed that the shear stresses are directly proportional to the velocity gradient. 
&lt;math&gt;\tau = \mu \frac{\partial u} {\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

The constant of proportionality is called the coefficient of dynamic viscosity. 

Another coefficient, known as the kinematic viscosity is defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity and density. 
&lt;math&gt; \nu = \mu / \rho &lt;/math&gt;


=== Reynolds Number ===

There are several dimensionless parameters that are important in fluid dynamics.
''Reynolds number'' (after Osborne Reynolds, 1842-1912) is an important parameter in the study of fluid flows. Physically it is the ratio between inertial and viscous forces.
The value of Reynolds number determines the kind of flow of the fluid.

&lt;math&gt;
  Re = \frac{\rho V L}{\mu} = \frac{VL}{\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;rho;''(rho) is the density, ''&amp;mu;''(mu) is the viscosity, ''V'' is the velocity of the flow, and ''L'' is the dimension representing length for the flow.
Additionally, we define a parameter ''&amp;nu;''(nu) as the ''kinematic viscosity''.

Low ''Re'' indicates creeping flow, medium ''Re'' is ''laminar'' flow, and high ''Re'' indicates ''turbulent'' flow.

Reynolds number can also be transformed to take account of different flow conditions. For example the reynolds number for flow within a pipe is expressed as

&lt;math&gt;
Re=\frac{\rho u d}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is the average fluid velocity within the pipe and ''d'' is the inside diameter of the pipe.

Application of dynamic forces (and the Reynolds number) to the real world: sky-diving, where friction forces equal the falling body's weight. (jjam)

=== Pathlines and Streamlines ===

The path which a fluid element traces out in space is called a ''pathline''. For steady non fluctuating flows where a pathline is followed continuously by a number of fluid elements , the pathline is called ''streamline''. A ''streamline'' is the imaginary line whose tangent gives the velocity of flow at all times if the flow is steady, however in an unsteady flow, the streamline is constantly changing and thus the tangent gives the velocity of an element at an instant of time.
A common practice in analysis is taking some of the walls of a control volume to be along streamlines.
Since there is no flow perpendicular to streamlines, only the flow across the other boundaries need be considered.

== Hydrostatics ==

The pressure distribution in a fluid under gravity is given by the relation ''dp/dz = &amp;minus;&amp;rho;g'' where ''dz'' is the change in the direction of the gravitational field (usually in the vertical direction).
Note that it is quite straightforward to get the relations for arbitrary fields too, for instance, the pseudo field due to rotation.

The pressure in a fluid acts equally in all directions.
When it comes in contact with a surface, the force due to pressure acts normal to the surface.
The force on a small area ''dA'' is given by ''p dA'' where the force is in the direction normal to ''dA''.
The total force on the area ''A'' is given by the vector sum of all these infinitesimal forces.

== Control Volume Analysis ==

A fluid dynamic system can be analysed using a ''control volume'', which is an imaginary surface enclosing a volume of interest.
The control volume can be fixed or moving, and it can be rigid or deformable.
Thus, we will have to write the most general case of the laws of mechanics to deal with control volumes.

The first equation we can write is the conservation of mass over time.
Consider a system where mass flow is given by ''dm/dt'', where ''m'' is the mass of the system.
We have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \dot m = \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA
&lt;/math&gt;

For steady flow, we have 

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

And for incompressible flow, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

If we consider flow through a tube, we have, for steady flow,

&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_1A_1V_1 = \rho_2A_2V_2
&lt;/math&gt;

and for incompressible steady flow,  ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Law of conservation of momentum as applied to a control volume states that

&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\rho}
  \right) + \int_{CS} \mathbf{V}\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the velocity vector and ''n'' is the unit vector normal to the control surface at that point.

Law of Conservation of Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics)

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf{W}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \right) + \int_{CS} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the energy per unit mass.

=== Bernoulli's Equation ===

''Bernoulli's equation'' considers frictionless flow along a streamline.

For steady, incompressible flow along a streamline, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{V^2}{2} + gz = constant
&lt;/math&gt;

We see that Bernoulli's equation is just the law of conservation of energy without the heat transfer and work.

It may seem that Bernoulli's equation can only be applied in a very limited set of situations, as it requires ideal conditions.
However, since the equation applies to streamlines, we can consider a streamline near the area of interest where it is satisfied, and it might still give good results, ''i.e.'', you don't need a control volume for the actual analysis (although one is used in the derivation of the equation).

==== Energy in terms of Head ====

Bernoulli's equation can be recast as

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{p}{\rho g} + \frac{V^2}{2g} + z = constant
&lt;/math&gt;

This constant can be called head of the water, and is a representation of the amount of work that can be extracted from it.
For example, for water in a dam, at the inlet of the penstock, the pressure is high, but the velocity is low, while at the outlet, the pressure is low (atmospheric) while the velocity is high.
The value of head calculated above remains constant (ignoring frictional losses).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
In most languages, &quot;complex&quot; means some sort of structured data type.  In Fortran, there are no structures of that ilk.  There are however, what we call in mathematics, &quot;complex numbers&quot;.  A complex number has a real and an imaginary component.  In Fortran, complex numbers are stored as a pair of real numbers (real part first, followed by the imaginary part), or a pair of double-precision numbers.

For something resembling structures, see Common Blocks.

==Declaration==
The standard way to declare a complex number is simply using the &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; statement:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 COMPLEX myVariable, anotherVariable, anArray(2,3)
&lt;/source&gt;
This is equivalent on most systems to specifying a length of 8 (two 4-byte Reals):
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 COMPLEX*8 myVariable, anotherVariable, anArray(2,3)
&lt;/source&gt;
If you want double-precision complex numbers, you're pretty much stuck with specifying a precision, and hoping that the compiler likes that format.  Here's where portability comes in:  If, for instance, the machine has floating point types of lengths 4, 8, and 16, and I specify a complex length of 8, 16, or 32, I'm likely to get a pair of floating point numbers at the size I expect.  If, however, I specify a length of some other value, for instance, 10, then I'm likely to get a pair of 4s or 8s, depending on what the compiler likes to do.  So, in general, to get the values as double-precision, I'd code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 COMPLEX*16 myVariable, anotherVariable, anArray(2,3)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Constants and Expressions==
Complex constants are specified as &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;, a real value, a comma, another real value, and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.  Some examples are 1 as &lt;code&gt;(1.0,0.0)&lt;/code&gt;, ''i'' as &lt;code&gt;(0.0,1.0)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2-3''i'' as (2.0,-3.0)&lt;/code&gt;, and 1000000000''i'' as &lt;code&gt;(0.0,1.0E+09)&lt;/code&gt;.  The same constants can be coded as double-precision complex constants by the simple expedient of using a &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; in the exponent.  Thus, the same constants can be coded in double-precision using &lt;code&gt;(1.0D+00,0.0D+00)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(0.0D+00,1.0D+00)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(2.0D+00,-3.0D+00)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;(0.0D+00,1.0D+09)&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Note: This notation cannot be used with variables. For example, &lt;code&gt;(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; is invalid. To convert real variables to complex, use the &lt;code&gt;CMPLX&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 CMPLX(a, b)
&lt;/source&gt;

Any expression involving complex numbers and other numbers is promoted to complex.

==Operators and Functions==
All of the arithmetic operators can take a complex number on either side.

Care must be taken in using function calls that might cause an error.  For instance, taking the square root of the real number -1 (coded as &lt;code&gt;-1.0&lt;/code&gt;) will result in an error, because -1 is outside of the domain of real square root.  Taking the square root of the complex number -1 (coded as &lt;code&gt;(-1.0,0.0)&lt;/code&gt;) is OK, because -1 is in the domain of complex square root.

== [[Control Systems]] ==

Hello Supermackin, welcome to wikibooks! I saw your edit to the [[Control Systems]] book, and I am glad: It's a good book that has been developing slowly because there are so few people with enough knowledge in the area to contribute to it. I'm an engineering graduate student myself, EE not Aerospace. Let me know if you need any help, or if you have any questions. Good luck, and happy editing! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:29, 11 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Most Fortran programs use self-contained data, without structures, and without much in the way of shared, structured data.  However, it is possible to share data, in structured and unstructured ways, using common blocks.  There's also typically very little memory management going on in a Fortran program.  Until the most recent versions, allocated storage wasn't even possible.

==Common Blocks==
A common block is Fortran's way of using shared, common storage.  In its simplest form, a common block is a way of defining global memory.  Be careful, though.  In most languages, each item in common memory is shared as a globally known name separately.  In Fortran, however, the common block is a shared thing.  I'll show several examples, but each example will share &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;anotherInteger&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;myArray&lt;/code&gt;, a 10x10 array of real numbers.

In C, for instance, I can define the shared memory using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 int i;
 int anotherInteger;
 float myArray[10][10];
&lt;/source&gt;
and use these data elsewhere with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 extern float myArray[10][10];
 extern int i;
 extern int anotherInteger;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that one module declares the storage, and another uses the storage.  Also note that the definitions and usages are not in the same order.  This is because in C, as in most languages, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;anotherInteger&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;myArray&lt;/code&gt; are all shared items.  Not so in Fortran.  In Fortran, all routines sharing this storage would have a definition something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 COMMON i, anotherInteger, myArray
 INTEGER anotherInteger
 REAL myArray(10,10)
&lt;/source&gt;
This common block is stored as a block of data, as a linkable named structure.  The only problem is that we don't know its name.  Various compilers will give various names to this block.  In some systems, the block actually doesn't have a name.  We can avoid this problem by giving the structure a name.  For instance,
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 COMMON/myBlock/ i, anotherInteger, myArray
 INTEGER anotherInteger
 REAL myArray(10,10)
&lt;/source&gt;
Using this form, two different Fortran programs can identify the same area of storage and share it, without having to know the structure of all shared storage.  Also using this format, a C or other program could share the storage.  For instance, a C program wanting to share this storage would declare the same storage as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 extern struct {
    int i;
    int anotherInteger;
    float myArray[10][10];
 } myBlock;
&lt;/source&gt;
In the above example, having the &lt;code&gt;myBlock&lt;/code&gt; names match is critical, as well as having the types, sizes, and order match.  However, having the names internally match is not since these names are known only locally.  Also note that in the above example, Fortran's &lt;code&gt;myArray(i,j)&lt;/code&gt; matches C's &lt;code&gt;myBlock.myArray[j][i]&lt;/code&gt;.

==Memory Management==
You can declare an array to have a known number of dimensions, but an unknown size using allocation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 REAL, DIMENSION(:,:), ALLOCATABLE :: myArray
 ...
 ALLOCATE(myArray(10,10))
 ...
 DEALLOCATE(myArray)
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also declare something as a pointer:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 REAL, DIMENSION(:,:), POINTER :: somePointer
 ...
 ALLOCATE(somePointer(10,10))
 ...
 DEALLOCATE(somePointer)
&lt;/source&gt;
In archaic versions of Fortran (77 and before), you'd just have a big static array and use whatever portion of it you need.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types==
Fortran types map quite well to intrinsic types in other compiled languages.  The following is a table of Fortran-to-C types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 Fortran            C
 =======            =
 COMMON             extern struct
 INTEGER*1          signed char
 INTEGER*2          short
 INTEGER*4          long
 INTEGER*8          long long
 INTEGER            int
 REAL               float
 REAL*4             float
 REAL*8             double
 REAL*16            long double
 LOGICAL            int
 LOGICAL*n          char [n]
 CHARACTER*n        char [n]
 DOUBLE PRECISION   double
 COMPLEX            float [2]
 COMPLEX*8          float [2]
 COMPLEX*16         double [2]
 COMPLEX*32         long double [2]
&lt;/source&gt;

==Arrays==
In Fortran, the leftmost array subscript changes the fastest, not the slowest, so the item following x(1,1) is x(2,1), not x(1,2).
By default the index of the first element of an array is 1, not 0.

==Global Storage==
See the [[Fortran/memory_management#Common_Blocks|Common Blocks]] section.

==Subroutine and Function Calls==
Many languages push their arguments onto the stack, some as constants and some as addresses.  In most compilers, Fortran will compile a block of pointers to variables and constants, and push the address of that block.  So, if we had a Fortran procedure defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 SUBROUTINE mySub(i, j, x)
&lt;/source&gt;
then the C definition would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 struct mySubArgs {
    int *i;
    int *j;
    float *x;
 } mySubArgs = {&amp;i, &amp;j, &amp;x};
 void mySub(mySubArgs*);
&lt;/source&gt;
The C code could call the routine as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 mySub(&amp;mySubArgs);
&lt;/source&gt;

==The PL/1 Special Case==
In PL/1, you can define an external common block, subroutine, or procedure to be of type FORTRAN.  When you do this, everything, down to subscript order, will be handled for you.  Likewise, you can define a PL/1 item, such as a subroutine, to be of type FORTRAN, and it will then be callable by Fortran using Fortran's calling conventions.

== Introduction ==

Hello, world.

My name is Scott, and I'm here mainly to work on the following book:

[[Game Design and Programming]]

Game programming is my specialty, and I love helping other people learn. I know it's very tough to get started, because there aren't many good free resources for game development, but I hope in time this WikiBook will be the best resource available!

As for the book itself, I'm not sure how many folks are actively working on it, but I plan to take some heavy action on it before anyone decides to delete it. So, if you object to anything I do, please let me know!

=== Interests ===
* Cross-platform Game Programming
* Game Engine design
* Data abstraction for games
* Fresh Networking ideas
* Camera work!
*: This especially! Ever think that a game could have been so much better, if only the camera didn't suck? It is very difficult to get the camera to be in the right place at the right time, with many objects the user could want to focus on. I hope to bring some new and fresh camera ideas to games during my career.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fortran is not real big on catching errors.  Typically in an error situation, your program will stop, and you'll get an error message.  The only exception to this is that at the end of &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statements' parenthesized control list, you can add &lt;code&gt;, ERR=''lineNumber''&lt;/code&gt; to determine which line to jump to in the event of an error.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though PLE differ from case by case and almost the process has no end， are there some practical methods or tips for  the novice begin to establish of his PLE? Here some methods and suggestions.

'''1. Necessary tools'''

There are many social tools for establishing PLE， how we make a selection？ Here some tools are necessary.

(1) Social bookmark

Why we need to use the social bookmark such as [http://del.icio.us del.icio.us]?

With the development of WEB2.0, the website numbers are going up exponentially , which brings the problem for an individual how to manage the URL resources effectively and efficiently. 

Social bookmark provides a new way to make use of URL resources . Unlike the tradition way we just store some useful URLs to the favorite folder by web browser to our own computer， through using social bookmark, we can find more related useful URL resources and we have more opportunities to make connection with other people we are interested in.

As an example, here is the course announcement &quot;[http://php.indiana.edu/~cjbonk/Syllabus_R685_Fall_of_2007.htm The Web 2.0 and Participatory e-Learning]&quot; released by professor Curt Bonk, if you collect this URL by social bookmark [http://del.icio.us del.icio.us], then you can find there are [http://del.icio.us/url/4a541afc4f964c70e08c510d508b788e so many people] share the same interests with you, and further you can add some people to your network in del.icio.us. In this way , you can establish your own PLE step by step.

(2)RSS Reader

Why we need to use the RSS reader such as [http://www.blogline.com Blogline] or [http://www.google.com/reader Google reader]?

The content of WEB2.0 is mainly generated by users, which also brings the problem for an individual  how to get update content in time . If we still behave in the traditional way that is visiting different websites one by one through web browser, we couldn't afford the time cost. In additional, you are not sure which website has been updated .  

RSS reader can help to solve this problem. You just need to add the rss feed of the website which you are interested in to your RSS reader. You get update information from different websites just by checking your RSS reader. In this way , you not only can save much time, but also you have the ability to read more information from more different websites.

RSS reader is a necessary tool for an individual to establish his PLE.

(3)Tagging

From a technical perspective, it is tag which makes WEB2.0 different from WEB1.0. There need a new way to organize the content which generated by different users. The new way is tag. In taxonomy term , it is called folksonomy. 

By tagging his content, an individual not only adapts a new way to organize his own content ,but also adapts a new way to make connnection with other people.

During the search using tag , not only you can find many related contents which you want to find, but also you can find some persons who share the same interests with you.

So, tagging is an important behave during the process of establish one's own PLE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mock HIV Test and Virtual ELISA for Lupus ==

'''TEACHING OBJECTIVE:''' 
* to illustrate the use of antibodies in the diagnostic ELISA test for HIV and Lupus.  
&lt;BR&gt;

'''TASK OUTCOMES:''' 
* By the end of this activity, students will be able to: 
a. Follow a simplified ELISA test to determine which 'patients' are HIV positive. 

b. Follow a detailed virtual lab protocol for the ELISA test for lupus. 

c. Outline the use of antibodies in diagnostic medicine. 

&lt;BR&gt;

'''TIME REQUIRED:''' 
* 60-90 minutes
&lt;BR&gt;
----

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 
&lt;BR&gt;
The ELISA test detects antibodies to a pathogen in blood serum and shows a positive result with a colour change. 
Dilutions of blood serum allow levels of antibodies (and thus the development of the disease) to be estimated. 
In this activity, students will carry out a simple test on mock serum samples and will go through all the steps of the ELISA in the virtual lab activity from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution. 

'''ESSENTIAL LINKS'''
* [http://sciencevideos.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/hhmi-biointeractive-teach-ahead-of-the-textbook/ Description and worksheet] for the HHMI virtual lab. 
* [http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/vlabs/immunology/index.html Direct Link to HHMI Immunology Lab Activity]




'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' 
* Virtual lab: worksheet and internet link to site above (requires Flash)
* Mock HIV Test (for each pair/ group): 
** Lead nitrate and potassium iodide solutions
** Dimple tray (min 11 wells)
** 11 x 100ml volumetric flasks, marked A-1:2 A-1:10 A-1:100; B-1:2 B-1:10 B-1:100; C-1:2 C-1:10 C-1:100; Positive Control; Negative Control; HRP
** A set of clean dropping pipettes



'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' 
* Carry out the mock HIV test first, using it as a chance to explain the method of the ELISA. 
* Follow this up with the virtual lab and the worksheet for students to add depth to their knowledge. 
&lt;BR&gt;
'''Prac Set Up:'''
* As outlined in the image 'setup'. 
* Each group also needs a flask containing 20ml Lead nitrate. Label this 'HRP' (for anti-human antibody). 

Instructions
* Explain that serum samples have been collected and diluted and are presented in the flasks. the ELISA plate (dimple tray) has been coated with HIV antigen. 
* Add a few drops of 'serum' to the appropriate wells. Take care not to contaminate them. 
* Explain at this point that they would normally be washed in buffer, to remove all traces of unattached antibodies. 
* To each of the wells, add a few drops of 'HRP. If antibodies are present, a reaction occurs causing a colour change. 
* Students record and analyse their results: 

Who is positive/ negative/ needs more testing? 


'''SAFETY/ RISK ASSESSMENT'''
* eye protection for KI and PbNO3
* wash all equipment thoroughly and do not ingest. 
* we aren't using real HIV, so don't worry.

Patient A tests negative. 
Patient B tests positive at high concentrations of serum (low dilutions), but negative at 1:100. They might need further tests or it may suggest early-stage HIV. 
Patient C tests positive at all dilutions. 
If the positive control does not turn yellow, results show false-negatives. 
If the negative control does turn yellow, results show false-postives (possibly due to contamination)

'''Red Deadnettle''' (''Lamium purpureum'') is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. Though superficially similar to a nettle in appearance, it is not related and does not sting, hence the name &quot;deadnettle&quot;. Outside of its native range, it is a common weed of cultivated areas; it is listed as an invasive species in some parts of North America.

==Description==
It grows to 5-20 cm (rarely 30 cm) in height. The leaves are green at the bottom and shade to purplish at the top; they are 2-4 cm long and broad, with a 1-2 cm petiole (leaf stalk), and wavy to serrated margins. It is often found alongside Henbit Deadnettle (''[[../Lamium amplexicaule/]]''), which is easily mistaken for it since they both have similar looking leaves and similar bright purple flowers; they can be distinguished by the stalked leaves of Red Deadnettle on the flower stem, compared to the unstalked leaves of Henbit Deadnettle.

The flowers are bright red-purple, and may be produced throughout the year, including mild weather in winter. This allows bees to gather its nectar for food when few other nectar sources are available. It is also a prominent source of pollen for bees in March/April (in UK), when bees need the pollen as protein to build up their nest.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Young plants have edible tops and leaves, good in salads or in stirfry as a spring vegetable. If finely chopped it can also be used in sauces.

'''''Acer saccharum''''' ('''Sugar Maple''') is a species of maple native to the hardwood forests of northeastern North America, from Nova Scotia west to southern Ontario, and south to Georgia and Texas.&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?1227 ''Acer saccharum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Autumn leaves (pantone).jpg|left|thumb|Autumn Color Change]]
[[Image:Shadedsugar.JPG|left|thumb|A shaded specimen turns bright yellow]]
It is a deciduous tree normally reaching heights of 25–35 m tall,&lt;ref name=nopd&gt;Northern Ontario Plant Database: [http://www.northernontarioflora.ca/description.cfm?speciesid=1000053 ''Acer saccharum'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obs&gt;Oklahoma Biological Survey: [http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/shrub/acsa3.htm ''Acer saccharum'']&lt;/ref&gt; and exceptionally up to 45 m (150 feet) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativetreesociety.org/fieldtrips/gsmnp/gsmnp_tall_trees.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. The leaves are deciduous, 8-15 cm long and equally wide with five palmate lobes. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the Silver Maple, however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow through orange to fluorescent red-orange. The leaf buds are pointy and brown colored. The recent years growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown.

The flowers are in corymbs of 5-10 together, yellow-green and without petals; flowering occurs in early spring after 30-55 growing degree days. The fruit is a double samara with two winged seeds, the seeds are globose, 7-10 mm diameter, the wing 2-3 cm long. The seeds fall from the tree in autumn.

It is closely related to the Black Maple, which is sometimes included in this species but sometimes separated as Acer nigrum. The western American Bigtooth Maple (Acer grandidentatum) is also treated as a variety or subspecies of Sugar Maple by some botanists.

The Sugar Maple is also often confused with the Norway Maple, though they are not closely related within the genus. The Sugar Maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (the Norway Maple has white sap), brown sharp-tipped buds (the Norway Maple has blunt green or reddish purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway Maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the Sugar Maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway Maple.

==Ecology==
The Sugar Maple is an immensely important species to the ecology of many forests in North America. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of many forest types.  It often forms associations with the [[American Beech]], forming the beech-maple forest type, common in northern areas. Other associations include Sugar Maple-[[Yellow Birch]] (which is most important beyond the northern limit of beech), Sugar Maple-[[Tilia americana|American Basswood]], Sugar Maple-[[White Ash]] and Sugar Maple-[[Ostrya|Ironwood]]-[[Red Oak]]. Sugar Maples engage in [[hydraulic lift]], drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers.  This not only benefits the tree itself but also many other plants growing around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1n685611216p3l0/ Hydraulic lift and its influence on the water content of the rhizosphere: an example from sugar maple, Acer saccharum]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sugar Maple Acer saccharum Trunk base 3264px.jpg|right|thumb|The bark of the Sugar Maple]]
Sugar Maple is among the most [[Shade tolerance|shade tolerant]] of large deciduous trees.  Among North American maples its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the [[Striped Maple]], a smaller tree.  Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. The sugar maple can grow comfortably in any type of soil, except sand.

Human influences have contributed to the decline of the Sugar Maple in many regions.  Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over.  The Sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. [[Acid rain]] and [[soil acidification]] are some of the primary contributing factors to [[maple decline]].   Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads has decimated the sugar maple's role as a &quot;street-front&quot; tree. 

In some parts of eastern North America, particularly near urbanized areas, the Sugar Maple is being displaced by the [[Acer platanoides|Norway Maple]]. The Norway Maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions resulting in the Sugar Maple's replacement in those areas heavily disturbed by human activities.

==Conservation==
The sugar maple is widespread, and is considered secure, except at the edges of its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Acer saccharum| url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=acer+saccharum| work=NatureServe Explorer| accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation and uses==
The Sugar Maple is one of the most important [[Trees of Canada|Canadian trees]], being (with [[Black Maple]]) the major source of sap for making [[maple syrup]]; Sugar Maple being regarded as slightly better. Many maples can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but none of the others are as good as these two.

The [[wood]] is one of the hardest of the maples, and is prized for furniture and flooring. [[Bowling]] alleys and bowling pins are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple. Trees with wavy wood grain, which can occur in curly, quilted and &quot;[[birdseye maple]]&quot; form, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for basketball courts, including the floors used by the NBA, and it is a popular wood for baseball bats, along with [[White Ash|white ash]].

The Sugar Maple is a favorite street and garden tree, because it is easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color; however, its intolerance of pollution and compacted soils common to inner city conditions make it a frequent victim of [[maple decline]]. It also has some of the most dense shade to be found in shade trees. The shade and the shallow, fibrous [[root]]s may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep well-drained [[loam]] is the best rooting medium, although Sugar Maple can grow well on sandy soil which does not become excessively dry. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support Sugar Maple. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats. Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to [[boron]].

'''''Salix discolor''''' ('''American Pussy Willow'''&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?102704 ''Salix discolor'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a species of willow native to North America, one of two species commonly called Pussy Willow.

It is native to the northern forests and wetlands of Canada (British Columbia east to Newfoundland) and the northeastern contiguous United States (Idaho south to Wyoming, and east to Maine and Maryland).&lt;ref name=grin/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc&gt;Plants of British Columbia: [http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Salix+discolor ''Salix discolor'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boreal&gt;Borealforests: [http://www.borealforest.org/shrubs/shrub44.htm ''Salix discolor'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is a weak-wooded deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 6 m tall, with brown shoots. The leaves are oval, 3-14 cm long and 1-3.5 cm broad, green above and downy grey-white beneath. The flowers are soft silky silvery catkins, borne in early spring before the new leaves appear, with the male and female catkins on different plants (dioecious); the male catkins mature yellow at pollen release. The fruit is a small capsule 7-12 mm long containing numerous minute seeds embedded in cottony down.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt;&lt;ref name=boreal/&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
As with the closely related ''[[../Salix caprea/]]'' (European Pussy Willow), it is also often grown for cut flowers. 

Like other willows, it contains salicin, and was used by Native Americans as a painkiller.&lt;ref name=boreal/&gt;

'''Eastern Skunk Cabbage''', '''Clumpfoot Cabbage''', '''Foetid Pothos''', '''Meadow Cabbage''', '''Polecat Weed''', '''Skunk Cabbage''', or '''Swamp Cabbage''' ''(Symplocarpus foetidus)'', commonly known as simply Skunk Cabbage, is a low growing, foul smelling plant that prefers wetlands. It can be found naturally in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia and southern Quebec west to Minnesota, and south to North Carolina and Tennessee, and also in northeastern Asia, in eastern Siberia, northeastern China and Japan. It is the only species in the genus, although the genus Lysichiton is similar. Skunk cabbage is protected as a state endangered plant in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?keywordquery=Symplocarpus+foetidus&amp;mode=sciname&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0 USDA PLANTS Database: S. foetidus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The leaves are large, 40-55 cm long and 30-40 cm broad. It flowers early in the year; the flowers are produced in a 5-10 cm long spadix contained within a spathe, 10-15 cm tall and mottled purple in colour. It flowers in the early spring, when only the flowers are visible above the mud, with the stems buried below and the leaves emerging later. The rhizome is often 30 cm thick.

Its name is derived from its odor, which is rather mild as long as the plant remains intact. To fully appreciate why the plant is so named, one need only tear off a fresh leaf, releasing a pungent odor. While not considered edible, the plant is not poisonous to the touch. Though unpleasant, the smell is not harmful. The foul odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies, stoneflies, and bees. The odor in the leaves may also serve to discourage large animals from disturbing or damaging this plant which grows in soft wetland soils.

Skunk cabbage is notable for its ability to produce heat of up to 15-35° C above air temperature by cyanide resistant cellular respiration in order to melt its way through frozen ground,&lt;ref&gt;Thorington, Katherine K.: &quot;Pollination and Fruiting Success in the Eastern Skunk Cabbage&quot;, The Journal of Biospheric Science , vol 1 no. 1 April 1999, accessed March 4, 2007, &lt;http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/mmcmenam/journal.html&lt;/ref&gt; placing it among a small group of plants exhibiting thermogenesis. Although flowering whilst there is still snow and ice on the ground it is successfully pollinated by early insects that also emerge at this time. Some studies suggest that beyond allowing the plant to grow in icy soil, the heat it produces may help to spread its odor in the air. Carrion-feeding insects that are attracted by the scent may be doubly encouraged to enter the spathe because it is warmer than the surrounding air, fueling pollination. &lt;ref&gt;Marinelli, Janet: &quot;Turning Up the Heat on Your Property&quot;, Backyard Habitat - National Wildlife Magazine, vol. 45 no. 1 Dec/Jan 2007, accessed March 3, 2007, &lt;http://www.nwf.org/nationalwildlife/article.cfm?issueID=112&amp;articleID=1418&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Symplocarpus foetidus 003.JPG|left|thumb|Foliage]]
Eastern Skunk Cabbage has contractile roots which contract after growing into the earth. This pulls the stem of the plant deeper into the mud, so that the plant in effect grows downward, not upward. Each year, the plant grows deeper into the earth, so that older plants are practically impossible to dig up. It is thought possible that it may be able to live for hundreds of years. They reproduce by hard, pea-sized seeds which fall in the mud and are carried away by animals or by floods.

==Growing Conditions==
Does best in true wetlands, but can survive in moist soils. Full sun to fairly dense shade.

==Uses==
In the 19th century the U. S. Pharmacopoeia listed eastern skunk cabbage as the drug &quot;dracontium&quot;. It was used in the treatment of respiratory diseases, nervous disorders, rheumatism, and dropsy. In North America and Europe, skunk cabbage is occasionally cultivated in water gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=200027331 Flora of North America: S. foetidus]&lt;/ref&gt; Skunk cabbage was used extensively as a medicinal plant, seasoning, and magical talisman by various tribes of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Symplocarpus+foetidus Dr. Moerman's Native American Ethnobotanical Database: S. foetidus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Easily propagated by division, though the plant is quite aromatic in the underground parts.

==Pests and Diseases==
Leaf blights are frequent but not fatal.

'''''Acer japonicum''''' ('''Downy Japanese Maple''' or '''Fullmoon Maple'''; Japanese: ハウチワカエデ ''hauchiwakaede'') is a species of maple native to Japan, on Honshū, Hokkaidō, Kyūshū (Nagasaki Prefecture), and also southern Korea.&lt;ref name=kanagawa&gt;Kanagawa Prefecture trees and shrubs: [http://www.geocities.jp/greensv88/jumoku-zz-hauchiwakaede.htm ''Acer japonicum''] (in Japanese; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://www.geocities.jp/greensv88/jumoku-zz-hauchiwakaede.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jm&gt;Japanese maples: [http://ganshuku.cool.ne.jp/22hautiwa.html ''Acer japonicum''] (in Japanese; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://ganshuku.cool.ne.jp/22hautiwa.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a small deciduous tree growing to 5–10 m (rarely 15 m) tall, with a trunk up to 40 cm diameter. The bark is smooth on young trees, becoming rough and scaly on old trees. The shoots are slender, and thinly downy with whitish hairs. The leaves are rounded, 7-15 cm diameter with 9–13 (rarely 7) serrate lobes incised to half or less of the diameter of the leaf; they are downy at first with white hairs, the hairs mostly lost by late summer except on the veins and the underside of the leaf; the petiole is 2–4 cm long and hairy. In autumn, the leaves turn bright orange to dark red. The flowers are 1 cm diameter, dark purplish-red with five sepals and petals; they are produced 10–15 together in drooping corymbs in early spring as the leaves start to open. The fruit is a paired samara with the nutlets 7 mm diameter with a 20–25 mm wing, hanging under the leaves.&lt;ref name=kanagawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jm/&gt;&lt;ref name=kanon&gt;Kanon tree book: [http://kanon101.cool.ne.jp/foto_sinrin/K_kaede/hautiwa_kaede/hautiwa_kaede.htm ''Acer japonicum''] (in Japanese; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://kanon101.cool.ne.jp/foto_sinrin/K_kaede/hautiwa_kaede/hautiwa_kaede.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gelderen&gt;van Gelderen, C. J. &amp; van Gelderen, D. M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-220013-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The closely related species ''[[../Acer shirasawanum/]]'' (Japanese, オオイタヤメイゲツ ''ooitayameigetsu'') from southern Japan is sometimes included as a subspecies of ''A. japonicum''.&lt;ref name=gelderen/&gt; It is distinct in its hairless shoots, and usually smaller leaves. Another related species, ''[[../Acer sieboldianum/]]'' (Japanese: コハウチワカエデ ''kohauchiwakaede''), is best distinguished by its yellow (not red) flowers, and smooth bark even on old trees. It is more easily distinguished from ''[[../Acer palmatum/]]'', as that species rarely has leaves with more than seven lobes.&lt;ref name=ij&gt;Infoseek Japan: [http://nosaku.hp.infoseek.co.jp/2000/s001114a.html Maples] (in Japanese; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://nosaku.hp.infoseek.co.jp/2000/s001114a.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;

===Cultivation===
''A. japonicum'' is frequently cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions of Europe, North America, and elsewhere, though much less commonly than ''A. palmatum''. In cultivation, it is often only a shrubby tree with multiple trunks joining at ground-level.&lt;ref name=gelderen/&gt;.

Its preferred growing conditions are similar to those of ''A. palmatum'', but it is sometimes considered more tolerant of cold, especially compared to the more delicate cultivars of the latter.&lt;ref name=gelderen/&gt;

Numerous cultivars have been selected, some of which have their own common names (e.g. &quot;Grape-leaf maple&quot; for ''A. japonicum'' 'Vitifolium'). Other popular cultivars are 'Aconitifolium' which has deeply incised leaves, and 'Green Cascade', with drooping to pendulous branches. Because of their variation from the wild species, some cultivars are difficult to assign to species, and they have often been mis-labeled as cultivars of the other related species; notably 'Aureum' has commonly been cited as a cultivar of ''A. japonicum'', but is actually derived from ''A. shirasawanum''.&lt;ref name=gelderen/&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultivars of this maple are found in almost every maple collection including [[../Esveld Aceretum/]] (Boskoop, Netherlands) and the large ''Acer'' section of [[../Arnold Arboretum/]] (Boston, Massachusetts). They are also common in more general collections of horticulture.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to export your beautiful terrain to a heightmap that can be used in most 3D graphics engines.  The benefit to doing this as opposed to just exporting your mesh is that many engines have a special process for dealing with terrains as opposed to regular meshes where it divides the terrain up into different sections so that it can subdivide regions closer to the camera more for greater detail, and also cull (not render) regions outside the camera's field of view, saving precious processing time.  This structure is called an [[w:Oct_tree|oct tree]] and is a highly optimized way to render large meshes such as terrains.

Before I begin, I must give credit to the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Tutorials/Creating_a_Heightmap_from_a_Plane Creating a Heightmap from a Plane] tutorial on the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Blender wiki].  This is how I learned to do this trick, and most of what I will cover came from this tutorial.  I'm simply including it here with the other landscaping tutorials I've written for convenience.

==A Word About Heightmaps==
I will briefly cover what a heightmap is and how it's useful for those who may not know.  If you are familiar with heightmaps, you can skip ahead to the next section.

[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-ExampleHeightmap.jpg|right|200px|An example of a heightmap]]
A heightmap is a grayscale image that uses various shades of gray to represent different elevations across a map.  Since the images are 8-bit (with the exception of some RAW formats that are 16-bit), you have 256 different shades of gray, ranging from pure black (0) to pure white (255).  Black represents the lowest elevation on the map, while white represents the highest.  Many 3D graphics engines already have functions to read in a heightmap and generate terrain from it.  The way it does this is it creates a grid of vertices (like we are going to do in Blender in just a moment), and uses the heightmap to determine the elevation of each point on the grid.  The more intense the pixel color (the closer it is to white), the higher the elevation of that vertex.  In most cases, if the resolution of the heightmap is smaller than the resolution of the terrain, the engine will interpolate the vertices in between those set by the heightmap.  For example, if your heightmap is 256x256 and your terrain is 1024x1024, your heightmap will determine the elevation of every fourth vertex, and the three in between will be interpolated.

Note that these values do not represent the absolute height of any given pixel, but rather the height relative to the rest of the map.  That is, your heightmap does not represent a landscape with altitudes ranging from 0 to 256.  When importing a heightmap, you can specify the minimum and maximum altitudes for the map, and the whole thing gets scaled.  For example, suppose you decide the minimum is 1000 feet, and the maximum is 5000 feet.  When the terrain is rendered, black pixels will represent 1000, white pixels will represent 5000, and a pixel that is exactly in between black and white (128) will represent 3000 feet (half of the sum of min and max).  This makes heightmaps relatively flexible.

Unfortunately, as you may have already noticed, there is a limitation of using heightmaps.  Since you only have 256 shades of gray, you only have 256 possible elevations.  This causes a problem.  No matter how precise your vertices may be in the mesh that you model, no matter how smooth you may have it looking, each point will get rounded off to an integer value between 0 and 255.  When used to render a terrain, this can cause a &quot;stair step&quot; effect as the terrain goes from one discrete elevation to the next instead of making a smooth transition.  But there are ways to avoid this, which I will cover later.

I apologize if you're scratching your head right now saying &quot;Huh?&quot;  For a further explanation and example, check the Wikipedia page on [[w:Heightmap|heightmaps]].

==Creating the Material==
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Exporting_as_a_Heightmap01.jpg|right|200px|The terrain that will generate the heightmap]]
To begin this tutorial, I will assume that you already have a landscape that you want to create a heightmap for.  If not, read my first tutorial, [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Landscape_Modeling_I:_Basic_Terrain|Landscape Modeling I: Basic Terrain]], to quickly create something.  '''WORD OF CAUTION'''!!!  If you've already created a landscape, try to remember the exact size of the plane that you used.  If you're about to make one, it's okay to scale the plane to have a larger surface to work with, but REMEMBER how much you scale it by.  This will make things easier later.  I recommend just working with the default 2x2 plane or grid and zooming in on it.  You may also want to backup your scene since we'll be changing a few things

To create the material we need, do the following steps:
* Remove any existing materials that may be applied to the terrain.
'''Note''': to remove a material, I think you need to go to the links and pipeline window in the shader section and click the little &quot;X&quot; underneath the words &quot;link to Object&quot;
* Add a new material in the Shading tab ('''F5''').
* Go to the Textures tab ('''F6''') and add a new texture.  This should be the only texture on your material.
* From the Texture Type drop down menu, select Blend.
* In the same window, find the Colors tab and select Colorband.  This will let us define the blend pattern, which by default fades from black with full transparency to a solid cyan.  Why cyan?  I have no idea.  It's an odd default.
* Select the black color by clicking on the left side of the colorband.  You should see a little black and white bar selected.
* Increase the Alpha all the way up to 1 by adjusting the slider labeled &quot;A&quot;.
* Select the cyan color and change this to a solid white.  
* What you have now should look like my colorband below.
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Exporting_as_a_Heightmap02.jpg|The blend colorband]]
* Return to the Materials tab (the red ball icon next to the cheese looking icon).
* In the Material pane, select the Shadeless option to disable lighting on the material.
* To the right, find the pane labeled Map Input.  In the bottom of this pane is a grid that by default reads:

'''X'''YZ&lt;br&gt;
X'''Y'''Z&lt;br&gt;
XY'''Z'''

* Set all three rows to '''Z''' so that the texture will map entirely to the Z coordinate.
* In the preview window to the left, if you select the sphere or cube you should see that it goes from black on the bottom to white on the top.  That's the effect we want for the terrain.  Remember, in a heightmap, black represents the lowest point and white the highest.
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Exporting_as_a_Heightmap03.jpg|Map the input to the z-axis and make the material Shadeless]]
* Finally, switch back to the Editing tab ('''F9''') and click the Set Smooth button to enable [[w:Gouraud_shading|Gouraud shading]] so that everything appears smooth.

==Setting up the Camera==
That's all we need to do for the terrain itself.  Now what we're going to do is setup the camera in such a way that when we render the scene we'll get an orthographic projection straight down on the terrain so that we can save it as our heightmap.

* If you still have any lights or cameras in the scene, delete them.
* Switch to the top view ('''NUM7''') and place the 3D cursor at the origin (0, 0, 0) by left clicking near the origin, hitting '''SHIFT+SKEY''' and selecting ''Cursor to Grid''.
* Add a new camera, ''Space-&gt;Add-&gt;Camera''.  This will add a new camera to the scene that is looking straight down.
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Exporting_as_a_Heightmap_04.jpg|right|200px|The camera needs to be above the terrain]]
* Switch to a side view ('''NUM1''' or '''NUM3''') and move the camera up the Z axis so that it is above the highest point in your terrain.  Even though the view is going to be orthographic, and therefore distance doesn't matter, the entire terrain still needs to be in front of the camera.
* Now, with the camera selected, go to the Editing tab ('''F9''') and select the &quot;Orthographic&quot; button.  This will change the camera to an orthographic projection which basically ignores the z-coordinate for all vertices (except for determining which pixels should be in front of others).  
* Just above the orthographic button is a value labeled &quot;Scale&quot;.  Remember earlier when I told you to remember how big your terrain is?  This is why.
* Change the Scale of the lens (default: 6) to match the size of your terrain.  If you left the plane the default size, this should be 2.  If you scaled the plane up by a factor of 20, as suggested in the &quot;Landscape Modeling I: Basic Terrain&quot; tutorial, this should be 40 (the plane is initially 2 units square).
* Now go to the scene tab ('''F10''') and under Format, change the SizeX and SizeY to be the size you want your heightmap to be.  For most graphics engines, this is required to be either a power of 2 (2^n) or one more than a power of 2 (2^n+1).  So try something like 256 (or 257 if you need it to be 2^n+1).
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Exporting_as_a_Heightmap_05.jpg|right|200px|What the terrain will look like from the camera view]]
* Now, if you switch to the camera view ('''NUM0''') you should see a &quot;flat&quot; square that completely fills the dotted box which represents the camera's field of view.
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-ExampleHeightmap.jpg|right|200px|The rendered image will be your heightmap.]]  
* Render the scene ('''F12''').  You should be looking at your heightmap.  Hit '''F3''' to save the rendered image and you're good to go!

Since this image has no color, and some engines require that your heighmap be a grayscale image (only one color channel instead of three), select the BW button in the Format pane before rendering.  This will render it as a grayscale image instead of a color image.
[[Image:Blender3DNobbToPro-Exporting_as_a_Heightmap_06.jpg|Select BW to save as a grayscale image.]]

==Avoid Stair-Stepping==
As mentioned earlier, exporting the heightmap as an 8-bit image (Blender doesn't support any 16-bit formats that I'm aware of) has the drawback that you only have 256 discrete height values which can cause a stair-step effect when the terrain is subdivided.  Ideally, you could use an application that can export the image in a 16-bit raw format, such as Terragen.  But this is a Blender tutorial, so we'll not go into that. =P

===Reducing the resolution===
One way you can &quot;smooth&quot; out the rendered terrain is to actually reduce the resolution of the heightmap.  This may sound counter intuitive, but bear with me.  Suppose you have a heightmap that is a simple blend from black to white going from left to right.  If your heightmap is 1024x1024, you will get 4 columns of each height since you only have 256 different values.  In other words, your grayscale will look something like this:

00001111222233334444...

00001111222233334444...

00001111222233334444...

00001111222233334444...

00001111222233334444...

00001111222233334444...

If you try to render terrain from this, you'll get 4 points with 0 altitude, 4 with 1, 4 with 2, and so on, creating the stair-step effect.

Now suppose you make the same heightmap, but reduce its size to 256x256.  Now you'll have 1 column for each height, and your grayscale will look something like this:

012345678...

012345678...

012345678...

012345678...

You may be thinking, &quot;But then my terrain will be smaller, or less detailed.&quot;  But it turns out the opposite is actually true.  Consider applying the above heightmap to a terrain that is 1024x1024.  The values from your heightmap will be applied to every 4th vertex, and the ones in between will be interpolated.  So instead of having something like:

'''0.0'''   '''0.0'''   '''0.0'''   '''0.0'''   '''1.0'''   '''1.0'''   '''1.0'''   '''1.0'''   '''2.0'''

which is what you would get with the 1024x1024 heightmap, you'll actually get something like this:

'''0.0'''   ''0.25''   ''0.5''   ''0.75''   '''1.0'''   ''1.25''   ''1.5''   ''1.75''   '''2.0'''

Where the integers are the values from your heightmap and the fractions are interpolated values.  This is assuming that whatever engine you are using will interpolate the values between heights read in from the heightmap.

At the present time, this is the only method I have verified that helps reduce the effects of stair-stepping.  As I try different techniques I will update this page with them.  For example, I know that Adobe Photoshop can export images in 16-bit raw formats, but I haven't tried it yet so I don't want to suggest it as a solution.

&lt;hr&gt;

As always, I do these tutorials for you, the reader.  So if you have any issues with the tutorial, or feedback (positive or negative), drop it in the discussions. I'll try to keep an eye on it to see what people have to say and update accordingly.  [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 19:02, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

'''''Acer platanoides''''' ('''Norway Maple''') is a species of maple native to eastern and central Europe and southwest Asia, from France east to Russia, north to southern Scandinavia and southeast to northern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Acer&amp;SPECIES_XREF=platanoides&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= Flora Europaea: ''Acer platanoides'' distribution ]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/acera/acer/acerplav.jpg Den virtuella floran: ''Acer platanoides'' distribution]&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely cultivated elsewhere, and is also an invasive in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norway Maple | url=http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/pubs/midatlantic/acpl.htm | author=Swearingen, J., Reshetiloff, K., Slattery, B., &amp; Zwicker, S. | year=2002 |  work=Plant Invaders of Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas | publisher=National Park Service and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

It is a deciduous tree growing to 20–30 m tall with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter, and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey-brown and shallowly grooved; unlike many other maples, mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark. The shoots are green at first, soon becoming pale brown; the winter buds are shiny red-brown. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed with five lobes, 7–14 cm long and 8–20 cm (rarely 25 cm) across; the lobes each bear one to three side teeth, and an otherwise smooth margin. The leaf petiole is 8–20 cm long, and secretes a milky juice when broken. The autumn colour is usually yellow, occasionally orange-red. The flowers are in corymbs of 15–30 together, yellow to yellow-green with five sepals and five petals 3–4 mm long; flowering occurs in early spring before the new leaves emerge. The fruit is a double samara with two winged seeds, the seeds are disc-shaped, strongly flattened, 10–15 mm across and 3 mm thick. The wings are 3–5 cm long, widely spread, approaching a 180° angle. It typically produces a large quantity of viable seeds. It is not particularly long-lived, with a maximum age of around 250 years.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999).

[[Image:Norway-maple-bark.jpg|thumb|left|Norway Maple bark]]
Norway Maple is a member (and is the type species) of the section ''Platanoidea'' Pax, characterised by flattened, disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap. Other related species in this section incluse ''[[../Acer campestre/]]'' (Field Maple), ''[[../Acer cappadocicum/]]'' (Cappadocian Maple), ''[[../Acer lobelii/]]'' (Lobel's Maple), and ''[[../Acer truncatum/]]'' (Shandong Maple). From Field Maple, Norway Maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed, not blunt, lobes, and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes.&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=afm/&gt;

It is also frequently confused with the more distantly related ''[[../Acer saccharum/]]'' (Sugar Maple). Sugar Maple is easy to distinguish from this species by the clear sap in the petiole (Norway Maple has white sap in the petiole). The tips of the points on Norway Maple leaves reduce to a fine &quot;hair&quot;, while the tips of the points on Sugar Maple leaves are on close inspection rounded. On mature trees, Sugar Maple bark is more shaggy, while Norway Maple bark has small, often criss-crossing grooves. While the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all Maple species, the leaf lobes of Norway Maple tend to have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on Sugar Maples. The seeds of Sugar Maple are globose, while Norway Maple seeds are flattened. Sugar Maple usually has a brighter orange autumn colour.&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=afm/&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
Many cultivars have been selected, with distinctive leaf shape or coloration such as the dark purple of 'Crimson King' and 'Schwedleri', the variegated leaves of 'Drummondii' and 'Emerald Queen', and the deeply divided, feathery leaves of 'Dissectum' and 'Lorbergii'. The purple-foliage cultivars have orange to red autumn colour. 'Columnare' is selected for its narrow upright growth.&lt;ref name=afm/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Acer Platanoides 'schwedleri' leaf.jpg|left|thumb|Leaf of 'Schwedleri']]
The wood is hard, yellowish-white to pale reddish, with the heartwood not distinct; it is used for furniture and turnery.&lt;ref name=vedel&gt;Vedel, H., &amp; Lange, J. (1960). ''Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow''. Metheun &amp; Co. Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been widely introduced into cultivation in other areas, including western Europe northwest of its native range. It grows north of the Arctic Circle at Tromsø, Norway. In North America, it is grown as a street and shade tree. It is favoured due to its tolerance of poor, compacted soils and urban pollution. As a result of these characteristics, Norway Maple is displacing locally native hardwoods in some parts of North America and is considered invasive in some states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norway Maple | url=http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/pubs/midatlantic/acpl.htm | author=Swearingen, J., Reshetiloff, K., Slattery, B., &amp; Zwicker, S. | year=2002 |  work=Plant Invaders of Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas | publisher=National Park Service and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is still widely used for urban plantings in many areas. Norway Maple itself is threatened in a few areas by the [[../Asian long-horned beetle/]], which eats through the trunk of trees, often killing them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Maintenance==
Bad crotching can be an issue, and since the wood is relatively weak the tree can easily split in windstorms. 

==Propagation==
Cultivars are propagated by cutting or grafting, otherwise the tree produces abundant fertile seed.

==Pests and Diseases==
Norway Maple is generally free of serious diseases, though can be attacked by the [[../Powdery Mildew|powdery mildew]] ''[[../Uncinula bicornis//]]'', and verticillium wilt disease caused by ''[[../Verticillium/]]'' spp.&lt;ref name=pb&gt;Phillips, D. H., &amp; Burdekin, D. A. (1992). ''Diseases of Forest and Ornamental Trees''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-49493-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Encapsulation ===
Encapsulation (also known as [[w:Information hiding|information hiding]]) is a concept commonly used on large software projects to allow for extensibility. The principal behind encapsulation is to hide the inner workings of a class from the code that uses the class, only exposing the essentials.

==== Why Bother? ====
Team development projects often split up tasks. Designing clean, easy to understand interfaces makes code easier to understand. If a data member of a class written by Team A is used by Team B, and the class changes a way the data member works, it can break compatibility with Team B's code. Not only is maintaining data members of a class very difficult, it can also be quite confusing to clients. The interface of an encapsulated class is like a contract to clients, stating what it is capable of doing. The client shouldn't care how it is done, in fact it can be upgraded in the future, as long as it complies with the same interface.

==== Implementation ====
To completely encapsulate a class, all data members of the class must be private. In designing the class, it must be determined what data must be accessible, and what can be kept completely hidden. The data to be made public will require &quot;accessor functions,&quot; which can allow data to be read or stored in private data members.

==== Example ====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//Non-encapsulated class
class raceCar {
    public:
        void drive()
        int pos;
        int speed;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//Encapsulated class
class raceCar {
    public:
        void drive()

        void setSpeed(int s) {m_speed = s;}
        int speed()          {return m_speed;}

        int position()       {return m_pos;}
    private:
        int m_pos;
        int m_speed;
};

==Introduction==



===Module objectives===

This study guide '''does not''' aim at replacing the other resources that exist to get prepared to pass the 70-536 exam: 

* we provide links to the MSDN library, we do not try to replace it. People who pass the exam often note that the [[#70-536 Training kit|training kit]] does not cover every aspect of the exam and that consulting the MSDN documentation is a big plus.

* we provide links to Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects where applicable. This is not a series of theoretical or encyclopedia articles but a guide on how the concepts are implemented in the .NET framework and how to use them.

* we do not provide testing software

* we do not pretend that this module replaces the recommended training kit or any other recommended material from Microsoft.

What we '''do provide''' though, even at this document's grossly incomplete stage, is:

* an exhaustive list of the objectives of the exam as stated by Microsoft

* links from all exam objectives to the corresponding MSDN library article.

* &quot;textbook like&quot; explanations for a growing number of topics with links to related external sources.

* and most of all, a place to put your important notes and code examples for your revision before the exam and as a reference for your professional work afterward. No training kit or library provides that in a shared and controlled environment.

The most difficult aspect of a book like this one is to keep a balance between having enough content to cover and explain every objective of the exam and not too much content because reading and studying time should be kept to a manageable level. Furthermore, there is no reason to cover content here that is not directly related to exam objectives.

Finally, as part of the Wikimedia family (Wikipedia and all) the Wikibooks project has very high ethics on copyrights and general quality. Do not hesitate to correct if you find anything &quot;wrong&quot; in any way.

===Module structure===

This module is structured around the objectives set by Microsoft for the 70-536 Exam. Chapters 3 to 9 represents each of the 7 major objective categories of the exam. 

The idea behind sticking to the exam &quot;official&quot; objectives is that we assume that somehow the certification provider (Microsoft) has some understanding of the product (.NET) and can state what is important to know about it.

For each chapter:

* a first section covers the major concepts (topics) treated in that chapter. This &quot;topics&quot; section allows us to somewhat separate the &quot;what&quot; from the &quot;how-to&quot;. ''Please note that the exam is heavily oriented toward the utilization of the libraries and tools and that an understanding of the concepts is highly insufficient as a preparation for the exam.''

* a second section then details each of the second, third and fourth level exam objectives for that objective category (how-to's, detailed usage and references to MSDN library).

Eventually, we would like to have:

* a &quot;revision questions&quot; section for each chapter where we could discuss the kind of questions that could be asked at the exam.

* an &quot;advanced&quot; section where we could put the more advanced material and keep the text flow of the basic sections at a level that corresponds to the knowledge required for the exam.

As of December 7, 2007:

* 24 subjects are detailed on separate pages (the subject title is the link). Most of those will eventually be integrated into the main page for a better flow of the text.

* all of the subjects are directly linked to the Microsoft Software Developers Network (MSDN) library, about 480 directly from the main page (the &quot;MSDN&quot; following the title is the link) and the others from their respective subpage.

* we just started to link the &quot;topics&quot; sections to Wikipedia articles to give you a feel of how the concepts are defined and treated outside of Microsoft's world.

Some sections are relatively advanced and others are awaiting your contributions. The more advanced sections are not all at the beginning of the module.

===The .NET Framework===

{{wikipedia|.NET Framework}}
In the certification paths where exam 70-536 &quot;Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0
Application Development Foundation&quot; is present, it represents the first step of the certification process. It is thus natural to start this first study guide with a short discussion of the framework as a whole.

The definition on [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx MSDN .NET main page] is: &quot;The .NET Framework is Microsoft's managed code programming model for building applications on Windows clients, servers, and mobile or embedded devices. Developers use .NET to build applications of many types: Web applications, server applications, smart client applications, console applications, database applications, and more&quot;.

Wikipedia's definition is: &quot;The Microsoft .NET Framework is a software component included with the Microsoft Windows operating system. It provides a large body of pre-coded solutions to common software development requirements, and manages the execution of programs written specifically for the framework. The .NET Framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform&quot;

The problem with Microsoft's definition is that it refers to a &quot;managed code programming model&quot; which is still Microsoft terminology. The best definition for it: &quot;Managed code is code that has its execution managed by the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime&quot; (see Brad Adams blog on [http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2004/01/09/48925.aspx MSDN]). 

Wikipedia's definition points to the two more important aspects from a developer point of view:
*The presence of a '''huge''' set of class libraries that allows for all of the common programming tasks. Beside the sheer size of the those class libraries, they are also evolving at a rapid pace.
*The fact that the execution environment is specific to the framework. The term &quot;virtual machine&quot; is often used to qualify such an environment.

Those two main characteristics parallel those of the Java environment, which is the main competitor to the .NET framework. This module tries to help you learn the .NET framework. It will not address the .NET vs Java comparisons and discussions.

===Framework structure===

[[Image:Overview of the Common Language Infrastructure.png|thumb|350px|Visual overview of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]]

The image on the right is taken from the Wikipedia article on the .NET framework (see above).

It describes the process followed by a program written in a .NET compatible language from source code to execution. The important difference with that and more conventional programming languages (ex. C++) is the fact that the program is compiled twice. The first compilation is done from the original language to a &quot;common intermediate language&quot; (CIL). This is what actually goes &quot;in&quot; an assembly.

The second compilation is done from the CIL to machine code. This compilation is usually performed automatically by the &quot;just-in-time&quot; (JIT) compiler.  It is also possible to use the Native Image Generator (ngen) utility to create the machine code in advance of runtime. 

This architecture has many direct implications for the subjects of this book. Among them:

* The &quot;source code&quot; of the second compilation (the CIL code) is always available to the virtual machine at runtime. This means that this code can easily be analyzed at runtime, contrary to conventional compiled environment. This characteristic is the base for the reflection functionality of the platform. Not only can we analyze the &quot;intermediate source code&quot; but we can actually create (emit) some of it at runtime and then do the &quot;just-in-time&quot; compilation and execution.

* The execution is done in the context of the CLR (this is the &quot;managed&quot; code concept). Put another way, we can say that the runtime always &quot;knows&quot; what it sends for execution, contrary to a conventional environment where the code is executed directly by the operating system. This implies that you can tell the runtime to execute, or not, this or that type of code. This is the basis for code access security.

* Most of the features of the .NET languages (C#, VB, etc.) are directly related to features of the intermediate language. Put another way, most of the time, the first compilation is pretty straightforward. Some of the constructs though do not have direct equivalents in the CIL (ex. properties in C# are mapped to class methods in the CIL).

We could continue like that for a long time. The point we want to make here is that a developer has much to gain from a detailed understanding of the platform, even if it is not directly mentioned as an objective of the exam.

If you want to read on the framework in Microsoft documentation you can see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a4t23ktk.aspx MSDN].

The last thing we will note here is that the common language runtime (CLR) can execute in different contexts:
* ASP.NET for web applications, where it is directly linked to the Internet Information Server (IIS).
* Internet Explorer for client side web controls
* In a standalone host for console, service and windows applications.

By default, examples in this book will use standalone executables. This is just because they are more easy to deploy for very simple programs. This does not imply that Windows applications are preferable to web applications.

===Where this book fits===

[[Image:DotNet.svg|thumb|350px|The .NET stack]]
The image on the right, also taken from Wikipedia, gives a simplified but clear view of the functional components of the framework.

This book (and the related exam) deals with the &quot;Base Class Library&quot; component and the basic relations of a program with the &quot;Common Language Runtime&quot; component.

The book does not cover ASP.NET, ADO.NET, WF or any other more specialized components.

We can say that we extensively cover the basics but that we shallowly cover the framework itself.

The relations with the common language runtime include such things as:
* Deployment
* Security
* Configuration
* Reflection
* Services
* Relationship with WMI
* Interoperability
* etc.

The base class library includes
* types
* collections
* generics
* text manipulation
* basic drawing
* basic globalization
* serialization
* basic input/output
* multi-threading
* etc.

All in all they are kind of &quot;dry&quot; topics. This idea of starting with an extensive coverage of the basics is certainly not the most interesting learning pattern for a beginner. This is why we advise real beginners to start with more adequate material.

One last note about the framework &quot;stack&quot; is that new versions tend to add new components instead of &quot;redoing&quot; existing ones. This means that most of the &quot;2.0&quot; basics are still valid in &quot;3.5&quot;. Some &quot;basic&quot; functionalities are nevertheless augmented or changed in new versions. We will try to keep track of those as side notes where possible.

===Programming paradigms===

{{wikipedia|Programming paradigm}}
Keeping things very (too much?) simple we can say that a programming paradigm is a &quot;style&quot; of programming, a specific way to model problems and &quot;translate&quot; their solution in code.

From a developer point of view the .NET framework (and its class libraries) is a general-purpose  object-oriented platform that is constantly extended to support other programming paradigms (generic programming with Generics, Aspect programming with attributes, Reactive programming with WF, Functional programming with Lambda expressions in C# 3.0, etc.). That &quot;extension process&quot; mirrors that of Java. The .NET and Java platforms are the only two  that currently support such extensive multi-paradigms extension process.

Discussing the extent and &quot;theoretical soundness&quot; of each of those paradigm implementations is obviously out of scope for this book.

Our point here is that navigating through all those programming styles in the same platform can get kind of confusing. Maintaining code is also getting more and more difficult because two original programmers could have solved the same problem using widely different &quot;styles&quot; or constructs.

We will thus try to connect, where possible, the different .NET concepts with their respective &quot;style&quot; to give the reader some context.

===Assemblies===

{{wikipedia|Component-based software engineering}}
{{wikipedia|Component object model}}
According to [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hk5f40ct.aspx MSDN] assemblies are: &quot;the building blocks of .NET Framework applications; they form the fundamental unit of deployment, version control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions&quot;.

The .NET Framework is now Microsoft's preferred way of developing applications on the Windows platform. In that respect it succeeds the Component Object Model (COM). This is important to mention because despite some deployment and management problems (remember DLL Hell?) COM played an important role in the development of component-based computing (reusing whole executable components, not only program code). Major efforts have been invested to transfer the component-based concepts of COM to the .NET framework and a significant part of this book deals with those (security, installation, versioning, etc.).

The assembly is the successor of the COM component.

== Visual Editor ==

What do you think of visual editor? I am presuming that since you are an administrator, they may have told you more. Will it be on Wikibooks after some point of development? And, also, in the advertisement they have in Wikipedia about it, they say it discourages users because nobody knows how to do &quot;all this coding&quot;. As a firsthand account, joining a month ago and having very little prior knowledge of programming, this stuff is easy! It is mildly complicated at the first edits, but they exaggerate it. I believe the advertisement draws too much for inferences. Does Wikimedia have some sort of tracking devices to see what page you are on; and to see whether you click the edit button and then go back? I do not believe so. [[User:Воображение|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial; color:black&quot;&gt;В&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial Black; color:grey&quot;&gt;о&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial Unicode MS; color:red&quot;&gt;о&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batang; color:orange&quot;&gt;б&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batangche; color:yellow&quot;&gt;р&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Book Antiqua; color:green&quot;&gt;а&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Bookman Old Style; color:blue&quot;&gt;ж&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri; color:indigo&quot;&gt;е&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri Light; color:purple&quot;&gt;н&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Cambria; color:grey&quot;&gt;и&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Cambria Math color:black&quot;&gt;е]]

: From my understanding of internet history, wiki technology was a runaway success ''because it's so easy to use''.  That sits oddly with claims that the difficulty of wiki markup discourages people from getting involved.

: I believe English Wikipedia has two major problems that endanger its future.
:* One is an often-toxic social atmosphere, which I believe is largely the cumulative effect of many years of AGF (Assume Good Faith).  I've got a list of three top reasons AGF is a truly Bad Idea.
:* The other is that the wikimedia sisters &amp;mdash;all of them, including Wikipedia&amp;mdash; need a better way to manage ''expertise''.  The tasks performed on the non-wikipedian sisters tend to be more specialized, therefore requiring more expertise, than those on Wikipedia, but even Wikiepdia has this need.  One needs to identify experts, capture what they know (to the extent that's possible), help guide newcomers through the expert tasks and also help them learn the expert knowledge themselves, and help experts apply the knowledge more easily.  All those things.  Wiki software, so far, is good for just one thing: writing documents.  And that's not a good way to capture expertise, not a good way to guide people through applying it, and not even a particularly good way to help people learn it.  I do have in mind some tools that might eventually help with expertise management, but there's a very long way to go, and I'm trying to design and write all the code myself &amp;mdash; in my copious free time (I spend most of my donated wikimedia time reviewing articles for English Wikinews... a task requiring a great deal of expertise, that could be made greatly easier by the sort of tools I'm having trouble finding time to develop).
: Frankly, I think English Wikipedia is in denial about these problems.  They don't see the expertise problem, and they've (many of them) got this profound emotional commitment to AGF that keeps them from seeing that it's destroying them.  So instead they pour effort into the quintessentially superficial visual editor.  That's how it seems to me, anyway.  I haven't looked into visual editor very deeply; perhaps if I did I'd be impressed by how ergonomic it is, though I don't see how it could be ''all that much easier'' to use since the wiki interface is already just not that difficult.  But more to the point, I don't think it's addressing the biggest problems that the wikimedia sisters are facing.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:00, 3 July 2013 (UTC)

::I think you are making exaggeration here. Being told you did something severely wrong (I doubt which happens very often), may discourage you, or it will motivate you do try again. AGF sometimes discourages people from editing/contributing, but I do not think that it is a &quot;truly Bad Idea&quot;. I would like to see these three reasons. As for expertise, Wikipedia has handled that excellently, using wikiProjects. Maybe something of the sort could be implemented into the siblings, but I am not sure I am grasping what you are saying. What tools are you talking about? What would they do? I see no problems with Wikimedia siblings, and Visualeditor is an, albeit nearly uselss, tool, and any help is welcomed help. [[User:Воображение|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batang; color:red&quot;&gt;В&lt;span style=&quot; color:purple&quot;&gt;оображени&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;е]]

::: AGF is a startlingly deep subject; it's taken me years to learn its dynamics.  My thinking on the subject has matured through a series of stages, which I'll take a stab at describing, below; key points are that AGF means something different than the naive interpretation of what it says, and that in practice what AGF does is different from what it's meant to do.
:::* Stage one: ''naive idealism''.
::::: When I first registered on Wikipedia (in 2006), I was soon given a welcome message on my user talk page there, and quickly discovered AGF.  I thought something like, &quot;Wow.  That's completely unworkable; obviously a completely open forum is going to be rife with people who don't mean well, and expecting such a project to function successfully by pretending otherwise is insane.  It's pie-in-the-sky idealism.  Cool!  Count me in!&quot;  This is an important thing to understand about projects run by volunteer labor:  they thrive on idealism.  Only idealism can stir the passions of volunteers to donate the quality and quantity of labor needed.
:::* Stage two: ''Behavior rather than belief''.
::::: I'd been on Wikipedia for about a year before I encountered the essay [[w:WP:The Zen of Wikipedia|The Zen of Wikpedia]], with its advice to '''''Assume good faith, even when you don't.''''' By that time I dimly grasped that, as implied by the advice, &quot;assume good faith&quot; shouldn't be taken too literally.  It took me another year or so before I felt I understood reasonably well what it ''does'' mean.  It has to do with how one conducts oneself, and perhaps just a bit with reminding oneself not to assume bad faith, but oughtn't be construed to imply one should be making unreasonable assumptions.
:::* Stage three:  ''Relativism''.
::::: For a while, I was so deeply indoctrinated in AGF that when I first arrived at Wikinews, where they ''explicitly'' rejected AGF on the grounds that a news reporter shouldn't be in the habit of ''assuming'' anything, I thought, &quot;Yes, I can see that a news site would have to discourage assuming anything, but how can a wiki project possibly function without AGF?&quot;  It's kind of amazing that I thought that, since a few years earlier when I arrived at Wikipedia I'd wondered how a wiki project could possibly function ''with'' AGF.  But I found that Wikinews functioned despite the absence of AGF, just as I'd found that Wikipedia functioned despite the presence of AGF.  And for several years I tried ''really hard'' to satisfy everyone at once, by believing that AGF is appropriate for Wikipedia even though it obviously isn't appropriate for Wikinews.

::::: In fact Wikinews, for a while there, did have intermittent problems with an unstable social climate &amp;mdash; but the problem wasn't the absence of AGF, rather it was the absence of clear guidelines on how to operate without AGF.  It took Wikinews quite a lot of political bother to finally formulate essay [[n:WN:Never assume|Never assume]], because I wasn't the only one who'd [[wikt:drink the Kool-Aid|drunk the AGF Kool-Aid]].

::::: Two out of my top three objections to AGF are already apparent at this stage:  First, if taken literally, AGF tells contributors to assume something, and information providers should not '''assume''' things &amp;mdash; just as information consumers shouldn't either.  Second, if understood as a behavioral guideline that doesn't mean literally what it says, AGF encourages contributors by example to say something different than what they mean.  Information providers should be in the habit of saying what they mean.
:::* Stage four: ''disillusionment''.
::::: What happens on Wikipedia is this:  nasty users learn to use AGF as a shield.  They can be extremely vicious without provably violating behavioral guidelines, and then when one of their victims is goaded into reacting to their viciousness, the victim gets a slap on the wrist, either for bad behavior as such or for failing to assume good faith.  Over many years, this has caused a gradual, steady rise in the proportion of nasty users on Wikipedia, and while there are still many great people there, overall the social atmosphere of the project has gotten more and more poisonous.  As the atmosphere grows worse, better users are discouraged from staying or discouraged from joining, and the problem makes itself worse.  This is the other one of my top three objections to AGF: that it shields troublesome users.

::::: It took me a long time on Wikinews before I was able to see clearly this problem with AGF.  In part, I had to recover from the AGF indoctrination I'd received at Wikipedia, but there was more to it than that.  I'd originally fallen in love with Wikipedia partly because of the ''idealism'' of AGF, and my emotional investment lingered, so I was reluctant to admit to an intrinsic flaw in AGF.  Indeed, many Wikipedians are apparently too emotionally committed to the idealism of AGF to entertain any doubt in it.
::: --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:27, 6 July 2013 (UTC)

:::::: Well, your biography of wikimedia usage was interesting. But to counter your points,
::::::* Firstly, I think you mean the wrong meaning of assume. In the wikitionary article of &quot;Assume&quot;, the third definition says this: &quot;To adopt an idea or cause.&quot;, while you may have mixed it up with the most common definition, &quot;To authenticate by means of belief; to surmise; to suppose to be true, especially without proof.&quot;. Assuming in the first definition is not OK, assuming in the third definition is acceptable (in my opinion). You can assume any religion, but as long as you remain unbiased, Wikimedia would have no problems with your religions. 
::::::* Secondly, I think that you misinterpreted it. It seems like you are comparing AGF to a situation like this: &quot;Would you like to come over to dinner?&quot; You are obliged to say &quot;Yes&quot;, and/or lie(No, I will be busy), in order to be polite. AGF is not supposed to be that degree. Rather, it is just saying as a rule, that you should not be vulgar or try to be mean whilst stating your true statement. 
::::::* Thirdly, I have not edited much on Wikipedia, but I could not imagine any of this. And if were abolished on Wikipedia, would not it be just a rowdy place like YouTube comments in which everybody is insulting each other and having arguments about religion, gender, etc? I think this may be unpreventable, and is just the lesser of the two evils.
:::::: And BTW instead of using ''Poisonous Atmosphere'', just use the word ''Miasma''. You seem to like saying toxic atmosphere and poisonous atmosphere a lot. [[User:Воображение|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batang; color:red&quot;&gt;В&lt;span style=&quot; color:purple&quot;&gt;оображени&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;е]]

::::::: Overall, it ''sounds'' &amp;mdash;puzzlingly&amp;mdash; as if you've somehow badly misunderstood what &quot;assume good faith&quot; means.  I'm not certain you've misunderstood.  I'm not sure what would cause such a misunderstanding, which makes it harder for me to believe such a misunderstanding has occurred.  What I can say unequivocally:  There isn't any doubt about what AGF means; there has never been any doubt about what AGF means.  When dealing with another user, you are to ''assume'' (i.e., believe without proof) that the other user is acting in good faith.

::::::: AGF is separate from various other principles that &amp;mdash;unlike AGF&amp;mdash; concern themselves with whether one is, oneself, ''mean''.  Like, &quot;Be civil&quot;, and &quot;Don't bite the newcomers&quot;.  Many of the users (not all, but many) who are most vocal in insisting on AGF are downright vicious.

::::::: As I mentioned, Wikinews had some problem a while back, '''not''' because it didn't have AGF, but because it didn't have a sufficiently clearly delineated alternative to AGF either.  The alternative to one way of doing things is ''some'' other way of doing things; the alternative to AGF is not automatically some particular [[wikt:dystopia|dystopia]].

::::::: Btw, ''miasma'' is not in this case a viable substitute for ''poisonous atmosphere'' (even setting aside subtleties of degree).  This is because ''atmosphere'' is being used in the sense of ''social environment'', a common usage for ''atmosphere'' that anchors the phrase to its intended meaning in a way that ''miasma'' does not.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:59, 7 July 2013 (UTC)

::::::: The [[W:Wikipedia:Assume good faith|Wikpedia page]] about it actually says to use assume in both the first and third ways, ''Unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, assume that people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it.'' is what you are thinking about.  However, what I am talking about it is ''If criticism is needed, discuss editors' actions, but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence.''. You may have a very good point in abolishing the first definition, but I think that the other definition should remain. Also, could you give me the crash course on how to contribute pages on wikiNews? I want to translate the Never Assume document. [[User:Воображение|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batang; color:red&quot;&gt;В&lt;span style=&quot; color:purple&quot;&gt;оображени&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;е]]
{{outdent|::::::}}
I don't see how the second passage would bear on a different sense of ''assume'' than the first.
* ''Unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, assume that people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it.'' &amp;mdash; talks about believing that people mean well.
* ''If criticism is needed, discuss editors' actions, but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence.'' &amp;mdash; doesn't actually use the word &quot;assume&quot;, but in relation to the meaning of &quot;assume&quot; it apparently implies you should ''pretend'' to assume that people mean well, until the pretense becomes unsustainable.  A related point is also made in [[n:WN:Never assume]], with some differences of shading &amp;mdash; most of the second paragraph, which doesn't place a high standard of evidence, and also addresses the recipient of criticism.
Re &quot;crash course on how to contribute pages on wikiNews&quot;, I'm happy to help but am unsure what you're asking for.  (It's ''Wikinews'' rather than ''wikiNews'', btw.&amp;nbsp;:-)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:51, 7 July 2013 (UTC)

: For the second one, I think you are misinterpreting it. Otherwise, it would be repetitive of the first statement. It tells you to more ''take up'' good faith rather than to &quot;authenticate without belief&quot; that others are using good faith. The first statement could have easily caused all of your reasons as for why AGF is a bad reason. You can break any facade that evils are building just by using my favourite rule which is something along the lines of ''Ignore all other rules''. And how can anyone act while AGF maliciously? If they use any kind of insults, it will be obvious that they are not assuming good faith. You can not assume that there is not a computer in front of me when you see that there is a computer in front of me. I am not the person you should be arguing about Assume Good Faith, the person you should see is [[W:User:Morwen|Morwen]], who created AGF. But only if you win this argument. 

: About Wikinews, I think it is apparent what I want to do; translate the Never Assume document into French. 

: Oh, and remember a while back I asked you about division of expertise? You still have not answered that question. [[User:Воображение|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batang; color:red&quot;&gt;В&lt;span style=&quot; color:purple&quot;&gt;оображени&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;е]]

== Venus Abridgement ==

You abridged one of my edits on Venus in Wikijunior. I forgot how to link pages here, and too lazy to look. I believe that most everywhere, people buy frozen pizza to cook. I, myself, baked my first successful pizza solo when I was 9. I would understand discrepancies as the reason to simplify it, however, I am associating it with something most children would say &quot;Yummy&quot;. And I doubt that our intended audiences are Italian pizza aficianados. Plus, I added the temperature my oven goes to when I bake pizza for answering the question that will probably pop up like this: Reader reads: &quot;As hot as an oven when baking pizza.&quot; Reader wonders: I wonder how hot that oven is actually. [[User:Воображение|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Batang; color:red&quot;&gt;В&lt;span style=&quot; color:purple&quot;&gt;оображени&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;е]]
: Hm.  There's pizza you get at a pizzeria (cheap or expensive), which is baked at very high temperatures.  Home-made pizza, baked at temperatures less than at a pizzeria but possibly still hotter than the surface of Venus.  Store-bought pizza baked in an oven, that temperature is I believe rather lower.  And store-bought pizza heated in a microwave oven, which is a different thing entirely.  Which of these things kids are, or aren't, likely to be familiar with depends on what part of the world they're in.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 20:18, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

::: There is in fact more than one &quot;temperature at which pizza is baked&quot;, corresponding to different modes of baking it, differing over a very wide range from below Venus's surface temperature to... above it I think, though I'd have to double check that.  And ''cultural'' differences may determine whether any given one of these modes is prevalent where a given child lives; it's not merely a matter of how rich the child is (though I do note initiatives to make laptops available for education of children all over the world, including in some direly underdeveloped areas).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:36, 6 July 2013 (UTC)

Hello, I saw on IRC that you made a recent edit.  I am being bullied by an admin who doesn't think I have done productive work on the [[Python programming]] book.  Can you help me?  You can see the exchange on my talk page. I am stepping out to get a curry, but will be back in about 30 minutes.

:Dan Polansky is [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Administrators#Administrators not an administrator].

:: [[User:Panic2k4]] has a good reason to hold grudge against me, as I have helped to halt some of this malpractices at [[C++ Programming]], especially his mistreatment of [[Talk:C++ Programming]], and I have pointed out [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny]]. Thanks also to the work of [[User:Adrignola]], [[Talk:C++ Programming]] and its archives are in sound order now. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 21:29, 13 October 2013 (UTC)
::: Dan, I don't know (yet) what the **** is going on over at Python Programming, but from what I've seen, including your above comment, your rhetoric on this matter seems pretty uniformly negative.  You seem to be looking for excuses to dismiss other's contributions; that's really how it comes across.  I even see you ridiculing another editor for making many small edits instead of one big edit &amp;mdash; ''seriously?''  I routinely make large edits in small increments, so it will be possible to use diffs to see clearly just what I've done &amp;mdash; but casting factual doubt on whether large edits are preferable to small edits isn't the point.  It's more disturbing that the whole argument comes across as (saying it again) an ''excuse'' to dismiss someone else's contributions.  Your basic position sure sounds like &quot;I can prove I've made more contributions here than you have proven you've made, therefore I own this book&quot;, which is appallingly antisocial.  If the C++ Programming affair teaches anything, I'd think it's that things become an unholy mess, and the project as a whole suffers, when editors stop trying to cooperate.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:50, 14 October 2013 (UTC)
:::: Thanks for your reply.  There are other projects that I can work on, however this is the one that I would like to work on the most, and where I think I can offer the most useful content, so I thought I should register the issue.  From my point of view as a new editor, it is a pretty appalling welcome from a veteran Editor, Dan.  From my view on [[Python programming]], I was in the first instance trying to tidy-up the navigation between the chapters, and make the content follow in a more coherent manner. 

::::I do not see how one can make (write), or amend chapters if you are unsure of what the order is.  Eg the 'decorators' chapter comes before the 'classes' chapter, and for the most part I have only ever seen decorators used with classes anyway.  There are other examples of poorly placed chapters, inconsistent capitalisation, repetitive content over several chapters, and (extremely?) poorly named chapters such as 'Extracting info from web pages' which lands on 'Web Page Harvesting.'  

::::I would say that 'Web Page Harvesting' actually sends the wrong message of copying web content irrespective of copyright. Harvesting implies someone copying web content without the permission of the content owner, and it also is a rather narrow application of the use of http client libraries, eg I use http client libraries at work to automate the configuration and monitor printers and NAS boxes.  Despite how we may feel about IP, wikibooks should not be in the business of encouraging illegal activity.  The navigation between chapters is broken, and inconsistent.   

::::After reviewing a fair number of chapters on [[Python programming]] I came to the conclusion that the book was mostly derelict and unmaintained, so I decided to crack on with reorganising it, and fixing the navigation between chapters.  That is work that I [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Python_Programming&amp;oldid=2565977 completed], which Dan [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Python_Programming reverted]. He reverted many of the articles that I fixed the navbars on.  I also archived out the ancient content from the Discussion page (I personally think that it is counter-productive to keep old content that is no longer relevant on the Talk pages; I think it is distracting and confusing, and should be archived in a sensible manner, and that only current discussion should be on the page, which again Dan reverted.

:::: So after reorganising the contents page, and fixing the navigation I started on refactoring and writing content beginning here: [[Python_Programming/Editing_and_Running_Python_Code]].  Then Dan left 2 rather nasty messages on my talk page: [[User_talk:Hackbinary]], and at first I tried really hard to press the reset button and foster a cooperative rapport, but he persisted in belittling, slighting and just being an obstinate jerk.  I wanted the contents page to be reorganised, so I would know the rough plan of the book so I could write against that, and Dan agreed that chapters were poorly ordered, but when it became clear that he was not agreeable to reorganising the contents page, I became frustrated, so I let it devolve a bit before calling it a day. 

:::: Finally, I find it quite odd that Dan did not mention Python programming on his User Page, nor did he even appear once on the Discussion pages on any of the chapters that had them before I suggested that he should speak up on them, so I do think that my view of Python programming being unmaintained is a reasonable conclusion.

Ugali is a staple dish in Kenya - a porridge-like starch made with maize meal (corn). 

==Ingredients==
* 4 white cornmeal or ground maize 
* 8 cups water
* salt to taste

==Procedure==

#Boil the water in a saucepan. When the water is bubbling, add salt (if desired) and pour the corn flour slowly into boiling water, stirring continuously. Try to mash up any lumps that do form - the aim is to get a smooth consistency. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until it has the consistency of thick oatmeal. 
#Serve hot ugali immediately with any meat or vegetable stew, or any dish with a sauce or gravy.</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Hi Flolit
I'm just stopping by to say thanks for your recent work on the wikijunior bugs book. you're doing a great job.

Keep up the good work, and if you need anything, feel free to ask.

Regards

Hi again Flolit. That's absolutely fine, the book is open to additions of any kind and the extra species looks to be a valuable addition. Fantastic to see your continued contributions to the project!

Hi Flolit - I rolled back a change I made to [[Wikijunior:Bugs]].  I thought I was making it better, but now that I see what you're doing, I step aside and get out of your way. :-) --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 20:16, 5 March 2012 (UTC)</text>

==Commons images deleted==
G'day, several images used by the book [[VHDL for FPGA Design]] have been deleted on the Wiki Commons due to problems with their licensing. Please see the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:CommonsTicker&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=1116079 CommonsTicker] for more information. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:17, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

:Hey Raimondo, how are you? The people at Commons can be sticklers for the proper licensing of images. When you submit an image, either here at wikibooks or on commons, you need to be sure to specify proper licensing information, so that those images don't get deleted accidentally. Many of the images that would be used in your VHDL book could also be used in other places, such as [[Programmable Logic]], [[Digital Circuits]], and [[Microprocessor Design]]. If you would be interested, we could work together to produce a nice set of images for all these books together, and ensure that they are licensed properly. Let me know if you are interested, because I would love to start up a project like this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:50, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

::Hi, [[:Image:Decoder 3 8 EN.png]] is duplicate of [[:Image:Decoder.PNG]], so it can delete. Actually I only start that VHDL book and ask some students to continue it (Maybe I continue it also little bit later), but I fully agree with you, that those books can be use lots of same images. Of course we are interested work together and we are glad, if you help us any licensing problem. You can freely repair any of our licensing mistakes. --[[User:Raimondo|Raimondo]] ([[User talk:Raimondo|talk]]) 22:03, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

:::Thanks for the quick reply! Those images that were deleted, 
:::*did you upload them? 
::::=&gt; Yes we are!
:::*Did you create them? 
::::=&gt; Yes we are!
:::*If so, we can upload them again, 
::::=&gt; Please do it and repair any of our licensing mistakes also later on!
:::*and make sure that they have the proper license information so that they do not get deleted again. If you would upload them again, I can check to ensure that they have the correct license. If you would like, you can email me the pictures, and I can properly upload them for you too.
::::=&gt; All images we have and we will upload for [[VHDL for FPGA Design]] and [[fi:VHDL-kieli FPGA-suunnittelussa]] pages are intend to upload commons and use boath of those pages and they are all made by ourself with [http://www.xilinx.com/ise/logic_design_prod/webpack.htm Xilinx ISE WebPACK] or copied inside of wikimedia. 
:::*What license should they use? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:36, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards
[[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 14:16, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Category replaced==
Hi Raimondo, I noticed your the person who is doing much of the Suomi chess pages. You have some good  ideas and I check out your pages.&lt;br&gt; I've recently moved the '''Category:Opening theory in chess''' category to the '''Category:Chess opening theory'''. Will update your user page because I noticed you linked to it. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 21:39, 2 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

The first step required to change the way your mind works is to be aware of your thoughts. Only when you catch yourself in a negative thought process is it possible to consciously halt it. This is not something that can be achieved overnight; it requires practice and [[../Willpower|willpower]].

-Elie Wiesel

It seems quite simple that people who have a goal in mind are not as listless as those without one. Yet some go through their daily lives not knowing what they want to get out of that day. How can one accomplish something when there is no goal to accomplish? Goals don't have to be of epic proportions - in fact, they probably shouldn't be. Life should be taken step by step. Every small achievement counts.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Services, threading, and application domains==

'''Exam objective: '''Implementing service processes, threading, and application domains in a .NET Framework application

===Topics===

====Services====

{{wikipedia|Windows service}}
The term service stands here for a Windows service. The basic definition of a Windows service is a long-running process that does not require a user interface. Why would you need a long-running process that does not require a user interface? Essentially two reasons:
*Doing maintenance tasks that do not need user intervention. A backup software for example will regularly check the backup schedule and execute the different backup tasks when needed. No user interface is needed for that.
*Responding to requests that come from other processes or from the operating system. An http server such as IIS (Windows component that process web requests) will receive http requests coming from client browsers and produce responses (html pages) to those same browsers. A database process is another good example. Again the http server does not need a user interface because the interface with the client is managed by the client browser component.

The exam objectives concerning services are very basic and touch the first problems that you will encounter when dealing with them:
*Since the service has no user interface then who will start and stop it? The answer is that the operating system executes the services directly but you have to ‘’register’’ your service to let the system know where it is and what to do with it (this is the installation process)
*A process with a user interface essentially waits for events coming from the user. How does a service ‘’work’’ in the absence of a message pump (the technique to get user input in a typical online application)?
*If the service does a user interface function it will “hang” waiting for a non-existent user. How can you avoid that?

The more important and complicated design issues are not covered by this exam and will be treated by the enterprise development exam.

==== Multithreading ====
{{wikipedia|Thread (computer science)}}


{{TODO|Description of multithreading support in .NET}}

====Application Domain====

{{wikipedia|Application Domain}}


{{TODO|Short description of the application domain in the CLI}}

===Classes, Interfaces, and tools===

====Implement, install, and control a service====

'''Exam objective: '''Implement, install, and control a service

(Refer System.ServiceProcess namespace)

Inherit from ServiceBase class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.servicebase(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

:A service is a long-running executable. It does not provide a user interface, and does not require any user to be logged onto the computer. Services run as System, but it is possible to choose to have them run under a different user account. The ServiceBase class is a base class for a service. It must be derived from when creating a new service.

:Almost all services will override the OnStart and OnStop methods of ServiceBase.

ServiceController class and ServiceControllerPermission class

:ServiceController class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.servicecontroller(VS.80).aspx MSDN] 

:ServiceControllerPermission class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.servicecontrollerpermission(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

ServiceInstaller and ServiceProcessInstaller class

:ServiceInstaller - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.serviceinstaller.aspx MSDN]

:ServiceProcessInstaller class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.serviceprocessinstaller.aspx MSDN]

ServiceChangeDescription structure and ServiceChangeReason enumeration

:SessionChangeDescription structure - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.sessionchangedescription.aspx MSDN] 

:SessionChangeReason enumeration - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serviceprocess.sessionchangereason.aspx MSDN]

====Develop multithreaded applications====

'''Exam objective: '''Develop multithreaded .NET Framework applications

(Refer System.Threading namespace)

Thread class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.thread(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

ThreadPool class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

ThreadStart delegate, ParameterizedThreadStart delegate, and SynchronizationContext class 

:ThreadStart delegate - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.thread.aspx MSDN]

::The simplest way to create a thread is to instantiate the Thread class. The Thread constructor takes a delegate argument. The ThreadStart delegate points to a method containing your logic. For example:

 Thread t1 = new Thread (new ThreadStart(LengthyLogic));
 public void LengthyLogic ()
 {
   // Logic code
 }

:ParameterizedThreadStart delegate - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.parameterizedthreadstart.aspx MSDN]

::When you start a thread, sometimes you need to pass in some data for processing. .NET 2.0 provides a new delegate, ParameterizedThreadStart, which takes a parameter of type object. The class has a new overload function Thread.Start. It allows you to specify the value to be passed into the thread. This approach is simple, but is not type-safe. Example:

 Thread t1 = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(LengthyLogic));
 // Use the overload of the Start method that has a parameter of type Object.
 t1.Start(myData);
 static void LengthyLogic(object data)
 {
   // Logic code
 }

:SynchronizationContext class - [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/SyncContextTutorial.aspx MSDN]

::The Code Project Example for SynchronizationContext Class [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/SyncContextTutorial.aspx]

Timeout class, Timer class, TimerCallback delegate, WaitCallback delegate, WaitHandle class, and WaitOrTimerCallback delegate

====Using applications domains====

'''Exam objective: '''Create a unit of isolation for common language runtime in a .NET Framework application by using application domains

(Refer System namespace) 

=====Create an application domain=====
See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6s0z09xw.aspx MSDN]

An application domain is a division of a process into multiple parts. Applications running in different application domains are as isolated as they would be in different processes. So they cannot access memory in another application domain. However, if native code is run, it can gain unlimited access to the whole process, which includes other application domains.

Application domains are easier to maintain and are faster because it is easier to communicate between application domains than between processes. An application domain can hold multiple assemblies.

To create an application domain, you must at least supply a name for the new application domain:
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;);

Use ''AppDomain.CurrentDomain'' to get the application domain the calling thread is using.

=====Load assemblies into an application domain=====
See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/25y1ya39.aspx MSDN]

It is possible to execute an assembly by name using ''AppDomain.ExecuteAssemblyByName'':
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;);
  ad.ExecuteAssemblyByName(&quot;aname, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=a9b8c7d6&quot;);

Or use ''AppDomain.ExecuteAssembly'' to supply a path to the assemby:
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;);
  ad.ExecuteAssembly(@&quot;c:\path\to\file.exe&quot;);

=====Unload an application domain=====
See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c5b8a8f9.aspx MSDN]

It is not possible to unload assemblies from the default application domain. However if an assembly is loaded in a different application domain, you can unload the whole application domain which includes all assemblies in that application domain.

To unload an application domain, use the static ''AppDomain.Unload'' function:
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;);
  AppDomain.Unload(ad);  

=====Configure an application domain=====
See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c8hk0245.aspx MSDN]

The most likely reason to modify the application domain configuration, is to restrict certain permissions to limit the damage if an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in an assembly.

An example is to run an assembly in the ''Internet Zone''. The Internet Zone has limited permissions. To do this create a ''Zone Evidence'' and supply it as a parameter when creating the Application Domain:
  object [] myEvidenceTypes = {new Zone (SecurityZone.Internet)};
  Evidence myEvidence = new  Evidence(myEvidenceTypes, null);
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;, myEvidence); // Pass the Evidence when creating the App. Domain
  ad.ExecuteAssembly(@&quot;c:\path\to\file.exe&quot;);
  
It is also possible to execute only one assemby in an Application Domain with different permissions;
  object [] myEvidenceTypes = {new Zone (SecurityZone.Internet)};
  Evidence myEvidence = new  Evidence(myEvidenceTypes, null);
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;);
  ad.ExecuteAssembly(@&quot;c:\path\to\file.exe&quot;, myEvidence); // Pass the Evidence in the ExecuteAssembly function

Except Evidence, you can also use the AppDomainSetup class to set other properties.
  AppDomainSetup ads = new AppDomainSetup();
  ads.ApplicationBase = @&quot;c:\Test&quot;;
  ads.DisallowCodeDownload = true;
  AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain(&quot;Name&quot;, null, ads); // use null as second parameter for default Evidence

=====Retrieve setup information from an application domain=====
See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dxh1dy9h.aspx MSDN]

Use the ''SetupInformation'' property of an AppDomain to read the settings from that application domain;
  AppDomainSetup ads = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetupInformation;
  Console.WriteLine(ads.ConfigurationFile);
  Console.WriteLine(ads.ApplicationName);

==Configuration, diagnostic, management, and installation==

'''Exam objective: '''Embedding configuration, diagnostic, management, and installation features into a .NET Framework application

===Topics===

==== Configuration management ====

Configuration management is used here in a restricted sense. It refers to the adaptation of an application to a specific execution environment or user. This is usually done thru the use of configuration files that specify the run time parameters of the application. The typical example of such configuration information is the connection string used to locate and connect to the application database. The exam objectives are all related to the actual interaction of the application with its configuration files.

The management or the design of the configuration files themselves is a vast subject that is not touched by the exam objectives so we will not cover it in this study guide.

====.NET framework installer====

====Event log==== 

{{wikipedia|Event log}}
MSDN's definition is &quot;Windows event logs allow your applications and components to record information about important events. You can use these records to audit access to your system, troubleshoot problems, and re-create usage patterns&quot;

For a general discussion see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e6t4tk09.aspx MSDN]

For specifics on the EventLog class and some cautions about its use see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlog.aspx MSDN]

=====Read from an event log=====
[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlog.writeentry.aspx MSDN]

=====Create a new event log=====

You create an EventLog by creating the first event source that writes to that log.

The two simplest way to do this are:
*Use the EventLog.CreateEventSource method
*Create an EventLog instance, specify a source and then write to the log. The actual creation takes place on execution of the first write.

Note that there is no &quot;EventSource&quot; class in the System.Diagnostics namespace even though an object representing the source is created in the registry.

    namespace EventLogLab1
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                try
                {
                    EventLog log1 = new EventLog(&quot;EvtLab2Log&quot;);
                    log1.Source = &quot;EvtLab2Source&quot;;
                    // Actual creation happens next
                    log1.WriteEntry(&quot;Example message&quot;, EventLogEntryType.Information,
                        123, 1);
                }
                catch (Exception e)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                }
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}}
The recommended way, which does not seem to be covered on the Training Kit (so probably not on the exam) is to use the EventLogInstaller class during the installation of the application.

Calls to these methods are ignored in the release version of your program (see 'The ConditionalAttribute attribute' below for details).

::In Visual Studio, the default target for Debug's write methods is the Output window. You can use Debug's Listeners property to access the associated TraceListenerCollection. The following code shows how to use the Remove and Add methods of the collection to control where debug messages are sent to. If you add more than one listener of the same type, the associated target receives the text multiple times.

The most notable class in this namespace is [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.managementobjectsearcher.aspx ManagementObjectSearcher], that you can use to retrieve management objects based on a WMI query.

::Information that can be retrieved this way ranges from computer case type (notebook, desktop...) over processor and hard disks details to information about running services and processes. Consult the [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394572.aspx WMI Reference on MSDN] for an overview of all WMI classes and their properties.

::In the example below a rough and dirty method is defined that prints all properties for all management information objects of a given WMI class. It is then used to print information about the current computer system.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Serialization and Input/Output==

'''Exam objective: '''Implementing serialization and input/output functionality in a .NET Framework application

===Topics===

====Serialization====

{{wikipedia|serialization}}
Wikipedia's definition for serialization is : &quot;in the context of data storage and transmission, serialization is the process of saving an object onto a storage medium (such as a file, or a memory buffer) or to transmit it across a network connection link in binary form&quot;.

The problem that is addressed here is that an object is created by a running process and is thus bound to the lifetime of that process instance. If for whatever reason, and there can be many, you want to &quot;transport&quot; the object in the context of another process instance you've got a problem, that you solve by &quot;saving&quot; the state of you object in the original process and &quot;restoring&quot; it in the destination process. This &quot;saving&quot; part is called serialization and the &quot;restoring&quot; part is called deserialization.

====Serializable attribute====

An object is serializable if its class name is prefixed with the [Serializable] attribute.

====Object Serialization====

One can use the [[Study Guides:Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)\Exam 70-536\BinaryFormatter class (Refer System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary namespace)|BinaryFormatter class]] to serialize an object.  To serialize, use the BinaryFormatter's Serialize() method which takes a stream and a serializable object as parameters.  To deserialize, use the BinaryFormatter's Deserialize() method which takes a stream as a parameter and returns a object that can be cast back to the original object type.  Remember to close streams after you use them by calling the stream's Close() method.

====XML Serialization====

One can use the [[Study Guides:Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)\Exam 70-536\XmlSerializer class (Refer System.Xml.Serialization)|XmlSerializer class]] to serialize an object.  To serialize, use the XmlSerializer's Serialize() method which takes a stream and a serializable object as parameters.  To deserialize, use the XmlSerializer's Deserialize() method which takes a stream as a parameter and returns a object that can be cast back to the original object type.  Remember to close streams after you use them by calling the stream's Close() method.

For an overview of XML and SOAP serialization see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/90c86ass.aspx MSDN]

====Custom Serialization====

The ISerializable interface allows an object to control its own serialization and deserialization. 

====Readers====

====Writers====

====Formatters====

A formatter is used to serialize objects into streams.

====Streams====

====File IO====

====Managing Byte Streams====

====Compression====

====Isolated storage====

==Security==

'''Exam objective: '''Improving the security of the .NET Framework applications by using the .NET Framework 2.0 security features

===Topics===

====Code access security====

{{wikipedia|Code access security}}
Code access security, CAS, allows the control of various permissions granted to specific managed applications. [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/930b76w0(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

Permissions allow access to system resources.  A permission set is a collection of permissions.  A code group relates exactly one permission set to exactly one evidence type.  Evidence is used to identify an assembly.  Evidence types can include the application directory, cryptographic hash of the assembly, publisher's digital signature, site from which the assembly was downloaded, cryptographic strong name of the assembly, URL from which the assembly was downloaded, and the security zone in which the assembly is running.  Security zones include the computer zone, local Intranet zone, Internet zone, trusted site, and untrusted sites.  See the Internet options security tab in Internet Explorer to view various security zones.  An assembly can be associated with multiple code groups.  Permission sets can be associated with multiple code groups.

A security policy is a logical grouping of code groups and permission sets.  An untrusted managed assembly must pass through four security policies:  The Enterprise security policy, machine security policy, user security policy, and application domain security policy.  Any one of these security policies can deny an untrusted managed assembly permissions.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Globalization, Drawing, and Text manipulation==

'''Exam objective: '''Implementing globalization, drawing, and text manipulation functionality in a .NET Framework application

===Topics===

====Globalization====

====Drawing====

====Text manipulation====

Text manipulation, in the context of the exam objectives, covers 3 main subjects: string building, regular expressions and text encoding. We look at each in the following paragraphs.

=====String and StringBuilder classes=====

Text manipulation starts with the representation of a string which is done via the [[#String class|String class]]. No specific exam objective mentions the String class but we added a section for it because you must understand some of its specific characteristics.

Next comes the [[#StringBuilder class|StringBuilder class]] that serves for efficient construction.

=====Regular expressions=====

{{wikipedia|Regular expressions}}
The [[#Regex_class|Regex]], [[#Match class and MatchCollection class|Match]] and [[#Group class and GroupCollection class|Group]] classes together implement the regular expressions support in the .NET framework.

Regular expressions are a world by themselves and have been around for quite some time.

There is a wikibook on [[regular Expressions|regular expressions]] which, among other things, point to this [http://en.kerouac3001.com/regex-tutorial-8.htm Tutorial].

Regular expressions support in .NET basically allows for:
*testing the match of a string to a regex pattern (Regex.IsMatch method) 
*extracting the substrings that &quot;match&quot; part of a pattern (Regex.Match method with Match and Group classes).

=====Text encoding=====

===Classes, Interfaces, and tools===

====Format data based on culture information.====

(Refer System.Globalization namespace)

====Text handling and regular expressions====

'''Exam objective: '''Enhance the text handling capabilities of a .NET Framework application, and search, modify, and control text in a .NET Framework application by using regular expressions

(Refer System.Text namespace)

(Refer System.RegularExpressions namespace) 

=====String class=====

The String class is '''not''' a specific exam objective but was added to have a place to discuss some of its characteristics. 

String class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

=====StringBuilder class=====

The StringBuilder class is used for very fast string concatenation. If you use conventional string concatenation
then it will run very slow because a string is held in an array. Each concatenation causes the array to increase its size
and the memory has to be copied to a new location internally. This is very slow.

For fast string concatenations use StringBuilder instead. It is about 1000 times faster (depending on the string
you concatenate). 

StringBuilder class - [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5fxz4s6t.aspx MSDN]


Refer to the example to measure the performance differences.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Preface==

Welcome to the 'Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation' module.

This book provides extensive &quot;textbook like&quot; coverage of the exam objectives associated with exam 70-536 of the Microsoft [[#Exam information and certifications|certification program]]. Those objectives cover the basic .NET class libraries and the interaction of a program with the .NET execution environment.

Please give us your feedback on the module so we can improve it (see [[talk:.NET Development Foundation|discussion page]]).

The preface contains information relevant to the context of the document, authors, wikibooks, etc. You can skip to the [[#Introduction|Introduction]] if you are primarily interested in the module content.

===Audience and other Wikibooks resources===

The audience for this study guide are software developers professionally interested in the .NET framework. [http://www.testslive.com/microsoft/ Microsoft] states in the Exam (70-536) [http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.mspx preparation guide] that &quot;Candidates should have at least two to three years of experience developing Web-based, Microsoft Windows-based, or distributed applications by using the .NET Framework 1.0, the .NET Framework 1.1, and the .NET Framework 2.0. Candidates should have a working knowledge of Visual Studio 2005.&quot;.

For this study guide we will just assume that readers know at least one of the .NET languages (VB.NET, C#, etc.), have access to Visual Studio and have some experience working with it.

Please note that the .NET platform is quite extensive and that a basic understanding of computer science is also assumed. For example, we will briefly discuss how object-orientation principles are implemented in the framework (from a developer point of view) but not the principles themselves, where do they come from, what specific problems they address, etc.

Wikibooks has other books both on VB, C# and .NET that are more introductory in nature:
* A description of [[.NET_Framework_3.0|NET 3.0 features]]
* An introduction to [[Visual_Basic_.NET|VB .NET]]
* A featured book on [[C_Sharp_Programming|C#]]

Finally, by &quot;professionally interested&quot; we refer to the fact that this book, along with the other certification study guides, provides an extensive coverage of the framework and demands a significant study time. So anybody that wants to get that kind of coverage and has some time to spare can join in!

===Contributions===

This module is far from over! Please do not hesitate to improve it as you see fit.

Just a couple of pointers though if you are a new contributor to wikibooks:

*Wikibooks are about textbooks not &quot;standard&quot; wikis. The project team is looking for continuous narratives that can be read from top to bottom. For somebody used to the MSDN type of documentation this can be a significant adjustment.

*Links only pages do not fit the above picture and are actively discouraged. If you create a page, be sure to have content to put on it :-)

*The administrators use templates to ask questions or notify of incomplete tasks. Those templates produce rather flashy notices that can be surprising at first. Don't worry about the look and ask for clarifications. The admins are very helpful and nice and will help you with whatever you may need.

*Code samples are very welcome and should be put in &quot;hidden&quot; sections to preserve the flow of the text. see [[/Configuration#Create_a_new_event_log|example section]]. A sample should be kept as short as possible but the space limitations of printed material obviously do not apply here. We thus encourage you to have complete, yet clear and simple, programs so they can be directly tested and used.

*Use the [[talk:.NET Development Foundation|discussion page]] for questions or comments.
*Use the official Actual4Exam's [http://www.actual4exam.com/70-536CSHARP.htm 70-536-CSHARP] or [http://www.actual4exam.com/70-536VB.htm 70-536-VB] Simulation PrepKit for passing the 70-536 exam.
*Try uCertify's [http://www.ucertify.com/exams/Microsoft/70-536-CSHARP.html 70-536-CSHARP] or [http://www.ucertify.com/exams/Microsoft/70-536-VB.html 70-536-VB] Simulation PrepKit for passing the 70-536 exam.
*Try qualitydumps [http://www.qualitydumps.com/70-536.html 70-536] or examsdeal [http://www.examsdeal.com/70-536.html 70-536] Simulation exam questions for passing the 70-536 exam.

===Exam information and certifications===

Current information on the exam can be found at [http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp#SKILLS MSDN Exam Information]

This module is the study guide for the first exam (70-536) for obtaining many Microsoft certifications:
*Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist: .NET Framework 2.0 Web Applications
*Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist: .NET Framework 2.0 Windows Applications
*Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist: .NET Framework 2.0 Distributed Applications
*[[Microsoft_Certified_Professional_Developer#Web_Developer|Microsoft Certified Professional Developer: Web development]]
*[[Microsoft_Certified_Professional_Developer#Windows_Developer|Microsoft Certified Professional Developer: Windows development]]
*[[Microsoft_Certified_Professional_Developer#Enterprise_Applications_Developer|Microsoft Certified Professional Developer: Enterprise application development]]

:If you contribute to this book, if you wish, please add your name here. The contributors for a specific article can be traced by its history.

''Please note that it is not wikibook's policy to have link only pages or pages with very few text. The preferred way is to have continuous textbooks that can be read from start to finish. The first contributions to this module where in the form of separate pages for each third or forth level exam objectives. This gave way to numerous pages that were merged into more consistent global pages. For links only page, this process had the adverse side effect of losing references to contributions made to those pages. For pages with text the change history were moved to the merged page.''

====70-536 Training kit====

.NET Framework Application Development Foundation Self-Paced Training Kit, Second Edition
Tony Northrup
Microsoft Press

We reference that book as the &quot;training kit&quot; since it is recommended by Microsoft as a training aid for the 70-536 exam (for example see [http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/winapps/default.mspx MCPD]).

If you use the training kit you might want to look [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959409 here] for a list of known corrections. Other potential corrections are listed in this wikibook.

====C Sharp 2005====

Visual C#: The language - 2005 Edition
Donis Marchall
Microsoft Press

Also recommended as a training aid for the 70-536 exam (for example see [http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/winapps/default.mspx MCPD])

====ECMA 335====

If you want to go deeper into the definition of the common language infrastructure you can download the [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm official specification]

This is not required for the exam but we will use the specification a couple of times to clarify ambiguities in the MSDN documentation or other reference manuals.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

== Welcome to the [[Java Programming]] book project ==

Welcome Cooper, I had been looking forward since ages now for a person who could actively participate with me in the [[Java Programming]] book project here. I needed to clean some stuff on the pages and would like you to help me.

First of all, I saw that you created and contributed to the following:
* [[Java Programming/FirstExamples‎]]
* [[Java Programming/BasicIO‎]]
* [[Java Programming/IntroToStreams&amp;Outputting Text]]
* [[Java Programming/SwingLargeExamples]]
* [[Java Programming/SwingLayouts]]

Now these page names are not according to Wikibook's [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming conventions]]. I will be moving these pages to their accurate names, please care to comment. Thanks. [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 19:13, 8 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

==A-Level Biology==

Hi, 

I have tried to have the correct classification for my chapters in my modules - so that there is a link to the parent page on the top of each chapters page as in http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Biology/Biology_Foundation/cell_structure for example;

'A-level Biology/Biology Foundation/cell structure
From Wikibooks, the open-content textbooks collection
 A-level Biology | Biology Foundation'

I was wondering if you could help classify the rest of the modules pages that'd be a fantastic help!

Thanks,

--[[User:Greenie|Greenie]] ([[User talk:Greenie|talk]]) 18:53, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

Hi, sorry, fixed it now! --[[User:Greenie|Greenie]] ([[User talk:Greenie|talk]]) 15:02, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

== edits to Question Writer 3 Manual ==

Hi I have noticed you have entered category links in sub pages of Question Writer 3 Manual that I am working on - is there a reason why?

thanks
[[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 16:14, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

OK I see why you have done that now (thanks :))- but am a little concerned that the link is red!  Clearly the book exists?  any clues?

== what is a &quot;book&quot; ==

See [[User_talk:Mike.lifeguard#what is a &quot;book&quot;]].  At this stage I am looking help identifying major flaws in algorithm, so I can fix them and then take the discussion to the village pump.  Feedback on my talk would be the best spot at the moment.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==

No matter how intelligently designed or unique you make the writing assignments for your students to do, the issue of grammar will most likely be a a subject you will have to addess in your class. Depending on the struggles students may have with grammar at this level, you can probably expect to include some grammar instruction in your classroom. However, with limited face-time with your class and a plethora of individual issues to cover, what are the most effective ways to deal with the grammatical errors that you may see your students making? The amount of grammar you cover will be entirely up to you, but the following ideas are meant to aid you in using this book in order to help students improve their writing skills as much as possible.





== '''Step 1''' ==

'''Using a Diagnostic'''

You may decide to use a grammar or writing diagnostic to determine the level of grammatical proficiency in your class, and from there decide how much class time you will want to spend focusing on grammar. The diagnostics will help tell you the pervasive problem areas and patterns that students exhibit, and this will help you develop a plan for what aspects to teach. For example, if most students have problems with verb tense, fragments, and parallelism, then these areas might be lessons you can actively teach the entire class about. If, however, only a few students use fragmented sentences in their writing, then other strategies may be needed.


== '''Step 2''' ==

'''Ideas to Help Teach Grammar'''

''Glossing''

This technique called &quot;glossing&quot; is one way to help students individually focus on one to three problem areas at a time. Once students turn in a paper to you, the easiest way to use this technique is to highlight the grammatical errors that you see them making over and over in their paper. Let's say that you have a student named Jackie who continually uses run on sentences, forgets to use commas after introductory clauses and switches verb tenses througout her paper. Highlight the grammatical errors you see in her paper (Focus on 3-5 only, or it will be overwhelming for her), label the highlighted portions as &quot;run-on,&quot; &quot;verb tense,&quot; etc...and then give her these instructions:
* Using the Rhetorical Composition Handbook, go to the section entitled, &quot;Writer's Handbook.&quot;
* Look up the rules that apply to run-ons, verb tense and commas. 
*Type three of the errors that were highlighted in your paper on a separate document, and then copy and paste the rules from the Writer's Handbook that will help you correct these errors.
* Type a corrected version of your glossed sentences to show that you recognize the grammatical errors that you made and understand the rule(s) that show you how to fix them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Yanking up and down will not help you at all.&quot; Wow, a little bit of a generalization there? Just because doing it slowly requires more energy, doing it fast still tires muscles, making it an efficient exercise. I don't know much about the utilization of muscles but I believe it requires more explosive, fast-twitch contractions, giving it a different outcome.

Push-ups use different muscles than pull-ups. Even if you could do one hundred push-ups you might not be able to do a single pull-up. Honestly, why would you say that?

Also, pull-ups and chin-ups are DIFFERENT THINGS. Why would you say that pull-ups are &quot;also called&quot; chin-ups? Stop writing articles!!!</text>

Mike,

[[User talk:Claurel]] mentioned to me that he'd received a copyvio notice with your signature for a page he'd recently created. Just so you know, we're in the process of migrating a [http://www.h-schmidt.net/celestia/ Celestia documentation Web page] originally written by Harald Schmidt into the [[Celestia]] Wikibook. This is being done with Harald's permission. He's no longer involved with Celestia and the page is woefully out of date.  ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 22:10, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Other evident flaws? ==

Hi Mike &lt;br&gt;
I have finished my first series of interventions on [[Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist/Exam_70-536]] (deleted link only pages, shorten paragraph header, added short introduction, etc.) 
Two questions from here:
*Could you take a look at the module to see if there are any other apparent flaws?
*Tell me if a future renaming of the pages would invalidate outside links pointing to them?
Thanks in advance --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] 05:26, 5 December 2007 (UTC)
:Short reply now; ask again later if you want more detail.
:When you move a page (be sure to use the ''move'' tab), a redirect is automatically created at the old location, which points to the new location. If the old location (ie where it is now) has redirects pointing to it, those need to be updated so they point to the new location. Otherwise, you will have a redirect pointing to a redirect pointing to a redirect (and the MediaWiki software won't do both redirects - you'll get stuck). Sequences like that get caught periodically at [[Special:Doubleredirects]], but it's better to avoid them in the first place.
:In essence you need to check &quot;what links here&quot; after moving, and fix the double redirects if any exist. For the most part, moving pages is safe (despite the warning that moving pages can be disruptive or whatever it says). Always move the talk page along with the module (there's a checkbox to bring it along automatically, no need to do a separate move)
:That turned out to not be very short :P &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:56, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

==Moving a book to Strategy Wiki==
You suggested I move my book to strategywiki. How do I go about doing so?
[[User:Connor.rosen|Connor.rosen]] 05:29, 5 December 2007 (UTC)
:[[strategywiki:Main Page|StrategyWiki]] seems to have Special:Import enabled. You'll want to find an administrator at that wiki, and ask them to import the pages. They may have a page where such requests are listed. Once that's done, please come back to Wikibooks, and add {{tlx|delete|transwikied to [[strategywiki:Main Page|StrategyWiki]]}} so we can delete it once the content has been moved. Thanks! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:07, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

==Intuitive template?==

The down arrows on the [[Featured_books|featured books]] template don't seem to be intuitive to me.  In fact, when I first came across this template in Featured Books I didnt notice them and wondered where the detailed write ups had gone. Consider a new user who has no idea that there might be write ups accessed by the down arrows, they will click on the headings and get the library catalogue.  Having got one result they might not then suspect that the down arrows also have a different function. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:22, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

:He probably considers the template intuitive now, because I changed the behavior so that anywhere within the titlebox (besides the links) can be clicked now to expand/collapse the boxes, and when rolled over the titlebox changes color and shows a tooltip that says &quot;show contents&quot; or &quot;hide contents&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:16, 5 December 2007 (UTC)
:I also removed the links, which made the behaviour slightly non-intuitive; the links are no inside the template body, and link to Subject: pages instead. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:32, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

== CompactTOCs (en.wp) ==

[[W:Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 November 27#CompactTOCs merge and rename]] closed in favor of the merge.  Thanks for volunteering to help; I honestly haven't run AWB in almost a year, so it would probably be best if someone more currently versed in its behavior fired it up.  My immediate take its that replacing CompactTOC2 (the original one) would be the first step, so that CompactTOC8 can take its place, then all the others can be changed to refer to (the new) CompactTOC2.  I suppose an admin will need to be involved in that transition, since the original will need to be deleted and TOC8 moved over it. I imagine that the closing admin would do that when asked. — &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Tahoma;&quot;&gt;[[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#91;[[User talk:SMcCandlish|talk]]&amp;#93; &amp;#91;[[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|cont]]&amp;#93;  &lt;b&gt;‹(-¿-)›&lt;/b&gt; 05:12, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

Hey Mike, [[User:‎James Fogal]] posted a lot of stuff (which I just marked) which is direct copyvios, I'd warn him about it but to be honest I'm not sure what template to use, do you know which one is typically used to warn people against this?

== I apologize for my late reply ==

First, my comments were directed to the nice box you put on the page that said 'contributors' instead of 'Wikibookians' (which, is still, as funny as last night). I think you really worked hard to make a nice centered box, complete with a nice little stop sign, which, as you seem to be of great importance, is also at the top of this page.

My IP has changed, so I apologize that you can't see said stop sign.
*I think you tried really hard.

As usual, I still say the [[User:Jimbo_Wales]] comment was mis-guided, but as you are indeed so important perhaps you could delete that page anyway. it didn't/doesn't really help anyone. Or be bold (or italic) and just merge it to whatever it's supposed to be merged to.

Yeah.

::::::I'll reformulate this since I don't think you are understanding what I'm stating. If attribution is given to Wikipedia, the requirement to use traswiki is secondary (not a legal requirement to conform to the GFDL we use), but of course if possible it should be performed since it preserves more information. I also referred that prior to the possibility of transwiki the first option was the only one available. Personally and regarding Wikibooks it is my opinion that doing the transwiki without giving acknowledgment to Wikipedia on specific books should not be done especially since the history information is highly volatile and hard to port to other mediums.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:02, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

Howdy, the author has done some large updates to [[w:Clock recovery]].  Could you reimport it over to  [[Transwiki:Clock recovery]]?

:I assume you're welcome to contribute there without an account, though I'm not sure why you wouldn't be able to register one. You might ask an administrator at strategywiki about that.

==POLT book cover==
Hello Mike,

I am a GA of Dr. Bonk's POLT Wikibook website, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Learning_Theories. 
As I explained before, Dr. Bonk personally hired a graphic artist for the POLT bookcover for this Wikibook, so he owns the book cover image. I think I already provided enough information of the license for this several times when I uploaded the image file. Please let me know if I did something wrong. 
And is there any way to post it on his Wikibook, except proving free license for it? Please let me know if you want to contact Dr. Bonk in person for this issue. In fact, he wants to let you know his phone number and email address. I think it would not be a good idea to provide his contact information here.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:156.56.193.69|156.56.193.69]] ([[User talk:156.56.193.69|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/156.56.193.69|contribs]]) 19:07, December 21, 2007.&lt;/small&gt;
:As I said, it was initially claimed that the uploader was the artist. If that were the case, then we wouldn't accept a fair use claim on the image - it would have to be used under a free license. Since that's not the case, a fair use claim is fine (though we'd still prefer a free license instead). I'll restore the image in a few minutes if not already done. If you'd like to provide contact information privately, you can [[Special:Emailuser/Mike.lifeguard|email]] me. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:47, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

== Re: Thanks ==

Thanks all, it's very appreciated. You're taking so much time to show me how to use the thing that I though that some general clean-up work would be appropriate. I'll return to my .NET things for the next few days though. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 23:32, 21 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''''Amelanchier''''', also known as '''shadbush''', '''serviceberry''', '''sarvisberry''', '''juneberry''', '''saskatoon''', '''shadblow''', '''shadwood''', '''sugarplum''', '''wild-plum''', and '''mespilus''',is a genus of about 20 species of small deciduous trees and large shrubs in the family Rosaceae.

The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxomically in North America, especially in the northern United States and southern Canada, and is native to every state of the United States except Hawaii. Two species also occur in Asia, and one in Europe. These plants are valued horticulturally, and their fruits are important to wildlife. The systematics (taxonomy) of shadbushes has long perplexed botanists, horticulturalists, and others, as suggested by the range in number of species recognized in the genus from 6 to 33 in two recent publications.&lt;ref&gt;Landry, P. (1975). Le concept d'espece et la taxinomie du genre Amelanchier (Rosacees). ''Bull. Soc. Bot. France'' 122: 43-252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, J. B., Robertson, K. R., Smith, P. G., &amp; Rohrer, J. R. (1990). A checklist of the subfamily Maloideae (Rosaceae). ''Canad. J. Bot''. 68: 2209-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of complexity comes from the occurrence of apomixis (asexual seed production), polyploidy, and hybridization. &lt;ref name=umaine&gt;University of Maine: [http://biology.umaine.edu/Amelanchier ''Amelanchier'' Systematics and Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the generic name ''Amelanchier'' is probably derived from the Provençal name of the European ''[[../Amelanchier ovalis/]]''. The name serviceberry comes from the similarity of the fruit to the related European ''[[../Sorbus/]]''. A widespread folk etymology states that the plant's flowering time signaled to early American pioneers that the ground had thawed enough in spring for the burial of the winter's dead. Juneberry refers to the fruits of certain species becoming ripe in June. The name Saskatoon originated from a Cree Native American noun ''misâskwatômina'' (''misāskwatōmina'', ''misaaskwatoomina'') for ''Amelanchier alnifolia''. The city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is named after this plant.

==Description==
''Amelanchier'' species grow to 0.2–20 m tall, arborecent or suckering and forming loose colonies or dense clumps to single-stemmed. The bark is gray or less often brown, smooth or fissuring in older trees. The leaves are deciduous, cauline, alternate, simple, lanceolate to elliptic to orbiculate, 0.5–10 x 0.5–5.5 cm, thin to coriaceous, with surfaces abaxially glabrous or densely tomentose at flowering, abaxially glabrous or more or less hairy at maturity. The inflorescences are terminal, with 1–20 flowers, erect or drooping, either in clusters of one to four flowers, or in racemes with 4–20 flowers. The flowers have five white (rarely somewhat pink, yellow, or streaked with red), linear to orbiculate petals, 2.6–25 mm long, occasionally andropetalous (bearing apical microsporangia adaxially; only known in this genus in A. nantucketensis). The flowers appear in early spring, &quot;when the shad run&quot; according to tradition (leading to names such as &quot;shadbush&quot;). The fruit is a berry-like pome, red to purple to nearly black at maturity, 5–15 mm diameter, insipid to delectably sweet, maturing in summer.&lt;ref name=umaine/&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

Several natural hybrids also exist. A taxon commonly cited as ''[[../Amelanchier lamarckii/]]'' F.G.Schroed. is very widely cultivated and naturalized in Europe, where it was introduced in the 17th century; it is known to be of North American origin, probably from eastern Canada. It is not currently known to occur in the wild, and is probably of hybrid origin between ''A. laevis'' and either ''A. arborea'' or ''A. canadensis''; it is apomictic and breeds true from seed.&lt;ref name=bean1&gt;Bean, W. J. (1976). ''Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles'' 8th ed., vol. 1. John Murray ISBN 0-7195-1790-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-220013-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The fruit of several species are excellent to eat raw, tasting like a slightly nutty blueberry, though their popularity with birds makes harvesting difficult. Fruit is harvested locally for pies and jams. The saskatoon berry is harvested commercially. The Native American food pemmican was flavored by shadbush fruits in combination with fat and dried meats, and the stems were made into arrow shafts.

Several species are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their flowers, bark, and fall color. Most need similar conditions to grow well, requiring good drainage, air circulation (to discourage leaf diseases), watering during drought and acceptable soil. One exception is ''A. bartramiana'' which, among other places in the wild, has been found growing in swamps and bogs.&lt;ref name=umaine4&gt;University of Maine: [http://sbe.umaine.edu/amelanchier/?page_id=149 ''Amelanchier bartramiana'']&lt;/ref&gt; Note that species names are often used interchangeably in the nursery trade. Many A. arborea plants that are offered for sale are actually hybrids, or entirely different species.

The wood is brown, hard, close-grained, and heavy. The heartwood is reddish-brown, and the sapwood is lighter in color. It can be used for tool handles and fishing rods.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagation is by seed, divisions and grafting. Serviceberries graft so readily that grafts with other genera, such as ''[[../Crataegus/]]'' and ''[[../Sorbus/]]'', are often successful.

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==
''Amelanchier'' are preferred browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of Lepidoptera such as [[w:Brimstone Moth]], [[w:Brown-tail]], [[w:Grey Dagger]], [[w:Mottled Umber]], [[w:Rough Prominent]], [[w:Satellite (moth)|The Satellite]], [[w:Winter Moth]], ''[[w:Limenitis arthemis]]'' and other herbivorous insects also have a taste for serviceberry. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and ''[[../Gymnosporangium/]]'' [[../rust/]]. In years when late flowers overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial [[../fireblight/]].

Is the case statement supposed to fall through to the next case, or is this simply false laziness? [[User:Puckdropper|Puckdropper]] ([[User talk:Puckdropper|talk]]) 22:59, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

: Never mind, when the program hits the return statement it won't go to the next case.  I'd probably use a break; anyway, but that's just a style issue.  [[User:Puckdropper|Puckdropper]] ([[User talk:Puckdropper|talk]]) 01:40, 15 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

'''Phones''' are every possible sound that the human mouth can make.  As well as the ''regular'' sounds of language, this includes hissing through your teeth, smacking your lips, and waggling your tongue.  There are thousands of possible phones.

== The phoneme/allophone distinction ==

The phones that occur in a language are usually divided up into two categories: phonemes and allophones.  The difference between the two is sometimes summarised like this:  &quot;Allophones are what the speaker says, and phonemes are what the listener hears&quot;.

=== Phonemes ===

'''Phonemes''' are the individual sounds that makes up syllables in a language. For example, in the word &quot;tin&quot;, there are three sounds:
#The &quot;t&quot; sound
#The &quot;i&quot; sound
#The &quot;n&quot; sound

So what's so special about a phoneme, you ask? Isn't it the same as a phone? Well no, some phones aren't phonemes. For example, if you cough, that's a sound that you're making with your mouth, but it's certainly not a phoneme, since it is not going to be a part of any English word that you're likely to speak. But languages don't usually have the same phonemes. If you smack your lips together, say, that's not a phoneme in the language you speak (English), but it is in some languages of southern Africa &amp;mdash; they use this sound as part of their words. And depending on where you're from, you might roll your tongue in such basic words like &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;hard&quot;, but this is actually one of the rarest phonemes to be found in all the languages of the world!

Here are more examples of English words split into phonemes:

*&quot;shape&quot; is made up of the &quot;sh&quot; phoneme /{{CXS|S}}/, the &quot;ay&quot; phoneme /{{CXS|ei}}/, and the &quot;p&quot; phoneme /{{CXS|p}}/.
*&quot;knife&quot; is made up of the &quot;n&quot; phoneme /{{CXS|n}}/, the &quot;eye&quot; phoneme /{{CXS|ai}}/, and the &quot;f&quot; phoneme /{{CXS|f}}/.
*&quot;complexity&quot; is made up of the following eleven phonemes: &quot;k&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|k}}/, &quot;uh&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|@}}/, &quot;m&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|m}}/, &quot;p&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|p}}/, &quot;l&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|l}}/, &quot;eh&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|E}}/, &quot;k&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|k}}/, &quot;s&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|s}}/, &quot;ih&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|I}}/, &quot;t&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|t}}/, &quot;ee&quot;&amp;nbsp;/{{CXS|i}}/.

''Note that we're talking about sounds here, not letters, so all the silent letters and irregular spellings are ignored. Furthermore, &quot;x&quot; is two sounds, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, while &quot;sh&quot; is one sound &amp;mdash; just &quot;sh&quot;, not &quot;s&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.''

So when you're conlanging, first consider this: what phonemes do you have? If you just make up words on the fly, eventually you're going to use up all of the phonemes of English (and no more), giving you a phonology that's precisely the same as English. To avoid this problem, it's much better to have an idea of the phonemes that you have, and make up words according to ''those''. This way you can have a language that sounds like itself, and not like English.

=== Allophones ===

Say &quot;ssss&quot; to yourself, &quot;s&quot; as in &quot;snake&quot; or &quot;soon&quot;. You'll notice that the sound is coming from the tip of your tongue, which is resting flat against the roof of your mouth. Now, while still hissing to yourself, vary it a bit; move it forwards and backwards; perhaps lower your tongue and raise it again. You may notice that as long as you don't go too far, it still sounds like &quot;s&quot; to you &amp;mdash; even though it may sound a bit different, it's still the same basic sound.

That's what &quot;allophone&quot; means.  As long as you're within reasonable bounds, you can make a lot of sounds that are a little different from each other, but they're still the same basic sound, or phoneme.  Those individual variations are allophones.

Now, why is this important? Well, what are allophones in one language may not be in another. The different &quot;s&quot;s that you pronounced just now may sound the same to you, but they are considered as two or more different phonemes in Basque, a language of northern Spain. If you were speaking Basque, you'd have to distinguish a &quot;sharp s&quot; and a &quot;regular s&quot; &amp;mdash; sounds that may sound exactly the same to you! Tonal languages go even further &amp;mdash; in Chinese, the syllable &quot;ma&quot; can change into the word for &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;scold&quot;, and even &quot;hemp&quot; (yeah that's right) depending on the tone that you &quot;sing&quot; it with. Again, to the untrained ear, these sound almost exactly the same. On the other hand, the words &quot;beet&quot; and &quot;bit&quot; may sound very different to you, but in many languages, the &quot;ee&quot; and &quot;ih&quot; sounds sound like the exact same phoneme. This is why people all over the world, from France to China to Japan to Brazil, all end up pronouncing English &quot;this&quot; as &quot;zees&quot;. (The &quot;z&quot; is another case in point &amp;mdash; the &quot;th&quot; and &quot;z&quot; sounds sound different to you, but they are likely to sound the same to a non-English speaker.)

So when you're conlanging, make sure to remember that if you're including new sounds that don't exist in the English language, those are going to sound pretty confusing (even to yourself) for a while. That's okay &amp;mdash; it simply means that you're an English speaker, attuned to the sounds of English, not your conlang (yet). Trust that the conpeople speaking your conlang are not going to have trouble with sounds that you yourself cannot tell apart or even pronounce.

Sometimes allophones appear depending on environment.  For example, the English sound /{{CXS|p}}/ consists of two main allophones: [{{CXS|p}}] and [{{CXS|p_h}}] (&quot;unaspirated&quot; and &quot;aspirated&quot;). [{{CXS|p_h}}] is pronounced with a small puff of air afterwards.  Put your hand in front of your mouth and feel for the puff of air in the word &quot;pat&quot; (with an aspirated p).  Then compare the airflow from the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spat&quot; (unaspirated).  While this distinction may seem almost unnoticeable to an English speaker, since they are allophones in English and our mind isn't in the mode to interpret them separately, there are languages where they are separate phonemes and are distinguished &amp;mdash; Quechua, for example.

So if you have two sounds in a given language, how do you know whether they are different phonemes, or just allophones of the same phoneme?  Well, one way is to find a ''minimal pair''.  A minimal pair is a pair of two words that are exactly the same except for the sound in question.  For example, &quot;bat&quot; and &quot;pat&quot; are pronounced the same except for the initial consonant.  In English, a speaker can distinguish between the two words, so that means that /{{CXS|b}}/ and /{{CXS|p}}/ are separate phonemes word-initially.  There are languages where &quot;bat&quot; and &quot;pat&quot; would sound the same to the speakers, and in those languages [{{CXS|b}}] and [{{CXS|p}}] probably are allophones.  Similarly, in English [{{CXS|p}}] and [{{CXS|p_h}}] do not form any minimal pairs, but in Quechua, they do.

=== Writing Phonemes and Allophones ===

In the [[../../Sound_notation|Sound notation]] section we told you how linguists distinguish writing from speech by putting writing in &lt;angle brackets&gt; and sounds in /slashes/.  We can now introduce you to the full system.  It's actually '''phonemes''' (rather than just &quot;sounds&quot;) that are written in /slashes/.  To write '''allophones''', linguists surround them with [square brackets].

*Example &amp;mdash; In English, [{{CXS|p}}] and [{{CXS|p_h}}] are both allophones of the phoneme /{{CXS|p}}/ which is written as &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;.

== The Vowel/Consonant Distinction ==

In the Beginner section on sounds, we saw that sounds can be divided into two groups:  consonants and vowels.

English &amp;mdash; though, like all languages, it varies from dialect to dialect &amp;mdash; usually contains about 25 consonants and 19 vowels (and not 21 consonants and 5 vowels as one might assume when looking at the alphabet).

=== Vowels ===

Different vowels can be described using two main criteria:

==== Height ====

How high or low a vowel is.  This is basically a fancy name for saying how wide you open your mouth to say it.  Low vowels require opening wide, and high vowels don't.  Just think of it as how &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; your jaw needs to be &amp;mdash; the lower the jaw, the wider you need to open your mouth.

*High vowels: /{{CXS|i}}/ &lt;peat&gt;, /{{CXS|u}}/ &lt;boot&gt;
*Mid-height vowels: /{{CXS|e}}/ &lt;pet&gt;, /{{CXS|o}}/ &lt;pot&gt;, /{{CXS|@}}/  &lt;putt&gt;
*Low vowels: /{{CXS|a}}/ &lt;pat&gt;, /{{CXS|A}}/

Some people call these &quot;close&quot; (for high), &quot;mid&quot; (for mid-height), and &quot;open&quot; (for low).

==== Backness ====

How front or back a vowel is.  This is a bit harder to describe, but it's basically where the highest part of your tongue is &amp;mdash; whether it's at the front of your mouth or the back of your mouth.

*Front vowels: /{{CXS|e}}/ &lt;pet&gt;, /{{CXS|i}}/ &lt;peat&gt;
*Central vowels: /{{CXS|@}}/ &lt;putt&gt;, /{{CXS|a}}/ &lt;pat&gt;
*Back vowels: /{{CXS|A}}/, /{{CXS|o}}/ &lt;pot&gt;, /{{CXS|u}}/ &lt;boot&gt;

Tip: If you're having trouble grasping this concept, try putting a tootsie pop in your mouth and saying various vowels. You'll be more able to feel the height and frontness of the different sounds.

==== Other features ====

Vowels also have some other features which aren't as important as the ones above. All languages distinguish their vowels using both height and backness, but the following distinctions are optional; feel free to play around with them and perhaps, if you're feeling confident, include one in your conlang. We'll go into more detail about these in the Advanced level.

* Rounding &amp;mdash; the amount of rounding of the lips when pronouncing the vowel. Typically, front vowels are unrounded, back vowels rounded. Almost all languages have some rounded vowels, but that doesn't mean that they have a roundness distinction. The key is having at least one pair of vowel phonemes that differ from each other only by whether they're rounded or not. French and German are examples of languages that contrast roundness.

* Length &amp;mdash; the time duration of the vowel.  Many languages contrast ''long'' and ''short'' forms of a vowel (By the way, English isn't one of them.  The vowels traditionally called &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; in English actually differed that way about a thousand years ago, but then came a change in English pronunciation now called the Great Vowel Shift, and after that, the traditional names didn't correspond to actual vowel length any more.) &lt;!-- that's quite a big diversion. do we need it? --&gt;

* Nasalization &amp;mdash; whether or not air is allowed to flow through the nose when pronouncing the vowel.  If it is, the vowel is ''nasal'', otherwise it's ''oral''.  Vowel nasalization is contrastive in some languages, like Portuguese and French, but not in English.

* R-coloring &amp;mdash; in practice, an &quot;r-colored vowel&quot; (also called a &quot;rhotic vowel&quot; or &quot;vocalic r&quot;) isn't really a vowel at all: it's an &quot;r&quot; sound used as the nucleus of a syllable, ''as if'' it were a vowel.  (Syllable nucleus will be explained in the next section, on [[../Syllables|syllables]].)

=== Consonants ===

Consonants are sounds that are produced by constricting the airflow at one or more points along the vocal tract.

Just like vowels, consonants can vary in many ways.

==== Manner ====

The '''manner of articulation''' basically corresponds to how strong the consonants are and how much they disrupt the airflow from the lungs. The plosives are pronounced with the tongue (or other part of the lower jaw) touching the roof of the mouth. As consonants get weaker the gap between the top of the mouth and the bottom gets larger and the mouth lets the air through more directly.

*Plosives (strongest): /{{CXS|p}}/, /{{CXS|d}}/, /{{CXS|g}}/
*Nasals: /{{CXS|m}}/, /{{CXS|n}}/, /{{CXS|N}}/ (the sound of &lt;ng&gt; in &lt;sing&gt;)
*Fricatives: /{{CXS|f}}/, /{{CXS|s}}/, /{{CXS|z}}/
*Approximants (weakest): /{{CXS|r\}}/ (&lt;r&gt; in &lt;race&gt;), /{{CXS|w}}/, /{{CXS|l}}/

==== Place ====

The '''place of articulation''' &amp;mdash; Like the vowels, consonants differ depending on how far forward or back they are.  Different parts of the mouth are used for different positions.  For example, the lips are used to make some of the more frontal consonants while the palate is further back.  This part is complicated because some sounds use a combination of the features (for example &quot;w&quot; uses both the lips and the back of the mouth).

*Labial: /{{CXS|b}}/, /{{CXS|m}}/
*Coronal: /{{CXS|s}}/, /{{CXS|t}}/
*Dorsal: /{{CXS|N}}/, /{{CXS|k}}/

Labial consonants are the furthest forward, and are pronounced using the lips. A little further back we have the coronal consonants which are pronounced using the teeth or the alveolar ridge (a &quot;bump&quot; just behind the teeth). Dorsal consonants are at the back of the mouth and are pronounced using the hard palate (middle roof of the mouth) or the velum (or soft palate: back roof of the mouth).

It's important to understand that labial, coronal, and dorsal are all groups of articulations that can be subdivided into more precise terms. For example &amp;mdash; Coronal can be subdivided into ''dental'', ''alveolar'', and ''retroflex''. We don't expect you to understand all these subdivisions, but you should be aware that they exist.

==== Voice ====

Place the palm of your hand against the base of your neck just below your adam's apple and start pronouncing the /{{CXS|f}}/ sound, the first sound in the word &lt;fit&gt;. Try to draw the sound out for a few seconds, as though you were saying &quot;ffffff&quot;. Now do the same with the /{{CXS|v}}/ sound as in &lt;very&gt;, &quot;vvvvvv&quot;. You should immediately feel a vibration in your throat when you say /{{CXS|v}}/ that doesn't occur when you say /{{CXS|f}}/. This vibration is called ''voicing'' and the thing inside your throat that is vibrating is called your ''vocal cords''.

The consonants that are pronounced together with this vibration are called ''voiced'' consonants. Those consonants that do not vibrate the vocal cords are called ''unvoiced''.

*Unvoiced consonants: /{{CXS|p}}/ /{{CXS|f}}/ /{{CXS|s}}/
*Voiced consonants: /{{CXS|b}}/ /{{CXS|v}}/ /{{CXS|z}}/

Most languages make use of both voiced and unvoiced consonants, but there are plenty that do not. If you decide that your conlang doesn't care about voicing then you should use the unvoiced letters when you're describing the sounds of your language. If you're feeling particularly adventurous then you may want to research a concept related to voicing called ''aspiration'' which you can think of as a kind of &quot;super-unvoiced&quot; or &quot;whispered&quot; form that some consonants can have.

If you experiment with the hand-on-throat trick a little you may discover that voicing also applies to vowels. All vowels in English have that same vibration as voiced consonants. Unvoiced vowels do exist but they're pretty rare because they can be difficult to hear accurately.

==== More terms ====

Terms for describing consonants aren't neatly divided into the basic terms given above, and esoteric terms that clearly belong at the Advanced level.  There are a lot of middling-difficult terms.  You don't really need them for the rest of the Intermediate level of this book (once we're off this page, Intermediate Phones); but in discussions of conlanging, it's likely that one or another of them will come up from time to time.  To keep your head above water when following such discussions, you don't need a detailed technical knowledge of all these terms, but it will help if you have some idea what they're about.

To start with, you can look over the row and column headings of the main table of consonant sounds in our CXS appendix, '''[[{{BOOKNAME}}/Appendix/CXS#Consonant sounds|here]]'''.  The column headings name many more precise places of articulation than just the three we've mentioned (labial, coronal, and dorsal), and the row headings name several more manners of articulation.

Here are some other terms that may be useful to have some clue about, and clues to a few of the more opaque of those row and column headings.

; Nasalized : pronounced while allowing airflow through the nose. Similar to the vowel term of the same name.
; Labialized : pronounced with the lips rounded, which would be called ''rounded'' if the sound were a vowel.
; Geminated : extended in time duration, which would be called ''long'' if the sound were a vowel.
; Stop, occlusive : synonyms for ''plosive''.
; Glide, semivowel, non-syllabic vowel : all synonyms, for any approximant that is very similar to some high vowel.
; Trill : a consonant such as the rolled&amp;nbsp;R of Spanish,&amp;nbsp; /{{CXS|r}}/.
; Tap, flap : like a trill, but with just one staccato sound instead of a series of them.
; Rhotic : either a trill, or an approximant similar to English&amp;nbsp;R,&amp;nbsp; /{{CXS|r\}}/.
; Lateral : a consonant similar to English&amp;nbsp;L,&amp;nbsp; /{{CXS|l}}/.  Consonants that aren't lateral are sometimes called ''central'' &amp;mdash; which is completely different from what ''central'' means when applied to a vowel.
; Liquid : either a lateral approximant, or a rhotic.  (All approximants are either liquids or glides.)
; Affricate : a sound that starts out as a plosive and ends up as a fricative, like the sound of English &amp;lt;ch&amp;gt;,&amp;nbsp; /{{CXS|tS)}}/.
; Coarticulated : using more than one place of articulation at the same time.  English&amp;nbsp;W,&amp;nbsp; /{{CXS|w}}/,&amp;nbsp; does this.
; Apical, laminal : these terms refer to which part of the tongue is used.
; Cerebral : an occasionally used synonym for ''retroflex'' (one of the column headings).

=== The sonority hierarchy ===

There is some order to this welter of sounds, and it's called the '''sonority hierarchy'''.  It arranges all the different kinds of consonants and vowels into a single scale according to, essentially, how free the airflow is, unifying the properties of consonant &quot;strength&quot; and vowel &quot;height&quot;.  At one end of the scale are the strongest consonants, and then increasingly weak consonants until the weakest consonants give way to the high vowels; at the far end of the scale are the low vowels.

Here is a typical version of the hierarchy.  Not everyone agrees on some details of the ordering.  Note that the term ''sonorant'' defies the vowel/consonant distinction, as it includes both all the vowels and some of the weaker consonants. The table goes from most sonorous at the top to least sonorous at the bottom.

This article has only one contributor. Therefore, it may suck (at looking good), be totally off-track (and be in a trainwreck), or be one-sided (how does this apply to Biology articles?). So &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:AP Biology/Genes and How They Work|action=edit}} &lt;span style=&quot;color: #002BB8&quot;&gt;jump in&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; and prevent the potential kitten death toll.
&lt;/div&gt;
==The Basics==
Of course, let's start off simple. A '''gene''' is a piece of [[AP_Biology/DNA|DNA]] which codes for one specific protein. A human has tens of thousands of genes! For example, the TP53 gene codes for the p53 protein. Special enzymes go in to the nucleus and &quot;read&quot; genes. They make a copy out of '''RNA'''. RNA is exactly the same thing as DNA, but is different because:

* RNA is not stuck inside the nucleus like DNA is,
* RNA is single-stranded, and
* RNA uses the base '''uracil''' instead of '''thymine'''.

The RNA is given to '''ribosomes''', which read the RNA strand and uses the information on the RNA to make '''polypeptide chains''', which then fold and - voila! - you have yourself a ready-to-go '''protein'''. Polypeptide chains are a giant strand of linked '''amino acids'''. There are twenty essential amino acids necessary to make protein.

This whole process is called '''expression''', which basically means that whatever the particular gene codes for is being put into action.

==The Tougher Stuff==
Now we're getting into details. Don't read this part until you understand the fundamentals. You might get confused and then have an incorrect perception of what we're going to say here!

This whole big thing is split up into two processes: '''transcription''' and '''translation'''. '''Transcription''', process that comes first, is when DNA is copied into an RNA strand. '''Translation''', on the other hand, is the reading of the information on that RNA strand, and making a protein based on that RNA strand.

===About RNA===
Before we go too far into the deep ocean of information, we need to know some more about RNA.

There are actually three kinds of RNA:

* '''Messenger RNA''', also called '''mRNA''', is the copy of the DNA which the ribosomes read.
* '''Ribosomal RNA''', or '''rRNA''', makes up the ribosomes. This RNA has no genetic information in it whatsoever.
* '''Transfer RNA''', or '''tRNA''', bring amino acids to the ribosome during translation. (Don't worry too much about this - yet - we'll go over it in more depth in the translation section.)

===Transcription===
When a gene is ready to be expressed, '''transcription initiation factors''' go in, along with '''RNA Polymerase''', and bind to the DNA in a place called the '''promoter'''. (The RNA Polymerase is the big cheese here - it actually copies the DNA into the mRNA strand. Transcription Initiation Factors are only there to help the RNA Polymerase bind to the DNA.) RNA Polymerase then unwinds and splits apart a segment of the DNA to make a transcription bubble (otherwise RNA Polymerase cannot read the nucleotide sequence, as the nucleotides on both sides of the DNA are stuck together by hydrogen bonds). The transcription initiation factors leave. Then, by the rules of '''complimentarity''',  RNA polymerase starts transcribing the DNA from the template strand. Here's how it would work (the coding sequence is entirely fictional):
[[File:simple transcription elongation1.svg|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription elongation]]
Here's the DNA segment RNA polymerase wants to transcribe:

{| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | T
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | C
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | G
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
|}

RNA Polymerase reads the first nucleotide, and as, by the rules of complementarity, '''thymine''' pairs up with '''adenine''' ('''^''' indicates the current position of RNA polymerase):

{| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | T
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | C
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | G
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
|-
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | ^
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|}

Because RNA uses '''uracil''' instead of '''thymine''', RNA polymerase would assign a uracil nucleotide for position 2:


{| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | T
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | C
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | G
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A

| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|}

'''Cytosine''' pairs up with '''guanine''':


{| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;

| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | A
| style=&quot;width: 25px&quot; | C

{| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;

Once RNA Polymerase is done making the mRNA strand, the mRNA strand is released along with RNA Polymerase, and the DNA reforms into a double helix.

However, our little friend, mRNA, isn't done here. The mRNA strand, the '''primary mRNA''' strand, is given a '''5' cap''' (a modified guanine nucleotide) and a '''poly-A tail''' (just a series of adenine nucleotides). Then '''spliceosomes''' go in and cut off parts of the mRNA. This isn't random; what the spliceosomes are cutting off are the '''intron''' segments of the RNA, and leaving only the '''exons'''. Exons are the part of the genetic information which code for the protein (the parts that get EXpressed). Introns don't code for a protein. Then why are they there? They used to be called garbage, but now scientists think that introns might have some function. We used to think that humans have about 100,000 genes, but now it turns out we might only have about 30,000! How are we supposed to be alive with just 30,000? Well, there are different hypotheses. One hypothesis is that these introns might have an enzymatic function. Another is that introns allow the exons to be rearranged so that instead of just one protein you can make hundreds. Or the introns are some kind of molecular signals which tell the cells what to do.

Well, back to Earth. Once the cap and the poly-A tail are added, and the introns are spliced, we have a mature mRNA. It is important to note that prokaryotes do not have spliceosomes, and therefore do not have introns.

===Translation===
====tRNAs====
Before we get too deep into translation, you'll need to learn more about '''tRNA'''s.

As you read in [[#The_Basics|the basics]], you learned that tRNAs bring amino acids to the ribosomes. But how?

[[File:TRNA.png|350px|right|thumb|In this case, the amino acid is leucine.]]Here's how. tRNAs are a chunk of RNA which have two important things: the amino acid itself, and the '''anticodon'''. The sequence of the three-nucleotide anticodon (ribosomes read by three - three nucleotides together are a '''codon''') determines which amino acid is attached. For instance, if a tRNA molecule has the anticodon CCA, CCG, CCU, or CCC, the tRNA molecule will have the amino acid glycine. 

====Ribosomes====
Ribosomes are made up of rRNA. They actually make the polypeptide chain which folds to become a protein. But how?

Ribosomes right off the shelf require some assembly, as they come in two halves, or '''ribosomal subunits'''. You really can't call them halves, though, as one &quot;half&quot; is bigger than the other.

====The process====
The first step is when the large and small ribosomal subunits snap onto a strand of mRNA. Now this is where the transfer RNA comes in. A transfer RNA comes in (the first '''codon''', which is 3 nucleotides together, always dictates for methionine [AUG]) and latches on to the first codon by its '''anticodon'''. Now the second tRNA comes in and bonds to the second codon. The ribosome then &lt;small&gt;*snap!*&lt;/small&gt; takes off the amino acid off the first tRNA and bonds it to the amino acid of the second tRNA. Then the first tRNA runs off to get another amino acid, while the ribosome moves along the mRNA, allowing another tRNA to bond to the third codon. This process repeats over and over until the ribosome gets to the stop codon on the mRNA, at which point a '''release factor''' binds to the stop codon (as the stop codon has no corresponding anticodon) and initiates the disassemblage of the two ribosomal subunits. The resulting '''polypeptide chain''' is also released to fold and become a fully functional protein.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation==
This Wikibook was motivated by two different things.  For one, I started trying to create an article on the Q document at English Wikipedia, but found that teaching about Q isn't particularly suited to the format of an encyclopedia article.  Rather, there's a distinct series of steps a student has to go through in order to understand Q--   first learning about the synoptic gospels, then the synoptic problem, then markan priority, then the double tradition, then Q, then the purported contents of Q, and then the hypothetical Q community, etc, and finally, alternatives to Q.  No one article really could cover it, but at the same time, just telling a student &quot;read this article, this article, then this article&quot; didn't seem appropriate either, since each article wouldn't have been written with an eye to being part of a unified whole designed to teach about Q.  

A second motivation was the desire to find a home for a free-licensed copy of those portions of Luke believed to be copied from Q.  Numerous such collections exist in print, and students should be able to have access to such a text in order to get a &quot;general feel&quot; for what scholars believe Q looked like.  Such a text wouldn't fit in a Wikipedia, nor at Wikisource-- instead such a text seemed to belong in a Wikibook.  --[[User:Alecmconroy|Alecmconroy]] ([[User talk:Alecmconroy|talk]]) 09:59, 13 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to better develop of a feel for what Q might have look liked, you should read over those portions of the Gospel of Luke which are believed to have been copied from Q.  Among scholars, Luke's use of Q is considered to be the more reliable.  

In doing so, you should be aware that the reconstruction presented here is only one of many possible such reconstructions.  While there is wide agreement on the overall contents of Q, the exact contents remain lost.

The contents presented here, for example, are probably fragmentary-- Q might well have contained passages that only Luke or Matthew quoted, but not both.  Q might also have contained passages which neither author quoted.  Similarly, it's conceivable Q contained passages which all three synoptic gospels quoted.  Finally, there is some disagreement about how close two passages need to be in order to be considered &quot;parallel&quot;.  

Similarly, many many English translations of the New Testament exist-- the translation used is just one of many.

That said, despite the choice of translation and the selection of verses, reading over the text should provide a basic feel for aphorisitic &quot;sayings gospel&quot; character of Q.  

==Sources==
The text below was created taking the verses believed to be in Q, and then actually listing the contents of those verses using a public-domain English translation.  

* The selection of verses is derived from [http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jdtabor/Qluke.html Tabor].   
* The English text is taken from the World English Bible translation of the Gospel of Luke, which is in the public domain.  
* The names of the section headings are generally taken from ''The Complete Gospels'', pp. 249-300, quoted [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/q-contents.html here].

===John's Preaching===
3:7-9, 16b-17 
He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?   Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!   Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.”  I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,  whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire

===Jesus Tested===
4:2b-12 
He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.  The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” Jesus answered him, saying, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’” The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want. If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.” Jesus answered him, “Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”* He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”* Jesus answering, said to him, “It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”


===Beatitudes===
6:20-23
Blessed are you who are poor,for yours is the Kingdom of God.  Blessed are you who hunger now,for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.  Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake. Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.


===Love your Enemies, Golden Rule===
6:27-37 
&quot;But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,  bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.  To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.  Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.
“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them. If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil. Therefore be merciful,  even as your Father is also merciful.


===Judge Not, Blind leading the Blind, Beam in your own eye===
6:37-42
Don’t judge, and you won’t be judged. Don’t condemn, and you won’t be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free. Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.”   Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?  Or how can you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye.


===[[Wikipedia:The Test of a Good Person|The Test of a Good Person]]===
6:43-45
For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.  The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.

===[[Wikipedia:Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders|Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders]]===
6:47-49
Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.  He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.   But he who hears, and doesn’t do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”

===The Centurion's Servant===
7:2-3, 7:6-10 
A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.   Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.  For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”  7:10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.


===John's Inquiry===
7:18-23
The disciples of John told him about all these things.   John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”   When the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”

In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.  Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”



===Jesus praises John===
7:24-35
When John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?   But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.   But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.   This is he of whom it is written,

‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’

For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.”

When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.  But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.

===Children in the marketplace===
7:31 “To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?  They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’  For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’  The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’  Wisdom is justified by all her children.


===Foxes have dens===
9:57-62
As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”
Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
He said to another, “Follow me!”
But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
But Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God.”
Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”
But Jesus said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.”



===The Mission Speech===
10:2-12
When he said to them, “The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.   Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.   Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.   Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’  If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.   Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don’t go from house to house.   Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.   Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’  But into whatever city you enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say,  ‘Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.’  I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.



===Woe to Chorazin===
10:13-15
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  10:14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.  10:15 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.


===Rejecting the sender===
10:16
Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”


===Father &amp; son===
10:21-22
In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.” Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”

===Privileged eyes===
10:23-24
“Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see, for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.”


===Lord's Prayer===
11:2-4
He said to them, “When you pray, say, ‘Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.  May your Kingdom come.May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us day by day our daily bread.  Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’” 


===Ask, seek, knock===
11:9-13
“I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.   For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?   Or if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he?   If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”

===Beelzebul controversy===
11:14-21
He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.   But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”   Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.  But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.   If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.  But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.   But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.  But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils. 


===Return of an unclean spirit===
11:24-26
The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’  When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.  Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”


===Request for a sign===
11:29b-32
This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.   For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.   The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.


===Lamp &amp; bushel, Eye &amp; light===
11:33-36
“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.   The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.  Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness.   If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”


===[[Wikipedia:Woes of the Pharisees|Woes of the Pharisees]]===
11:39-40, 42-43
Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.   You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?  But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.   Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces. 


11:46-52 
He said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.   Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.  So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.   Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,   that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;  from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.  Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”

===All will be revealed===
12:
But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.   Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.

===Fear not===
12:4-5
“I tell you, my friends, don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.  But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him.

===On Fear===
12:6-7 
Aren’t five sparrows sold for two assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God.   But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.


===Fearless Confessions===
12:8-12 
“I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;  but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.  Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;  for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say.”

===On Food and Clothing===
12:22-31 Don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.  Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.  Consider the ravens: they don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!   Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?   If then you aren’t able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?  Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.   But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?  Don’t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.   For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things. But seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.


===Sell your possessions===
12:33-34
Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

===Homeowner &amp; burglar===
12:39-40
But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.  Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”

===[[Wikipedia:Parable of the Faithful Servant|Parable of the Faithful Servant]]===
12:42-46
The Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?   Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.  Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.  But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.

===[[Wikipedia:But to bring a sword|But to bring a sword]]===
12:51-53
Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.  For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.  They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”

===Before the judge===
12:57-59
Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?  For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny.”

===[[Wikipedia:Parable of the Leaven|Parable of the Leaven]]===
13:20-21
Again he said, “To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?   It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.”

===The Two Ways; Closed Door===
13:24
“Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.

13:25-29 
When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ then he will answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’   Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’   He will say, ‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.’   There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.  They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.

===Lament over Jerusalem ===
13:34-35
“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!  Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”

===A Sheep Who Falls into a Pit on the Sabbath===
14:5 
He answered them, “Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”

===Parable of the Wedding Feast===
14:16-23
But he said to him, “A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.  He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’  They all as one began to make excuses.
“The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’
“Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’
“Another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’
“That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’
“The servant said, ‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’
“The lord said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.


===Hating one's family===
14:26-27
“If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can’t be my disciple.  Whoever doesn’t bear his own cross, and come after me, can’t be my disciple. 

===Salt Losing its Flavor=== 
14:34-35 
Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?  It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

===Parable of the Lost Sheep, Parable of the Lost Coin===
15:4-10 
“Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?  When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.  When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’  I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.  Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn’t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?  When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.’  Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.”

===Two masters / God and Mammon ===
16:13 
No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren’t able to serve God and mammon.”

===God's rule &amp; violence===
16:16 
The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.

===Not one stroke of a letter ===
16:17
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.

===Millstone award===
17:1
He said to the disciples, “It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!

===Scold &amp; forgive===
17:3-4
Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.  If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”

===Mountains into the sea===
17:5-6
The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”  The Lord said, “If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. 

===Coming of son of Adam===
17:23-37
They will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them, for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.   But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.   As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.   They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.   Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;   but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.   It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.   In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.  Remember Lot’s wife!  Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.  I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.  There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.”  
They, answering, asked him, “Where, Lord?”He said to them, “Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.” 


===[[Wikipedia:Parable of the Talents|Parable of the Talents]]===
19:12-13, 15-26
He said therefore, “A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.   He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’
“It happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.  The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’
“He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
“The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’
“So he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’  Another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’
“He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow.  Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’  He said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.’
&quot;They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’  ‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.

===On twelve thrones===
22:28-30
But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.  I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

'''''Carex''''' is a genus of plants in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges (although other, related species are also called sedges, those of genus Carex may be called &quot;true&quot; sedges). It is the most species-rich genus in the family. The study of ''Carex'' is known as '''caricology''', a word reportedly created by Robert Kral, retired botanist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}
 
The genus was established by Carolus Linnaeus in his work ''Species Plantarum'' in 1753. Estimates of the number of species vary from about 1100 to almost 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web ||title=Systematics of the genus ''Carex'' |author=Anthony Darrouzet-Nardi |date=[[2003-05-05]] |url=http://anthony.darrouzet-nardi.net/works/carex.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are distributed all over the world, but predominantly found in temperate regions. 

Most (but not all) sedges are found in marshes, where they can be the dominant vegetation.

==Description==
[[Image:Carex rostrata a1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Carex rostrata'']]

'''Eastern Redbud''' ('''''Cercis canadensis''''' L.) is a large shrub or small tree native to eastern North America from southern Ontario, Canada south to northern Florida, United States. In the wild, Eastern redbud is a frequent native understory tree in mixed forests and hedgerows. It is also much planted as a landscape ornamental plant. 

The redbud is the state tree of Oklahoma.

==Description==
It typically grows to 8-12 m tall, with a short, often twisted trunk and spreading branches. The bark is dark in color, smooth, later scaly with ridges somewhat apparent, sometimes with maroon patches. The twigs are slender and zigzag, nearly black in color, spotted with lighter lenticels. The winter buds are tiny, rounded and dark red to chestnut in color. The leaves are alternate, simple, cordate in shape with an entire margin, 7-12 cm (3-5 inches) long and wide, thin and papery, and may be slightly hairy below.

[[Image:Xylocopa_9789.JPG |thumb|left|Carpenter bee (''Xylocopa virginica'') on redbud flowers.]]
The flowers are showy, light to dark pink in color, 1.5 cm (½ inch) long, appearing in clusters from March to May, on bare stems before the leaves, sometimes on the trunk itself. The flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees such as blueberry bees and carpenter bees. Short-tongued bees apparently cannot reach the nectaries. The fruit are flattened, dry, brown, pea-like pods, 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) long that contain flat, elliptical, brown seeds 6 mm (¼ inch) long, maturing in August to October.

Small tree, with a sturdy upright trunk which divides into stout branches that usually spread to form a broad flat head.  Found on rich bottom lands throughout the Mississippi valley; will grow in the shade and often becomes a dense undergrowth in the forest.  Very abundant in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and eastern Texas.  Hardy far north; grows rapidly; is a satisfactory ornamental tree.  Many trees are sterile and produce no fruit.

* Bark: Red brown, with deep fissures and scaly surface.  Branchlets at first lustrous brown, later become darker.
* Wood: Dark reddish brown; heavy, hard, coarse-grained, not strong.  Sp. gr., 0.6363; weight of cu. ft. 39.65 lbs.
* Winter buds: Chestnut brown, obtuse, one-eighth inch long.

'''''Chionodoxa''''' (Glory-of-the-snow) is a genus of eight bulbous perennials in the family Hyacinthaceae. The blue, white or pink flowers appear early in the year making them valuable garden ornamentals.

Four species occur in West Turkey, one in Southwest Turkey, two in Crete and one in Cyprus. Some species (mainly ''[[../Chionodoxa siehei/]]'' and ''[[../Chionodoxa luciliae/]]'') have naturalised from gardens outside of their native range. E. g. in Great Britain, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands. A natural hybrid of ''Chionodoxa siehei'' x ''Chionodoxa luciliae'' also occurs.

'''''Claytonia virginica''''' ('''Eastern spring beauty''' or '''fairy-spuds''') is a flowering plant in the family Portulacaceae, native to eastern North America. It is found in moist woods and clearings. 

==Description==
It is a trailing plant growing to 5-40 cm long. The leaves are slender lanceolate, 3-14 cm long and 5-13 mm broad, with a 6-20 cm long petiole. The flowers are 7-14 mm diameter, with five pale pink or white (rarely yellow) petals, flowering is between March and May.

==Growing Conditions==
'''''Claytonia virginica''''' is native to open woodlands with dry to moist soils, and performs best when these conditions are replicated in the garden. The foliage is somewhat ephemeral and becomes ratty by late summer, so it should either be planted in lawns or where taller plants will hide the dieback.

'''''Fritillaria meleagris''''', commonly known as the '''Snake's Head''' (the original English name), and also the '''Snake's Head Fritillary''', '''Leper Lily''', '''Guinea-hen Flower''', and '''Checkered Daffodil''') is a Fritillary, a flower from the family Liliaceae.

The flower has a checkered reddish-brown, purple, white and gray coloration, sometimes mostly white. It flowers from March to May and grows between 15 and 40 cm in height. It has a round bulb, about 2cm in diameter which contains poisonous alkaloids.

The plant is commonly found growing in grasslands in damp soils and river meadows. It can be found at altitudes up to 800 metres.

It is native to Europe, but in many places, including France, Slovenia and Romania it is an endangered species that is rarely found in the wild, but is common in horticulturists' gardens. In Croatia the flower is known as ''Kockavica'' and is part of the country's national symbol. It is the only species of Fritillary native to Britain, growing in traditional grass meadows. Due to changing land usage, it is now quite rare in the wild. The Meadow of Magdalen College, Oxford, the village of Ducklington, Oxfordshire (which holds a Fritillary Sunday festival), and the North Meadow National Nature Reserve, Wiltshire are some of the best locations to view this flower.

The Leper Lily is the official flower of the Swedish province of Uppland, where it grows in large quantities every spring at the meadows in Kungsängen, just outside Uppsala, also giving the flower its Swedish name, ''kungsängslilja''.

'''''Kerria japonica''''', commonly named '''Kerria''' or '''Japanese Yellow Rose''' )the sole species in the genus ''Kerria''), is a deciduous shrub in the rose family Rosaceae, native to eastern Asia, in China, Japan and Korea. It is named after William Kerr, who introduced the cultivar 'Pleniflora'. The scientific genus name is also used as a common name Kerria. Kerria is a very popular ornamental plant in gardens, often using the double-flowered cultivar 'Pleniflora'. 

==Description==
It grows to 1-3 m tall, with weak arching stems often scrambling over other vegetation or rocks. The leaves are alternate, simple, 4-7 cm long, with a sharply serrated margin. The flowers are bright yellow, with five petals. The fruit is a dry single-seeded achene 5 mm long.

'''''Lamium''''' ('''deadnettle''') is a genus of about 40-50 species of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, of which family it is the type genus. They are all herbaceous plants native to Europe, Asia, and north Africa, but several have become very successful weeds of crop fields and are now widely naturalised across the temperate world.

The genus includes both annual and perennial species; they spread by both seeds and stems rooting as they grow along the ground.

The common name refers to their superficial resemblance to the unrelated stinging nettles, but unlike those, they do not have stinging hairs and so are harmless or apparently &quot;dead&quot;.

==Description==

&lt;!--physical description of the plant--&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

Lamiums are frost hardy and grow well in most soils.  Flower colour determines planting season and light requirement: white- and purple-coloured flowered species are planted in spring and prefer full sun.  The yellow-flowered ones are planted in fall (autumn) and prefer shade.  They often have invasive habits and need plenty of room.   

==Varieties==
*''[[../Lamium album/]]'' (White Deadnettle)
*''[[../Lamium amplexicaule/]]'' (Henbit Deadnettle)
*''[[../Lamium bifidum/]]''
*''[[../Lamium barbatum/]]''
*''[[../Lamium corsicum/]]''
*''[[../Lamium flexuosum/]]''

*''[[../Lamium moschatum/]]''
*''[[../Lamium orvala/]]''
*''[[../Lamium purpureum/]]'' (Red Deadnettle)

Several closely related genera were formerly included in ''Lamium'' by some botanists, including ''[[../Lamiastrum/]]'' (Yellow Archangel), ''[[../Galeopsis/]]'' (hemp-nettles) and ''[[../Leonurus/]]'' (motherworts).

==Uses==

&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagate from seed or by division in early spring.

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==
''Lamium'' species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including [[w:Angle Shades]], [[w:Setaceous Hebrew Character]] and the ''[[w:Coleophora]]'' case-bearers ''C. ballotella'', ''C. lineolea'' and ''C. ochripennella''.

'''''Lindera benzoin''''' ('''Common Spicebush''', '''Northern Spicebush''' or '''Benjamin Bush''') is a flowering plant in the family Lauraceae, native to eastern North America, ranging from Maine to Ontario in the north, and to Kansas, Texas and northern Florida in the south.

==Description==
It is a medium-sized deciduous shrub growing to 5 m tall, typically found only in the understory of moist thickets. The leaves are alternate, simple, 6-15 cm long and 2-6 cm broad, oval or obovate and broadest beyond the middle of the leaf. They are very aromatic when crushed, hence the common names and the specific epithet &quot;benzoin&quot;. The flowers grow in showy yellow clusters that appear in early spring, before the leaves begin to grow. The fruit is a berrylike red drupe about 1 cm long and is highly prized by birds. It has a peppery taste and scent, and contains a large seed.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;
Requires moderate to moist, humous-rich soils.

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==

Used for naturalizing a landscape. Lindera benzoin provides a food source for larval Spicebush Swallowtail Butterflies, and for various species of bird.

&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==

'''Annual Honesty''' (''Lunaria annua'') is a tall (height about 1 m), hairy-stemmed Biennial plant found throughout Europe. It has large, pointed oval leaves with marked serrations. The common name &quot;Honesty&quot; arose in the 16th century, and it may be due to the translucent seed-pods which are like flattened pea-pods and borne on the plant through winter.  In South-East Asia, it is called the Money Plant, because its seed pods have the appearance of silver coins.

The '''lungworts''' are  flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae, native to Europe and western Asia, with one species (P. mollissima) east to central Asia. According to various estimates there may be between 10 and 18 Pulmonaria species found in the wild, but the taxonomy of this genus is very confusing.

The scientific name ''Pulmonaria'' is derived from Latin ''pulmo'' (the lung). In the times of sympathetic magic, the spotted oval leaves of ''P. officinalis'' were thought to symbolize diseased, ulcerated lungs, and so were used to treat pulmonary infections. The common name in many languages also refers to lungs, as in English &quot;lungwort&quot; and German &quot;lungenkraut&quot;. In some East European languages, the common name is derived from a word for honey, e.g. Russian &quot;medunitza&quot; and Polish &quot;miodunka&quot;.

English colloquial names include Lungwort, Soldiers and Sailors, Spotted dog, Joseph and Mary, Jerusalem Cowslip, Bethlehem Sage.

==Description==
[[Image:Lungwort.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers of ''Pulmonaria officinalis'']]
Lungworts are perennial herbs that form clumps or rosettes. They are covered in hairs of varied length and stiffness, and sometimes also bear glands.
The underground parts consist of a slowly creeping rhizome with adventitious roots. Flowering stems are unbranched, rough, covered with bristly hairs, usually not exceeding 25-30cm, with a few exceptions (''P. mollis, P. vallarsae''). The stems are usually upright, or slightly spreading. 

The leaves are arranged in rosettes. The blades are usually large, from narrowly lanceolate to oval, with the base ranging from heart shaped to very gradually narrowing, and can have a sharply pointed or blunt tip. Leaf margin is always entire, but in some species and forms can be rather wavy. Basal leaves are carried on stalks that can be short or longer than the leave blade in various species. Stem leaves are smaller and often narrower, and are unstalked or clasping the stem. All leaves are covered with hairs that are usually bristly, or occasionally soft. The leaves are often prominently spotted in black and blue, or sometimes in pale green, or unspotted.

The inflorescence is a terminal scorpioid cyme, with bracts. Lungwort flowers are heterostylous, with two distinct forms of flower within each species; those with short stamens and long styles (&quot;pin&quot; flowers) and those with long stamens and short styles (&quot;thrum&quot; flowers), with the former usually being larger and more showy. The calyx is hairy, 5-lobed, tubular or funnel-shaped, enlarging as the fruit ripens. The corolla is funnel-shaped and consists of a long, cylindrical tube and a limb with five shallow lobes. Within the corolla throat, five tufts of hairs alternate with the stamens to form a ring. The colour of corolla varies from purple, violet or blue to shades of pink and red, or sometimes white. The colour of the flower in bud is often pink, which then changes as the flower matures. The stamens and style are included within the corolla and not protruding.

The nutlets are smooth, egg-shaped, brownish, up to 4.5 mm long and 3 mm wide, each containing a single seed. Up to four nutlets per flower are produced, ripening mostly in summer.

Pulmonaria species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including ''[[../Coleophora pulmonariella/]]'' which feeds exclusively on P. saccharata.

'''''Sassafras albidum''''' ('''Sassafras''', '''White Sassafras''', '''Red Sassafras''', or '''Silky Sassafras''') is a species of Sassafras native to eastern North America, from southern Maine and southern Ontario west to Iowa, and south to central Florida and eastern Texas. It occurs throughout the eastern deciduous forest habitat type, at altitudes of sea level up to 1,500 m.&lt;ref name=fna&gt;Flora of North America: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=233501217 ''Sassafras albidum'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usfs&gt;U.S. Forest Service: [http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pdf/shrubs/Sassafras%20albidum.pdf ''Sassafras albidum'' (pdf file)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hope&gt;Hope College, Michigan: [http://www.hope.edu/academic/biology/naturepreserve/Trees/Sasalb.htm ''Sassafras albidum'']&lt;/ref&gt; It formerly also occurred in southern Wisconsin, but is extinct there as a native tree.&lt;ref name=usfs1&gt;U.S. Forest Service Silvics Manual: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=233501217 ''Sassafras albidum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Sassafras&quot;, applied by the botanist Nicolas Monardes in the sixteenth century, is said to be a corruption of the Spanish word for saxifrage. Before the twentieth century, Sassafras enjoyed a great reputation in the medical literature, but became valued for its power to improve the flavor of other medicines.&lt;ref name=Keeler /&gt;

==Description==
It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 15–35 m tall, with a trunk up to 60 cm diameter, and a crown with many slender branches. The bark on trunk of mature trees is thick, dark red-brown, and deeply furrowed. The branching is sympodial. The shoots are bright yellow green at first with mucilaginous bark, turning reddish brown, and in two or three years begin to show shallow fissures. The leaves are alternate, green to yellow-green, ovate or obovate, 10–16 cm long and 5–10 cm broad with a short, slender, slightly grooved petiole. They come in three different shapes, all of which can be on the same branch; three-lobed leaves, unlobed elliptical leaves, and two-lobed leaves; rarely, there can be more than three lobes. In fall, they turn to shades of yellow, tinged with red. The flowers are produced in loose, drooping, few-flowered racemes up to 5 cm long in early spring shortly before the leaves appear; they are yellow to greenish-yellow, with five or six tepals. It is usually dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees; male flowers have nine stamens, female flowers with six staminodes (aborted stamens) and a 2–3 mm style on a superior ovary. Pollination is by insects. The fruit is a dark blue-black drupe 1 cm long containing a single seed, borne on a red fleshy club-shaped pedicel 2 cm long; it is ripe in late summer, with the seeds dispersed by birds. The cotyledons thick and fleshy. All parts of the plant are aromatic and spicy. The roots are thick and fleshy, and frequently produce root sprouts which can develop into new trees.&lt;ref name=fna/&gt;&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=hope/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keeler&gt;Keeler, H. L. (1900). ''Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them''. Charles Scriber's Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing Conditions==
It prefers rich, well-drained sandy loam with a pH of 6–7, but will grow in any loose, moist soil. Seedlings will tolerate shade, but saplings and older trees demand full sunlight for good growth; in forests it typically regenerates in gaps created by windblow. Growth is rapid, particularly with root sprouts, which can reach 1.2 m in the first year and 4.5 m in 4 years. Root sprouts often result in dense thickets, and a single tree, if allowed to spread unrestrained, will soon be surrounded by a sizable clonal colony, as its stoloniferous roots extend in every direction and send up multitudes of shoots.&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=hope/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keeler/&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Sassafras is often grown as an ornamental tree for its unusual leaves and aromatic scent. Outside of its native area, it is occasionally cultivated in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;

An essential oil, called sassafras oil, is distilled from the root bark or the fruit. It was used as a fragrance in perfumes and soaps, food (sassafras tea and candy flavoring) and for aromatherapy. The smell of sassafras oil is said to make an excellent repellent for mosquitoes and other insects, which makes it a nice garden plant. Acids can be extracted from bark for manufacturing perfumes.

The essential oil was used as a pain killer as well as an antiseptic in dentistry. The pith is used in the U.S. to soothe eye inflammation and ease catarrh.

Sassafras oil is the preferred source of safrole, which is the main component (75-80%) of the essential oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kamdem D. P., Gage, D. A.| title = Chemical Composition of Essential Oil from the Root Bark of Sassafras albidum | journal = [[Journal of Organic Chemistry]]| pages =574-575| year = 1995|volume = 61|issue = 6| doi=10.1055/s-2006-959379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root or root bark is used to make tea, although commercial &quot;sassafras teas&quot; are now artificially flavored as a result of the FDA ban (see below). A yellow dye is obtained from the wood. The shoots were used to make root beer (formerly an alcoholic beverage, but now a soft drink), which owed its characteristic odor to the sassafras extract, now replaced by other natural and/or artificial flavors.
The dried and ground leaves are known as filé powder. Filé is still used for thickening sauces and soups in Cajun, Creole, and other Louisiana cooking, notably in the dish ''filé gumbo''.

Safrole is now recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture as a potential carcinogen. Safrole, and sassafras not certified as safrole-free, have been banned in the United States as food additives or flavoring agents by the FDA since 1976 due to safrole's designation as a carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=US FDA/CFSAN: Listing of Food Additive Status | date=July 2006 | publisher=FDA | url =http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opa-appa.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-25 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sassafras leaves do not contain sufficient amounts of safrole to be covered by the FDA ban.

Safrole is commonly used by clandestine laboratories to synthesize various hallucinogenic drugs such as MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine), MDMA (Ecstasy), and MDEA (Love). For this reason, the sale of safrole and sassafras oil is monitored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

In some regions it was a popular additive to moonshine.

The wood is dull orange brown, hard, and durable in contact with the soil; it was used in the past for posts and rails, small boats and ox-yokes, though scarcity and small size limits current use. Some is still used for making furniture. &lt;ref name=mp&gt;Missouriplants: [http://www.missouriplants.com/Yellowalt/Sassafras_albidum_page.html ''Sassafras albidum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagation of the tree is most easily achieved trough the separating of root sucklings that are found around almost all mature trees.  Simply cut the root below the sapling leaving some 10 cm of the root. Plant the sapling in a pot containing a free draining organic rich soil and leave in a relatively protected spot from wind, heat, and intense sunlight. They are very hardy and it's almost impossible to fail.

The '''poppywort''' (also known as '''stylophorum''', '''celandine poppy''', '''wood poppy''', or '''yellow poppy''') is a member of the poppy family native to eastern North America, with yellow-orange flowers. 

==Description==
The flowers are 4 showy sepals that are petal like, with many stamens in the middle. Plants grow about 1.5 feet tall, with pinnatifid shaped leaves. The flowers are produced in umbels that can have one to a few flowers each, the umbels terminate the stems and after blooming a pod like fruit is produced that hangs down under the foliage. When the seeds are ripe in mid summer, the pods split open along four valves. The plants have a yellow-orange sap that can stain hands.

'''Tulips''' are spring blooming bulbs with a long history of cultivation, as well as a notorious history in commerce. 

==Description==
Tulips grow from bulbs, each bulb producing a single shoot with alternate, straplike leaves and a single flower. The plant dies back shortly after flowering in mid-spring.

==Growing Conditions==
Tulips require a well drained soil, and can suffer from over-irrigation in the summer. 

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Tulips are grown for spring color and as cut flowers.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

'''''Aesculus hippocastanum''''' is a large deciduous tree, commonly known as Horse-chestnut. It is native to a small area in the mountains of the Balkans in southeast Europe, in small areas in northern Greece, Albania, the Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, and Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=empp&gt;Euro+Med Plantbase Project: [http://ww2.bgbm.org/_EuroPlusMed/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=24982&amp;PTRefFk=500000 ''Aesculus hippocastanum'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely cultivated throughout the temperate world.

==Description==
[[Image:Kaštan 1.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage and flowers]]
It grows to 36 m tall, with a domed crown of stout branches, on old trees the outer branches often pendulous with curled-up tips. The leaves are opposite and palmately compound, with 5-7 leaflets; each leaflet is 13-30 cm long, making the whole leaf up to 60 cm across, with a 7-20 cm petiole. The flowers are usually white with a small red spot; they are produced in spring in erect panicles 10-30 cm tall with about 20-50 flowers on each panicle. Usually only 1-5 fruit develop on each panicle; the fruit is a green, softly spiky capsule containing one (rarely two or three) nut-like seeds called conkers or horse-chestnuts. Each conker is 2-4 cm diameter, glossy nut-brown with a whitish scar at the base.

==Uses==
[[Image:Aesculus hippocastanum-1.jpg|left|thumb|Leaves and trunk]]
Cultivation for its spectacular spring flowers is successful in a range of climatic conditions provided summers are not too hot, with trees being grown as far north as Edmonton, Alberta, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/InfraPlan/Heritage/pdfs/BuildingHeritageNews12.pdf Edmonton]&lt;/ref&gt; the Faroe Islands,&lt;ref&gt;Højgaard, A., Jóhansen, J., &amp; Ødum, S. (1989). A century of tree planting on the Faroe Islands. ''Ann. Soc. Sci. Faeroensis'' Supplementum 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tromsø, Norway. In more southern areas, growth is best in cooler mountain climates.

In Britain, the nuts are used for the popular children's game conkers. During the two world wars, horse-chestnuts were used as a source of starch which in turn could be used via the Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation method devised by Chaim Weizmann to produce acetone. This acetone was then used as a solvent which aided in the process of ballistite extrusion into cordite, which was then used in military armaments.

The nuts, especially those that are young and fresh, are slightly poisonous, containing alkaloid saponins and glucosides. Although not dangerous to touch, they cause sickness when eaten. Some mammals, notably deer, are able to break down the toxins and eat them safely. They are reputed to be good for horses with wind, but this is unproven and feeding them to horses is not advisable. The saponin aescin, however, has been used for health purposes (such as varicose veins, edema, sprains) and is available in food supplements, as is a related glocoside aesculin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2001/gerrard/aesculin.html|

In the past, Horse-chestnut seeds were used in France and Switzerland for whitening hemp, flax, silk and wool. They contain a soapy juice, fit for washing of linens and stuffs, for milling of caps and stockings, etc., and for fulling of cloth. For this, 20 horse-chestnut seeds were sufficient for six liters of water. They were peeled, then rasped or dried, and ground in a malt or other mill. The water must be soft, either rain or river water; hard well water will not work. The nuts are then steeped in cold water, which soon becomes frothy, as with soap, and then turns milky white. The liquid must be stirred well at first, and then, after standing to settle, strained or poured off clear. Linen washed in this liquid, and afterwards rinsed in clear running water, takes on an agreeable light sky-blue colour. It takes spots out of both linen and wool, and never damages or injures the cloth.

In Bavaria the chestnut is the typical tree for a beer garden. Originally they were planted for their deep shade which meant that beer cellar owners could cut ice from local rivers and lakes in winter to cool their beer well into summer. Nowadays guests enjoy the shade to keep their heads cool - even after the second Maß (a mug with a liter of beer).
Conkers have been threatened by the leaf-mining moth Cameraria ohridella, whose larvae feed on horse chestnut leaves. The moth had been in Europe since 1985 but took 17 years to reach Britain.

Aesculus hippocastanum is used in Bach flower remedies. When the buds are used it is referred to as &quot;Chestnut Bud&quot; and when the flowers are used it is referred to as &quot;White Chestnut&quot;.

The flower is the symbol of the city of Kiev, capital of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unspecial.org/uns619/UNS619_T15.html Kiev]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Horse-chestnuts can be used to make jewelry using the conkers as beads.

Does anyone else have any pro/cons to add to the ''Reason to use/not use'' bulleted lists?--[[User:Klka0701|Klka0701]] ([[User talk:Klka0701|talk]]) 15:04, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

I added some ideas to the &quot;Reason to use/not use&quot; section. The bulleted lists seemed incomplete, and as such, I decided to expand on them and turn them into full sentences. I also added more updated information on e-books, which may or may not have been in their infancy since the last edit of this page. --[[User:Heja0805|Heja0805]] ([[User talk:Heja0805|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heja0805|contribs]]) 15:56, 20 December 2012 (UTC)

== Teaching with the Rhetoric and Composition Wikibook vs wikitexts in a general sense  ==

I may have been mislead, but I initially thought this page was dedicated to teaching with wikitexts in a general sense. I think there must be a distinction between how to teach with the Rhetoric and Composition Wikibook and how to implement wikis in pedagogical settings. I propose the creation of a separate page on this wikibook to address how to teach using wikis in educational contexts. --[[User:Heja0805|Heja0805]] ([[User talk:Heja0805|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heja0805|contribs]]) 22:22, 18 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Writing for the Web==

Writing for the Web demands more than an understanding of proper mechanical and grammatical writing techniques and rules.  Unfortunately, these techniques and rules are often the last focus of Web-based writing.  Within Internet writing, delivery becomes the main focus.  Known as the 5th Canon of writing, delivery becomes essential to an audience's reaction and willingness to view what has been written.  If you are writing for a corporate site, or a personal blog, delivery will decide if an audience will exist. In this way, the lines distinguishing writing and marketing begin to blur.


Some of the focal points given more prominence during the process of Web-writing are:

*Understanding target audience.
*Speed at which a web-page can be uploaded.
*Use of color and imagery to capture and sway an audience.
*Long-term affect of writing in a public forum.
*Everything published on the web can be found.

Writing for the Web can offer any individual the opportunity to be published.  The words placed on-line when one is 15 will most likely still exist when they are 95 years old.  Corporations and hiring agencies WILL scour the web to find out more information on a potential employee or customer.  For this reason, understanding what students are writing and sharing online may affect their future.

Also, on-line writing allows students to include voice recordings, pictures and images, video clips, and typed words.  Graphics and fonts change the meaning of words just as much as a well-chosen synonym will.  In this then, Web-based writing demands an understanding beyond the well structured paragraph.

==Audience and Writing==
An understanding of online audience is key for students.  Most students have a natural understanding of this concept.  The majority of students born after 1981 can be considered ''digital natives''.  A digital native is someone who has grown up around, and using, digital and Internet technology.  For these students, the techniques needed for quality online writing will center around grammar, mechanics, and subject matter.  For students not considered digital natives, achieving an appropriate length for the document will be a major goal.


'''Below are a few Web writing tips your audience will appreciate:''' 

'''Be concise.''' Writing for the Web requires relaying your message concisely and succinctly and omitting unnecessary words. A good rule to follow is to write 50 percent less for the Web than you would for a hardcopy publication. Consider using bulleted lists for important points. 

'''Write for scanning'''. Write so readers can scan the text. If the Web page contains long blocks of text the reader will grow weary and leave your page. The back door is only a click away. Guide the reader through the page and/or site by using headlines, lists and bold/italic formatting for emphasis. 

'''Chunk large amounts of information'''. Carefully dividing material into shorter blocks can help maintain an engaged reader. Appropriately dividing the material or &quot;chunking&quot; is a great way to break up long blocks of continuous text. Chunking also helps limit the length of the Web page. Readers usually prefer shorter pages. 

On the other hand, '''avoid fragmentation'''. Over-subdividing the information can overwhelm and frustrate the reader. An information chunk should have give the appropriate amount of background, context and amount of information. Use links to other pages that provide supporting information.   

'''Use links effectively.''' Links can support your material by providing further background information, adding detail, and expanding on related concepts. 

'''Proper formatting.''' Always start with a headline and use subheads throughout the page. Remember, readers are scanning the page looking for specific topics. Headlines and subheads provide an outline to guide the reader's eyes. Providing a summary paragraph at the beginning of longer documents can help orient the reader to the page's contents. Use italics for emphasis and to make your text more conversational. 

===Corporate Writing===


==Writing on Social Networking Platforms==
Within a Social writing space, such as [http://www.myspace.com/ Myspace] and [https://www.facebook.com/?ref=cws Facebook], as well as blog providers like [http://www.wordpress.com Wordpress] and [http://www.blogger.com Blogger], the length of a composition is key.  Within the blogging sections of these spaces, any document consisting of more than 300 words is considered excess. People who write often on-line instinctively know, with the help of these visit counters, what length of entry will keep, and lose, an audience. The average length of time a reader spends scanning a web page is 5-15 seconds. Effective blog entries are thus typically shorter in length.  Many of the social sites now offer a viewing tally and useful tools to view page analytics. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging Microblogging] has thoroughly imbued writing practice on social networking sites. [https://twitter.com/ Twitter] has quickly become was one the most widely used online social networking services and is founded on posting &quot;tweets&quot; of 140 characters or less. Facebook, in an effort to compete with microblogging platforms such as Twitter, now enables users to post status updates of up to 420 characters in length. 

The constraints of microblogging has required users to pay close attention to minute details, clarity, and of course, concise language on their posts. Microblogging is an excellent way to provide instant updates on anything from news to personal details. While some users on Twitter choose to dedicate their profiles to their personal life, others find it suitable for professional networking opportunities. 

Microblogging also poses a unique potential area for creative writing. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction Flash fiction], and more genres like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropoetry micropoetry] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flarf_poetry flarf], display the unique opportunities of constrained writing on the Internet.

===Your Words will follow You===
The words written today will exist tomorrow.  This is the belief of many internet users.  For the most part, they are correct.  Any document, photo, video, and podcast can be recorded or photographed by another computer user.  For this reason, one of the most important concepts students must learn is that their words are not just part of the current moment.

==Visual Awareness==



==Use of Video and Graphics==
Not everyone in the world has high-speed internet.  For this reason, one of the first writing concepts of web content deals with upload speed.  Upload speed will affect how quickly an audience can view the information you are trying to share.  In the early years of the internet web-designers would incorporate intricate images and graphics that would start up as soon as a page was opened.  This slows down upload speed.  Though fun to view, these graphic openings have since been considered bad practice, because viewers do not wish to wait for the upload to be completed.

The goal of this page, currently, is to offer wisdom and common sense information.  I'm targeting the novice computer user who is going to enter into a web-based teaching world.

Links to useful multi-modal teaching places (education muds, blogs, and wikis) would be nice.  Basically, try to help Teachers understand what is the focus of web writing overall, while also helping the teacher get their &quot;feet wet&quot; so to speak.

A list of quality web-writing books will help too.  I'll try to add a few books I like during the week of Dec. 17th--[[User:Klka0701|Klka0701]] ([[User talk:Klka0701|talk]]) 16:21, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

== Proper Place? ==

Does this really belong to the teacher's handbook section?  I think it should go somewhere else.</text>

      <comment>Incorrect info in page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is actually incorrect. The density parameter does determine the geometry of the universe (whether it is flat, open or closed), but it does not determine the final state. This is because we now know that there is dark energy in the universe, which contributes to &amp;Omega; but makes the expansion accelerate rather than decelerate.

Given that it seems most A-level syllabuses have yet to catch up on this, I would hesitate to put the correct information in the main page. -- Anon</text>

== Copyright problem with [[:Image:Light-candles.jpg]] ==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Light-candles.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Light-candles.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add this information; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|help desk]].

See {{UserImages}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:10, 20 December 2007 (UTC)}}

:You need to edit the image description page to fix this - ''do not upload a new version''. Please add both a link to the source, and the appropriate [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Image namespace|license template]].

* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Synoptic Gospels==

[[Image:Relationship between synoptic gospels.png|right|450px|Almost all of Mark's content is found in Matthew, and much of Mark is similarly found in Luke.  Additionally, Matthew and Luke have a large amount of material in common that is not found in Mark.]]
Of the four canonical gospels included in the New Testament, three are very similar:  Mark, Matthew, and Luke.  These gospels often recount the same stories about Jesus, generally follow the same sequence and, often use the same or similar wording.  Because they share the same view, these three gospels are known as the Synoptic Gospels (from Greek synoptic, meaning &quot;seeing with the same eyes&quot;).

&lt;!--===Commonalities between the Synoptics===--&gt;
A substantial amount of material is repeated in all three synoptic gospels.  This material is known as the '''triple tradition'''.   About half of the material in the synoptic gospels (taken together) would be considered &quot;triple tradition&quot; material.  

Another substantial block of material is repeated in both Matthew and Luke, but is absent from Mark.  This material is known as the '''double tradition'''.   About one-fifth of the material in the synoptic gospels (taken together) would be considered &quot;double tradition&quot; material.

A small amount material (about 9%) is found in both Mark and Matthew, but not in Luke.  A very small amount of material (about 2%)  is found in Mark and Luke, but not in Matthew.

Additionally, each gospel has some material that is unique to it alone.  Luke has a relatively large amount of such material-- Luke-only material makes up about 15% of the synoptics. Matthew-only material, meanwhile, makes up about 9% of the synoptics.  Mark has the least amount of unique material-- Mark-only material makes up less than 1% of the synoptics.

==The Synoptic Problem==
[[Image:Synoptic word-for-word.png|right|thumb|350px|Two parallel passages from Matthew and Luke.  Identical wording is rendered in red.&lt;ref&gt;Matt 3:7-10 &amp;  Luke 3:7-9.  Text from 1894 Scrivener New Testament&lt;/ref&gt;]]


The relationships between the three synoptic gospels goes beyond mere similarity in viewpoint.  The gospels often recount the stories, usually in the same exact order, sometimes even using the exact same words.  Some sections are repeated nearly verbatim.   

Scholars note that the similarities between the Mark, Matthew, and Luke are too great to be accounted for by mere coincidences.     Since multiple eyewitnesses reporting the exact same events will basically never relate a story using exactly the same word-for-word telling, Scholars and theologians have long assumed there was some literary relationship between the three synoptic gospels. 

The precise nature of the relationships between the gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke is know as the '''Synoptic Problem'''.  The recognition of the question, and attempts to resolve it, date to antiquity.  For example, Augustine of Hippo, a 5th century bishop, tried to explain the relationships between the synoptic gospels by proposing that perhaps Matthew was written first, then Mark was written using Matthew as a source, and finally Luke was written using Matthew and Mark as sources.  Although this specific solution has fallen out favor with modern scholars, it represents one of the earliest and most influential proposed solutions to the synoptic problem.

'''Sour mix''' is a mixer used in many cocktails, notably the Long Island Iced Tea family. It is made from approximately equal parts lemon and/or lime juice and simple syrup and shaken vigorously with ice. This produces a pearly-white liquid with a pronounced flavour. Egg white may be added as a foaming agent, to improve the texture of the finished product. Pre-mixed versions are available, and are in use in many bars - these typically consist of a powder which must be rehydrated by adding water prior to use.

One of the earliest known printed references to the word &quot;cocktail&quot; described a drink made from &quot;Spirit of any kind, sugar, water and bitters&quot;. This is very similar to the drink that would these days be known as ''sours'' - a spirit or liqueur, shaken vigorously with ice, lemon juice and sugar.

==Ingredients==

* One cup of sugar
* One egg white
* Two cups of water
* Two cups of lemon juice, preferably freshly squeezed

Alternately, try this &quot;vegan&quot; recipe:

# 2 parts lime juice
# 2 parts simple syrup (sugar water)
# 1 part orange juice
# 1 part lemon juice

==Procedure==

# Whisk egg white (unless preparing vegan version) in a medium-sized bowl until frothy
# Stir in the sugar and water or simple syrup
# Add the lemon juice (and lime and orange juices if using)
# Stir all ingredients well

Store the mix refrigerated and use within three days of making it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why not use the article from Wikipedia?

:Good question. If you think the WP article would make a good starting point for this page, you can [[WB:RFI|request that a copy of it be imported]]. Of course, Wikibooks isn't an encyclopedia, nor collections of encyclopedia articles, so significant formatting work would have to be done to the article to make it suitable for inclusion here. However, if you think it's worth the effort, let us know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:21, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

::Whiteknight, I could give you a better answer if I knew what age range we are targeting with this book. Obviously we would not present to an elementary school audience facts that would be approrpiate for an high school audience.

= King's Gambit Declined=
Black ignores the gambit and develops its dark-squared bishop, controls the d4 square and makes it harder for white to castle kingside. This also sets up a trap, leaving black's e-pawn undefended.

White cannot accept the pawn and play [[/3. fxe5/]], because of 3...Qh4+ 4. g3 leading to the loss of a rook (attempting to hang onto the rook with 4. Ke2 leads to 4...Qxe4#). The main continuation is [[/3. Nf3/]], but [[/3. Bc4/]] looks good too.

[[Debate/Topics/Murder|Morality/Murder]] was merged into this book. As [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] and [[User:Darklama|darklama]] noted, this book is likely doesn't belong here.
:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''  - violates [[WB:WIW]]: a) not a soapbox b) no original works and [[WB:NPOV]]. The nature of the book will make it extremely difficult if not impossible to keep NOPV (and the lack of active contributors makes it all the more difficult). '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:25, 10 October 2007 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - The works does seem to need a reorganization and even a rename would be in order. The subject matter may indeed be problematic or not politically correct but [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard]] categorization as soapbox and NPOV is a bit over the top, since the contributors don't seem to be advocating any behavior or single sided interpretation, it does covers other POV and that can be extended over the time, I would contribute work into it...
:We could argue that the subject matter has an high probability of generating conflict, and it does. But we as a web community constituted mostly by creators or culture aficionados should address real world problems and philosophy or social behaviors should be  also have a high representation in on our bookshelfs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:56, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''  This book is not a textbook in that it does not teach nor explain. It is a soapbox for the dissemination of people's opinions on various issues. In it's current form, it is meerly a listing of these opinions. Even if we allow for the fact that multiple viewpoints are represented on each topic, that doesnt mean the book satisfies NPOV. Remember, it's &quot;Neutral Point of View&quot;, not &quot;Every Point Of View&quot; or &quot;at least two points of view&quot; (as most of the pages currently are laid out). Also, the title &quot;Issue Guide&quot; is utterly ambiguous: What kinds of issues? What are the boundaries of this book? It's scope? What makes this book anything more then a summary of current events that the author deems worthy? Beyond that, it's not wikibook's job to &quot;address&quot; anything. We are based on the idea that information can be freely developed and distributed, but we do not have a maxim of freedom of speech: We have a number of policies that prevent our users from writing just anything that comes to mind. We don't allow commentary, we don't allow current events, we don't allow soapboxing, etc. The POV issue is the central point of my argument, but I would also argue that this book has no unifying theme: It is simply a collection of controversial topics, and a listing of select opinions on those topics. As such, this book is either a macropedia (a collection of loosely-related topics and no central narrative) or it is a listing, neither of which are allowed here by policy. Take your pick of reasons, this book needs to go. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:18, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
::{{comment}} - I agree that the book needs work but what is the point of deleting stubs so soon (1year inactivity if we consider all the pages)? The book has been made of a collage of moved pages, as you say above it seems that content was no only able to survive various deletion attempts but also based on the number of users that worked on the aggregation of the pages seems to have at least a significant value (content wise). The book in itself (save one page) doesn't promote any point of view and covers several so the NPOV  should not apply here. From NPOV &quot;...a book collection is best served not by advancing or detracting particular points of view on any given subject, but by trying to present a fair, neutral description of the facts...&quot; &quot;Consequently, modules should be written from a neutral point of view, which means that modules should represent differing views on a subject fairly and within the context...&quot; so we should not validate the deletion the stub on this base.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:26, 11 October 2007 (UTC)
:::The amount of time that the book has been inactive is not an issue. The book is not a &quot;textbook&quot; by any definition of that word. It does not have a common theme, but is instead a collection of loosely-related articles. Also, the value of the content is not a valid reason to keep: There are many valuable works that Wikibooks does not allow. The quote you bring up from the NPOV policy works better in my favor then it does in yours: This book ''does advance and detract from several points of view''. Again, multiple POV is not the same as NPOV. Wikibooks is not a forum for people to discuss social issues, which is precisely what this book proposes to be. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:56, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I do agree that this needs some work, however I disagree that it is hopeless. Unless I'm misunderstanding it, something is NPOV ''only'' if it both expresses all relevant sides of an argument (which is the multiple Points of View argument) '''and''' attributes them to a third-party source. The book is not currently attributed (which is something that would need to be improved) but I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find credible sources making both sides of many of the arguments in this book. I think there is nothing wrong with a book on morality and social issues (which I presume is the purpose of this book), so long as it follows these guidelines. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:02, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''  - I have a hard time believing that books with heavy POV can be effectively redesigned. This books sure does have a lot of controversy in it and I don't feel anyone would benefit from this as a textbook. This book would have to be absolutely huge to fairly cover these topics. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:49, 12 October 2007 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''  I'm afraid I have to say that I can't see how this book fits in here at all. Granted that it could be expanded to contain a reasonable subset of the points of view on various topics, it still would not be a textbook: by its nature, it can't be, it could be a macropedia, as Whiteknight mentioned. I also see this as being a focus for argument. The most likely outcome if this book became popular would be that immature editors would take individual POVs and write them as their own personal hobby-horses, which would result in revert wars as editors delete points of view that they don't agree with and re-instate their own. It also has very real potential for developing into a series of personal attacks. While I don't suggest that this book has no value, I must state that in my opinion it is singularly unsuited for a Wiki, and as it is not a textbook, the value of retaining it in WB is minimal, and nowhere near the amount of headaches it could cause us.

Lots of school subjects require at least a basic grasp of the arguments surrounding controversial issues (in the UK: RE, Citizenship and General Studies in particular), so I believe a textbook outlining these could do some good.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;''Music is so naturally united with us that we cannot be free from it even if we so desired''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-Boethius

Music, like other forms of art, has more emotional value than the sound vibrations or paint strokes that make them.

As shown in many studies, music has countless benefits, including:
*Increasing IQ&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3psygs/MusicLessons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increasing SAT scores&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amc-music.com/musiceducation/sats.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Getting into medical school&lt;ref&gt;http://production.amc-music.org/child_literature.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Helping stroke victims relearn how to speak &lt;ref&gt;http://www.amc-music.com/musicmaking/brain/stroke.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improved emotional health&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amc-music.com/research_briefs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This templates should be generic and intended to be minimal and easy to understand, the prosed change is minimal. It can lead not only to a better understanding but also will automatically increase the chance on promoting Wikibooks (if the user does fell that the content is important enough to seek authorization), altering not the intended message but providing a way to address the issue. I also changed the references to sources (as it was incomplete) except the Websites (since Wikibookians may think otherwise), probably someone could reword it better...&lt;br&gt;
If no objection arises I will make the change it in a few days. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:54, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
:Well the first problem is that we can't use &quot;content which uses an unacceptable license&quot; with permission - they have to license it appropriately, right? They can't just say &quot;Yes, it is copyrighted, but I give you permission to use it on Wikibooks.&quot; That's not OK - it must be GFDL-compatible. I'm sure that's what you intended to mean, but this wording is currently incorrect. Something like this would be better: &quot;... which uses an unacceptable license or is lacking one. You may want to ask the copyright holder(s) for [[Wikibooks:Boilerplate_request_for_permission|permission]] to use the content here.&quot; This is both accurate and complete. Keep in mind that this is mostly used for egregious copyright violations where there is little to no doubt that they've just ripped it off some corporate website which would never give them permission. Since that's the case, I don't think we need to be overly concerned about covering all the bases like this; they can check out [[Wikibooks:Media]] if they're interested. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:03, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

::Nope the license can be even against the GFDL but if the contributor gets permission from the copyright holder, it constitutes a relicense to you or to Wikimedia (the scope depends on how it is done).
::They may relicense the work completely or grant you permission to user it (in any way or with limitations) or even limited to the place you intend to add the content to (it may not be limited to Wikibooks). (as for the details the copyright information here covers all that and the proposal I linked to is complete, even overstating the GFDL issue).
::Well I don't think most do it in bad faith (and we shouldn't aim that low), most do it out of lack of information or misunderstanding of how copyrights work. Does this address your objections ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:17, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
:::Are you trying to say that things like &quot;You can use it only on Wikibooks&quot; or &quot;You can use it for anything noncommercial&quot; are ok? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:21, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
::::For instance those would be valid limitations a copyright holder can impose (on use, to the publisher, in distribution, etc...), he doesn't have to write a long license to go about it, some licenses can even be only invoked and not aggregate, it all falls down to how the permission was given. In case of wikibooks it is required that they conform to the GFDL (the limitations if any).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:27, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
:::::Right, but they're not suitable for inclusion on Wikibooks. See [[Help:Contributing FAQ#I have, or can get, special permission to copy an image or module to Wikibooks. Is it OK to do that?|here]]: &quot;The text and images of Wikibooks are covered by the GNU Free Documentation License. Unless an item is covered by the same or a similar license, or is in the public domain, it cannot be used on Wikibooks. So you have to ask the copyright holder of the material to license it under GFDL.&quot;
:::::So back to the original issue: We need content to be specifically GFDL-compatible for inclusion here (with exceptions that aren't relevant here). The most correct way to impart this would be to say &quot;We can't accept copyrighted content unless it is licensed in a GFDL-compatible way&quot; and then link to a description of what that is (ie [[Wikibooks:Media). Feel free to propose language which is more formal than that, but that's what it needs to say. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:32, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

*reset

Yup, but &quot;unless it is licensed in a GFDL-compatible way&quot; is equal to &quot;unless it is given permission to be used in a GFDL-compatible way&quot; (I didn't remove any reference to the GFDL on the template above).
The link to the example request for authorization does address in high detail the GFDL and limitations we use on Wikibooks, a similar valid proposal (but not as informative to the other party would be, &quot;DO you grant permission to use your work XPTO  at Wikibooks on the work XPTO123&quot;, this is oversimplification but there is no deep need to explain the particular in so much detail for it to be valid. I think that the way the actual example is written can cause an increase on anxiety to the target, and requires a deeper understanding of the GFDL, trouble that most will not get into. But that is another matter. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:43, 14 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
That last example is in error or badly phrased. Take for example the UNESCO case...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:45, 14 December 2007 (UTC)
:OK; what you meant to say was correct then. Let's try this language on for size:

== Use ==
The tag may be use to obligate the provision of information regarding a works copyright license. PD works are considered out of copyright but still acceptable. This has more to do with what is tagged so I'm attempting to make this clear here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:22, 7 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

== About CLIPS ==
{{Wikipedia|CLIPS}}
'''CLIPS''' is a public-domain software tool for building expert systems. The name is an acronym for &quot;C Language Integrated Production System.&quot; The syntax and name was inspired by Charles Forgy's [[w:OPS5|OPS]]. The first versions of CLIPS were developed starting in 1985 at NASA-Johnson Space Center until the mid 1990s when the development group's responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology.

CLIPS is probably the most widely used expert system tool because it is fast, efficient and free. Although it is now in the public domain, it is still updated and supported by the original author, Gary Riley. CLIPS incorporates a complete object-oriented language &quot;COOL&quot; for writing expert systems. Though it is written in C, its interface more closely resembles that of the programming language LISP. Extensions can be written in C, and CLIPS can be called from C.

Like other expert system languages, CLIPS deals with rules and facts. Various facts can make a rule applicable. An applicable rule is then asserted. Facts and rules are created by first defining them, as shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (deffacts trouble_shooting
     (car_problem (name ignition_key) (status on))
     (car_problem (name engine) (status wont_start))
     (car_problem (name headlights) (status work))
  )
 (defrule rule1
     (car_problem (name ignition_key) (status on))
     (car_problem (name engine) (status wont_start))
      =&gt;
     (assert (car_problem (name starter) (status faulty))
  )
&lt;/source&gt;
Descendants of the CLIPS language include Jess, [[w:Haley Eclipse|Haley Eclipse]], [[w:FuzzyCLIPS|FuzzyCLIPS]], [http://erabaki.ehu.es/ehsis/ EHSIS], and others.

== About Jess ==
{{Wikipedia|Jess programming language}}

'''Jess''', a rule engine for the Java platform, is a superset of [[../CLIPS|CLIPS]], developed by Ernest Friedman-Hill of Sandia National Labs. It was first written in late 1995.

It provides rule-based programming suitable for automating an expert system, and is often referred to as an ''expert system shell''.  In recent years, intelligent agent systems have also developed, which depend on a similar capability.

Rather than a procedural paradigm, where a single program has a loop that is activated only one time, the declarative paradigm used by Jess continuously applies a collection of rules to a collection of facts by a process called ''pattern matching''. Rules can modify the collection of facts, or they can execute any Java code.

Jess can be used to build Java servlets, EJBs, applets, and full applications that use knowledge in the form of declarative rules to draw conclusions and make inferences. Since many rules may match many inputs, there are few effective general purpose matching algorithms.  The Jess rules engine uses the Rete algorithm.

While CLIPS is licensed as open source, Jess is not open source.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===
Code examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
  ; is a comment

 (bind ?x 100)
 
 ; x = 100

 (deffunction max (?a ?b)
   (if (&gt; ?a ?b) then ?a else ?b))

 (deffacts myroom
    (furniture chair)
    (furniture table)
    (furniture bed)
 )

 (deftemplate car
    (slot color)
    (slot mileage)
    (slot value)
 )

 (assert (car (color red) (mileage 10000) (value 400)))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example 2 ===

Sample code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;

==History==

{{Wikipedia|Prolog}}

'''Prolog''' is a logic programming language. It is a general purpose language often associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It has a purely logical subset, called &quot;pure Prolog&quot;, as well as a number of extralogical features.

It was created around 1972 by Alain Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel, based on Robert Kowalski's procedural interpretation of Horn clauses.  It was motivated in part by the desire to reconcile the use of logic as a declarative knowledge representation language with the procedural representation of knowledge that was popular in North America in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Much of the modern development of Prolog came from the impetus of the fifth generation computer systems project (FGCS), which developed a variant of Prolog named ''Kernel Language'' for its first operating system.

Pure Prolog was originally restricted to the use of a resolution theorem prover with Horn clauses of the form

:&lt;tt&gt;H :- B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;.

The application of the theorem-prover treats such clauses as procedures

:to show/solve &lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;, show/solve &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and … and &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

Pure Prolog was soon extended, however, to include negation as failure, in which negative conditions of the form not(B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) are shown by trying and failing to solve the corresponding positive conditions B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Data types ==

Prolog's single data type is the ''term''. Terms are either ''atoms'', ''numbers'', ''variables'' or ''compound terms''.

Example '''atoms''' are: x, blue, 'Some atom', and [].

'''Numbers''' can be floats or integers. Many Prolog implementations also provide unbounded integers and rational numbers.

'''Variables''' are denoted by a string consisting of letters, numbers and underscore characters, and beginning with an upper-case letter or underscore. Variables closely resemble variables in logic in that they are placeholders for arbitrary terms. A variable can become instantiated via [[unification]]. 
A single underscore (_) denotes an anonymous variable and means &quot;any term&quot;.

A '''compound term''' has a functor and a number of arguments, which are again terms. The number of arguments is called the term's [[arity]]. (Atoms can be regarded as a special case of compound terms of [[arity]] zero.)

Examples for terms are f(a,b) and p(x,y,z). Some operators can be used in infix notation. For example, the terms +(a,b) and =(X,Y) can also be written as a+b and X=Y, respectively. Users can also declare arbitrary sequences of symbols as new infix or postfix operators to allow for domain-specific notations. The notation ''f/n'' is commonly used to denote a term with functor ''f'' and arity ''n''.

Special cases of compound terms:

* ''Lists'' are defined inductively: The atom [] is a list. A compound term with functor . (dot) and arity 2, whose second argument is a list, is itself a list. There exists special syntax for denoting lists: .(A, B) is equivalent to [A|B]. For example, the list .(1, .(2, .(3, []))) can also be written as [1,2,3].
* ''Strings'': A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes is equivalent to a list of (numeric) character codes, generally in the local [[character encoding]] or [[Unicode]] if the system supports Unicode.

== Programming in Prolog ==
Prolog programs describe relations, defined by means of clauses. Pure Prolog is restricted to [[Horn clauses]], a [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] subset of first-order [[predicate logic]].  There are two types of clauses:  Facts and rules.  A rule is of the form 

 Head :- Body.

and is read as &quot;Head is true if Body is true&quot;. A rule's body consists of calls to predicates, which are called the rule's '''goals'''. The built-in [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ,/2 denotes [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of goals, and ;/2 denotes [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]].  Conjunctions and disjunctions can only appear in the body, not in the head of a rule.  Clauses with empty bodies are called '''facts'''.  An example of a fact is:

 cat(tom).

which is equivalent to the rule:

 cat(tom) :- true.

The built-in predicate true/0 is always true.

Given above fact, one can ask:

''is tom a cat?''

 ?- cat(tom).  
 Yes

''what things are cats?''

 ?- cat(X).  
 X = tom

Due to the relational nature of many built-in predicates, they can typically be used in several directions. For example, length/2 can be used to determine the length of a list (&lt;tt&gt;length(List, L)&lt;/tt&gt;, given a list &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt;) as well as to generate a list skeleton of a given length (&lt;tt&gt;length(X, 5)&lt;/tt&gt;), and also to generate both list skeletons and their lengths together (&lt;tt&gt;length(X, L)&lt;/tt&gt;).  Similarly, append/3 can be used both to append two lists (&lt;tt&gt;append(ListA, ListB, X)&lt;/tt&gt; given lists &lt;tt&gt;ListA&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ListB&lt;/tt&gt;) as well as to split a given list into parts (&lt;tt&gt;append(X, Y, List)&lt;/tt&gt;, given a list &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt;).  For this reason, a comparatively small set of library predicates suffices for many Prolog programs.  All predicates can also be used to perform [[unit tests]]: Queries can be embedded in programs and allow for automatic compile-time regression testing.

As a general purpose language, Prolog also provides various built-in predicates to perform routine activities like input/output, using graphics and otherwise communicating with the operating system. These predicates are not given a relational meaning and are only useful for the side-effects they exhibit on the system. For example, the predicate &lt;tt&gt;write/1&lt;/tt&gt; displays a term on the screen.

== Evaluation ==
Execution of a Prolog program is initiated by the user's posting of a single goal, called the query. Logically, the Prolog engine tries to find a [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]] refutation of the negated query. The resolution method used by Prolog is called [[SLD resolution]]. If the negated query can be refuted, it follows that the query, with the appropriate variable bindings in place, is a logical consequence of the program. In that case, all generated variable bindings are reported to the user, and the query is said to have succeeded. Operationally, Prolog's execution strategy can be thought of as a generalization of function calls in other languages, one difference being that multiple clause heads can match a given call. In that case, the system creates a choice-point, unifies the goal with the clause head of the first alternative, and continues with the goals of that first alternative. If any goal fails in the course of executing the program, all variable bindings that were made since the most recent choice-point was created are undone, and execution continues with the next alternative of that choice-point. This execution strategy is called chronological [[backtracking]]. For example:

 sibling(X, Y)      :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y).
 
 parent_child(X, Y) :- father_child(X, Y).
 parent_child(X, Y) :- mother_child(X, Y).
 
 mother_child(trude, sally).
 
 father_child(tom, sally).
 father_child(tom, erica).
 father_child(mike, tom).

This results in the following query being evaluated as true:

 ?- sibling(sally, erica).
 Yes

This is obtained as follows: Initially, the only matching clause-head for the query sibling(sally, erica) is the first one, so proving the query is equivalent to proving the body of that clause with the appropriate variable bindings in place, i.e., the conjunction (parent_child(Z,sally), parent_child(Z,erica)). The next goal to be proved is the leftmost one of this conjunction, i.e., parent_child(Z, sally). Two clause heads match this goal. The system creates a choice-point and tries the first alternative, whose body is father_child(Z, sally). This goal can be proved using the fact father_child(tom, sally), so the binding Z = tom is generated, and the next goal to be proved is the second part of the above conjunction: parent_child(tom, erica). Again, this can be proved by the corresponding fact. Since all goals could be proved, the query succeeds. Since the query contained no variables, no bindings are reported to the user. A query with variables, like:

 ?- father_child(Father, Child).

enumerates all valid answers on backtracking.

Notice that with the code as stated above, the query sibling(sally, sally) also succeeds (X = Y). One would insert additional goals to describe the relevant restrictions, if desired.

== Loops and recursion ==
Iterative algorithms can be implemented by means of recursive predicates. Prolog systems typically implement a well-known optimization technique called tail call optimization (TCO) for deterministic predicates exhibiting [[Tail recursion|tail recursion]] or, more generally, tail calls: A clause's stack frame is discarded before performing a call in a tail position. Therefore, deterministic tail-recursive predicates are executed with constant stack space, like loops in other languages.

== Negation ==
The built-in Prolog predicate \+/1 provides [[negation as failure]], which allows for [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning. The goal &quot;\+ illegal(X)&quot; in the rule

 legal(X) :- \+ illegal(X).

is evaluated is follows: Prolog attempts to prove illegal(X). If a proof for that goal can be found, the original goal (i.e., \+ illegal(X)) fails. If no proof can be found, the original goal succeeds. Therefore, the \+/1 prefix operator is called the &quot;not provable&quot; operator, since the query &quot;?- \+ Goal&quot; succeeds if Goal is not provable. This kind of negation is sound if its argument is ground. Soundness is lost if the argument contains variables. In particular, the query &quot;?- legal(X).&quot; can now not be used to enumerate all things that are legal.

== Operational considerations ==
Under a declarative reading, the order of rules, and of goals within rules, is irrelevant since logical disjunction and conjunction are commutative. Procedurally, however, it is often important to take into account Prolog's execution strategy, either for efficiency reasons, or due to the semantics of impure built-in predicates for which the order of evaluation matters.

==DCGs and parsing==
There is a special notation called definite clause grammars ([[Definite_clause_grammar|DCG]]s). A rule defined via --&gt;/2 instead of :-/2 is expanded by the preprocessor (expand_term/2, a facility analogous to macros in other languages) according to a few straight-forward rewriting rules, resulting in ordinary Prolog clauses. Most notably, the rewriting equips the predicate with two additional arguments, which can be used to implicitly thread state around, analogous  to [[Monads_in_functional_programming|monads]] in other languages. DCGs are often used to write parsers or list generators, as they also provide a convenient interface to list differences.

===Parser example===
A larger example will show the potential of using Prolog in parsing.

Given the sentence expressed in [[Backus-Naur form|BNF]]:

 &lt;sentence&gt;    ::=  &lt;stat_part&gt;
 &lt;stat_part&gt;   ::=  &lt;statement&gt; | &lt;stat_part&gt; &lt;statement&gt;
 &lt;statement&gt;   ::=  &lt;id&gt; = &lt;expression&gt; ;
 &lt;expression&gt;  ::=  &lt;operand&gt; | &lt;expression&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;operand&gt;
 &lt;operand&gt;     ::=  &lt;id&gt; | &lt;digit&gt;
 &lt;id&gt;          ::=  a | b
 &lt;digit&gt;       ::=  0..9
 &lt;operator&gt;    ::=  + | - | *

This can be written in Prolog using DCGs, corresponding to a predictive parser with one token look-ahead:

 sentence(S)                --&gt; statement(S0), sentence_r(S0, S).
 sentence_r(S, S)           --&gt; [].
 sentence_r(S0, seq(S0, S)) --&gt; statement(S1), sentence_r(S1, S).
 
 statement(assign(Id,E)) --&gt; id(Id), [=], expression(E), [;].
 
 expression(E) --&gt; term(T), expression_r(T, E).
 expression_r(E, E)  --&gt; [].
 expression_r(E0, E) --&gt; [+], term(T), expression_r(plus(E0,T), E).
 expression_r(E0, E) --&gt; [-], term(T), expression_r(minus(E0, T), E).
 
 term(T)       --&gt; factor(F), term_r(F, T).
 term_r(T, T)  --&gt; [].
 term_r(T0, T) --&gt; [*], factor(F), term_r(times(T0, F), T).
 
 factor(id(ID))   --&gt; id(ID).
 factor(digit(D)) --&gt; [D], { (number(D) ; var(D)), between(0, 9, D)}.
 
 id(a) --&gt; [a].
 id(b) --&gt; [b].

This code defines a relation between a sentence (given as a list of tokens) and its [[abstract syntax tree]] (AST). Example query:

 ?- phrase(sentence(AST), [a,=,1,+,3,*,b,;,b,=,0,;]).
 AST = seq(assign(a, plus(digit(1), times(digit(3), id(b)))), assign(b, digit(0))) ;

The AST is represented using Prolog terms and can be used to apply optimizations, to compile such expressions to machine-code, or to directly interpret such statements. As is typical for the relational nature of predicates, these definitions can be used both to parse and generate sentences, and also to check whether a given tree corresponds to a given list of tokens. Using iterative deepening for fair enumeration, each arbitrary but fixed sentence and its corresponding AST will be generated eventually:

 ?- length(Tokens, _), phrase(sentence(AST), Tokens).
  Tokens = [a, =, a, (;)], AST = assign(a, id(a)) ;
  Tokens = [a, =, b, (;)], AST = assign(a, id(b)) 
  etc.

== Higher-order programming ==
Since arbitrary Prolog goals can be constructed and evaluated at run-time, it is easy to write higher-order predicates like maplist/2, which applies an arbitrary predicate to each member of a given list, and sublist/3, which filters elements that satisfy a given predicate, also allowing for [[currying]].

To convert solutions from temporal representation (answer substitutions on backtracking) to spatial representation (terms), Prolog has various all-solutions predicates that collect all answer substitutions of a given query in a list. This can be used for [[list comprehension]]. For example, [[perfect numbers]] equal the sum of their proper divisors:

 perfect(N) :-
     between(1, inf, N), U is N // 2,
     findall(D, (between(1,U,D), N mod D =:= 0), Ds),
     sumlist(Ds, N).

This can be used to enumerate perfect numbers, and also to check whether a number is perfect.

== Meta-interpreters and reflection ==

Prolog is a [[homoiconic]] language and provides many facilities for [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]]. Its implicit execution strategy makes it possible to write a concise [[meta-circular evaluator]] (also called ''meta-interpreter'') for pure Prolog code. Since Prolog programs are themselves sequences of Prolog terms (:-/2 is an infix operator) that are easily read and inspected using built-in mechanisms (like read/1), it is easy to write customized interpreters that augment Prolog with domain-specific features.

==Implementation techniques==
For efficiency, Prolog code is typically compiled to abstract machine code, often influenced by the register-based [[Warren Abstract Machine]] (WAM) instruction set. Some implementations employ [[abstract interpretation]] to derive type and mode information of predicates at compile time, or compile to real machine code for high performance. Devising efficient implementation techniques for Prolog code is a field of active research in the logic programming community, and various other execution techniques are employed in some implementations. These include [[clause binarization]] and stack-based virtual machines.

== Examples ==

Here follow some example programs written in Prolog.

=== QuickSort ===
The [[QuickSort]] sorting algorithm, relating a list to its sorted version:

 partition([], _, [], []).
 partition([X|Xs], Pivot, Smalls, Bigs) :-
     (   X @&lt; Pivot -&gt;
         Smalls = [X|Rest],
         partition(Xs, Pivot, Rest, Bigs)
     ;   Bigs = [X|Rest],
         partition(Xs, Pivot, Smalls, Rest)
     ).
 
 quicksort([])     --&gt; [].
 quicksort([X|Xs]) --&gt; 
     { partition(Xs, X, Smaller, Bigger) },
     quicksort(Smaller), [X], quicksort(Bigger).

=== Turing machine ===
[[Turing completeness]] of Prolog can be shown by using it to simulate a Turing machine:

 turing(Tape0, Tape) :-
     perform(q0, [], Ls, Tape0, Rs),
     reverse(Ls, Ls1),
     append(Ls1, Rs, Tape).
 
 perform(qf, Ls, Ls, Rs, Rs) :- !.
 perform(Q0, Ls0, Ls, Rs0, Rs) :-
     symbol(Rs0, Sym, RsRest),
     once(rule(Q0, Sym, Q1, NewSym, Action)),
     action(Action, Ls0, Ls1, [NewSym|RsRest], Rs1),
     perform(Q1, Ls1, Ls, Rs1, Rs).
 
 symbol([], b, []).
 symbol([Sym|Rs], Sym, Rs).
 
 action(left, Ls0, Ls, Rs0, Rs) :- left(Ls0, Ls, Rs0, Rs).
 action(stay, Ls, Ls, Rs, Rs).
 action(right, Ls0, [Sym|Ls0], [Sym|Rs], Rs).
 
 left([], [], Rs0, [b|Rs0]).
 left([L|Ls], Ls, Rs, [L|Rs]).

A simple example Turing machine is specified by the facts:

 rule(q0, 1, q0, 1, right).
 rule(q0, b, qf, 1, stay).

This machine performs incrementation by one of a number in unary encoding: It loops over any number of &quot;1&quot; cells and appends an additional &quot;1&quot; at the end. Example query and result:

 ?- turing([1,1,1], Ts).
 Ts = [1, 1, 1, 1] ;

This example illustrates how any computation can be expressed declaratively as a sequence of state transitions, implemented in Prolog as a relation between successive states of interest. As another example for this, an optimizing compiler with three optimization passes could be implemented as a relation between an initial program and its optimized form:

 program_optimized(Prog0, Prog) :-
     optimization_pass_1(Prog0, Prog1),
     optimization_pass_2(Prog1, Prog2),
     optimization_pass_3(Prog2, Prog).

or equivalently using DCG notation:

 program_optimized --&gt; optimization_pass_1, optimization_pass_2, optimization_pass_3.

=== Dynamic programming ===
The following Prolog program uses [[dynamic programming]] to find the [[longest common subsequence]] of two lists in polynomial time. The clause database is used for [[memoization]]:

 :- dynamic stored/1.
 
 memo(Goal) :- ( stored(Goal) -&gt; true ; Goal, assertz(stored(Goal)) ).
 
 lcs([], _, []) :- !.
 lcs(_, [], []) :- !.
 lcs([X|Xs], [X|Ys], [X|Ls]) :- !, memo(lcs(Xs, Ys, Ls)).
 lcs([X|Xs], [Y|Ys], Ls) :-
     memo(lcs([X|Xs], Ys, Ls1)), memo(lcs(Xs, [Y|Ys], Ls2)),
     length(Ls1, L1), length(Ls2, L2),
     (   L1 &gt;= L2 -&gt; Ls = Ls1 ; Ls = Ls2 ).

Example query:

 ?- lcs([x,m,j,y,a,u,z], [m,z,j,a,w,x,u], Ls).
 Ls = [m, j, a, u]

Some Prolog systems, like [[BProlog]] and [[XSB]], implement an extension called ''tabling'', which frees the user from manually storing intermediate results.

== Extensions ==

* [[Constraint logic programming]] is important for many Prolog applications in industrial settings, like time tabling and other scheduling tasks. Most Prolog systems ship with at least one constraint solver for finite domains, and often also with solvers for other domains like rational numbers.
* [[HiLog]] and [[λProlog]] extend Prolog with [[higher-order programming]] features.
* [[F-logic]] extends Prolog with frames/objects for [[knowledge representation]].
* [[OW Prolog]] has been created in order to answer Prolog's lack of graphics and interface.
* [[Logtalk]] is an open source object-oriented extension to the Prolog programming language. Integrating logic programming with object-oriented and event-driven programming, it is compatible with most Prolog compilers. It supports both prototypes and classes. In addition, it supports component-based programming through category-based composition.
* [http://apps.lumii.lv/prolog-mpi/ Prolog-MPI] is an open-source [[SWI-Prolog]] extension for distributed computing over the [[Message Passing Interface]].

== Related languages ==

* [[Visual Prolog]], also formerly known as '''PDC Prolog''' and '''Turbo Prolog'''.  Visual Prolog is a strongly-typed object-oriented dialect of Prolog, which is considerably different from standard Prolog.  As Turbo Prolog it was marketed by Borland, but it is now developed and marketed by the Danish firm PDC (Prolog Development Center) that originally produced it.
* [[Datalog]] is actually a subset of Prolog.  It is limited to relationships that may be stratified and does not allow compound terms. In contrast to Prolog, Datalog is not Turing-complete.
* In some ways Prolog is a subset of [[Planner programming language|Planner]], e.g., see Kowalski's early history of logic programming.  The ideas in Planner were later further developed in the [[Scientific Community Metaphor]].

Frameworks also exist which can provide a bridge between Prolog and the [[Java programming language]]:

* [http://www.declarativa.com/interprolog/ InterProlog], a programming library bridge between [[Java platform|Java]] and Prolog, implementing bi-directional predicate/method calling between both languages. Java objects can be mapped into Prolog terms and vice-versa. Allows the development of [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]] and other functionality in Java while leaving logic processing in the Prolog layer. Supports [[XSB]], [[SWI-Prolog]] and YAP.
* [[Prova]] provides native syntax integration with Java, agent messaging and reaction rules. Prova positions itself as a rule-based scripting (RBS) system for middleware. The language breaks new ground in combining [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative programming]].

{{Wikipedia|Dendral}}
'''Dendral''' was an influential pioneer project in artificial intelligence (AI) of the 1960s, and the [[computer software]] [[expert system]] that it produced. Its primary aim was to help [[organic chemistry|organic chemists]] in identifying unknown organic molecules, by analyzing their [[mass spectrometry|mass spectra]] and using knowledge of chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  It was done at [[Stanford University]] by [[Edward Feigenbaum]], [[Bruce Buchanan]], [[Joshua Lederberg]], and [[Carl Djerassi]].&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  It began in 1965 and spans approximately half the history of AI research.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  

The software program Dendral is considered the first expert system because it automated the decision-making process and problem-solving behavior of organic chemists.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of two sub-programs, '''Heuristic Dendral''' and '''Meta-Dendral''',&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;.  It was written in [[Lisp (programming language)]], which was considered the language of AI.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many systems were derived from Dendral, including [[MYCIN]], MOLGEN, MACSYMA, PROSPECTOR, [[XCON]], and STEAMER.

The name ''Dendral'' is a [[portmanteaux]] of the term &quot;Dendritic Algorithm&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Heuristic Dendral==
Heuristic Dendral is a program that uses mass spectra or other experimental data together with knowledge base of chemistry, to produce a set of possible chemical structures that may be responsible for producing the data.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  A mass spectrum of a compound is produced by a mass spectrometer, and is used to deterime its molecular weight, the sum of the masses of its atomic constituents.  For example, the compound water (H2O), has a molecular weight of 18 since hydrogen has a mass of 1.01 and oxygen 16.00, and its mass spectrum has a peak at 18 units.  Heuristic Dendral would use this input mass and the knowledge of atomic mass numbers and valence rules, to determine the possible combinations of atomic constituents whose mass would add up to 18.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  As the weight increases and the molecules become more complex, the number of possible compounds increases drastically. Thus, a program that is able to reduce this number of candidate solutions through the process of hypothesis formation is essential.

==Meta-Dendral==
Meta-Dendral is a knowledge acquisition system that receives the set of possible chemical structures and corresponding mass spectra as input, and proposes a set of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain correlation between some of the proposed structures and the mass spectrum &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. These hypotheses would be fed back to Heuristic Dendral to test their applicability.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, &quot;Heuristic Dendral is a performance system and Meta-Dendral is a learning system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  The program is based on two important features: the plan-generate-test paradigm and knowledge engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan-generate-test paradigm===
The plan-generate-test paradigm is the basic organization of the problem-solving method, and is a common paradigm used by both '''Heuristic Dendral''' and '''Meta-Dendral''' systems &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''generator''' generates potential solutions for a particular problem, which are then expressed as [[chemical graph]]s in Dendral &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this is feasible only when the number of candidate solutions is minimal. When there are large numbers of possible solutions, Dendral has to find a way to put constraints that rules out large sets of candidate solutions &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. This is the primary aim of Dendral '''planner''', which is a “hypothesis-formation” program that employs “task-specific knowledge to find constraints for the generator” &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. Last but not least, the '''tester''' analyzes each proposed candidate solution and discards those that fail to fulfill certain criteria &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. This mechanism of plan-generate-test paradigm is what holds Dendral together &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Knowledge Engineering===
The primary aim of knowledge engineering is to attain a productive interaction between the available knowledge base and problem solving techniques &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. This is possible through development of a procedure in which large amounts of task-specific information is encoded into heuristic programs &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the first essential component of knowledge engineering is a large '''“knowledge base.”''' The knowledge base would include specific knowledge about the mass spectrometry technique, large amount of information that forms the basis of chemistry and graph theory, and any information that might be helpful in finding the solution of a particular chemical structure elucidation problem &lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;. Through knowledge engineering Dendral is able to use this “knowledge base” to both determine the set of possible chemical structures that correspond to the input data, and form new “general rules” that helps it reduce the number of candidate solutions. Thus, at the end the user is now provided with a minimal number of possible solutions, which can now be tested by any non-expert user to find the right solution.

== Heuristics ==

A [[heuristic]] is a rule of thumb, an algorithm that does not guarantee a solution, but reduces the number of possible solutions by discarding unlikely and irrelevant solutions.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of heuristics to solve problems is called &quot;heuristics programming&quot;, and was used in Dendral to allow it to replicate in machines the process through which human experts induce the solution to problems via rules of thumb and specific information.

Heuristics programming was a major approach and a giant step forward in artificial intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay et al., 1980&lt;/ref&gt; as it allowed scientists to finally automate certain traits of human intelligence. It became prominent among scientists in the late 1940s through [[George Polya]]’s book, ''How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method''.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Herbert Simon]] said in ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', &quot;if you take a heuristic conclusion as certain, you may be fooled and disappointed; but if you neglect heuristic conclusions altogether you will make no progress at all.&quot;

== History ==

During mid 20th century, the question &quot;can machines think?&quot; became intriguing and popular among scientists, primarily to add humanistic characteristics to machine behavior. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], who was one of the prime researchers of this field, termed this concept of machine intelligence as &quot;[[artificial intelligence]]&quot; (AI) during the Dartmouth summer in 1956. AI is usually defined as the capacity of a machine to perform operations that are analogous to human cognitive capabilities &lt;ref&gt;Berk, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;. Much research to create AI was done during the 20th century.

Also around mid 20th century, science, especially biology, faced a fast-increasing need to develop a &quot;man-computer symbiosis&quot;, to aid scientists in solving problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the structural analysis of [[myogoblin]], [[hemoglobin]], and other [[protein]]s relentlessly needed instrumentation development due to its complexity.

In the early 1960s, [[Joshua Lederberg]] started working with computers and quickly became tremendously interested in creating interactive computers to help him in his [[exobiology]] research &lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically, he was interested in designing computing systems that to help him study alien organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As he was not an expert in either chemistry or computer programming, he collaborated with Stanford chemist [[Carl Djerassi]] to help him with chemistry, and [[Edward Feigenbaum]] with programming, to automate the process of determining chemical structures from raw mass spectrometry data.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Feigenbaum was an expert in [[programming language]]s and heuristics, and helped Lederberg design a system that replicated the way Carl Djerassi solved structure elucidation problems &lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;. They devised a system called '''Dendritic Algorithm''' (Dendral) that was able to generate possible chemical structures corresponding to the mass spectrometry data as an output.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendral then was still very inaccurate in assessing spectra of [[ketone]]s, [[alcohols]], and [[isomer]]s of chemical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as seen in figure 1, Djerassi &quot;taught&quot; general rules to Dendral that could help eliminate most of the &quot;chemically implausible&quot; structures, and produce a set of structures that could now be analyzed by a &quot;non-expert&quot; user to determine the right structure.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 2 shows how Dendral operates without an expert, after all the general rules were entered into Dendral's knowledge base.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dendral team recruited Bruce Buchanan to refine Feigenbaum’s Lisp program.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Buchanan had similar ideas and interests as Feigenbaum and Lederberg, but his special interest was hypothesis formation.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  As Joseph November said in ''Digitizing Life: The Introduction of Computers to Biology and Medicine'', &quot;(Buchanan) wanted the system (Dendral) to make discoveries on its own, not just help humans make them&quot;. Buchanan designed &quot;Meta-Dendral&quot;, which was a &quot;hypothesis maker&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Meta-Dendral and Dendral were fused together to create Heuristic Dendral&quot; in 1966-67.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The prime difference was that Heuristic Dendral &quot;would serve as a template for similar systems in other areas&quot; rather than just concentrating in the field of organic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikipedia|Mycin}}

'''Mycin''' was an early expert system developed over five or six years in the early 1970s at Stanford University; it was written in Lisp, by Edward Shortliffe under the direction of Bruce Buchanan and others; it derived from the earlier Dendra] expert system, but considerably modified and extended the basic Dendral software. This computer system was designed to diagnose infectious blood diseases and recommend antibiotics, with the dosage adjusted for patient's body weight &amp;mdash; the name derived from the antibiotics themselves, as many antibiotics have the suffix &quot;-mycin&quot;.

==Method==
Mycin operated using a fairly simple inference engine,a knowledge base of ~500 rules. It would query the physician running the program via a long series of simple yes/no or textual questions. At the end, it provided a list of possible culprit bacteria ranked from high to low based on the probability of each diagnosis, its confidence in each diagnosis' probability, the reasoning behind each diagnosis (that is, Mycin would also list the questions and rules which led it to rank a diagnosis a particular way), and its recommended course of drug treatment.

Despite Mycin's success, it is sometimes now used as a cautionary tale in AI courses for people who generate their own ad hoc probability frameworks. Mycin had a limited depth to its reasoning hierarchy due to the noise introduced by its certainty factor system. This problem can be solved by using a rigorous probabilistic framework, such as Bayesian statistics.

==Results==
Research conducted at the Stanford Medical School found Mycin to have a correct diagnosis rate of about 65%, which was ''better'' than most physicians who were not specialists in diagnosing bacterial infections, even though  it was worse than those physicians who were themselves experts in the field who had average correct diagnosis rates of about 80%.

==Practical use==
Mycin was never actually used in practice. This wasn't because of any weakness in its performance &amp;mdash; in tests it outperformed members of the Stanford medical school. It was as much because of ethical and legal issues related to the use of computers in medicine &amp;mdash; if it gives the wrong diagnosis, who can be held responsible? Issues with whether human experts would find it acceptable to use arose as well.

A difficulty that rose to prominence during the development of Mycin and subsequent complex expert systems has been the extraction of the necessary knowledge for the inference engine to use from the humans expert in the relevant fields into the rule base (the so-called knowledge engineering).

== About Fuzzy Logic ==

{{Wikipedia|Fuzzy logic}}

'''Fuzzy logic''' is derived from fuzzy set theory dealing with reasoning that is approximate rather than precisely deduced from classical predicate logic. It can be thought of as the application side of fuzzy set theory dealing with well thought out real world expert values for a complex problem (Klir 1997).

Degrees of truth are often confused with probabilities.  However, they are conceptually distinct; fuzzy truth represents membership in vaguely defined sets, not likelihood of some event or condition. For example, if a 100-ml glass contains 30 ml of water, then, for two fuzzy sets, Empty and Full, one might define the glass as being 0.7 empty and 0.3 full.  Note that the concept of emptiness would be subjective and thus would depend on the observer or designer.  Another designer might equally well design a set membership function where the glass would be considered full for all values down to 50 ml. A probabilistic setting would first define a scalar variable for the fullness of the glass, and second, conditional distributions describing the probability that someone would call the glass full given a specific fullness level.  Note that the conditioning can be achieved by having a specific observer that randomly selects the label for the glass, a distribution over deterministic observers, or both.  While fuzzy logic avoids talking about randomness in this context, this simplification at the same time obscures what is exactly meant by the statement the 'glass is 0.3 full'.

Fuzzy logic allows for set membership values to range (inclusively) between 0 and 1, and in its linguistic form, imprecise concepts like &quot;slightly&quot;, &quot;quite&quot; and &quot;very&quot;. Specifically, it allows partial membership in a set. It is related to fuzzy sets and possibility theory. It was introduced in 1965 by Lotfi Zadeh at the University of California, Berkeley.

Fuzzy logic is controversial in some circles and is rejected by some control engineers and by most statisticians who hold that probability is the only rigorous mathematical description of uncertainty. Critics also argue that it cannot be a superset of ordinary set theory since membership functions are defined in terms of conventional sets.

== Applications ==
Fuzzy logic can be used to control household appliances such as washing machines (which sense load size and detergent concentration and adjust their wash cycles accordingly) and refrigerators.

A basic application might characterize subranges of a continuous variable.  For instance, a temperature measurement for anti-lock brakes might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range.  These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled.

[[Image:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|center]]

In this image, ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' are functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three &quot;truth values&quot; &amp;mdash; one for each of the three functions. For the particular temperature illustrated with the vertical line, the three truth values could be interpreted as describing the temperature as, say, &quot;fairly cold&quot; (blue arrow), &quot;slightly warm&quot; (yellow arrow), and &quot;not hot&quot; (red arrow).

== Misconceptions and controversies==


;Fuzzy logic is the same as &quot;imprecise logic&quot;. 
:Fuzzy logic is not any less precise than any other form of logic: it is an organized and mathematical method of handling ''inherently'' imprecise concepts. The concept of &quot;coldness&quot; cannot be expressed in an equation, because although temperature is a quantity, &quot;coldness&quot; is not. However, people have an idea of what &quot;cold&quot; is, and agree that there is no sharp cutoff between &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;not cold&quot;, where something is &quot;cold&quot; at N degrees but &quot;not cold&quot; at N+1 degrees &amp;mdash; a concept classical logic cannot easily handle due to the principle of bivalence. The result has no set answer so it is believed to be a 'fuzzy' answer.

;Fuzzy logic is a new way of expressing probability. 
:Fuzzy logic and probability are different ways of expressing uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can be used to represent subjective belief, fuzzy set theory uses the concept of fuzzy set membership (i.e. ''how much'' a variable is in a set), probability theory uses the concept of subjective probability (i.e. ''how probable'' do I think that a variable is in a set). While this distinction is mostly philosophical, the fuzzy-logic-derived possibility measure is inherently different from the probability measure, hence they are not ''directly'' equivalent. However, many statisticians are persuaded by the work of Bruno de Finetti that only one kind of mathematical uncertainty is needed and thus fuzzy logic is unnecessary.  On the other hand, Bart Kosko argues that probability is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as probability only handles one kind of uncertainty. He also claims to have proven a derivation of Bayes' theorem from the concept of fuzzy subsethood. Lotfi Zadeh, the creator of fuzzy logic, argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He has created a fuzzy alternative to probability, which he calls possibility theory. Other controversial approaches to uncertainty include [[Expert Systems/Dempster-Shafer Theory|Dempster-Shafer theory]] and rough sets.  

;Fuzzy logic will be difficult to scale to larger problems.
:This criticism is mainly due to the fact that there exist problems with conditional possibility, the fuzzy set theory equivalent of conditional probability (see Halpen (2003), section 3.8). This makes it difficult to perform inference. However there have not been many studies comparing fuzzy-based systems with probabilistic ones.

== Examples where fuzzy logic is used ==

* Automobile and other vehicle subsystems, such as automatic transmissions, ABS and cruise control (e.g. Tokyo monorail)
* Air conditioners
* The Massive engine used in the ''Lord of the Rings'' films, which helped show huge scale armies create random, yet orderly movements
* Cameras
* Digital image processing, such as edge detection
* Rice cookers
* Dishwashers
* Elevators
* Washing machines and other home appliances
* Video game artificial intelligence
* Language filters on message boards and chat rooms for filtering out offensive text
* Pattern recognition in Remote Sensing
* Fuzzy logic has also been incorporated into some microcontrollers and microprocessors, for instance, the Freescale 68HC12.

== How fuzzy logic is applied ==
Fuzzy Set Theory defines Fuzzy Operators on Fuzzy Sets. The problem in applying this is that the appropriate Fuzzy Operator may not be known. For this reason, Fuzzy logic usually uses IF/THEN rules, or constructs that are equivalent, such as fuzzy associative matrices.

Rules are usually expressed in the form:&lt;br&gt;
IF ''variable'' IS ''set'' THEN ''action''

For example, an extremely simple temperature regulator that uses a fan might look like this:&lt;br&gt;
IF temperature IS very cold THEN stop fan&lt;br&gt;
IF temperature IS cold THEN turn down fan&lt;br&gt;
IF temperature IS normal THEN maintain level&lt;br&gt;
IF temperature IS hot THEN speed up fan&lt;br&gt;

Notice there is no &quot;ELSE&quot;.  All of the rules are evaluated, because the temperature might be &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; at the same time to differing degrees.

The AND, OR, and NOT operators of boolean logic exist in fuzzy logic, usually defined as the minimum, maximum, and complement; when they are defined this way, they are called the ''Zadeh operators'', because they were first defined as such in Zadeh's original papers. So for the fuzzy variables x and y:

NOT x = (1 - truth(x))

x AND y = minimum(truth(x), truth(y))

x OR y = maximum(truth(x), truth(y))

There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called ''hedges'' that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as &quot;very&quot;, or &quot;somewhat&quot;, which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula.

In application, the programming language Prolog is well geared to implementing fuzzy logic with its facilities to set up a database of &quot;rules&quot; which are queried to deduct logic.  This sort of programming is known as logic programming.

Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy relational databases. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in Maria Zemankova's dissertation. After, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. Medina, M.A. Vila et al. In the context of fuzzy databases, some fuzzy querying languages have been defined, highlighting the SQLf by P. Bosc et al. and the FSQL by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels and so on.

=== Other examples ===

* If a man is 1.8 meters, consider him as tall:&lt;br&gt;
IF male IS true AND height &gt;= 1.8 THEN is_tall IS true; is_short IS false

* The fuzzy rules do not make the sharp distinction between tall and short, that is not so realistic:&lt;br&gt;
IF height &lt;= medium male THEN is_short IS agree somewhat&lt;br&gt;
IF height &gt;= medium male THEN is_tall IS agree somewhat&lt;br&gt;

In the fuzzy case, there are no such heights like 1.83 meters, but there are fuzzy values, like the following assignments:

dwarf male = [0, 1.3] m&lt;br&gt;
short male = (1.3, 1.5]&lt;br&gt;
medium male = (1.5, 1.8]&lt;br&gt;
tall male = (1.8, 2.0]&lt;br&gt;
giant male &gt; 2.0 m&lt;br&gt;

For the consequent, there are also not only two values, but five, say:&lt;br&gt;

agree not = 0&lt;br&gt;
agree little = 1&lt;br&gt;
agree somewhat = 2&lt;br&gt;
agree a lot = 3&lt;br&gt;
agree fully = 4&lt;br&gt;

In the binary, or &quot;crisp&quot;, case, a person of 1.79 meters of height is considered short. If another person is 1.8 meters or 2.25 meters, these persons are considered tall.

The crisp example differs deliberately from the fuzzy one. We did not put in the antecedent 

IF male &gt;= agree somewhat AND ...

as gender is often considered as a binary information. So, it is not so complex as being tall.
&lt;references/&gt;

== Formal fuzzy logic ==
In mathematical logic, there are several formal systems that model the above notions of &quot;fuzzy logic&quot;; most of them belong among so-called t-norm fuzzy logics. Note that they use a different set of operations than above mentioned Zadeh operators.

=== Propositional fuzzy logics ===

The most important propositional fuzzy logics are:
* Basic propositional fuzzy logic BL is an axiomatization of logic where conjunction is defined by a continuous |t-norm, and implication is defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to BL-algebras.
* Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic is a special case of basic fuzzy logic where conjunction is Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic logic plus an axiom of double negation (so it is not intuitionistic logic), and its models correspond to MV-algebras.
* Gödel fuzzy logic is a special case of basic fuzzy logic where conjunction is Gödel t-norm. It has the axioms of basic logic plus an axiom of idempotence of conjunction, and its models are called G-algebras.
* Product fuzzy logic is a special case of basic fuzzy logic where conjunction is product t-norm. It has the axioms of basic logic plus another axiom, and its models are called product algebras.
* Monoidal t-norm logic MTL is a generalization of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is realized by a ''left''-continuous t-norm. Its models (MTL-algebras) are prelinear commutative bounded integral residuated lattices.
* Rational Pavelka logic is a generalization of multi-valued logic. It is an extension of Łukasziewicz fuzzy logic with additional constants.
All these logics encompass the traditional propositional logic (whose models correspond to Boolean algebras).

=== Predicate fuzzy logics ===
These extend the above-mentioned fuzzy logics by adding universal and existential quantifiers in a manner similar to the way that predicate logic is created from propositional logic. The semantics of the universal resp. existential quantifier in t-norm fuzzy logics is the infimum resp. supremum of the truth degrees of the instances of the quantified subformula.

=== Effectiveness for fuzzy logics ===
The notions of a &quot;decidable subset&quot; and &quot;recursively enumerable subset&quot; are basic ones for classical mathematics and classical logic. Then, the question of a suitable extension of such concepts to fuzzy set theory arises. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of ''fuzzy Turing machine'', ''Markov normal fuzzy algorithm'' and ''fuzzy program''. Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla proposed the following definition where ''Ü'' denotes the set of rational numbers in [0,1].
A fuzzy subset μ : ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;[0,1] of a set ''S'' is ''recursively enumerable'' if a recursive map ''h'' : ''S''×''N'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''Ü'' exists such that, for every ''x'' in ''S'', the function ''h''(''x'',''n'') is increasing with respect to ''n'' and μ(''x'') = lim ''h''(''x'',''n'').
We say that μ is ''decidable'' if both μ and its complement –μ are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is proposed in a paper by G. Gerla.
The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property). 

'''Theorem.''' Any axiomatizable fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the fuzzy set of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.

It is an open question to give supports for a ''Church thesis'' for fuzzy logic claiming that the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. To this aim, further investigations on the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy Turing machine should be necessary (see for example Wiedermann's paper). Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of Gödel’s theorems to fuzzy logic.

== About the Rete Algorithm ==

The '''Rete algorithm''' is an efficient [[pattern matching]] [[algorithm]] for implementing [[production rule system]]s.  The Rete algorithm was designed by Dr [[Charles Forgy|Charles L. Forgy]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], first published in a working paper in [[1974]], and later elaborated in his [[1979]] Ph.D. thesis and a [[1982]] paper (see [[#References|References]]). Rete has become the basis for many popular expert systems, including [[CLIPS programming language|CLIPS]], [[Jess programming language|Jess]], [[JBoss Rules]], and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]]. 

A [[naïve algorithm|naïve implementation]] of an expert system might check each rule against the known [[fact]]s in the [[Knowledge base]], firing that rule if necessary, then moving on to the next rule (and looping back to the first rule when finished).  For even moderate sized rules and facts knowledge-bases, this naïve approach performs far too slowly.

The Rete algorithm (usually pronounced either 'REET', 'REE-tee' or, in Europe, 're-tay' after the Latin pronunciation, from the [[Latin]] 'rete' for net, or [[wiktionary:Network|network]]) provides the basis for a more efficient implementation of an expert system.  A Rete-based expert system builds a network of nodes, where each node (except the root) corresponds to a pattern occurring in the left-hand-side of a rule.  The path from the root node to a leaf node defines a complete rule left-hand-side.  Each node has a memory of facts which satisfy that pattern. This structure is essentially a generalized [[Trie]].

As new facts are asserted or modified, they propagate along the network, causing nodes to be annotated when that fact matches that pattern.  When a fact or combination of facts causes all of the patterns for a given rule to be satisfied, a leaf node is reached and the corresponding rule is triggered.

The Rete algorithm is designed to sacrifice memory for increased speed.  In most cases, the speed increase over naïve implementations is several orders of magnitude (because Rete performance is theoretically independent of the number of rules in the system).  In very large expert systems, however, the original Rete algorithm tends to run into memory consumption problems.  Other algorithms, both novel and Rete-based, have since been designed which require less memory.

== Description ==
The Rete algorithm provides a generalized logical description of an implementation of functionality responsible for matching data [[Tuple|tuples]] (‘facts’) against [[AI_production|productions]] (‘[[Rule|rules]]’) in a [[Pattern_matching|pattern-matching]] [[production system]] (a category of [[rule engine]]).   A [[AI_production|production]] consists of one or more conditions and a set of actions which may be undertaken for each complete set of facts that match the conditions.   Conditions test fact [[Attribute_%28computing%29|attributes]], including fact type specifiers/identifiers.   The Rete algorithm exhibits the following major characteristics:

*	It reduces or eliminates certain types of redundancy through the use of node sharing.
*	It stores partial matches when performing [[Logical_conjunction|joins]] between different fact types.   This, in turn, allows production systems to avoid complete re-evaluation of all facts each time changes are made to the production system’s working memory.   Instead, the production system needs only to evaluate the changes (deltas) to working memory.
*	It allows for efficient removal of memory elements when facts are retracted from working memory.
The Rete algorithm is widely used to implement matching functionality within pattern-matching engines that exploit a match-resolve-act cycle to support [[forward chaining]] and [[Inference|inferencing]].

Retes are [[Directed_acyclic_graph|directed acyclic graphs]] that represent higher-level rule sets.   They are generally represented at run-time using a network of in-memory objects.   These networks match rule conditions (patterns) to facts (relational data tuples).  Rete networks act as a type of relational query processor, performing [[Projection_%28relational_algebra%29|projections]], [[Selection_%28relational_algebra%29|selections]] and [[Logical_conjunction|joins]] conditionally on arbitrary numbers of data [[Tuple|tuples]]. 

[[AI_production|Productions]] ([[Rule|rules]]) are typically captured and defined by [[Business_analyst|analysts]] and [[Software_developer|developers]] using some high-level rules language.     They are collected into rule sets which are then translated, often at run time, into an executable Rete.

When facts are ‘asserted’ to working memory, the engine creates ‘working memory elements’ (WMEs) for each fact.   Facts are [[Tuple|n-tuples]], and may therefore contain an arbitrary number of data items.   Each WME may hold an entire [[Tuple|n-tuple]], or, alternatively, each fact may be represented by a set of WMEs where each WME contains a fixed-length [[Tuple|tuple]].   In this case, [[Tuple|tuples]] are typically triplets ([[Tuple|3-tuples]]).

Each WME enters the Rete network at a single root node.  The root node passes each WME on to its child nodes, and each WME may then be propagated through the network, possibly being stored in intermediate memories, until it arrives at a terminal node.

== Alpha Network ==
The ‘left’ (alpha) side of the node graph forms a discrimination network responsible for selecting individual WMEs based on simple conditional tests which match WME attributes against constant values.  Nodes in the discrimination network may also perform tests that compare two or more [[Attribute_%28computing%29|attributes]] of the same WME.  If a WME is successfully matched against the conditions represented by one node, it is passed to the next node.   In most engines, the immediate child nodes of the root node are used to test the entity identifier or fact type of each WME.   Hence, all the WMEs which represent the same [[entity]] type typically traverse a given branch of nodes in the discrimination network.

Within the discrimination network, each branch of alpha nodes (also called 1-input nodes) terminates at a memory, called an ‘alpha’ memory.   These memories store collections of WMEs that match each condition in each node in a given node branch.   WMEs that fail to match at least one condition in a branch are not materialised within the corresponding alpha memory.   Alpha node branches may fork in order to minimise condition redundancy.

A possible variation is to introduce additional memories for each intermediate node in the discrimination network.   This increases the overhead of the Rete, but may have advantages in situations where rules are dynamically added to or removed from the Rete, making it easier to vary the topography of the discrimination network dynamically.

An alternative implementation is described by [http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1995/CMU-CS-95-113.pdf Doorenbos].    In this case, the discrimination network is replaced by a set of memories and an [[Index_%28information_technology%29|index]].    The [[Index_%28information_technology%29|index]] may be implemented using a [[hash table]].   Each memory holds WMEs that match a single conditional pattern, and the [[Index_%28information_technology%29|index]] is used to reference memories by their pattern.   This approach is only practical when WMEs represent fixed-length [[Tuple|tuples]], and the length of each [[Tuple|tuple]] is short (e.g., [[Tuple|3-tuples]]).   In addition, the approach only applies to conditional patterns that perform [[Equality_%28mathematics%29|equality]] tests against [[Variable#Constants|constant]] values.   When a WME enters the Rete, the [[Index_%28information_technology%29|index]] is used to locate a set of memories whose conditional pattern matches the WME [[Attribute_%28computing%29|attributes]], and the WME is then added directly to each of these memories.   In itself, this implementation contains no 1-input nodes.   However, in order to implement non-equality tests, the Rete may contain additional 1-input node networks through which WMEs are passed before being placed in a memory.   Alternatively, non-equality tests may be performed in the beta network described below.

== Beta Network ==
The ‘right’ (beta) side of the graph chiefly performs [[Logical_conjunction|joins]] between different WMEs.    It is optional, and is only included if required.   It consists of 2-input nodes where each node has a ‘left’ and a ‘right’ input.   Each beta node sends its output to a ‘beta’ memory.

Beta nodes process tokens.   A token is a unit of storage within a memory and also a unit of exchange between memories and nodes.  In many implementations, tokens are introduced within alpha memories where they are used to hold single WMEs.   These tokens are then passed to the beta network.

Each beta node performs its work and, as a result, may create new tokens to hold a list of WMEs representing a partial match.   These extended tokens are then stored in beta memories, and passed to subsequent beta nodes.   In this case, the beta nodes typically pass lists of WMEs through the beta network by copying existing WME lists from each received token into new tokens and then adding a further WMEs to the lists as a result of performing a [[Logical_conjunction|join]] or some other action.   The new tokens are then stored in the output memory.

A common variation is to build [[Linked_list|linked lists]] of tokens where each token holds a single WME.   In this case, lists of WMEs for a partial match are represented by the [[linked list]] of tokens.   This approach may be more optimal because it eliminates the need to copy lists of WMEs from one token to another.   Instead, a beta node needs only to create a new token to hold a WME it wishes to join to the partial match list, and then link the new token to a parent token stored in the input beta memory.   The new token now forms the head of the token list, and is stored in the output beta memory.

In descriptions of Rete, it is common to refer to token passing within the beta network.   In this article, however, we will describe data propagation in terms of WME lists, rather than tokens, in recognition of different implementation options and the underlying purpose and use of tokens.    As any one WME list passes through the beta network, new WMEs may be added to it, and the list may be stored in beta memories.     A WME list in a beta memory represents a partial match for the conditions in a given [[AI_production|production]].

WME lists that reach the end of a branch of beta nodes represent a complete match for a single [[AI_production|production]], and are passed to terminal nodes.   These nodes are sometimes called ‘p-nodes’, where ‘p’ stands for ‘[[AI_production|production]]’.   Each terminal node represents a single [[AI_production|production]], and each WME list that arrives at a terminal node represents a complete set of matching WMEs for the conditions in that [[AI_production|production]].   For each WME list it receives, a production node will ‘activate’ a new [[AI_production|production]] instance on the ‘agenda’.   Agendas are typically implemented as [[Priority_queue|prioritised queues]].

Beta nodes typically perform joins between WME lists stored in beta memories and individual WMEs stored in alpha memories.   Each beta node is associated with two input memories.    An alpha memory holds WMEs and performs ‘right’ activations on the beta node each time it stores a new WME.    A beta memory holds WME lists and performs ‘left’ activations on the beta node each time it stores a new WME list.  When a join node is right-activated, it compares one or more attributes of the newly stored WME from its input alpha memory against given attributes of specific WMEs in each WME list contained in the input beta memory.   When a join node is left-activated it traverses a single newly stored WME list in the beta memory, retrieving specific attribute values of given WMEs.   It compares these values with attribute values of each WME in the alpha memory.

Each beta node outputs WME lists which are either stored in a beta memory or sent directly to a terminal node.   WME lists are stored in beta memories whenever the engine will perform additional left activations on subsequent beta nodes.

Logically, a beta node at the head of a branch of beta nodes is a special case because it takes no input from any beta memory higher in the network.    Different engines handle this issue in different ways. Some engines use specialised adapter nodes to connect alpha memories to the left input of beta nodes. Other engines allow beta nodes to take input directly from two alpha memories, treating one as a ‘left’ input and the other as a ‘right’ input.   In both cases, ‘head’ beta nodes take their input from two alpha memories.

In order to eliminate node redundancies, any one alpha or beta memory may be used to perform activations on multiple beta nodes.   As well as join nodes, the beta network may contain additional node types, some of which are described below.   If a Rete contains no beta network, alpha nodes feed tokens, each containing a single WME, directly to p-nodes.   In this case, there may be no need to store WMEs in alpha memories.

== Conflict Resolution ==
During any one match-resolve-act cycle, the engine will find all possible matches for the facts currently asserted to working memory.   Once all the current matches have been found, and corresponding production instances have been activated on the agenda, the engine determines an order in which the production instances may be ‘fired’.    This is termed ‘conflict resolution’, and the list of activated production instances is termed the ‘conflict set’.  The order may be based on rule priority (salience), rule order, the time at which facts contained in each instance were asserted to the working memory, the complexity of each production or some other criteria.   Many engines allow rule developers to select between different conflict resolution strategies or to chain a selection of multiple strategies.
 
Conflict resolution is not defined as part of the Rete algorithm, but is used alongside the algorithm.    Some specialised [[Production_system|production systems]] do not perform conflict resolution.

== Production Execution==
Having performed conflict resolution, the engine now ‘fires’ the first production instance, executing a list of actions associated with the [[AI_production|production]]. The actions act on the data represented by the production instance’s WME list.

By default, the engine will continue to fire each production instance in order until all production instances have been fired.   Each production instance will fire only once, at most, during any one match-resolve-act cycle.   This characteristic  is termed ‘refraction’.   However, the sequence of production instance firings may be interrupted at any stage by performing changes to the working memory.   Rule actions can contain instructions to assert or retract WMEs from the ‘working memory’ of the engine. Each time any single production instance performs one or more such changes, the engine immediately enters a new match-resolve-act cycle.   This includes ‘updates’ to WMEs currently in the working memory.   Updates are represented by retracting and then re-asserting the WME.   The engine undertakes matching of the changed data which, in turn, may result in changes to the list of production instances on the agenda.  Hence, after the actions for any one specific production instance have been executed, previously activated instances may have been de-activated and removed from the agenda, and new instances may have been activated.

As part of the new match-resolve-act cycle, the engine performs conflict resolution on the agenda and then executes the current first instance.  The engine continues to fire production instances, and to enter new match-resolve-act cycles, until no further production instances exist on the agenda.  At this point the rule engine is deemed to have completed its work, and halts.

Some engines support advanced refraction strategies in which certain production instances executed in a previous cycle are not re-executed in the new cycle, even though they may still exist on the agenda.

It is possible for the engine to enter into never-ending loops in which the agenda never reaches the empty state.   For this reason, most engines support explicit ‘halt’ verbs that can be invoked from production action lists.  They may also provide automatic [[cycle detection|loop detection]] in which never-ending loops are automatically halted after a given number of iterations.   Some engines support a model in which, instead of halting when the agenda is empty, the engine enters a wait state until new facts are asserted externally. 

As for conflict resolution, the firing of activated production instances is not a feature of the Rete algorithm.   However, it is a central feature of engines that use Rete networks. Some of the optimisations offered by Rete networks are only useful in scenarios where the engine performs multiple match-resolve-act cycles.

== Existential and Universal Quantifications ==
Conditional tests are most commonly used to perform [[Selection_%28relational_algebra%29|selections]] and [[Logical_conjunction|joins]] on individual [[Tuple|tuples]].   However, by implementing additional beta node types, it is possible for Rete networks to perform [[Quantification|quantifications]].    [[Existential quantification]] involves testing for the existence of at least one set of matching WMEs in working memory.   [[Universal quantification]] involves testing that an entire set of WMEs in working memory meets a given condition.    A variation of [[universal quantification]] might test that a given number of WMEs, drawn from a set of WMEs, meets a given criteria.   This might be in terms of testing for either an exact number or a minimum number of matches.

[[Quantification]] is not universally implemented in Rete engines, and, where it is supported, several variations exist.   A variant of [[existential quantification]] referred to as ‘negation’ is widely, though not universally, supported, and is described in seminal documents.   Existentially negated conditions and [[Logical_conjunction|conjunctions]] involve the use of specialised beta nodes that test for non-existence of matching WMEs or sets of WMEs.   These nodes propagate WME lists only when no match is found.   The exact implementation of negation varies.   In one approach,  the node maintains a simple count on each WME list it receives from its left input.   The count specifies the number of matches found with WMEs received from the right input.   The node only propagates WME lists whose count is zero.   In another approach, the node maintains an additional memory on each WME list received from the left input.   These memories are a form of beta memory, and store WME lists for each match with WMEs received on the right input.   If a WME list does not have any WME lists in its memory, it is propagated down the network.   In this approach, negation nodes generally activate further beta nodes directly, rather than storing their output in an additional beta memory.   Negation nodes provide a form of '[[negation as failure]]'.

When changes are made to working memory, a WME list that previously matched no WMEs may now match newly asserted WMEs.   In this case, the propagated WME list and all its extended copies need to be retracted from beta memories further down the network.   The second approach described above is often used to support efficient mechanisms for removal of WME lists.   When WME lists are removed, any corresponding production instances are de-activated and removed from the agenda.

[[Existential quantification]] can be performed by combining two negation beta nodes.   This represents the semantics of [[double negation]] (e.g., ‘If NOT NOT any matching WMEs, then…’).   This is a common approach taken by several [[Production_system|production systems]].

== Memory Indexing ==
The Rete algorithm does not mandate any specific approach to indexing the working memory.   However, most modern production systems provide [[Index_%28information_technology%29|indexing]] mechanisms.   In some cases, only beta memories are indexed, whilst in others, indexing is used for both alpha and beta memories.   A good indexing strategy is a major factor in deciding the overall performance of a [[production system]], especially when executing rule sets that result in highly combinatorial [[pattern matching]] (i.e., intensive use of beta join nodes), or, for some engines, when executing rules sets that perform a significant number of WME retractions during multiple match-resolve-act cycles.   Memories are often implemented using combinations of [[Hash_table|hash tables]], and hash values are used to perform conditional [[Logical_conjunction|joins]] on subsets of WME lists and WMEs, rather than on the entire contents of memories.   This, in turn, often significantly reduces the number of evaluations performed by the Rete network.

== Removal of WMEs and WME lists ==
When a WME is retracted from working memory, it must be removed from every alpha memory in which it is stored.   In addition, WME lists that contain the WME must be removed from beta memories, and activated production instances for these WME lists must be de-activated and removed from the agenda.   Several implementation variations exist, including tree-based and rematch-based removal.   Memory indexing may be used in some cases to optimise removal.

== Handling OR’ed conditions ==
When defining productions in a rule set, it is common to allow conditions to be grouped using an ‘OR’ [[Logical_connective|connective]].    In many [[Production_system|production systems]], this is handled by interpreting a single [[AI_production|production]] containing multiple OR’ed patterns as the equivalent of multiple [[AI_production|productions]].   The resulting Rete network contains sets of terminal nodes which, together, represent single [[AI_production|productions]].   This approach disallows any form of short-circuiting of the OR’ed conditions.    It can also, in some cases, lead to duplicate production instances being activated on the agenda where the same set of WMEs match multiple internal productions.   Some engines provide agenda de-duplication in order to handle this issue.

== Miscellaneous Considerations ==
Although not defined by the Rete algorithm, some engines provide extended functionality to support greater control of [[Truth_maintenance_systems|truth maintenance]].   For example, when a match is found for one [[AI production|production]], this may result in the assertion of new WMEs which, in turn, match the conditions for another production.  If a subsequent change to working memory causes the first match to become invalid, it may be that this implies that the second match is also invalid. The Rete [[algorithm]] does not define any mechanism to define and handle these logical truth dependencies automatically.  Some engines, however, support additional functionality in which truth dependencies can be automatically maintained.  In this case, the retraction of one WME may lead to the automatic retraction of additional WMEs in order to maintain logical truth assertions.

The Rete [[algorithm]] does not define any approach to justification.   Justification refers to mechanisms commonly required in [[Expert_systems|expert]] and decision systems in which, at its simplest, the system reports each of the inner decisions used to reach some final conclusion.   For example, an [[Expert_systems|expert system]] might justify a conclusion that an animal is an elephant by reporting that it is large, grey, has big ears, a trunk and tusks.   Some engines provide built-in justification systems in conjunction with their implementation of the Rete [[algorithm]].

This article does not provide an exhaustive description of every possible variation or extension of the Rete algorithm.   Other considerations and innovations exist.    For example, engines may provide specialised support within the Rete network in order to apply [[Pattern_matching|pattern-matching]] [[rule]] processing to specific [[data types]] and sources such as [[Object_%28computer_science%29|programmatic objects]], [[XML]] data or [[Table_%28database%29|relational data tables]].   Another example concerns additional time-stamping facilities provided by many engines for each WME entering a Rete network, and the use these time-stamps in conjunction with conflict resolution strategies.   Engines exhibit significant variation in the way they allow programmatic access to the engine and its working memory, and may extend the basic Rete model to support forms of parallel and distributed processing.

== Optimisation and Performance ==
Several optimisations for Rete have been identified and described in academic literature. Several of these, however, apply only in very specific scenarios, and therefore often have little or no application in a general-purpose rules engine.  In addition, alternative [[algorithm|algorithms]] such as TREAT and LEAPS have been formulated which may provide additional performance improvements.   There are currently very few commercial or open source examples of [[Production_system|productions systems]] that support these alternative [[algorithm|algorithms]].

The Rete [[algorithm]] is orientated to scenarios where [[forward chaining]] and ‘[[Inference|inferencing]]’ is used to calculate new facts from existing facts, or to filter and discard facts in order to arrive at some conclusion. It is also exploited as a reasonably efficient mechanism for performing highly combinatorial evaluations of facts where large numbers of joins must be performed between fact [[Tuple|tuples]]. Other approaches to performing rule evaluation, such as the use of [[decision trees]], or the implementation of sequential engines, may be more appropriate for simple scenarios, and should be considered as possible alternatives.


The following diagram illustrates the basic Rete topography, and shows the associations between different node types and memories.

[[Image:Rete.JPG|center|600px]]

* Most implementations use type nodes to perform the first level of selection on n-tuple working memory elements.   Type nodes can be considered as specialized select nodes.   They discriminate between different tuple relation types.
* The diagram does not illustrate the use of specialized nodes types such as negated conjunction nodes.   Some engines implement several different node specialisations in order to extend functionality and maximise optimisation.
* The diagram provides a logical view of the Rete.   Implementations may differ in physical detail.   In particular, the diagram shows ‘dummy’ inputs providing right activations at the head of beta node branches.  Engines may implement other approaches, such as adapters that allow alpha memories to perform right activations directly.
* The diagram does not illustrate all node-sharing possibilities.

==Rete II==
In the 1980s Charles L. Forgy developed a successor to the Rete algorithm named '''Rete II''' [http://www.pst.com/rete2.htm]. Unlike the original Rete (which is public domain) this algorithm was not disclosed. Rete II claims better performance for more complex problems (even [http://www.pst.com/benchcr2.htm orders of magnitude]).

== About Dempster-Shafer Theory ==

{{Wikipedia|Dempster-Shafer theory}}

The '''Dempster-Shafer theory''' is a mathematical theory of [[evidence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SH76&quot;&gt;Shafer, Glenn; ''A Mathematical Theory of Evidence'', Princeton University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; based on ''belief functions'' and ''plausible reasoning'', which is used to combine separate pieces of information (evidence) to calculate the probability of an event. The theory was developed by [[Arthur P. Dempster]] and [[Glenn Shafer]].

==Consider two possible gambles==
The first gamble is that we bet on a head turning up when we toss a coin that is known to be fair. Now consider the second gamble, in which we bet on the outcome of a fight between the world's greatest boxer and the world's greatest wrestler. Assume we are fairly ignorant about martial arts and would have great difficulty making a choice of who to bet on.

Many people would feel more unsure about taking the second gamble, in which the probabilities are unknown, rather than the first gamble, in which the probabilities are easily seen to be one half for each outcome. Dempster-Shafer theory allows one to consider the confidence one has in the probabilities assigned to the various outcomes.

==Formalism==
Let ''X'' be the ''universal set'': the set of all states under consideration. The [[power set]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P(X)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all possible sub-sets of ''X'', including the [[empty set]]. For example, if:

:&lt;math&gt;X = \left \{ a, b \right \} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb P(X) = \left \{ \varnothing, \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ b \right \}, X \right \}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of the power set can be taken to represent propositions that one might be interested in, by containing all and only the states in which this proposition is true.

The theory of evidence assigns a belief mass to each subset of the power set. Formally, a function &lt;math&gt;m: \mathbb P(X) \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, is called a ''basic belief assignment'' (BBA), when it verifies two axioms. First, the mass of the empty set is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;m(\varnothing) = 0. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Second, the masses of the remaining members of the power set add up to a total of 1:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sum_{A \in \mathbb P(X)} m(A). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The mass ''m''(''A'') of a given member of the power set, ''A'', expresses the proportion of all relevant and available evidence that supports the claim that the actual state belongs to ''A'' but to no particular subset of ''A''. The value of ''m''(''A'') pertains ''only'' to the set ''A'' and makes no additional claims about any subsets of ''A'', each of which has, by definition, its own mass.

From the mass assignments, the upper and lower bounds of a probability interval can be defined. This interval contains the precise probability of a set of interest (in the classical sense), and is bounded by two non-additive continuous measures called '''belief''' (or '''support''') and '''plausibility''':

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(A) \le P(A) \le \operatorname{pl}(A).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The belief bel(''A'') for a set ''A'' is defined as the sum of all the masses of (not necessarily proper) subsets of the set of interest:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(A) = \sum_{B \mid B \subseteq A} m(B).&lt;/math&gt;

The plausibility pl(''A'') is the sum of all the masses of the sets ''B'' that intersect the set of interest ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pl}(A) = \sum_{B \mid B \cap A \ne \varnothing} m(B).&lt;/math&gt;

The two measures are related to each other as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pl}(A) = 1 - \operatorname{bel}(\overline{A}).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the above that you need know but one of the three (mass, belief, or plausibility) to deduce the other two, though you may need to know the values for many sets in order to calculate one of the other values for a particular set.

==Dempster's rule of combination==
The problem we now face is how to combine two independent sets of mass assignments. The original combination rule, known as Dempster's rule of combination, is a generalization of [[Bayes' rule]]. This rule strongly emphasises the agreement between multiple sources and ignores ''all'' the conflicting evidence through a normalization factor. Use of that rule has come under serious criticism when significant conflict in the information is encountered.

Specifically, the combination (called the '''joint mass''') is calculated from the two sets of masses &lt;math&gt;m_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;m_{1,2}(\varnothing) = 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m_{1,2}(A) = (m_1 \bigoplus m_2) (A) = \frac {1}{1 - K} \sum_{B \cap C = A \ne \varnothing} m_1(B) m_2(C) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;K = \sum_{B \cap C = \varnothing} m_1(B) m_2(C). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the amount of conflict between the two mass sets. The normalization factor, &lt;math&gt;1-K\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, has the effect of completely ignoring conflict and attributing ''any'' mass associated with conflict to the null set. Consequently, this operation yields counterintuitive results in the face of significant conflict in certain contexts.

==Discussion==

Dempster-Shafer theory is a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability; whereas the latter requires probabilities for each question of interest, belief functions base degrees of belief (or confidence, or trust) for one question on the probabilities for a related question. These degrees of belief may or may not have the mathematical properties of probabilities; how much they differ depends on how closely the two questions are related&lt;ref name=&quot;SH02&quot;&gt;Shafer, Glenn; [http://www.glennshafer.com/assets/downloads/articles/article48.pdf ''Dempster-Shafer theory''], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. Put another way, it is a way of representing [[epistemology|epistemic]] plausibilities but it can yield answers which contradict those arrived at using [[probability theory]].

Often used as a method of [[sensor fusion]], Dempster-Shafer theory is based on two ideas: obtaining degrees of belief for one question from subjective probabilities for a related question, and Dempster's rule&lt;ref name=&quot;DE68&quot;&gt;Dempster, Arthur P.; ''A generalization of Bayesian inference'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, Vol. 30, pp. 205-247, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; for combining such degrees of belief when they are based on independent items of evidence.  In essence, the degree of belief in a proposition depends primarily upon the number of answers (to the related questions) containing the proposition, and the subjective probability of each answer. Also contributing are the rules of combination that reflect general assumptions about the data.

In this formalism a '''degree of belief''' (also referred to as a '''mass''') is represented as a '''belief function''' rather than a [[Bayesianism|Bayesian]] [[probability distribution]]. Probability values are assigned to ''sets'' of possibilities rather than single events: their appeal rests on the fact they naturally encode evidence in favor of propositions.

Dempster-Shafer theory assigns its masses to all of the subsets of the entities that comprise a system. Suppose for example that a system has five members, that is to say five independent states, exactly one of which is actual. If the original set is called S, &lt;math&gt;|S|=5&lt;/math&gt;, then the set of all subsets &amp;mdash;the ''power set''&amp;mdash; is called 2&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;. Since you can express each possible subset as a binary vector (describing whether any particular member is present or not by writing a “1” or a “0” for that member's slot), it can be seen that there are 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; subsets possible (&lt;math&gt;2^{|S|}&lt;/math&gt; in general), ranging from the empty subset (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) to the &quot;everything&quot; subset (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). The empty subset represents a contradiction, which is not true in any state, and is thus assigned a mass of zero; the remaining masses are normalised so that their total is 1. The &quot;everything&quot; subset is often labelled &quot;unknown&quot; as it represents the state where all elements are present, in the sense that you cannot tell which is actual.

===Belief and plausibility===
Shafer's framework allows for belief about propositions to be represented as intervals, bounded by two values, ''belief'' (or ''support'') and ''plausibility'':

:''belief'' &amp;le; ''plausibility''.

''Belief'' in a hypothesis is constituted by the sum of the masses of all sets enclosed by it (i.e. the sum of the masses of all subsets of the hypothesis). It is the amount of belief that directly supports a given hypothesis at least in part, forming a lower bound. ''Plausibility'' is 1 minus the sum of the masses of all sets whose intersection with the hypothesis is empty (equivalently, it is the sum of the masses of all sets whose intersection with the hypothesis is ''not'' empty). It is an upper bound on the possibility that the hypothesis could possibly happen, i.e. it &quot;could possibly happen&quot; up to that value, because there is only so much evidence that contradicts that hypothesis.

For example, suppose we have a belief of 0.5 and a plausibility of 0.8 for a proposition, say &quot;the cat in the box is dead.&quot; This means that we have evidence that allows us to state strongly that the proposition is true with a confidence of 0.5. However, the evidence contrary to that hypothesis (i.e. &quot;the cat is alive&quot;) only has a confidence of 0.2. The remaining mass of 0.3 (the gap between the 0.5 supporting evidence on the one hand, and the 0.2 contrary evidence on the other) is &quot;indeterminate,&quot; meaning that the cat could either be dead or alive.
This interval represents the level of uncertainty based on the evidence in your system.

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;|
! Hypothesis !! Mass !! Belief!! Plausibility
|-
| Null (neither alive nor dead) || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| Alive || 0.2 || 0.2 || 0.5
|-
| Dead || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.8
|-
| Either (alive or dead) || 0.3 || 1.0 || 1.0
|}

The null hypothesis is set to zero by definition (it corresponds to &quot;no solution&quot;). The orthogonal hypotheses &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead&quot; have probabilities of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. This could correspond to &quot;Live/Dead Cat Detector&quot; signals, which have respective reliabilities of 0.2 and 0.5. Finally, the all-encompassing &quot;Either&quot; hypothesis (which simply acknowledges there is a cat in the box) picks up the slack so that the sum of the masses is 1. The support for the &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead&quot; hypotheses matches their corresponding masses because they have no subsets; support for &quot;Either&quot; consists of the sum of all three masses (Either, Alive, and Dead) because &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead&quot; are each subsets of &quot;Either&quot;. The &quot;Alive&quot; plausibility is m(Alive)+m(Either), since only &quot;Either&quot; intersects &quot;Alive&quot;. Likewise, the &quot;Dead&quot; plausibility is m(Dead)+m(Either). Finally, the &quot;Either&quot; plausibility sums m(Alive)+m(Dead)+m(Either). The universal hypothesis (&quot;Either&quot;) will always have 100% support and plausibility &amp;mdash;it acts as a checksum of sorts.

Here is a somewhat more elaborate example where the behaviour of support and plausibility begins to emerge. We're looking at a faraway object, which can only be coloured in one of three colours (red, white, and blue) through a variety of detector modes:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;|
! Hypothesis !! Mass !! Belief !! Plausibility
|-
| Null || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| Red || 0.35 || 0.35 || 0.56
|-
| White || 0.25 || 0.25 || 0.45
|-
| Blue || 0.15 || 0.15 || 0.34
|-
| Red or white || 0.06 || 0.66 || 0.85
|-
| Red or blue || 0.05 || 0.55 || 0.75
|-
| White or blue || 0.04 || 0.44 || 0.65
|-
| Any || 0.1 || 1.0 || 1.0
|}

Although these are rather bad examples, as events of that kind would not be modeled as disjoint sets in the probability space, rather would the event &quot;red or blue&quot; be considered as the union of the events &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;, thereby (see the axioms of probability theory) p(red or white)&gt;= p(white) = 0.25 and p(any)=1.
Only the three disjoint events &quot;Blue&quot; &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;White&quot; would need to add up to 1. In fact one could model a probability measure on the space linear proportional to &quot;plausibility&quot; (normalized so that p(red)+p(white)+p(blue) = 1, and with the exception that still all probabilities are &lt;=1)

===Combining probability sets===
Beliefs corresponding to independent pieces of information are combined using ''[[Dempster's rule of combination]]'' which is a generalisation of the special case of [[Bayes' theorem]] where events are independent (There is as yet no method of combining ''non-independent'' pieces of information). Note that the probability masses from propositions that contradict each other can also be used to obtain a measure of how much conflict there is in a system. This measure has been used as a criterion for clustering multiple pieces of seemingly conflicting evidence around competing hypotheses.

In addition, one of the computational advantages of the Dempster-Shafer framework is that priors and conditionals need not be specified, unlike Bayesian methods which often use a symmetry (minimax error) argument to assign prior probabilities to random variables (e.g. assigning 0.5 to binary values for which no information is available about which is more likely).  However, any information contained in the missing priors and conditionals is not used in the Dempster-Shafer framework unless it can be obtained indirectly - and arguably is then available for calculation using Bayes equations.

Dempster-Shafer theory allows one to specify a degree of ignorance in this situation instead of being forced to supply prior probabilities which add to unity. This sort of situation, and whether there is a real distinction between ''[[risk]]'' and ''[[ignorance]]'', has been extensively discussed by statisticians and economists. See, for example, the contrasting views of [[Ellsberg's paradox|Daniel Ellsberg]], [[Howard Raiffa]], [[Arrovian uncertainty|Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Knightian uncertainty|Frank Knight]].

===Critics===
[[Judea Pearl]] (1988a, chapter 9&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearl-88&quot;&gt;Pearl, J. (1988a), ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems,'' (Revised Second Printing) San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;; 1988b&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearl-1988b&quot;&gt;Pearl, J. (1988b) &quot;On Probability Intervals,&quot; ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,'' 2(3):211-216.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1990)&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearl-1990&quot;&gt;Pearl, J. (1990) Reasoning with Belief Functions: An Analysis of Compatibility. ''The International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,'' 4(5/6):363-389.&lt;/ref&gt;; has argued that it is 
misleading to interpret belief functions as representing either 
&quot;probabilities of an event,&quot; or &quot;the confidence one has in the 
probabilities assigned to various outcomes,&quot; or &quot;degrees of belief (or
confidence, or trust) in a proposition,&quot; or &quot;degree of
ignorance in a situation.&quot; Instead, belief
functions represent the probability that a given proposition
is ''provable'' from a set of other propositions, to which
probabilities are assigned. Confusing probabilities
of ''truth'' with probabilities of ''provability'' may lead to
counterintuitive results in reasoning tasks such as
(1) representing complete knowledge, (2) belief-updating
and (3) evidence pooling. He further demonstrated that, if
partial knowledge is encoded and updated by belief
function methods, the resulting beliefs
cannot serve as a basis for rational decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conjugating the Past Tense ==

For basic past tense conjugation, called الماضي in Arabic, the root of the verb, i.e. ذهب , is then followed by a suffix according to who or what it is referring to.
:When looking in an Arabic-English dictionary the verb will be listed under the root. This root is also the singular male form of the verb. It is important to note what form the root of the verb takes (this is for when one wants to become advanced). This can cause the root of the verb to change in accordance to the conjugation. TO GO is a basic verb that stays constant through out.  

&lt;u&gt;Past tense: to go (went) (ذهب)&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;font size+7&gt;
:ذهب he&lt;font size+3&gt; (هو)
:ذهبا  they (Dual form: 2 people)(هما)
:ذهبوا  they (3+ people)(هم)
:...................................................
:ذهبتْ  She (هي)
:ذهبتا  they (dual form: 2 people)(هما)
:ذهبن  they (3+ people)(هن)
:....................................................
ذهبت  You (Masculine Singular)(انتٓ)
:ذهبتما  You (Dual form: 2 people)(انتما)
:ذهبتم  You (Plural: 3+ people)(انتم)
:.....................................................
:ذهبتِ  You (Feminine Singular)(انتِ)
:ذهبتما  You (Dual form: 2 people)(انتما)
:ذهبتن  You (Plural: 3+ people)(انتن)
:...................................................
:ذهبتُ  I (انا)
ذهبنا  We(نحن)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Social Network Analysis (SNA), is a type of research method. Since the concept of a social network was first used to analyze the structure of fishing in Norway by Barnes (anthropologist) in 1954, many researchers have been using this method to do research in social structures. With the coming of the era of Internet focusing on interactive communication, this method begins to be used to analyze the more complex Interpersonal communications in Network Virtual Community.

==Fields in which SNA plays role==
#Psychology
#Anthropology
#Mathematics
#Communication
#Sociology
#Statistics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.analytictech.com/networks/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to do SNA==
About three steps:
#Record and Analyze original data;
#Express data in form of visualization with some tool's help;
#Analyze the above data more, distill the important problems and make conclusion.

==Tools for SNA==

==Case Study==
To prove the key role SNA plays,Professor Steve Borgatti from University of Kentucky has ever conducted a social network analysis of executives in the exploration and production division of a large petroleum organization with his colleagues' help.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R., Parker, A., Prusak, L. &amp; Borgatti, S.P. 2001. Knowing What We Know: Supporting Knowledge Creation and Sharing in Social Networks. Organizational Dynamics 30(2): 100-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

This research is interested in assessing the executives'ability as a group to create and share knowledge.The researchers mainly conducted a social network analysis of information flow among the top 20 executives within the Exploration and Production Division.This analysis reveals a striking contrast between the group’s formal and informal structure.

From this contrast,we can find three important points quickly emerge for this group in relation to sharing information and effectively leveraging their collective expertise.

The social network analysis identified mid-level managers who were critical in terms of information flow within the group. A particular surprise came from the very central role that Cole (a member) played in terms of both overall information flow within the group and being the only point of contact between members of the production division and the rest of the network. In this network, Cole is a critical source for all sorts of information.Through no fault of his own, the number of informational requests he received and the number of projects he was involved in had grown excessive,which not only caused him stress but also frequently slowed the group as a whole, because Cole had become a bottleneck. The social network analysis also revealed the extent to which the entire network was disproportionately reliant on Cole.If he were hired away, the efficiency of this group as a whole would be significantly impacted as people in the informal network reestablished important informational relationships. The social network diagram made it very clear that if Cole left, the company would lose both his valuable knowledge and the relationships he had established that in many ways were holding the network together. However, with the analysis' help, we can make a central intervention to reallocate many of the informational requests coming to Cole to other members in the group. Simply categorizing various informational requests that Cole received and then allocating ownership of these informational or decision domains to other executives served to both unburden Cole and make the overall network more responsive and robust.

Just as important, the social network analysis helped to identify highly peripheral people who essentially represented untapped expertise and thus underutilized resources for the group.In particular, it became apparent that many of the senior people had become too removed from the day-to-day operations of this group. The most senior person (Jones) was one of the most peripheral in the informal network. This is a common finding. As people move higher within an organization, their work begins to entail more administrative tasks that makes them both less accessible and less knowledgeable about the day to day work of their subordinates. However, in this case Jones had become too removed,and his lack of responsiveness frequently hold the entire network back when important decisions needed to be made. In this case, the social network diagram helped to make what could have been a potentially difficult conversation with this executive nonconfrontational, and results in more of his time being committed back to the group.

Finally,the social network analysis demonstrates the extent to which the production division has become separated from the overall network.Several months before this analysis,these people had been physically moved to a different floor in the building. Upon reviewing the network diagram,many of the executives realized that this physical separation had resulted in loss of a lot of the serendipitous meetings that occurred when they were co-located.

In this case,the executives decided that they needed to introduce more structured meetings to compensate for this recent loss of serendipitous communication(and they also adopted an instant messaging system to promote communication).

'''''Ajuga reptans''''' ('''Blue bugle''', '''Bugleherb''', '''Bugleweed''', '''Carpetweed''', '''Common bugle''', '''Carpenter's Herb''') is a herbaceous flowering plant native to Europe. This plant is often used as medicinal and ornamental plant. Bugle is also known as &quot;carpenter's herb&quot; due to its supposed ability to stem bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael. ''Traditional Folk Remedies'' (Century, 1987), p108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bugle has dark green leaves with purple highlights. It is a spreading ground cover that grows in a dense mat. The leaves grow 2-3 inches high but in the spring it sends up 4-6 inch tall flower stalks densely covered with numerous purple or blue flowers.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Cascading Style Sheets are most often linked to a web page so that they can be used in an entire site. Because of this they are an independent file and have their own construction.

A stylesheet should begin with a declaration.

 &lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt; @charset &quot;UTF-8&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;

After this declaration each CSS rule is independent and made of three parts: a selector, a property and an argument (i.e. a value):

'''Example:'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;

 @charset &quot;UTF-8&quot;;

 body {
 background-color : #000000;
 font-family : Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
 font-size : 100%;
 color : #ffffff;
 margin : 0;
 padding : 0;
 text-align : center;
 }

 h1 {
 font-family : Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
 font-size : 16px;
 color : #ffffff;
 font-style : normal;
 font-weight : normal;
 letter-spacing : 0.1em;
 }

 h2 {
 font-family : Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
 font-size : 12px;
 font-style : italic;
 font-weight : bold;
 color : #ffffff;
 text-decoration : underline;
 }

 p {
 font-family : Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
 font-size : 12px;
 font-style : normal;
 color : #ffffff;
 }

 etc
&lt;/source&gt;

What this breaks down to here is this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
@rule argument(s) {
	selector {
		property: argument(s);
		another-property: argument(s);
		property-the-third: argument(s);
		fourth-property: argument(s);
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Each selector can have as many properties as you would like. The properties and values are enclosed in { } tags.

==Rules==
CSS rules are preceded by the {{CSS:rule|@}} symbol and are often the start of blocks of code. Rules take at least 1 argument. Some examples of rules are {{CSS:rule|@charset}}, for defining the document character set; {{CSS:rule|@media}}, for setting properties for a type of media, often {{CSS:rule|all}}, {{CSS:rule|screen}} and {{CSS:rule|print}}; and {{CSS:rule|@font}} for setting up a [[../Fonts and Text#Web Font|web font]].

==Selectors==
Selectors are where most of the power in CSS lies. Selectors allow the author to specifically target an element to apply any given property to. Many different selector types can be combined for the precision application of styles.

===Elements===
Elements that are specified in CSS definitions (abbreviated E, F, etc.) correspond to the (X)HTML or XML elements in the document. In HTML or XHTML, common elements include &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;div&lt;code&gt;. In XML, the element names will vary with the type of document to be displayed.

===Class===
Class is the most basic of the selectors. The class operator is a &quot;&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and the syntax is &lt;code&gt;E.classname&lt;/code&gt;.

===ID===
ID specifies a unique element in the document and in (X)HTML it is also the fragment identifier. The ID operator is a &quot;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and the syntax is &lt;code&gt;E#IDname&lt;/code&gt;.

===Attribute===
Attribute selection is a newer feature in CSS that allows selection based on any attribute of the element. The syntax is &lt;code&gt;E[Attribute=&quot;value&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;. Attribute supports several different matching operators, including &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$=&lt;/code&gt;.

===Pseudo-class===
Pseudo-classes are special classes based on the state of an element and uses the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; operator. The syntax is &lt;code&gt;E:pseudo-class&lt;/code&gt;. Commonly used pseudo-classes include &lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:visited&lt;/code&gt;...

==Blocks==
Blocks of code are everywhere in CSS. A block is started with &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and closed with &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;. Blocks are used to group CSS statements into logical groups based on the author's needs. Blocks are most commonly used by Rules and to group properties to a selector.

==Properties==
Properties are the meat of CSS. The syntax is quite simple, &lt;code&gt;property: argument(s);&lt;/code&gt;. Properties are always after a selector and always inside a &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; block. A property must be ended with a &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; to close it.

''Allium schoenoprasum'' is also the only species of Allium native to both the New and the Old World.

Its species name derives from the Greek skhoinos (sedge) and prason (onion) and ''prason'' (onion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gräslök], from Den virtuella floran, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'' &lt;/ref&gt; Its English name, ''chive'', derives from the French word ''cive'', which was derived from ''cepa'', the Latin word for onion.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;[http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa022398.htm Chives], from homecooking.about.com, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

Culinary uses for chives involve shredding its leaves (straws) for use as condiment for fish, potatoes and soups. Because of this, it is a common household herb, frequent in gardens as well as in grocery stores. It also has insect-repelling properties which can be used in gardens to control pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaufman | first = Peter B | coauthors = Thomas J Carlson, Kaufman B Kaufman, Harry L Brielmann, Sara Warber, Leland J Cseke, James A Duke | year = 1999 | title = Natural Products from Plants | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | id = 084933134X | pages = 261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology ==

The chive is a bulb-forming herbaceous perennial plant, growing to 30-50 cm tall. The bulbs are slender conical, 2-3 cm long and 1 cm broad, and grow in dense clusters from the roots. The leaves are hollow tubular, up to 50 cm long, and 2-3 mm in diameter, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower from a leaf, it may appear stiffer than usual. The flowers are pale purple, star-shaped with six tepals, 1-2 cm wide, and produced in a dense inflorescence of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery bract. The seeds are produced in a small three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'', based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gräslök], from Den virtuella floran, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'', The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chives are the only species of Allium native to both the Old World and New. Sometimes, the plants found in North America are classified as A. schoenoprasum var. sibiricum, although this is disputed. There have been significant differences among specimens: one example was found in northern Maine growing solitary, instead of in clumps, also exhibiting dingy grey flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGary | first = Mary Jane | year = 2001 | title = Bulbs of North America: North American Rock Garden Society | publisher = Timber Press | location = Portland | id = 088192511X | pages = 28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeit repulsive to insects in general, due to its sulfur compounds, its flowers are attractive to bees, and it is sometimes kept to increase desired insect life.&lt;ref&gt;Baines. C. Making a Wildlife Garden. 0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
[[Image:Chives(GreenOnion) for Misoshiru PacificBeachHotel Waikiki.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Scallions are often mistaken for chives. In this photo, they serve as a garnish for Japanese soup misoshiru.]]

Chives are grown for their leaves, which are used for culinary purposes as condiment, which provide a somewhat milder flavour than its neighbouring Allium species.

Chives have a wide variety of culinary uses, such as in traditional dishes in France&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culinarycafe.com/Spices_Herbs/Chives.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden&lt;ref name=&quot;swe&quot;&gt;Försök til en Flora Oeconomica Sveciæ by A. J. Retzius (1806)&lt;/ref&gt;, among others. In his 1806 book ''Attempt at a Flora'' (''Försök til en flora''), Retzius describes how chives are used with pancakes, soups, fish and sandwiches.&lt;ref name=&quot;swe&quot;&gt;Försök til en Flora Oeconomica Sveciæ by A. J. Retzius (1806)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an ingredient of the gräddfil sauce served with the traditional herring dish served at Swedish midsummer celebrations. The flowers may also be used to garnish dishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/allschoenoprasum.htm Allium schoenoprasum], from Mountain valley growers, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chives are one of the &quot;fines herbes&quot; of French cuisine, which also include tarragon, chervil and/or parsley.

Chives can be found fresh at most markets year-round, making it a readily available spice herb; it can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to its taste, giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own garden.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;[http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa022398.htm Chives], from homecooking.about.com, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cultivation===
Retzius also describes how farmers would plant chives between the rocks making up the borders of their flowerbeds, to keep the plants free from pests (such as Japanese beetles&lt;ref name=&quot;japanese_beetles&quot;&gt;http://www.selfsufficientish.com/pests.htm&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;swe&quot;&gt;Försök til en Flora Oeconomica Sveciæ by A. J. Retzius (1806)&lt;/ref&gt;. While the growing plant repels unwanted insect life, the juice of the leaves can be used for the same purpose, as well as fighting fungal infections, mildew and scab.&lt;ref&gt;Holtom. J. and Hylton. W. Complete Guide to Herbs. Rodale Press 1979 ISBN 0-87857-262-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riotte. L. Companion Planting for Successful Gardening. Garden Way, Vermont, USA. 1978 ISBN 0-88266-064-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley. A. The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. 1992. MacMillan Press 1992 ISBN 0-333-47494-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Its flowers are attractive to bees, which are important for gardens with an abundance of plants in need of pollination.

===Medicinal uses===
The medicinal properties of chives are similar to those of garlic, but weaker; the faint effects in comparison with garlic are probably the main reason for its limited use as a medicinal herb. Containing numerous organisulplide compounds such as allyl sulfides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burdock | first = George A | year = 1996 | title = Encyclopedia of Food &amp; Color Additives | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | id = 0849394120 | pages = 87, 95-96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and alkyl sulfoxides, chives have a beneficial effect on the circulatory system, acting upon it by lowering the blood pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;phd&quot;&gt;[http://www.vibrantlife.com/vl/herb-44.html Talkin' Chive], by Winston J. Craig, Ph. D, from Vibrantlife.com, ''accessed on June 13, 2006'' &lt;/ref&gt; As chives are usually served in small amounts and never as the main dish, negative effects are rarely encountered, although digestive problems may occur following over-consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;phd&quot;&gt;[http://www.vibrantlife.com/vl/herb-44.html Talkin' Chive], by Winston J. Craig, Ph. D, from Vibrantlife.com, ''accessed on June 13, 2006'' &lt;/ref&gt;

Chives are also rich in vitamins A and C, and contain trace amounts of sulfur and iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;sal&quot;&gt;[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from &quot;Sally's place&quot;, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Chives are cultivated both for its culinary uses as well as its ornamental value; the violet flowers are often used in ornamental dry bouquets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1082/is_n3_v40/ai_18339595/pg_2 Flower &amp; Garden Magazine, June-July 1996, The lazy gardener's guide to potpourri]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chives thrive in well drained soil, rich in organic matter, with a pH of 6-7 and full sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobot&quot;&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chives can be grown from seed and mature in summer, or early the following spring. Typically, chives need to be germinated at a temperature of 15 °C to 20 °C and kept moist. They can also be planted under a cloche or germinated indoors in cooler climates, then planted out later. After at least four weeks, the young shoots should be ready to be planted out. Some prefer to replant the small clumps of chives available in plastic pots at some markets, thus avoiding unnecessary work with sowing seeds and cloche cultivation.

In the winter, chives die back to the underground bulbs, with the new leaves appearing in early spring. Chives starting to look old can be cut back to about 2-5 cm; this length is also preferred when harvesting, making the unattractive yellowing appear close to the ground, so that the plant can retain its aesthetic value.

==History and cultural importance==

Chives have been cultivated in Europe since the Middle Ages, although signs of its usage date back to 5000 years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;[http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa022398.htm Chives], from homecooking.about.com, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; used by the Chinese.

The Romans believed chives could relieve the pain from sunburn or a sore throat. They believed that eating chives would increase blood pressure and acted as a diuretic.

Romanian Gypsies have used chives in fortune telling.&lt;ref name=&quot;sal&quot;&gt;[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from &quot;Sally's place&quot;, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that bunches of dried chives hung around a house would ward off disease and evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;sal&quot;&gt;[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from &quot;Sally's place&quot;, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcoholic beverages are used in cooking to provide an additional layer of flavor and the alcohol is almost always completely evaporated leaving only the flavor of the drink itself. Wine is used the most often for cooking and is used extensively in Italian, Greek, French, and Spanish cuisine. Wine can give a subtle hint of flavor to a dish or completely alter its makeup. Inexpensive wines are used for cooking because the flavor difference between expensive and inexpensive wine is minimal in food.

'''''Arisaema triphyllum''''' ('''Jack-in-the-Pulpit''', '''Bog onion''', '''Brown dragon''', '''Indian turnip''', '''Wake robin''' or '''Wild turnip''') is a [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant]] growing from a [[corm]]. It is a highly variable species typically growing from 30 to 65 cm in height with three parted leaves and flowers contained in a spadix that is covered by a hood. It is native to eastern [[North America]], occurring in moist woodlands and thickets from [[Nova Scotia]] west to [[Minnesota]], and south to southern [[Florida]].


== Description ==


The [[leaf|leaves]] are trifoliate, with groups of three leaves growing together at the top of a long stem; each leaflet is 8-15 cm long and 3-7 cm broad. Plants are sometimes confused with [[Poison-ivy (plant)|Poison-ivy]] especially before the flowers appear or non-flowering plants. The [[inflorescence]]s are shaped irregularly and grow to a length of up to 8 cm long. They are greenish-yellow with purple or brownish stripes. The [[spathe]], known in this plant as &quot;the pulpit&quot; wraps around and covers over and contain a [[spadix]] (&quot;Jack&quot;), covered with tiny flowers of both sexes. The flowers are unisexual, in small plants most if not all the flowers are male, as plants age and grow larger the spadix produces more female flowers. This species flowers from April to June. The [[fruit]] are smooth, shiny green, 1 cm wide [[berry|berries]] clustered on the thickened spadix. The fruits ripen in late summer and fall, turning a bright red color before the plants go dormant.  Each berry produces 1 to 5 seeds typically, the seeds are white to light tan in color, rounded, often with flattened edges and a short sharp point at the top and a rounded bottom surface.
If the seeds are freed from the berry they will germinate the next spring, producing a plant with a single rounded leaf. Seedlings need three or more years of growth before they become large enough to flower.   

It is hardy to [[USDA plant hardiness zone]] 3.

===Chemical composition and medicinal uses===
[[Image:Jack in the pupit.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Jack-in-the-Pulpit in the [[Allegheny National Forest]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[U.S.A.]].]]The plant contains [[calcium oxalate]] crystals in all parts, and because of this consumption of the raw plant material results in a powerful burning sensation.  It can cause irritation of the mouth and digestive system, and on rare occasions the swelling of the mouth and throat may be severe enough to affect breathing. 

If the plant is properly dried or cooked it can be eaten as a root vegetable.  

A preparation of the root was reported to have been used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as a treatment for sore eyes.  Preparations were also made to treat [[rheumatism]], [[bronchitis]], and snakebites, as well as to induce sterility.

===History and folklore===
Some accounts of the [[Meskwaki]] Indians state that they would chop the herb's root into meat and leave it for their enemies to find.  The taste would not be detectable, but consuming the meat reportedly caused their enemies sufficient pain to be fatal.  They also used it to determine the fate of the sick by dropping a seed in a cup of water.  If the seed went around four times clockwise, the patient would recover, otherwise they would not.&lt;ref name=&quot;folklore&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2bnthewild.com/plants/H46.htm|title=Jack in the Pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warning===
According to the website DrKoop.com, the [[oxalic acid]] and [[asparagine]] in jack in the pulpit are [[poisonous]] if ingested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/002870.html |title= Jack-in-the-pulpit | accessdate = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care should also be taken to avoid confusion with [[poison ivy]], which has 3 leaflets somewhat similar in appearance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Curvature of Wavefronts ==
Light can be viewed as beams travelling between points. However, from most light sources, the light radiates outwards as a series of wavefronts. Light from a light source is bent - wavefronts of light have a property known as curvature.

[[Image:wavefronts_circle.svg|left|thumb|200px|Decreasing curvatures of wavefronts]]
As light travels further away from its source, its curvature decreases. Consider a sphere expanding gradually from a point, which represents a given wavefront of light. As the sphere expands, the curvature of its surface decreases when we look at any part of the surface with a constant area. It should be noted at this point that light from a source infinitely far away has 0 curvature - it is straight. This is useful, as ambient light (light from a source that is far away) can be assumed to have a curvature of 0, as the difference between this and its actual curvature is negligible.

The curvature of a wavefront is given as:

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{v}&lt;/math&gt;,

where v is the distance from the wavefront to the in-focus image depicted by the light. Curvature is measured in dioptres (D).


== Power of lenses ==
[[Image:Lens_power.svg|right|thumb|200px|Calculating the power of a lens]]
The function of a lens is to increase or decrease the curvature of a wavefront. Lenses have a 'power'. This is the curvature which the lens adds to the wavefront. Power is measured in dioptres, and is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;,

where f equals the focal length of the lens. This is the distance between the lens and the point where an image will be in focus, if the wavefronts entering the other side of the lens are parallel.

==The Lens Equation==
[[Image:Lens_equation.svg|left|thumb|200px|The lens equation, applied to a single pixel.]]
Overall, then, the formula relating the curvature of the wavefronts leaving a lens to the curvature of the wavefronts entering it is:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;

where v is the distance between the lens (its centre) and the in-focus image formed, u is the distance between the lens (its centre) and the object which the in-focus image is of, and f is the focal length of the lens. The power of the lens can be substituted in for the reciprocal of f, as they are the same thing.

===The Cartesian Convention===
If we were to place a diagram of the lens on a grid, labelled with cartesian co-ordinates, we would discover that measuring the distance of the object distance is negative, in comparison to the image distance. As a result, the value for u must always be negative. This is known as the Cartesian convention.

This means that, if light enters the lens with a positive curvature, it will leave with a negative curvature unless the lens is powerful enough to make the light leave with a positive curvature.

==Types of Lens==
[[Image:Lens_types.svg|right|thumb|200px|Types of lens]]
There are two types of lens:

'''Converging lenses''' add curvature to the wavefronts, causing them to converge more. These have a positive power, and have a curved surface which is wider in the middle than at the rim.

'''Diverging lenses''' remove curvature from the wavefronts, causing them to diverge more. These have a negative power, and have a curved surface with a dip in the middle.

==Magnification==
Magnification is a measure of how much an image has been enlarged by a lens. It is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{h_2}{h_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the heights of the image (or object) before and after being magnified, respectively. If an image is shrunk by a lens, the magnification is between 0 and 1.

Magnification can also be given as:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{v}{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where v and u are the image and object distances. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{h_2}{h_1} = \frac{v}{u}&lt;/math&gt;

An easy way to remember this in the middle of a exam is the formula:

&lt;math&gt;I = AM&lt;/math&gt;

where I is image size, A is actual size of the object M is the magnification factor.

==Questions==
1. A lens has a focal length of 10cm. What is its power, in dioptres?

2. Light reflected off a cactus 1.5m from a 20D lens forms an image. How many metres is it from the other side of the lens?

3. A lens in an RGB projector causes an image to focus on a large screen. What sort of lens is it? Is its power positive or negative?

4. What is the focal length of a 100D lens?

5. The film in a camera is 5mm from a lens when automatically focussed on someone's face, 10m from the camera. What is the power of the lens?

6. The light from a candle is enlarged by a factor of 0.5 by a lens, and produces an image of a candle, 0.05m high, on a wall. What is the height of the candle?

}}'''''Barbarea vulgaris''''', also called as '''Bittercress''', '''Herb Barbara''', '''Rocketcress''', '''Yellow Rocketcress''', '''Winter Rocket''', and ''' Wound Rocket''', is a biennial herb native to Europe.  

==Description==
During the autumn and winter, the plant has only a basal rosette of glossy leaves. As it bolts and flowers in the spring, it also has pinnately divided leaves arranges sparsely on the stem. The yellow flowers are borne in dense terminal clusters above the foliage in spring. It grows to about 8-32 inches. 

==Growing Conditions==
It is naturalised in many parts of North America as a weed. Winter Cress prefers moist, disturbed fields.

==Uses==
Greens are edible and have a similar taste to other mustard greens, but become sour when the plant bolts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A lens has a focal length of 10cm. What is its power, in dioptres?'''

Always use SI units, so 10cm = 0.1m.

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10\mbox{ D}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Light reflected off a cactus 1.5m from a 20D lens forms an image. How many metres is it from the other side of the lens?'''

u must be negative, as per. the Cartesian covention, so u = -1.5.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{-1.5} + 20 = \frac{58}{3}\mbox{ D}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{3}{58} = 0.0517\mbox{ m} = 51.7\mbox{ mm}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. A lens in an RGB projector causes an image to focus on a large screen. What sort of lens is it? Is its power positive or negative?'''

The wavefronts are being caused to spread out (diverge) more by the lens. Hence, it is a diverging lens. The wavefronts are losing curvature, so the lens has a negative power.

'''4. What is the focal length of a 100D lens?'''

&lt;math&gt;100 = \frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01\mbox{ m} = 10\mbox{ mm}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. The film in a camera is 5mm from a lens when automatically focussed on someone's face, 10m from the camera. What is the power of the lens?'''

5mm = 0.005m

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{0.005} = \frac{1}{-10}+ P&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;200 = P - 0.1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = 200.1\mbox{ D}&lt;/math&gt;

Since lenses are generally made to have nice round powers, this was probably a 200D lens. However, this is in real life, and this an hypothetical question with numbers picked out of thin air by me.

'''6. The light from a candle is enlarged by a factor of 0.5 by a lens, and produces an image of a candle, 0.05m high, on a wall. What is the height of the candle?'''

&lt;math&gt;0.5 = \frac{0.05}{h_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{h_1}{0.05}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h_1 = 100\mbox{ mm}&lt;/math&gt;

Several things are wrong about this page: 
1) When discussing Urdu, but not Hindi, you should use Arabic (nastaliq) script instead of Devanagari, which is used for Hindi only.
2) Split ergativity is not triggered by the subject having a suffix but rather by perfective aspect of the clause predicate.

== the text is in hindi not urdu!!!! ==

the text is in hindi not urdu!!!! look into this matter that though both the languages are similar in speaking, both are written in a completely different way. THIS MATTERS VERY MUCH IF YOU ARE WRITING A GRAMMAR BOOK!!!!</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

{{Reading level|Advanced}}
{{Book Search|prefix=Graph Theory}}

'''Graph Theory''' is the study of interactions between nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between the vertices), and it relates to topics such as combinatorics, scheduling, and connectivity making it useful to computer science and programming, engineering, networks and relationships, and many other fields of science. Graph theory can be thought of as the &quot;mathematician's connect-the-dots&quot; but it does not examine graphs as done in [[Calculus]] (curves and other related concepts).

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:20, 14 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At present, I'm a Mathematics major (BSc). I am very nearly graduated, and working towards a second degree in Computing Science.

As such, I tend towards the discrete and algebra-related mathematics.

So far, my wikibook projects are:
*'''[[Graph Theory]]''': at present, I'm working on developing the structure and main ideas.

I will be adding more as I make more significant contributions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haskell newb, here. Here were my answers to the Partial Application exercises.
 
 -- Exercise 7.1 Convert the following functions into point-free style, if possible. 
 
 func1 x l = map (\y -&gt; y*x) l
 func2 f g l = filter f (map g l)
 func3 f l = l ++ map f l
 func4 l = map (\y -&gt; y+2)
               (filter (\z -&gt; z `elem` [1..10])
                       (5:l))
 func5 f l = foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 l

 -- Answers:
 
 func12 x = map (*x)                                  -- definitely better
 func22 f g = filter f . map g                        -- debatably better..
 func32 l = (l++) . (`map` l)                         -- not really better?
 func42 = map (+ 2) . filter (`elem` [1..10]) . (5:)  -- shorter, and probably better
 func52 f = foldr uncurry f 0                         -- better


The function 

 func3 f l = l ++ map f l

can also be written as...

 func32 l = (l++) . (`map` l)

It's ugly, and longer, but it does have free-point style, does it not?

-- [[User:Chrisdone|Chris]] ([[User talk:Chrisdone|talk]]) 23:49, 14 December 2007 (UTC)


The function

 func5 f l = foldr (\x y -&gt; f (y,x)) 0 l

also can be written as...

 func52 = flip foldr 0 . curry

points for being completely point-free.

&lt;big&gt;'''Libido'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Women: Testosterone Replacement==
*'''NCCTG N02C3''' (2004-2005)
**Randomized, cross-over. 150 postmenopausal women, history of cancer but NED, reported decrease in sexual desire, and a sexual partner. None on hormone replacement. Arm 1) 2% testosterone in Vanicream for 10 mg/day x4 weeks vs. Arm 2) placebo Vanicream, then crossed over for additional 4 weeks. Primary endpoint sexual desire/libido assessed at 4 and 8 weeks
**'''2007''' PMID 17470735 -- &quot;Randomized controlled trial to evaluate transdermal testosterone in female cancer survivors with decreased libido; North Central Cancer Treatment Group protocol N02C3.&quot; (Barton DL, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 May 2;99(9):672-9.
***Outcome: mean testosterone significantly increased, but average libido change no different
***Conclusion: No benefit, possibly because women on study were estrogen depleted</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Pancreatic Endocrine Neoplasms (PEN)'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Uncommon tumors, incidence ~4/1,000,000
*Can be either functional or nonfunctional; common functional tumors include insulinoma and gastrinoma (giving rise to Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES))
*[http://www.neuroendocrine.net European Neuroendocrine Society] suggests TNM staging and grade are predictive of tumor behavior
*Treatment for localized PENs is surgical resection or enucleation
*Lymph node status important prognostic factor, so LND should be considered, especially since tumor size does not correlate with LN status
*Low grade tumors have excellent long-term outcomes, 5-year OS &gt;90%
*Intermediate grade tumors with LN+ or DM+ have 5-year OS ~58%</text>

***Gold fiducial marker evaluation. Small (0.35 mm), medium (0.75 mm), and large (1.15mm) marker with length of 10 mm implanted in phantom. Monte Carlo simulation
***Outcome: Perturbation of dose large marker 31%, medium marker 23%, so not well suited. Small marker too fragile for transrectal implantation

***Compared various types of implantable markers for visibility on kV imagins, and reviewed dosimetry models by Monte Carlo
***Outcome: gold and stainless steel markers visible, titanium not so much. Stainless steel and titanium didn't perturb beam much, gold large shadow
***Conclusion: 0.9 mm diameter, 3.1 mm long stainless steel marker has good visibility on kV and &lt;8% beam pertuberance

**Treatment planning. Passive vs IMPT vs 7-F IMRT step-and-shoot vs 7-F IMRT sliding window. 78 CGE
**Outcome: Homogeneity and rectal sparing best for IMPT
**Conclusion: PT is suitable treatment option

***Retrospective. 10 patients with early-stage PCA. Treated with 3D-CPT (two parallel-opposed lateral fields) and IMRT (7 coplanar fields). Dose 79.2 Gy/CGE
***Outcome: 98% of PTV received prescription dose. IMRT better dose conformity, 3D-CPT better dose homogeneity. 
***Normal organs: Bladder dosimetry: V30 better with protons, V70 better with IMRT. Rectal dosimetry: V70 comparable
***Conclusion: Above 60 Gy, IMRT better than protons for bladder, rectum comparable. Doses &lt;50% significantly better with protons

***23 patient plans. Comparison of TCP and NTCP for 3D-CRT (n=7), 6 MV or 15 MV IMRT (n=8), and spot-scanned proton RT (n=8). Doses modeled 70 - 100 Gy, baseline 70 Gy 3D-CRT
***Outcome: Secondary cancer risk compared with 70 Gy 3D-CRT: 6 MV IMRT +18%, 15 MV IMRT +25%, spot-scanned protons -41%
***Conclusion: Spot-scanned protons can halve risk of secondary cancers with dose escalation

**Comparison. 5 patients. 3D proton plan (2 lateral beams) vs. 3D conformal photons (4 field box) vs. IMRT (seven beams). PTV = CTV + 5 mm. Total dose 70 Gy.
**Outcome: PTV: similar dose distribution. Conformity indices photon 1.4-1.5, proton 1.1-1.4. OAR received more dose (&gt;=1.7x) with photons, mainly at low and medium dose levels
**Conclusion: PTV comparable, for OAR 2 field protons &gt; IMRT &gt; 3D-CRT

      <text xml:space="preserve">The definite article of Arabic is &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;الـ &lt;/font&gt; (Alif-Laam), known as&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لام التارف &lt;/font&gt; (Laam Al-tarif).

The first letter of the laam al-tarif is a Hamzat-Wasl (همزة وصل), an alif with a Saad (ص) written above it &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;(ٱ)&lt;/font&gt;.  We do not write the ص on the alif in writing (we simply know it is there, as no words in Arabic begin with Alif (only Alif with Hamza &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;(أ)&lt;/font&gt;).  A Hamzat-Wasl takes the sound of a vowel immediately before it, if there is one.  If not, it makes the same sounds a fatha at the beginning of the word &lt;big&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;(أَ)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

An example of the hamzat-wasl taking the sound of a preceding vowel is &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;الأُممُ الـمُتَّحِدة&lt;/font&gt;) (Al-Umamu ul-Muttahida), &quot;The United Nations.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==To be an active participant==
To understand the concept of PLE is not difficult, but how to put it into practice for everyone is not as easy as you think. As the name suggests, PLE is personal and differs individually, but that doesn't mean that the process is non-cooperative and conducted just by one person alone. On the contrary, the process is social and cooperative. And to be an active participant is the key of the process for everyone.

Here is an example to demonstrate why being an active participant is the key of the process of PLE.

During the course delivered by Miss Zhuang from Beijing Normal University in the fall semester in 2007, she initiated an activity to help the students to master the use of some tools of WEB2.O. [http://www.haokanbu.com/event/46/ The activity] is conducted on the platform called [http://www.haokanbu.com Haokanbu] in China. What makes Haokanbu differ from Blog or Flickr or other social software is that Haokanbu provides the user with the function to create stories using different images together with text and audio. It is easy and interesting to create your story here. The process of creating a story is also the process of using images together with text or audio to organize and express one's thoughts.

The content of the story is about how to use these tools or what you get from using tools. At first, Miss Zhuang took the lead to issue several stories about the WEB2.O tools operating methods. As we know, to build PLE, you should grasp the method of using social network software first. Under the lead of the teacher,the learners choose different software to use and create stories according to their own interests. Thereupon, the activity started, everybody practiced and recorded the practice process and harvested or demonstrated how to use the software with the story. Very quickly,the students' first batch of story creations were published, and they were extremely excited because they made them by their own. They also watched others' stories actively, and discussed them, asked questions or gave comments on others. Others in the network community were also attracted by these stories, they joined in the discussion and the activity. During the discussion people established study partnership and friendship. Thus, there had formed a study mass organization, when someone has a question he asked on the platform. In a short time, people with different knowledge backgrounds would give many different replies. Of course, he can also directly seek the experts for help in this activity.

Soon, students liked this way of study, and recorded the difficulties from the practice with stories actively. When they wanted to study social network software, they will come here look for the related stories - the more stories there are, the more the learners could learn. The teacher also kept on guiding and pushing the activity. After a period of time, when students reconsider their work, they found that they not only grasped the use of the tools, but also learned the independent study method in the network.

Now, let us look at the activity again. The teacher here is a guide and sponsor, she continued to promote activity. For the learners, at the beginning, they joined the activity in order to complete the task of study that the teacher laid out, but along with the activities carried out, students learned to use the network software to study by themselves and to work together. They used the social network tools to share, to communicate, to create altogether. And stories here play an important role as bridges, they connect different people together. The more stories are shared, the more people joined in the activity and the learners could learn more knowledge. This is a process which PLE gradually establishs. From this activity, we found that there are several key facts in building PLE:

*Firstly, practice actively. PLE is built with a lot of practice. In practice you will be able to learn its essence ,the more you practice ,the more you learn.
*Secondly, constructing PLE is not one person's game, it needs a lot of people to complete together. So it is a good way for you to act as an organizer in a course or activity you are interested in on the Internet and to invite other people to participate together.
*Thirdly, you should have a personal space just like blog or haokanbu on the internet to publish your idea or share resource, so you will make other people know you and attract them to the community or work together with you. In this way you will make more friends.

==Learner's Narrative==
The following is the case of a learner who is establishing her own PLE.

I have learned the technology of web 2.0 for 2 months since the beginning of the fall semester 2007. During this short time, I have learned how to operate some tools of web2.0 and the spirit of practice. PLE is not a concept but a process, a movement of learning, there is no end of PLE. So we do not need to ask whether we have built PLE, the only thing we should do is practice, communicate on and on. Whether you have known or not, it doesn’t matter. You are creating PLE if you've started to practice. The only difference between us is the depth, but we can all make progress.

Now, I will talk about my experience of creating PLE, of course it is only the beginning. However, I believe I will become a PLE learner.

Firstly, I considered what I should learn. The key of learning is to creating PLE, but we should know what is the aim of our learning and what is necessary for creating PLE. First as we do not have enough time, I chose to learn del.cio.us .rss reader, blog after thinking.

Secondly, I was looking for a platform to ask and share my ideas I think people are the best resources. So we must look for people to help us and share each other, then all of us will make big progress. So I joined the google group which was built by Doctor Xiulizhuang from Beijing Normal University. I know a lot of the tools there, besides,I mastered it with the help of the members, and we can share our feelings and thoughts, very interestingly. I am glad to have such a kind of group.

Thirdly, I use the tools I have learned. I create accounts on del.iico.us,google reader; sina blog and haokanbu. If I did not use them, I will forget them and not know the value of them. After several times using them, now I found I nearly cannot leave them. It is very convenient. I would made greater progress if I lived a regular life.

Now, I have not found the person I am looking for, but I am confident I will found them and formed a group only if I keep on. Of course, there default exist along with them, so we should consider the following tips:

1. Make a plan,do not do unnecessary things. The boundaries of web will make you faint if you do not know what to do.

2. Keep on thinking. If you do not do it, you don’t change your learning style at all.

3. Don’t be afraid you are slow leaner, and do not make excuses for yourself. If you look for excuses you can always find them.

4. Don’t be shy, just practice, you will find you can learn more some day, or you will made a slow experience and progress.

The '''Kash Vault''' is similar to the Monkey Vault and Dash Vault.
==Steps==
A Kash Vault is started the same as a Monkey Vault, with the traceur putting their hands on the wall or object in front of them, springing up and bringing their legs up to their chest in a tuck position.
The Traceur then lets go of the object, kicks their legs out like in the dash vault and places their hands back on the object in order to push off and secure a safe landing although it isn't necessary to let go, the traceur may wish to keep their hands on the object at all times.

==Note==
It is often a good idea to attempt a Kash Vault in a similar area to a Double Kong Vault, with a big area to clear or with 2 objects close to each other than can be cleared in 1 vault.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page provides proofs for identities involving the totient function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(k)&lt;/math&gt; and the Möbius function &lt;math&gt;\mu(k)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Sum of integers relatively prime to and less than or equal to ''n''==

The proof of the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{1\le k\le n \atop (k,n)=1} k = \frac{1}{2} \, \varphi(n) \, n
\quad \mbox{ where } \quad
n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;

uses the fact that

:&lt;math&gt; (k, n) = d \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad (n-k, n) = d &lt;/math&gt;

because
if &lt;math&gt;d|n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d|k&lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt;d|n-k&lt;/math&gt; and
if &lt;math&gt;d|n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d|(n-k)&lt;/math&gt; then
&lt;math&gt;d|n-(n-k) = k.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; we may group the ''k'' that are relatively prime to ''n'' into pairs
:&lt;math&gt;(k, n-k) \quad \mbox{ where } \quad k&lt;n-k.&lt;/math&gt;. 

The case &lt;math&gt;k=n/2&lt;/math&gt; does not occur because &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; is not an integer when ''n'' is odd, and when ''n'' is even, we have &lt;math&gt;(n/2, n)=n/2&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; because we assumed that &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2.&lt;/math&gt; There are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
such pairs, and the constituents of each pair sum to
:&lt;math&gt;k \; + \; n-k \; = n,&lt;/math&gt;
hence
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{(k, n)=1} k = \frac{1}{2} \, \varphi(n) \, n
\quad \mbox{ where } \quad
n \ge 3.&lt;/math&gt;
The case &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; is verified by direct substitution and may be included in the formula.

==Proofs of totient identities involving the floor function==

The proof of the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\varphi(k)}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\mu(k)}{k}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

is by [[Mathematical_induction|mathematical induction]] on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. 
The base case is &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and we see that the claim holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(1)/1 = 1 = \frac{\mu(1)}{1} \left\lfloor 1\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

For the induction step we need to prove that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(n+1)}{n+1} = 

\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\mu(k)}{k}
\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{k}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor\right)
+ \frac{\mu(n+1)}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The key observation is that

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{k}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor
\; = \; \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }k|(n+1) \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise, }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the sum is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k|n+1,\; k&lt;n+1} \frac{\mu(k)}{k} + \frac{\mu(n+1)}{n+1}
= \sum_{k|n+1} \frac{\mu(k)}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k|n+1} \frac{\mu(k)}{k} = \frac{\varphi(n+1)}{n+1}
&lt;/math&gt;

is a basic totient identity. To see that it holds, let 
&lt;math&gt;p_1^{v_1} p_2^{v_2} \ldots p_q^{v_q}&lt;/math&gt;
be the prime factorization of n+1. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(n+1)}{n+1} = \prod_{l=1}^q \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p_l} \right)
= \sum_{k|n+1} \frac{\mu(k)}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

by definition of &lt;math&gt;\mu(k).&lt;/math&gt; This concludes the proof.

An alternate proof proceeds by substituting
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi(k)}{k} = \sum_{d|k}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
directly into the left side of the identity, giving
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{d|k}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we ask how often the term 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
occurs in the double sum. 
The answer is that it occurs for every multiple &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, but there are precisely &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{d}\right\rfloor\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
such multiples, which means that the sum is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d=1}^n\frac{\mu(d)}{d}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{d}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

as claimed.

----

The trick where zero values of 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{k}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
are filtered out may also be used to prove the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n\varphi(k) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1+ \sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k)\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The base case is &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and we have

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = 1 = 
\frac{1}{2} \left(1+ \mu(1) \left\lfloor\frac{1}{1}\right\rfloor^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and it holds. The induction step requires us to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n+1)  = \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_{k=1}^n 
\mu(k)
\left(
\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{k}\right\rfloor^2 - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor^2
\right)
\; + \; \frac{1}{2} \; \mu(n+1) \; \left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{n+1}\right\rfloor^2
.&lt;/math&gt;

Next observe that

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{k}\right\rfloor^2 - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor^2
\; = \; \begin{cases} 2\frac{n+1}{k} - 1, &amp; \mbox{if }k|(n+1) \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the following for the sum
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2} 
\sum_{k|n+1, \; k&lt;n+1} \mu(k) 
\left( 2\frac{n+1}{k} - 1 \right) \; + \; \frac{1}{2} \; \mu(n+1) =
\frac{1}{2} 
\sum_{k|n+1} \mu(k) \left( 2 \; \frac{n+1}{k} - 1 \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Treating the two inner terms separately, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
(n+1) \sum_{k|n+1} \frac{\mu(k)}{k} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k|n+1} \mu(k).
&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these two is precisely &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; as we saw earlier, and the second is zero, by a basic property of the [[Möbius function]] (using the same factorization of &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; as above, we have &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \sum_{k|n+1} \mu(k) = \prod_{l=1}^q (1-1) = 0 \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.) This concludes the proof.

This result may also be proved by [[Inclusion-exclusion|inclusion-exclusion]]. Rewrite the identity as
:&lt;math&gt;-1 + 2\sum_{k=1}^n\varphi(k) = 
\sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k)\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we see that the left side counts the number of lattice points (''a'', ''b'') in [1,''n'']&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;[1,''n''] where ''a'' and ''b'' are relatively prime to each other. Using the sets &lt;math&gt;A_p&lt;/math&gt; where ''p'' is a prime less than or equal to ''n'' to denote the set of points where both coordinates are divisible by ''p'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \bigcup_p A_p \right| =
     \sum_p \left| A_p \right| \;
- \; \sum_{p&lt;q} \left| A_p \cap A_q \right| \;
+ \; \sum_{p&lt;q&lt;r} \left| A_p \cap A_q \cap A_r \right| \;
- \; \cdots \;
\pm \; \left| A_p \cap \; \cdots \; \cap A_s \right|.
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula counts the number of pairs where ''a'' and ''b'' are not relatively prime to each other.
The cardinalities are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left| A_p \right| = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor^2, \;
\left| A_p \cap A_q \right| = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{pq} \right\rfloor^2, \;
\left| A_p \cap A_q \cap A_r \right| = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{pqr} \right\rfloor^2, \; \ldots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the signs are &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}-\mu(pqr\cdots)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;, hence the number of points with relatively prime coordinates is

&lt;math&gt;\mu(1)\, n^2
\; + \; \sum_p \mu(p) \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor^2
\; + \; \sum_{p&lt;q} \mu(p q) \left\lfloor \frac{n}{pq} \right\rfloor^2
\; + \; \sum_{p&lt;q&lt;r} \mu(p q r) \left\lfloor \frac{n}{pqr} \right\rfloor^2
\; + \; \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

but this is precisely &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k) \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor^2&lt;/math&gt; and we have the claim.

==Average order of the totient==

We will use the last formula of the preceding section to prove the following result:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \varphi(k)= 
\frac{3}{\pi^2} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log n }{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;x-1 &lt; \lfloor x \rfloor \le x&lt;/math&gt; we have the upper bound
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2 n^2} 
\left(1+ \sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k)\frac{n^2}{k^2}\right) =
\frac{1}{2 n^2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the lower bound
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2 n^2} 
\left(1+ \sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k)\left(\frac{n^2}{k^2} - 2\frac{n}{k} + 1\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2 n^2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}
- \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k}
+ \frac{1}{2 n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k)
&lt;/math&gt;

Working with the last two terms and using the asymptotic expansion of the nth 
[[Harmonic_number|harmonic number]] we have
:&lt;math&gt;- \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k} &gt;
- \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = - \frac{1}{n} H_n
&gt; -\frac{1}{n} (\log n +1)
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2 n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \mu(k) &gt; - \frac{1}{2 n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we check the order of the terms in the upper and lower bound. The term
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(1)&lt;/math&gt; by comparison with &lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann_zeta|Riemann zeta]] function. 
The next largest term is the logarithmic term from the lower bound. 

So far we have shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \varphi(k)= 
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}
 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log n }{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

It remains to evaluate 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
asymptotically, which we have seen converges. 
The Euler product for the [[Riemann_zeta|Riemann zeta]] function is
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \prod_p \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^s} \right)^{-1}
\mbox{ for } \Re(s)&gt;1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now it follows immediately from the definition of the [[Möbius function|Möbius function]] that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \prod_p \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^s} \right)
= \sum_{n \ge 1} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2} = 
\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\zeta(2)} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where the integral
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \int_{n+1}^\infty \frac{1}{t^2} dt\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
was used to estimate
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \sum_{k&gt;n} \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}\end{matrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
But 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\zeta(2)} = \frac{3}{\pi^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and we have established the claim.

===Average order of &amp;phi;(''n'')/''n''===

The material of the preceding section, together with the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\varphi(k)}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\mu(k)}{k}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

also yields a proof that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\varphi(k)}{k} = 
\frac{6}{\pi^2} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log n }{n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Reasoning as before, we have the upper bound
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\mu(k)}{k}\frac{n}{k} = 
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and the lower bound
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\mu(k)}{k} +
\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{\mu(k)}{k^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now apply the estimates from the preceding section to obtain the result.

==Inequalities==

We first show that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim \inf \frac{\varphi (n)}{n}=0 \mbox{ and } \lim \sup \frac{\varphi (n)}{n}=1. &lt;/math&gt;

The latter holds because when ''n'' is a power of a prime ''p'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi (n)}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{p},&lt;/math&gt;

which gets arbitrarily close to 1 for ''p'' large enough (and we can take ''p'' as large as we please since [[Prime_number#There_are_infinitely_many_prime_numbers|there are infinitely many primes]]).

To see the former, let ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the product of the first ''k'' primes, 
call them &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2, ..., p_k&lt;/math&gt;. Let

:&lt;math&gt;r_k = \frac{\varphi (n_k)}{n_k} = \prod_{i=1}^k \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_k} = \prod_{i=1}^k \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right)^{-1} &gt;
\sum_{m=1}^{p_k} \frac{1}{m} = H_{p_k},&lt;/math&gt;

a [[harmonic number]]. Hence, by the well-known bound &lt;math&gt;H_n &gt; \log n&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_k} &gt; \log p_k.&lt;/math&gt; 

Since the [[logarithm]] is unbounded, taking ''k'' arbitrarily large ensures that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; achieves values arbitrarily close to zero.

We use the same factorization of ''n'' as in the first section to prove that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {6 n^2} {\pi^2} &lt; \varphi(n) \sigma(n) &lt; n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi(n) \sigma(n) = 
n 
\prod_{l=1}^q \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_l}\right) 
\prod_{l=1}^q \frac{p_l^{v_l+1}-1}{p_l-1} =
n
\prod_{l=1}^q \frac{p_l-1}{p_l} \; \frac{p_l^{v_l+1}-1}{p_l-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which is

:&lt;math&gt;
n \prod_{l=1}^q \left(p_l^{v_l}-\frac{1}{p_l}\right) =
n^2 \prod_{l=1}^q \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_l^{v_l+1}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound follows immediately since

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{l=1}^q \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_l^{v_l+1}}\right) &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

We come arbitrarily close to this bound when ''n'' is prime. 
For the lower bound, note that

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{l=1}^q \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_l^{v_l+1}}\right) \ge
\prod_{l=1}^q \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_l^2}\right) &gt;
\prod_p \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the product is over all primes. We have already seen this product, as in

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_p \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^s}\right) =
\sum_{n\ge 1} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} = \frac{1}{\zeta(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_p \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^2}\right) = \frac{1}{\zeta(2)}
= \frac{6}{\pi^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and we have the claim. The values of ''n'' that come closest to this bound are products of the first ''k'' primes.

'''''Corydalis lutea''''' ('''Yellow Corydalis''') is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southern foothills of the south-western and central Alps of Italy and Switzerland, but widely introduced elsewhere&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?GENUS_XREF=Pseudofumaria&amp;SPECIES_XREF=lutea |title=''Psuedofumaria lutea'' (L.) Borkh. |author=Flora Europaea |publisher=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh |accessdate=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
Yellow Corydalis grows to 30–38&amp;nbsp;cm (12–15&amp;nbsp;in) tall and its grey-green foliage is attractive from spring until autumn. The 2&amp;nbsp;cm (¾&amp;nbsp;in) flowers are borne above the leaves from spring until mid-summer and sometimes later. The species often grows wild in cracks in old walls where drainage is excellent.

==Growing Conditions==
Yellow Corydalis grows in USDA Hardiness Zones 5 to 10 (average annual minimum temperature –29°C or above); it does best in light shade, but will tolerate both full sun and deep shade. Excellent drainage is vital and the soil should be liberally supplemented with peat moss or leaf mould.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I sometimes wonder if Wikibooks is as useful as it seems.
:I mean, we provide the textbooks for Wikiversity and even real-world colleges, we give out books full of useful information, and even Jimbo Wales says we're one of the better Wikis to belong to.
:But we don't hand out ourselves as Wikipedia does (they specialize in making any article you ask, and they edit it to full glory). Wikibooks is smaller and less prominent, too, so people don't use what I see as our usefulness-accurate, well-written textbooks that can enrich those from 2 to 100.
:But maybe this is better for us. There isn't a rush of vandals, articles, spammers, and admins that Wikipedia seems to hold a lot of. I wonder if that's why colleges will use our textbooks but shun Wikipedia articles. Maybe, even though we're smaller, we can provide better services. I can personally testify to this. After an 800-edit career on Wikipedia which culminated with watchlist spam, I realize Wikibooks' service is much better than anything Wikipedia can provide. And I realize I want to be a part of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Reflection==

[[Image:Reflection_refraction_angles.svg|right|thumb|200px|Angles of reflection and incidence]]
Reflection is when light 'bounces' off a material which is different to the one in which it is travelling. You may remember from GCSE (or equivalent) level that we can calculate the direction the light will take if we consider a line known as the 'normal'. The normal is perpendicular to the boundary between the two materials, at the point at which the light is reflected. The angle between the normal and the ray of light is known as the angle of reflection (r). The ray of light will be reflected back at the same angle as it arrived at the normal, on the other side of the normal.

==Refraction==

Refraction is when light changes velocity when it travels across the boundary between two materials. This causes it to change direction. The angle between the normal and the refracted ray of light is known as the angle of refraction (r).

===The Refractive Index===

The refractive index is a measure of how much light will be refracted on the boundary between a material and a 'reference material'. This reference material is usually either air or a vacuum. It is given by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{c_0}{c_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of light in a vacuum (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s) and c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of light in the material.

===Snell's Law===

We can relate the refractive index to the angles of incidence (i) and refraction (r) using the following formula, known as Snell's Law:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{\sin{i}}{\sin{r}} = \frac{c_0}{c_1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Total Internal Reflection==

Normally, when light passes through a non-opaque material, it is both reflected and refracted. However, sometimes, rays of light are totally internally reflected; in other words, they are not refracted, so no light goes outside the material. This is useful in optic fibres, which allow a signal to be transmitted long distances at the speed of light because the light is totally internally reflected.

===Critical Angle===

The critical angle is the minimum angle of incidence, for a given material, at which rays of light are totally internally reflected. At the critical angle (C), the angle of refraction is 90°, as any smaller angle of incidence will result in refraction. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{\sin{90}}{\sin{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since sin 90° = 1:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{1}{\sin{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sin{r} = \frac{1}{n} = \sin{C}&lt;/math&gt;

In word form, in a material with refractive index n, light will be totally internally reflected at angles greater than the inverse sine of the reciprocal of the refractive index.

==Questions==

1. A ray of light is reflected from a mirror. Its angle to the normal when it reaches the mirror is 70°. What is its angle of reflection?

2. The speed of light in diamond is 1.24 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. What is its refractive index?

3. The refractive index of ice is 1.31. What is the speed of light in ice?

4. A ray of light passes the boundary between air and a transparent material. The angle of refraction is 20°, and the angle of incidence is 10°. What is the speed of light in this material? Why is it impossible for this material to exist?

5. What is the critical angle of a beam of light leaving a transparent material with a refractive index of 2?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A ray of light is reflected from a mirror. Its angle to the normal when it reaches the mirror is 70°. What is its angle of reflection?'''

The angles of reflection on both sides of the normal are always equal, so the angle of reflection is 70°.

'''2. The speed of light in diamond is 1.24 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. What is its refractive index?'''

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{v_1}{1.24 \times 10^8}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the speed of light in the reference medium is 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.24 \times 10^8} = \frac{3}{1.24} \approx 2.42&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. The refractive index of ice is 1.31. What is the speed of light in ice?'''

&lt;math&gt;1.31 = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_2 = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.31} \approx 2.29 \times 10^8 \mbox{ ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. A ray of light passes the boundary between air and a transparent material. The angle of refraction is 20°, and the angle of incidence is 10°. What is the speed of light in this material? Why is it impossible for this material to exist?'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3 \times 10^8}{v_2} = \frac{\sin{10}}{\sin{20}} \approx 0.508 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_2 \approx \frac{3 \times 10^8}{0.508} \approx 5.91 \times 10^8 &lt;/math&gt;

This is greater than the speed of light in a vacuum (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;), and so is impossible.

'''5. What is the critical angle of a beam of light leaving a transparent material with a refractive index of 2?'''

&lt;math&gt;\sin{C} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

C = 30° (using the sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; button on a scientific calculator - this means 'inverse sine', often denoted arcsine or asin for short.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, welcome to the [[.NET Development Foundation]] feedback page.

The quality of this study guide totally depends on the feedback '''on the exam''' we receive from people who have passed the exam. If you did, '''please take a few minutes''' to give us any feedback that you might have. You do not need to register on WikiBooks to add a comment.

There are two ways to do so:

*Go to the the document and edit it as you see fit! This is an open content wiki so anyone is invited to contribute.
*If you have less time or are not sure where to insert your content, then '''add a comment here''' and we will make sure that it is reflected in the book.

To add a comment, click on the &quot;+&quot; sign tab at the top of the page, enter a subject, and go to it!

==Minimal rules==

There are very few rules to follow in your comments:

*Please use correct language.

*Do not put anything that would be subject to copyright. In particular, we are not interested in the actual exam questions, but rather on the knowledge required to answer those questions. You may put &quot;example questions&quot; to guide the reader, but no &quot;braindumps&quot; please.

== Comments on the web ==

Some comments that we got while discussing the exam on different forums:

*[http://www.developpez.net/forums/showthread.php?t=456146 This one is in French.]

Ok, I just took the exam and failed.  I used mearure-up practice exam to study as well as online .NET resources.  I felt I was really prepared and confident I would pass.  However, the majority of my question were on CultureInfo and RegionInfo, which I obviously did not cover enough.  I am hopeful the information in this Wiki will get me over the top.  I wonder how many people fail the first time.

== Passed with 754 ==

Hi,
I passed today the 70-536 exam with not incredible much, but enough 754 points.
I used only the 70-536 preparation kit book from Microsoft and trained with the included MessureUp tests. Of course I also read some other books a bit, but in general I used the MessureUp tests to memorize the correct answers and read the book in some hours.
Honestly said, I was too lazy and did not train the labs in the book - afterwards, I would recommend to practise the labs, because this helps a lot to memorize the API methods a lot.

Was it difficult? Hmm... I'm a original Java programmer and I felt the questions from Microsoft were not that tough as from the SUN exams, but yes, when I read the first question I already recognized, the questions from MessureUp are not that tough as the real test questions.
Personally, my by far biggest drawback was the AppDomain/CultureInfo area, but even then, it's possible to pass (as I am).
Interestingly no single question about value&lt;-&gt;reference types came up on my exam, one of the stuff I feel at home.
Before I submitted the questions 1 hour before the time limit reached (sorry, but else I know or I guess - why sticking around for nothing?), I was sure I answered only 3 questions correctly and the last 37 questions I was more or less unsure...

Since I'm new to .NET (C#) I can only say: You don't need years of experience. Take the MS Preparation Kit book and read it carefully (practise the exams!). After that it's very likely you pass the exam.

One last note: I'm not the biggest fan of the MS Preparation Kit book, since I was sometimes irritated because I couldn't get sometimes a correct/meaningful answer to some questions from the MessureUp tests. But since I don't know a better resource and I have the feeling you have a &gt;70% chance to pass with this book, I can still recommend it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book summarises current limitations and workarounds for the [http://mail.yahoo.co.uk Yahoo Mail] &amp; [http://calendar.yahoo.co.uk Calendar] facility

=Calendar=

==Is it possible to send a calendar invitation to non-yahoo attendees ?==

Yes.
 Simply enter their normal email address in the invitation section.
 The information will be sent to invitee, with a link for the invitee to follow.

==Is it possible to send the same invitation link to all attendees ?==

Yes - for Yahoo attendees only

 In this case use the link at the bottom of the invitation page.

No - for non-yahoo attendees.

 Each link in the invitation email is unique to the person it is sent to.
 So it is not possible to send this invitation link to everyone
 (e.g. after following the link and then changing the name the original name is replaced.)

==Is it possible to Update a calendar entry and have the invitees automatically updated ?==

Partially.
 The resend of the invite contains the original event details only and not the updated event 
 (e.g. if the time changes then this is not reflected in the new invite.
 However, after clicking the invitation link the correct change in time details are shown
although any change in title is not shown.

=Mail=

==Search Limitations==

Emails found by the search facility finds an email in the &quot;Drafts&quot; folder cannot be edited.

Workaround: Open the email and copy and paste into a new email.

==Draft Limitations==

When a draft item is actually sent the previously saved draft item is not deleted.

 Workaround: After sending the email check that it was actually sent my looking in the
&quot;Sent&quot; items folder and then go to &quot;Drafts&quot; and manually the delete the email.

==IMAP support==

Yahoo seems to support IMAP (as seen by tests performed with an iPhone).  However, it has not been possible to date to find settings that will work.

&lt;!--
==Why is it difficult to get to the &quot;Address Guard&quot; menu ?==

You could save the bookmark locally or on your toolbar bookmarks.

The toolbar Address Guard entry ????? is only partially useful as it does not allow you to set the &quot;Allow messages to be sent from this address&quot; and setting of the &quot;From&quot; name.

==How do I have more than 5 email accounts ?==

???????

==Fails to verify an account==

Introduction

In photosynthesis, plant cells convert light energy into chemical energy that is stored in sugars and other organic compounds. Critical to the process is chlorophyll, the primary photosynthetic pigment in chloroplasts.

This laboratory has two separate activities: I. Plant Pigment Chromatography, and II. Measuring the Rate of Photosynthesis. Select the one you want to study, beginning with Key Concepts for that section.

===Topics===

==== Programs, objects and methods ====

{{wikipedia|Computer program}}
{{wikipedia|Object oriented programming}}
.NET is essentially a set of tools to build and execute computer programs. A computer program is a set of instructions given to a computer that executes those instructions automatically to manipulate some data. .NET follows the object-oriented paradigm which means that the instructions and data are grouped around ‘’objects’’ that represent things or concepts. Objects that share the same instructions and manipulate the same kind of data are grouped into the same type. 

An object-oriented program is the definition of a series of types. For each type the kind of data and the instructions are specified. The instructions are grouped inside methods. One of the available instructions is the creation of an object of a defined type.  Another kind of instruction is the request to execute a method associated with an object. This is called invoking a method. When a method is invoked its instructions are executed until the method terminates (returns). When the method returns the calling (invoking) method executes its next instruction (statement).

When you start the execution of a program the system creates a first object and invokes a method of that object (this is called the ''main'' method). Inside that method other objects are typically created and methods of those objects are invoked. Those methods will invoke other methods and create other objects and so on. Gradually the called methods will return and the '’main’’ method will eventually finish, marking the end of the program execution.

====System types====

{{wikipedia|data type}}
{{wikipedia|type system}}
This section will be obvious for experienced object oriented developers but some of the specific objectives of the exam are directly related to the type system.

Types are a way to classify the concepts or objects of a language. The way this classification is organized is called a 'type system'. The types themselves can also be categorized in different ways by the type system.

The first way to categorize types in .NET is to make a difference between types that are part of the framework class libraries (System types) and types that will be constructed by the developer (custom types).

Writing object oriented programs can be seen as the process of defining one or more custom types. Those types are then packaged in some kind of execution unit (Assemblies in the case of .NET). The assemblies are compiled and then executed starting at some entry point that will be a specified method of one of the custom type.

Those custom types use:
* System types to execute &quot;pre-programmed&quot; instruction sequences 
* other custom types

System types are also packaged in assemblies. The custom assemblies must reference the system assemblies in order to use the System types.

There are other ways to categorize types in .NET. One of them is by the way the objects created based on those types are mapped to the computer memory. This will give us Value types and Reference types.  

Another way is by Reflection category (Class, Value types, Interfaces, Generics, etc.).

Yet another way is to distinguish the types that are directly supported by the runtime (built-in types) from those defined either in the class libraries or custom.

Those categories can also be intersected with one another, that will give us such things as &quot;Built-in value types&quot; or &quot;System interfaces&quot;. Stay alert of the categorizations used when you encounter such combinations.

Namespaces are a way to organize types so that they can be more easily found. See [[C Sharp Programming/Namespaces|this]] for a discussion on namespaces.

In the context of namespaces the System types are the types included in the System namespace or one of its sub-namespace and Custom types (non system types) should use other namespaces.

For a peek at how Microsoft describes the .NET type system see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2hf02550.aspx MSDN]. And then for an overview of the class libraries (System types) see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hfa3fa08.aspx MSDN].

Most of the exam is in fact based on how to use the common parts of the type libraries (System types). This is why the list of exam objectives (and this book TOC) is so long.

====Hello world====

For the newcomers to .NET, you may want to take a little break from the concepts here and make sure that you see how the concepts discussed so far are used in a very simple example. The next concepts are not that trivial. We will put such an example [[../Hello world|here]].

====Value types====

{{wikipedia|Call stack}}
Value types represent one part of the Value / Reference classification of the type system.

An instance of a value type directly contains its data (value). For example an Int32 local variable has its memory allocated directly on the stack.

The value types are themselves split in 3 categories:
* The built-in value types
* User-defined value types
* Enumerations

Remember that built-in types are the types directly supported by the runtime.

They are the building blocks of any program because they are what the machine instructions ultimately act upon. The rest are essentially compositions of those types.

All of the built-in types are value types except for Object and String.

The built-in value types consist of
* the integer types (Byte, SByte, Int16, Int32, Int64, UInt16, UInt32 and UInt64)
* the floating point types (Single and Double)
* the logical type (Boolean)
* other (Char, Decimal, InPtr and UInPtr)

All built-in value types are defined in the System namespace (ex. System.Int32) and have keywords that represent them in the VB and C# (ex. int in C#, integer in VB.NET) except for InPtr and UInPtr.

{{dynamic navigation
|title=Side note
|body=
We noted above that type classification can be quite confusing sometimes. As an example note that System.DateTime is presented as a built-in value type in the [[../Trailers/#70-536 Training kit|Training kit]] (page 5) and this is not identified as an error in MSDN KB. It is '''not''' a built-in type according to the [[../Trailers/#ECMA 335|official specification]] (page 19). The confusion comes from the fact that the [[../Trailers/#70-536 Training kit|Training kit]] does not make a clear difference between System types (in the class libraries) and Build-in types (basic types dealt with directly by the runtime).  

The point here is not to be fussy or depreciate the work done by the authors of the training kit. We just want to note that it may be worth to take a few minutes to clearly separate the concepts before heading to the code.
}}

All value types derive from System.ValueType either directly for built-in and user-defined or indirectly through System.Enum for enumerations.

Enumerations are a way to name a set of values of an underlying integer type (signed or unsigned). As restrictions of an integer type they act as their underlying type.

User-defined value types and Enumerations both include System types and Custom types.

An example of a System user-defined value-type would be System.Drawing.Point used in drawing.

You build custom value types using specific language constructs (struct in C#, Structure in VB.NET).

An example of a System enumeration would be the System.Data.CommandType enumeration that specifies if a table is a text command, a call to a stored procedure, etc.

You build custom enumerations using specific language constructs (enum in C#, Enum in VB.NET).

For examples and notes on using value types see this [[../Using_System_Types#Value_types_usage|section]]. See also examples of [[../Using_System_Types#Building_a_value_type|building]] and [[../Using_System_Types#Using_a_user-defined_value_type|using]] user-defined value types.

====Reference types====

{{wikipedia|Dynamic memory allocation}}
Reference types represent the other part of the Value / Reference classification of the type system.

Contrary to value types, an instance of a reference type does not directly contain its data (value), but instead contains some kind of a reference to the memory location of that value. For example a String local variable has memory allocated on the stack for a reference to the contained string, not the string itself. In that case the string itself will be allocated on the heap and garbage collected (more on that later).

Two built-in types are considered reference types: Object and String and they are also directly referenced in the System libraries (ex. System.String) and have their own constructs in the .NET languages (ex. string in C#).

The reference types are themselves split in four categories:
* pointers
* arrays
* classes
* interfaces

We will not talk about pointers in this book because no exam objective references them.

The next three sections will present arrays, classes and interfaces.

For a comparison of value / reference types try [http://blogs.msdn.com/theoy/archive/2005/06/24/ValueRef.aspx this].

For other notes and an example of using reference types see [[../Using_System_Types#Using_reference_types|this]].

====Arrays====

{{wikipedia|array}}
An array is essentially a group of objects, usually of the same type, than can be accessed via an index.

For a general discussion of arrays you can see the Wikipedia article (on the right) or go to the Wikibook on [[Data Structures/Arrays|data structures]].

Arrays once were one of the most used features of programming languages because you can go from one item in the array to the next in a very efficient way (you can see   [[C_Programming/Pointers_and_arrays|C pointers and arrays]] if you want more details on this). Today the availability of much more “computer power” has moved the focus from arrays to collections. The two main problems of arrays are:
* They are fixed length
* They support only one internal organization

Collections address most of the shortcomings of arrays (at a cost though). Arrays can still be considered for a fixed group of objects that have to be efficiently manipulated.

We will have some examples in the [[../Using_System_Types#Using_and_building_arrays|using arrays]] section.

====Classes====

{{wikipedia|Object oriented programming}}
{{wikipedia|Class (computer_science)}}
Classes are themselves split in three:
* user-defined classes
* boxed value types 
* delegates

Boxed value types will be discussed a little later in the [[../Using_System_Types#Boxing_and_unboxing|boxing / unboxing]] section.

Delegates will also be covered later in their [[#Events and delegates|section]].

User-defined classes are the basic realizations of the object oriented concepts.

Obviously a lot can be said about classes but since no exam objective reference to them we will assume that the reader is already familiar with the concept and have already worked with them (in .NET or elsewhere).

You can have System classes (hundreds and hundreds of them) and custom classes (where you will code the essential of your program logic).

We have examples of [[../Using_System_Types#Using_classes|using]] and [[../Using_System_Types#Using_classes|building]] classes.

====Interfaces====

{{wikipedia|Type polymorphism}}
{{wikipedia|Interface (computer_science)}}
If you want to get really confused on what exactly is object-oriented programming just check the Wikipedia article on Polymorphism :-).

The idea is just to be able to have a single type of reference to the &quot;common part&quot; of different types that have &quot;something in common&quot;. 

Rectangles and Ellipses are both &quot;Shapes&quot; so how can we get part of a program to manipulate &quot;Shapes&quot; without knowing about the specific of Rectangles or Ellipses. In such a situation we say that Shapes are polymorphic (literally they can take many forms).

In object-oriented programming you get this behavior with inheritance. A reference to a parent class (Shape) will manipulate child objects (Rectangles or Ellipses) without problems.

Interfaces were developed to get the same behavior in the context of component-based computing where you don't have access to the source code so you cannot use inheritance. The interface construct was the basis of all component communication in COM.

An interface is a contract to implement a set of methods in a clearly defined manner (method signatures). If you know that a class implements an interface you know that you can use any of the defined methods.

From that definition it is easy to imagine having a reference to an &quot;interface instance&quot; from which you can call any of the interface methods. So easy in fact that the framework provides just that.

Now suppose that instead of a Shape being a parent of Rectangle we just have a Shape interface that is implemented both by Rectangle and Ellipse. If I have a reference to a Rectangle object, I will be able to &quot;cast&quot; it to a reference to a Shape interface and pass it to the part of the program that knows only about &quot;Shape objects&quot;.

This is exactly the same polymorphic behavior that we had via inheritance.

The class libraries rely heavily on interfaces and a clear understanding of the concept is essential.

An interesting problem with interfaces compared with inheritance is that you '''do not''' get a default implementation (virtual parent methods) so you have to recode everything. The techniques and tools do exist here but there is always some extra work to do. More on that with generics...

We have examples of [[../Using_System_Types#Using_interfaces|using]] and [[../Using_System_Types#Building_a_custom_interface|building]] interfaces. Some interfaces of the System namespace are shown in the [[../Other_system_classes#Standard_interfaces|standard interfaces]] section.

====Attributes====

{{wikipedia|Aspect-oriented programming}}
We now take a short break of our discussions on types to talk a little bit about attributes. First of all attributes are not types. They are elements of information that are added to a program element (assemblies, classes, method, etc.) to qualify it outside of the normal code associated with that element.

Those added &quot;attributes&quot; serves at doing manipulations of the underlying program element without having to modify the execution logic of the element.

Why would we ever want to manipulate program elements outside execution code? The short answer here is that object oriented concepts do not easily deal with what is known as cross-cutting concerns, or aspects of a program that apply to all or most classes. Examples of such aspects are security, persistence, serialization, etc. Instead of modifying every class to add serialization logic (which has nothing to do with business rules) you can add serialization attributes to the class to direct the serialization process of those classes without changing the business logic (execution code).

A number of functionality of the framework rely on attributes to add information to program elements. The attributes are kept by the compilation process and associated with their qualifying element in the assemblies. They are analyzed programmatically at run time using reflection to adjust the behavior of &quot;cross-cutting&quot; functionalities.

As for types we have System attributes (part of the framework) and Custom attributes (built by the developer). The development of Customs attributes will be treated in the [[../Interoperability_Classes#Implement_Reflexion|reflection section]]. Until then we will limit ourselves with System attributes and focus on defining them and knowing how they will determine the behavior of framework.

The [[../Using_System_Types#Using_attributes|attributes usage section]] will give some example of how simple System attributes can be used.

Let's note here that attributes are not the only way to add &quot;non-execution&quot; information to a program to modify its behavior. XML configuration files for example can be used to specify parameters that will affect program execution. We will talk about those in the Configuration section of this book.

See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288059(VS.71).aspx MSDN] for the discussion of attributes in C#.

====Collections====

{{wikipedia|Collection (computing)}}
A collection is a grouping of objects. The framework has many types of collections that cover most of the situations where you would process objects as a group. Knowing these collection types will save you the time to &quot;re-code&quot; equivalent logic and will keep your program more maintainable.

Unlike arrays collections come in many flavors each with its specific internal organization. Each type of collection is related to a specific type of problem. We will point out the types of problems when we give examples of each type of collections.

We have two sections with collections examples:
* [[../Using_collections|Using collections]] for the classes in the System.Collections namespace. 
* [[../Other_system_classes#Using_specialized_collections|Using specialized collections]] for the classes in the System.Collections.Specialized namespace.

The major drawback of collections is that in &quot;real life&quot; objects that are grouped together usually have some characteristics in common (they are the same type, have a common parent type or support a common interface). So most of the time we know &quot;more&quot; about the objects than merely their organization. Collections do not allow us to use that knowledge to validate the objects passed to the collection or code logic applicable to all objects of the collection (without casting and exception handling that is).

Generic collections where introduced in version 2.0 of the framework. They solve this problem while keeping the other advantages of collections. For that reason they should be used whenever possible instead of &quot;plain&quot; collections.

Some external links on collections are [http://samples.gotdotnet.com/quickstart/howto/doc/icollection.aspx GotDotNet] and [http://www.aspnetresources.com/blog/dotnet_collection_madness.aspx AspNetResources]

See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7y3x785f(VS.80).aspx MSDN] for a general discussion on arrays, collections and data structures.

====Generics====

{{wikipedia|Generic programming}}
Generic programming or the use of parameterized types is not an object oriented concept. In that sense Generics are a bit like attributes, they were added to main stream object-oriented platforms to take care of situations that are not easily covered by object-oriented techniques. 

To start our discussion please read the following interesting [[.NET Development Foundation/Generic types|linked article (annexes)]] that introduces the concept of generics in the context of generic collections. This external [http://www.softsteel.co.uk/tutorials/cSharp/lesson21.html tutorial] does the same.

The concept of Generics is interesting because it applies the concept of generalization to types. Types themselves are generalizations of objects (the basis of object-oriented programming). So here we start manipulating types, namely having types as parameters.

The actual type will be obtained when you substitute the parameter type with a specific type (For example when you declare a variable of that type). 
 // C#
 List&lt;int&gt; myIntList = new List&lt;int&gt;()
 
 '// VB.NET
 Dim myIntList As New List(Of Integer)
 
In the .NET framework this substitution is done during the second compilation (the just-in-time compilation from CIL to machine code). Said differently, generics are supported by the CIL and are thus part of the framework itself, not of the language used (ex. C#).

For more coverage on generics see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/512aeb7t(VS.80).aspx MSDN].

We have examples of [[../Using_System_Types#Using_generic_types|using]] and [[../Using_System_Types#Building_generics|building]] generic types.

For examples of generics collections see the [[../Using_generic_collections|using generic collections]] section.

====Exceptions====

{{wikipedia|Exceptions}}

This is how you throw a general exception:

 // C#
 throw new Exception(&quot;This is an exception.&quot;);
 
 '// VB.NET
 Throw New Exception(&quot;This is an exception.&quot;)

This is how you handle an exception:

 // C#
 try
 {
    throw new Exception(&quot;This is an exception.&quot;);
 }
 catch (Exception e)
 {
   Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
 }
 
 '// VB.NET
 Try
   Throw New Exception(&quot;This is an exception.&quot;)
 Catch ex As Exception
   Console.WriteLine(ex.Message)
 End Try

====Events and Delegates====

{{wikipedia|Delegate (.NET)}}
{{wikipedia|Delegation (programming)}}
{{wikipedia|Event-driven programming}}
{{wikipedia|Publish/subscribe}}
For the “official” discussion of events and delegates see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-US/library/17sde2xt.aspx MSDN]. What we will do here is a little more general discussion of the many concepts involved. 

The first concept is delegation or the idea that part of the functionality of a class can be done “elsewhere” in the program, it can be delegated. The important benefit of delegation is that the “delegating” object does not have to know how the delegated functionality is actually implemented. One way to “delegate” is to define an interface. If an object has a reference to an interface it can delegate part of its functionality to the object implementing that interface without knowing much about that object. 

.NET 2.0 defines another reference type called a delegate that implements the delegation pattern in a slightly different way. A delegate is a type that defines a reference to a single function that must have the same signature as the delegate definition. A signature is a description of the type of the function parameters and its return type. Like a class you can create an object of that type. The object created is a reference to a function that can be assigned (set the reference to a specific function), be passed as parameter or executed (the function that is referenced is actually executed). Unlike an interface, a delegate defines only one function and a delegate instance can be created directly (no need to have another class implementing the interface).

Most delegates in .NET derive from a multicast delegate. A multicast delegate is a delegate that keeps a list of references to functions having the same signature as the delegate definition instead of a single reference. You can add a reference to a multicast delegate using the += operator. When you execute a multicast delegate each function referenced is executed in turn.

If an object is from a class that implements a multicast delegate member, then if you have a reference to that object you can &quot;add&quot; to the multicast delegate a reference to a function of your choice. If the object decides to &quot;execute&quot; its delegate member then the function from which you added a reference will be executed. 

This multicast delegate member is precisely what an event is in .NET. This is why events and delegates are almost always discussed together. 

The procedure to define an event is:
* You define a delegate type as a reference to functions having a specific signature
* You add an Event member to a class and associate it with the delegate type you just define, this instantiate a multicast delegate associated with the event 
* When you have a reference to an object of the class you can add a reference to any method that has the same signature as the delegate type.
* When the object raises the event, the associate multicast delegate is executed which triggers the execution of the referenced function.

Most of the time you will add a reference to one of your own method. When the referenced object fires its event it actually executes one of your methods without knowing it. This setup is an implementation of the publish / subscribe pattern. You subscribe to an event, signaling that you want to be informed when a specific &quot;event&quot; happens. Many object can subscribe to the same event. When the referenced object fires its event it &quot;publishes&quot; a message that the event has effectively happened in the form of a function call to all the &quot;registered&quot; functions. 

So any class can define events. Many system classes define events to communicate to your code the fact that &quot;something&quot; happened in the executing environment (the mouse moved, a key was pressed, a message was received on a socket, etc.). Constructing a program that &quot;waits&quot; for events to happen and then react to them is called event programming. Most online applications and services follow this design. We will discuss in more details the way system events are catched in the section on multithreading.

For examples of events and delegates see [[../Using_events|this section]].

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;font: 2em sans-serif;padding;1em&quot;&gt;System types and collections: Using System types&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

====Using System types====

'''Exam objective: '''Manage data in a .NET Framework application by using the .NET Framework 2.0 system types.

(Refer System namespace)

=====Value types usage=====

Following are some &quot;usage&quot; oriented remarks about value types.

Value types contain the values they are assigned: 
 int a = 1;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// the variable &quot;a&quot; contains &quot;1&quot; of value type ''int''&lt;/font&gt;
Value types can also be created by using the ''new'' keyword.  Using the ''new'' keyword initializes the variable with the default value obtained from the type's default constructor:
 int a = new int(); &lt;font color = green&gt;// using the default constructor via the ''new'' keyword&lt;/font&gt;
 return a;          &lt;font color=green&gt;// returns &quot;0&quot; in the case of type Int.&lt;/font&gt;
Value types can be declared without being initialized, but they must be initialized to some value before being used:
 int a;     &lt;font color=green&gt;// This is perfectly acceptable&lt;/font&gt;
 return a;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// NOT acceptable!  You can't use &quot;a&quot; because &quot;a&quot; doesn't have a value!&lt;/font&gt;
Value types cannot equal ''null''.  .NET 2.0 provides a ''Nullable type'' to get around this limitation, which is discussed in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Study_Guides:Microsoft_Certified_Professional_Developer_%28MCPD%29%5CExam_70-536%5CNullable_type the next section], but ''null'' is not a valid value for value types:
 int a = null;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// Won't compile - throws an error.&lt;/font&gt;
If you copy a Value type to another Value type, the value is '''copied'''.  Changing the value of the copy has no effect on the value of the original.  The second is merely a copy of the first - they are in no way connected after assignment.  This is fairly intuitive:
 int var1 = 1;
 int var2 = var1;  &lt;font color=green&gt;//the value of var1 (a &quot;1&quot; of type ''int'') is '''copied''' to var2&lt;/font&gt;
 var2 = 25;        &lt;font color=green&gt;// The &quot;1&quot; value in var2 is overwritten with &quot;25&quot;&lt;/font&gt;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;The value of var1 is {0}, the value of var2 is {1}&quot;, var1, var2);
Which would result in the output:
 The value of var1 is 1, the value of var2 is 25
Changing the value of the copy ('''var2''' in this instance) had no effect on the value of the original ('''var1''').
This is different from reference types which copy a reference to the value, not the value itself.

Value types cannot be derived from.

Value types as method parameters are passed by value by default. A copy of the value-type is made and the copy is passed to the method as a parameter. If the parameter is changed inside the method it will not affect the value of the original value type.

{{TODO|Eventually we could add an example showing the usage of some of the built-in value type: integer, floating point, logical, char and decimal and the value parameter passing of value types}}

=====Nullable type=====

See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx MSDN]

A nullable type...

*Is a generic type
*Is an instance of System.Nullable struct.
*Can only be declared on value types.
*Is declared with System.Nullable&lt;''type''&gt; or the shorthand ''type''? - the two are interchangeable.
 System.Nullable&lt;int&gt; MyNullableInt;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// the long version&lt;/font&gt; 
 int? MyNullableInt;                  &lt;font color=green&gt;// the short version&lt;/font&gt;
*Accepts the normal range of values of the underlying type, '''as well as''' ''null''.
 bool? MyBoolNullable;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// valid values: true || false || null&lt;/font&gt;
Be careful with ''nullable'' booleans!  In ''if, for, while'' or logical evaluation statements a nullable boolean will equate a ''null'' value with ''false'' -- it will '''not''' throw an error.

Methods: ''T GetValueOrDefault()'' &amp; ''T GetValueOrDefault(T defaultValue)''&lt;br&gt;
Returns the stored value or the default value if the stored value is set to ''null''.

Properties: ''HasValue'' &amp; ''Value''&lt;br&gt;
Nullable types have two '''read only''' properties:  ''HasValue'' and ''Value''.

'''HasValue''' is a boolean property that returns true if Value != ''null''.  It provides a means to check your type for a non-''null'' value before using it where you might throw an error:
  int? MyInt = null;
  int MyOtherInt;
  MyOtherInt = MyInt.Value + 1;    &lt;font color=green&gt;// Error! You can't add ''null'' + 1!!&lt;/font&gt;
  if (MyInt.HasValue) MyOtherInt = MyInt.Value + 1; &lt;font color=green&gt;// This is a better way.&lt;/font&gt;
'''Value''' returns the value of your type, ''null'' or otherwise.
 int? MyInt = 27;
 if (MyInt.HasValue) return MyInt.Value;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// returns 27.&lt;/font&gt;
 MyInt = null;
 return MyInt; &lt;font color=green&gt;// returns ''null''.&lt;/font&gt;

'''Wrapping / Unwrapping'''

'''Wrapping''' is the process of packaging a value ''m'' from a non-nullable type ''N'' to a nullable type ''N?'' via the expression '''new N?(m)'''

'''Unwrapping''' is the process of [[evaluating]] a nullable type ''N?'' for instance m as type ''N'' or NULL and is performed via the 'Value' property (e.g. '''m.Value'''). &lt;br&gt;

Note: Unwrapping a null instance generates the exception ''System.InvalidOperationException''

'''The ?? Operator''' (aka the ''Null Coalescing'' Operator)

While not for use solely with Nullable types, the '''??''' operator proves very useful when you want to use a default value instead of a ''null'' value.  The '''??''' operator returns the left operand of a statement if not null, otherwise it returns the right operand.  
 int? MyInt = null;
 return MyInt ?? 27;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// returns 27, since MyInt is ''null''&lt;/font&gt;
For more information see the [http://blog.devstone.com/Aaron/archive/2006/01/02/1404.aspx blog entry by R. Aaron Zupancic on the ?? Operator]

===== Building a value type =====

Building a value type must be very simple. The following example defines a custom &quot;point&quot; structure with only 2 double members. See [[#Boxing_and_unboxing|boxing and unboxing]] for a discussion of implicit conversion of value types to reference types. 
{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# Code sample
|body=
Building and using a custom value type (struct)
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    //
    namespace ValueTypeLab01
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                MyPoint p;
                p.x = 3.2;
                p.y = 14.1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Distance from origin: &quot; + Program.Distance(p));
                // Wait for finish
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            // method where MyPoint is passed by value
            public static double Distance(MyPoint p)
            {
                return Math.Sqrt(p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y);
            }
        }
        // MyPoint is a struct (custom value type) representing a point
        public struct MyPoint
        {
            public double x;
            public double y;
        }
    }
}}

===== Using a user-defined value type =====

The above example can be used here. Note that the p variable does not have to be initialized with the ''new'' operator.

=====Using enumerations=====

The following sample shows simple uses of the System enumeration DayOfWeek. The code is much simpler to read than testing for an integer value representing a day. Note that using ToString() on an enum variable will give the string representation of the value (ex. “Monday” instead of “1”). 

The possible values can be listed using Reflection. See that section for details.

For a discussion of the Enum class see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.enum.aspx MSDN]

There is a special type of enumeration called a flags enumeration. The exam objectives do not mention it specifically. See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.flagsattribute.aspx MSDN] if you are interested.

Simple use of enumerations

    {

        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                DayOfWeek day = DayOfWeek.Friday;
                if (day == DayOfWeek.Friday)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Day: {0}&quot;, day);
                }
                DayOfWeek day2 = DayOfWeek.Monday;
                if (day2 &lt; day)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Smaller than Friday&quot;);
                }
                switch (day)
                {
                    case DayOfWeek.Monday:
                        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Monday processing&quot;);
                        break;
                    default:
                        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Default processing&quot;);
                        break;
                }
                int i = (int)DayOfWeek.Sunday;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Int value of day: {0}&quot;, i);
                // Finishing
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}}

===== Building an enumeration =====

Building a custom enumeration is pretty straightforward as shown by the following example.

{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# Sample
|body=
Declaring a simple enumeration
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    //
    namespace EnumLab02
    {
        class Program
        {
            public enum MyColor
            {
                None = 0,
                Red,
                Green,
                Blue
            }
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                MyColor col = MyColor.Green;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Color: {0}&quot;, col);
                // Finishing
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}}

=====Using reference types=====

Reference types are more commonly referred to as ''objects''. [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0b0thckt.aspx Classes], [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/87d83y5b.aspx Interfaces] and [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/900fyy8e.aspx Delegates] are all reference types, as well as the built-in reference types '''System.Object''' and '''System.String'''.  Reference types are stored in managed Heap memory.

Unlike Value types, reference types can be assigned the value ''null''.

Copying a reference type copies a ''reference'' that points to the object, not a copy of the object itself.  This can seem counter-intuitive at times, since changing a copy of a reference will also change the original.

A Value type stores the value it is assigned, plain and simple - but a Reference type stores a ''pointer to a location in memory'' (on the heap).  Think of the heap as a bunch of lockers and the Reference type holds the locker number (there are no locks in this metaphor).  Copying a Reference type is like giving someone a copy of your locker number, rather than a copy of its contents.  Two Reference types that point to the same memory is like two people sharing the same locker - both can modify its content:
{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# Code sample
|body=
 Example of using Reference types
 public class Dog
 {
   private string breed;
   public string Breed { get {return breed;} set {breed = value;} }
   
   private int age;
   public int Age { get {return age;} set {age = value;} }
   
   public override string ToString()
   {
     return String.Format(&quot;is a {0} that is {1} years old.&quot;, Breed, Age);
   }
   
   public Dog(string dogBreed, int dogAge)
   {
     this.breed = dogBreed;
     this.age = dogAge;
   }
 }
 
 public class Example()
 {
    public static void Main()
    {
      Dog myDog = new Dog(&quot;Labrador&quot;, 1);    &lt;font color=green&gt;// myDog points to a position in memory.&lt;/font&gt;
      Dog yourDog = new Dog(&quot;Doberman&quot;, 3);  &lt;font color=green&gt;// yourDog points to a ''different'' position in memory.&lt;/font&gt;
 
      yourDog = myDog; &lt;font color=green&gt;// both now point to the same position in memory, 
                     // where a Dog type has values of &quot;Labrador&quot; and 1&lt;/font&gt;
    
      yourDog.Breed = &quot;Mutt&quot;;
      myDog.Age = 13; 
 
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Your dog {0}\nMy dog {1}&quot;, yourDog.ToString(), myDog.ToString());
    }
 }
Since the yourDog variable and the the myDog variable both point to the same memory store, the ouput of which would be:
 Your dog is a Mutt that is 13 years old.
 My dog is a Mutt that is 13 years old.
}}

As a practice for manipulating reference types you may want to work with the [[../Globalization#String_class|String and StringBuilder]] classes. We have put these with the text manipulation section but manipulating strings is a basic operation of almost all programs.

=====Using and building arrays=====

See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.aspx MSDN] for reference information.

=====Using classes=====

=====Building a custom class=====

=====Using interfaces=====

=====Building a custom interface=====

=====Using attributes=====

=====Using generic types=====

The use of the four major categories of System Generic Types will mainly be demonstrated elsewhere in this book:
* The nullable type was discussed above
* A whole section follows on Generic collections
* The generic event handler will be discussed in the Event / Delegate section.
* The generic delegates will also be discussed in the Event / Delegate section as well as in the Generic collections section (Comparer class).

If you copy the next very simple example in Visual Studio and try to add something other than an int to the list the program will not compile. This demonstrates the strong typing capability of generics.

            {
                List&lt;int&gt; myIntList = new List&lt;int&gt;();
                myIntList.Add(32);
                myIntList.Add(10); // Try to add something other than an int 
                                   // ex. myIntList.Add(12.5);
                foreach (int i in myIntList)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Item: &quot; + i.ToString());
                }
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}}
You can use List&lt;string&gt; instead of List&lt;int&gt; and you will get a list of strings for the same price (you are using the same List(T) class).

=====Building generics=====

The programming of a custom generic collection was shown in the [[/Generic types|article]] mentioned in the topics discussion.

Here we have an example of a Generic Function. We use the trivial problem of swapping two references. Although very simple we still see the basic benefits of Generics:
*We don't have to recode a swap function for every type
*The generalization does not cost us the strong typing (try swapping an int and a string, it wont compile)

        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Program pgm = new Program();
                // Swap strings
                string str1 = &quot;First string&quot;;
                string str2 = &quot;Second string&quot;;
                pgm.swap&lt;string&gt;(ref str1, ref str2);
                Console.WriteLine(str1);
                Console.WriteLine(str2);
                // Swap integers
                int int1 = 1;
                int int2 = 2;
                pgm.swap&lt;int&gt;(ref int1, ref int2);
                Console.WriteLine(int1);
                Console.WriteLine(int2);
                // Finish with wait
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            // Swapping references
            void swap&lt;T&gt;(ref T r1,ref T r2)
            {
                T r3 = r1;
                r1 = r2;
                r2 = r3;
            }
        }
    }
}}


Next step is to present an example including a generic interface, a generic class that implements that generic interface and a class derived from that generic class. The sample also uses interface and derivation constraints.

This is another simple problem involving employees and suppliers which have nothing in common except that they can request payment to a &quot;payment handler&quot; (see [[w:Visitor_pattern|visitor pattern]]). 

The problem is to know where to put the logic if you have specific processing to do for a certain kind of payment just for employees. There are myriads of ways to solve that problem but the use of generics make the following sample clean, explicit and strongly typed. 

The other nice thing is that it has nothing to do with containers or collections where you will find almost all of generic samples.

Please note that the EmployeeCheckPayment&lt;T&gt; class derives from CheckPayment&lt;T&gt; giving a '''stronger constraint''' on the type parameter T (must be employee not just implement IPaymentInfo). That gives us the to opportunity to have access (in its RequestPayment method) to all payment logic (from the base class) at the same time as all employee public interface (thru the sender method parameter) and that without having to do any cast.

=====Boxing and unboxing===== 

See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx MSDN]

All types derive directly or indirectly from System.Object (including value types by the way of System.ValueType). This allows the very convenient concept of a reference to &quot;any&quot; object but poses some technical concerns because value types are not &quot;referenced&quot;. Comes boxing and unboxing. 

Boxing and unboxing enable value types to be treated as objects. Boxing a value type packages it inside an instance of the Object reference type. This allows the value type to be stored on the garbage collected heap. Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. In this example, the integer variable i is boxed and assigned to object o:
 int i = 123;
 object o = (object) i;  // boxing

Please also note that it is not necessary to explicitly cast an integer to an object (as shown in the example above) to cause the integer to be boxed. Invoking any of its methods would also cause it to be boxed on the heap (because only the boxed form of the object has a pointer to a virtual method table):

 int i=123;
 String s=i.toString(); //This call will cause boxing

There is also a third way in which a value type can be boxed. That happens when you pass a value type as a parameter to a function that expects an object.
Let's say there is a function prototyped as:

 void aFunction(object value)

Now let's say from some other part of your program you call this function like this:

 int i=123;
 aFunction(i); //i is automatically boxed

This call would automatically cast the integer to an object, thus resulting in boxing.

The object o can then be unboxed and assigned to integer variable i:
 o = 123;
 i = (int) o;  // unboxing

'''Performance of boxing and unboxing'''

In relation to simple assignments, boxing and unboxing are computationally expensive processes. When a value type is boxed, an entirely new object must be allocated and constructed. To a lesser degree, the cast required for unboxing is also expensive computationally.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Heredity is basically the passage of traits from a ''P'' ( parental) generation onto its offspring. Genetics is intimately related to reproduction and a knowledge of reproduction will facilitate your learning of genetics. 

== Reproduction ==
Reproduction is continuation of life. What reproduction does is transmit the hereditary information found in all cells of an organism, namely DNA. There are 2 types of reproduction, asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction is the propagation of a single organism. That organism recreates itself and all its offspring are identical to it. Sexual reproduction promotes change and requires 2 organism to fuse gametes ( reproductive cells with genetic information) to create offspring that are different from their parents. 

Genetic information is packaged into a unit known as a chromosome. A chromosome is made up mostly of DNA and proteins that make up its structure. Chromosome is a very general term. Humans have X shaped chromosomes, ''e. coli'' has a circular chromosome known as a plasmid. From these chromosomes and through DNA cells can construct an entire organism. It is a very efficient and elegant system that oversees the life of all organisms from tiny cells to humans. 

In sexual reproduction, 2 organisms fuse gametes to make up the genetic information for their offspring. Examples of gametes are sperm and eggs. Gametes each contain half the genetic information their parents had. This means they are haploid ( haploid - half ploid) is represented by ''1n''. To be useful you need 2 gametes to fuse and a make a diploid ( di, two ploid) zygote ( ''2n''). From the zygote will be born the organism.

== Chromosomes ==
Chromosomes are the carriers of genetic information. Most mammalian organisms have an arrangement of diploid chromosomes.  They exist in pairs, carrying homologous genetic information. That is they carry different versions of the same thing. Let's say there was a plant with only 1 pair of chromosomes. One chromosome has the allele for blue stem color and the other chromosome has an allele for green stem color (an allele is a subunit of a chromosome, its an alternate version of a gene -in this case stem color). In the end, only one of these alleles are expressed ( more on this later) but they are both present in this organism.

Home hair color is used by women for a variety of reasons such as to cover gray, look younger, or provide a fresh new look for the season.  However, even experienced users find the process messy and sometimes unpredictable, and novices face a daunting learning curve with potentially embarrassing outcomes.  This article provides general insights on techniques and then in-depth directions on the process by subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Top 10 Tips &amp; Tricks ==
&lt;br /&gt;
# When in doubt, use a lighter shade… you can always re-color darker, but it’s hard to go lighter! 
# Going Blond? If your skin has yellow undertones, avoid golden blonds; if it has pink undertones, stay away from the strawberry shades.   
# Browns and blacks can stain your skin, make sure you use a protective barrier like Vaseline or Repelle Hair Color Stain Shield made just for this purpose. 
# Use eye and skin color to help decide warmer versus cooler tones. An ‘ashy’ cooler tone can help your gray hair appear to have natural blonde highlights. 
# Don’t go by the picture on the box! The picture on the front of the box only shows the color dye you are adding to the hair color you already have. Look at the “starting” and “ending” colors on the back or side of the box to get a better idea which direction your hair color tone will end up. 
# Don’t wash your hair on the day you will color, the natural hair oils provide a barrier to protect your scalp from color. 
# Color with a friend to make the process more fun and get help with application and avoiding spills. 
# It’s good to always have two boxes of color. You never know when you'll run out of the mix, have an unexpected spill, or somehow damage the bottle. If you’re comfortable with the possibility of coloring half your head if you spill, go ahead and buy just one box! 
# Don’t wash your hair for 24 hours after you color. Use high quality, color-safe shampoos. Shampoo every other day if you can stand it, to make your color last longer! 
# Most major hair color companies have an 800 number you can call for advice. If you need help, use it! 
&lt;br /&gt;
== Pick the Right Type of Color ==
How long do you want your new color to last? &lt;br /&gt;
'''Temporary haircolor''' only lasts a day or two, then it washes out. This product would be good if you wanted to color your hair darker briefly or if you were thinking of covering your grey and wanted a preview. It cannot lighten. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Semi- or demi-permanent dyes''' are excellent to darken your color, add red or blend grey by turning it into tinted highlights. They last from four to six weeks and gently fade from the hair, usually without leaving a visible line along the roots. They cannot lighten your hair. A semi permanent contains no ammonia or peroxide and works by coating the hair. Too frequent use could build up on the hair making it dull and possibly darker than you originally wanted. A demi permanent is mixed with a small amount of peroxide. Demi's will last up to six weeks and are more permanent than semi permanent color because of the peroxide in it. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Permanent hair color''' lasts until it grows out. Permanent hair color generally has to be touched up every four to six weeks to cover the roots, where your natural color will start showing and you’ll see a visible line. Most permanent haircolor contains ammonia and peroxide and work by lightening the hair as well as coloring it. Because these two things happen during one process in home hair color they are referred to as single process hair color. &lt;br /&gt;
=== Coloring your hair without coloring your skin. === 
Concerned about hair color on your skin?  No luck, any type of color—temporary, semi-permanent or permanent—has high concentrations of dye and other harsh chemicals that can stain or irritate your skin (whether from the chemicals themselves or scrubbing to remove the stain). Protect your skin from the stains and irritation with a product like Vaseline or Repelle Hair Color Stain Shield.

== Pick the Right Color Shade/Level and Tone ==
Getting your color just the way you want is no easy task.  It involves getting both the right darkness or level of color, and the right shade or tone of color.
=== Lighter, darker, or exactly the same level? === 
At home hair coloring is great for people who want to make a subtle change in color or color grey as long as you only want to go one or two shades lighter or darker than your original color.  When in doubt, use the lighter shade… you can always re-color darker, but it’s hard to go lighter! &lt;br /&gt;
Going Blond? If your skin has yellow undertones it is best to avoid golden blonds. Stay away form the strawberry shades if your skin has pink undertones. Would you make a great blond?  If you were blond as a child, the answer is probably yes! &lt;br /&gt;
Going Brown? Be careful going dark brown, even if your hair is naturally dark brown, to avoid over saturation of color making it too dark. Browns and blacks can stain your skin, make sure you use a protective barrier! &lt;br /&gt;
Going black? Sometimes people find the most natural looking results are achieved with a dark brown dye instead of black unless you have very dark skin or hair. Pure blacks can result in purple or red tones. Be careful of dark colors if your skin is very pale.  The results can make you look very pale.  If you do use black, be sure to use Repelle to avoid stains! &lt;br /&gt;
Covering Gray? Gray hair can be resilient to hair dye because of its coarse texture. If your hair is less than 15% gray, a semi-permanent color that’s a shade lighter than your natural color (or matches your color) will blend the gray right in. If your hair is more than 15% gray, permanent color is the only thing that will completely cover the gray. An ‘ashy’ cooler tone can help your gray hair appear to have natural blonde highlights. &lt;br /&gt;
Going Red?  Reds can be tricky. You can sometimes end up with color that does not look natural.  For best results, choose a level (light, medium, or dark) that’s close to your natural haircolor. If you want to try red, but it makes you a little nervous, try a semi-permanent color before you make a commitment or opt for a red glaze that will deposit red tones on top of your current shade, but will still wash out. &lt;br /&gt;
=== Warm or Cool? ===
Some women like it hot. Some like it cold. At a given level or darkness of color, there are shades that are warmer—with more gold, yellow or orange in them—and shades that are cooler—with more blue or red in them. Of course, no one wants blue hair, but cooler shades with some blue tones within the dye neutralize or reduce warm tones. Likewise, warmer tones “warm up” or brighten duller, drabber cooler tones. &lt;br /&gt;
Looking at your eye color and your skin tone will help determine which way to go. If your eyes are amber, green, blue-green, topaz, blue or hazel and you have warm skin tones like ivory, peach, creamy beige or golden brown, your best colors are golden with red highlights, golden brown, honey brown, chestnut, copper or mahogany. &lt;br /&gt;
If your coloring is more on the cool side; if your skin has rosy  beige or pink, dark brown or olive, and your eyes are deep blue, grey blue, light blue, deep green, brown or black, your best hair color options are ash and platinum blonde, brown, dark brown, black, salt and pepper and pure white. &lt;br /&gt;
Of course there are always exceptions!  Sometimes, those with warm tones who use a warm—golden color will pull too much gold and the result can be a “brassy” tone. This can be toned down with a neutral or cool/ash tone. Alternately, choose a warm shade (golden or copper for instance) if you want to add some warmth or brightness to hair that looks dull or drab. &lt;br /&gt;
You can also look at the colors that look best on you in clothing to figure out the best hair color tone for you. If you favor warm colored clothing, than warm tones are for you. If cool colors make you look your best, stick with cool hair color tones as well. &lt;br /&gt;
Special Tip!—Don't go by the picture on the box! The picture on the front of the box only shows the color dye you are adding to the hair color you already have. Look at the “starting” and “ending” colors on the back or side of the box to get a better idea which direction your hair color tone will end up. 
&lt;br /&gt;
== Prepare Your Hair for Coloring ==
A few days before you color your hair, you should deep condition your hair, paying close attention to the ends. The ends of your hair are typically the most porous and have a tendency to absorb too much color. Do not wash your hair on the day you will color. Natural hair oils provide a natural barrier to help protect your scalp from the hair color and can assist in making the hair color application more effective. 
&lt;br /&gt;
== Assemble Your Tools ==
Keeping all your supplies on one place will make the coloring process much more enjoyable. Your supply box should include: 
* An old button down shirt—preferably without a collar.  
* One or two old towels to catch excess color. White towels work well because they can be bleached afterwards. 
* Hair clips for sectioning your hair when you do touchups 
* A minute timer 
* Hand mirror to check for dripping color on skin 
* Vinyl or latex gloves. One pair will come in the box of color but it is always good to have extra on hand. 
* It’s good to always have two boxes of color. You never know when you'll run out of the mix, have an unexpected spill, or somehow damage the bottle. If you’re comfortable with the possibility of coloring half your head if you spill, go ahead and buy just one box! 
back to top 
&lt;br /&gt;
== Do the Deed—Color Away! ==
Read and follow all product directions on the box. The time to ask for help is before you start… and before you end up looking like Bozo the clown!  Most major hair color companies have an 800 number you can call for advice, use it!
# Before you color all over, always do a patch test and strand test according to the package instructions! The patch test checks for allergic reactions… nothing to sneeze about! The more years you use color, the more the risk. And the strand test is important because it is much easier to change your mind BEFORE you have a full head of the new color!  
# Apply 2-3 strokes of Repelle around your hairline, ears and neck to protect your skin from stains, redness and irritation, before applying the color. 
# Put on the button down shirt and the gloves to protect your clothing and skin from color stains. 
# Some products recommend you dampen your hair just before coloring. Read/follow product directions. 
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Coloring your hair all over? ===
* The first time you will want to saturate your hair with the color product. Once the hair is completely saturated with color, throw out the remainder. Excess hair color that is mixed cannot be saved.   
* Start the timer per the instructions on the box after you are finished applying the color. 
* Check for dripping color with your hand mirror and remove with one of the towels in your supply kit.   
* For experienced color users, some professionals recommend conducting mid-color strand tests starting halfway through the timing (others say “just stick with the time on the box to be safe!”). To try a mid-color strand test, remove the color from a small section of hair from the root to the end with a damp towel and dry the strand with a blow dryer. If the color needs more time, work the color back into the strand and try again in five more minutes. Repeat this process until you achieve the desired color or the time is up. 
* Shampoo and condition following the directions on the box of color. 
Just touching up hair color? A few weeks after you've colored your hair, you'll want to re-dye the roots. 
* Part hair down the center, divide the hair into four sections and clip in place. 
* Apply the color to the new growth close to the scalp (only), by taking small sections and applying the color to the hair as close to the scalp as possible. 
* Save the remaining dye for refreshing the rest of your hair. Don’t throw away your gloves! 
* To avoid over processing your ends, cover ends with conditioner to protect hair from dye. A few minutes before it’s time to rinse color out, work the dye over the rest of your hair, including the conditioned ends. This will add just enough process to refresh your overall color. Shampoo and condition following the directions on the box of color. 
&lt;br /&gt;
== Protect Your Color ==
There are things you can do between applications to keep your color beautiful.
* Do not wash hair for at least 24 hours after you color. You want the pigment in the dye to fully settle into the hair. 
* Don't wash your hair everyday if you don’t have oily hair. Washing strips color; unless you have oily hair, you should be able to skip a day. A bonus: day old hair generally holds styles better. 
* Use shampoos that are safe for color treated hair. There are several color-depositing shampoo and conditioners on the market that are good choices too.  Do not use clarifying shampoos. 
* Apply a deep conditioner once a week. Otherwise, the color will dry hair. Clairol sells its hair color conditioner in the hair color section now, separate from the box.  
* Avoid heavy protein conditioners and oil treatments after coloring. These can remove color. 
* Shampoo and condition in warm water, not hot. You can put on a shower cap and crank up the heat when you are done with your hair! 
* Avoid exposing hair to sun and chlorine. Before going out in the sun and water, wet hair with cool or warm water and apply a leave-in conditioner with sunscreen. Fill a spray bottle with one ounce of conditioner mixed with sunscreen, add water and apply as needed. Wear a hat. (And wear sunscreen!) 
* Red hair can begin to fade after your first few washings! To end up with the color you want, color it a bit redder and apply a brown glaze. The glaze will wash out in a few days, leaving you with your desired color. Or, buy a red color-enhancing shampoo and use it regularly as instructed on the package to help brighten the color. 
&lt;br /&gt;
== Hate Your Hair Color? ==
Darker than you wanted? Add a few drops of dish detergent to your shampoo before you use it and this can lift a bit of the color. Condition well afterwards because this can dry  out your hair. &lt;br /&gt;
Wrong semi-permanent color? First, shampoo a couple of times with a clarifying shampoo. These are known to strip hair of color.  &lt;br /&gt;
If that’s not enough, you can try a hot oil treatment to cause color—especially semi-permanent—to fade faster. Leave it on your hair for 15 minutes, then shampoo out. You can repeat this several times a day without damaging your hair. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==Palabrito==
In the &quot;A Few Important Words&quot; section, the table said &quot;Palabritos - Little words&quot;. But surely it'd be &quot;palabritas&quot;, since &quot;palabra&quot; ends with &quot;a&quot;? I went ahead and changed it, but I wonder if there might be a better term. - [[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] ([[User talk:Furrykef|talk]]) 08:19, 16 December 2007 (UTC)
: Yes, you're right. I make hundreds of errors, typographical and otherwise, so thank you for noticing and correcting them.

==Albañil/constructor==
My dictionaries all suggest that &quot;constructor&quot; refers to a firm, and &quot;albañil&quot; refers to a person, so I changed &quot;constructor(a)&quot; to &quot;albañil&quot;. I'm far from a native speaker, though, so I'm posting here to make sure that this is a good idea... - [[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] ([[User talk:Furrykef|talk]]) 08:19, 16 December 2007 (UTC)

The '''Eurasian smoketree''' or '''smoke tree''' (''Cotinus coggygria'', syn. ''Rhus cotinus'') is native to a large area from southern Europe, east across central Asia and the Himalaya to northern China. 

==Description==
It is a multiple-branching shrub growing to 5-7 m tall with an open, spreading, irregular habit, only rarely forming a small tree. The leaves are 3-8 cm long, rounded oval, green with a waxy glaucous sheen. The autumn colour can be strikingly varied, from peach and yellow to scarlet. The flowers are numerous, produced in large inflorescences 15-30 cm long; each flower 5-10 mm diameter, with five pale yellow petals. Most of the flowers in each inflorescence abort, elongating into yellowish-pink to pinkish-purple feathery plumes, which surround the small (2-3 mm) drupaceous fruit that develop.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
It is commonly grown as an ornamental plant, with several cultivars available. Many of these have been selected for purple foliage and flowers.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==

      <comment>/* Importing GeoSpatial Data into SQL Server */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Microsoft's 2008 release of SQL Server finally delivers Geospatial support to the SQL Server product suite.   

This allows the storage of spatial data in SQL tables (in the form of points, lines and polygons) and a set of functions to allow the manipulation of this data.  Also included are new spatial indexes to support the execution of these functions.

==Example Database==

This book will use an example database for the majority of its examples.  The code for creating this can be found in Appendix A and should be run, as per the instructions there, in order to be able use the example code throughout this book.  What follows here is a brief description of that database and the data contained within.  If you wish, then you can skip this section and get straight into the interesting stuff, working out what the database is doing as you go.

==Geospatial Data Types==

SQL Server 2008 supports two different spatial data types: GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY.

*GEOMETRY - This data type stores data in projected planar surfaces.
*GEOGRAPHY - This data type stores data in an ellipsoidal model.

The Geometry Classes define a hierarchy as follows:

[[Image:GeospatialSQLServer2008_SpatialDataTypes_Diagram.jpg]]

From the diagram we can see that there are seven types of instantiable spatial data types (in orange).  Namely:


===Point===

A point is an object representing a single location.  It always has an X and Y co-ordinate and may additionally have an elevation Z and a measure M.

===MultiPoint===

A MultiPoint object is a collection of points.  It differs from a LineString and a Polygon as there is no implied connections between the points in the collection.  Because of this the boundary of a MultiPoint object is empty.

===LineString===

A LineString is again a collection of points.  However this differs from the Multipoint object, as the points are in sequence and the LineString object also represents the line segments connecting the points.

===MultiLineString===

A MultiLineString is simply a collection of LineStrings.

===Polygon===

A Polygon is a collection of points representing a two dimensional surface.  A Polygon may consist of a exterior ring and a number of interior rings.  For a Polygon object to be a valid instance the interior rings cannot cross one another.

===MultiPolygon===

A MultiPolygon is a collection of Polygons.

===GeometryCollection===

A GeometryCollection is a collection of geometry (or geography) objects.

===Visually===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Importing GeoSpatial Data into SQL Server==

Data can be imported directly into SQL server from the following formats: WKT, WKB and GML.  For more detail of these formats please see the appendices.

===So I can't import my data from shape files?===

Currently you cannot do this directly, whether this will change in future versions remains to be seen.  If you have your data in shape files, or other formats then you will need to find a way to convert it.  There are a number of Microsoft Spatial partners who offer tools which will allow you to do this, but obviously this will involve another license fee.  Free versions I am sure will begin to appear as SQL Server 2008 releases.  Currently Morten Nielsen has such a free tool posted on his blog here [[http://www.sharpgis.net/2007/12/23/ShapefileToSqlServer2008ToWPF.aspx]] and Tillmann Eitelberg has published a SSIS shape file source under Ms-PL on CodePlex [[http://shapefilesource.codeplex.com/]]. AutoConViz (by Sugam Sharma, U Sunday Tim and Shashi Gadia) also offers the GUI based spatial format conversion (shape file format to GML) as one of its core functions[[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10095020.2012.714099#.UbSoMvm1G80]].

===Import Functions===

Importing spatial data into SQL Server 2008 is done via means of the ST&lt;i&gt;xxx&lt;/i&gt;from&lt;i&gt;yyy&lt;/i&gt; set of functions, where &lt;i&gt;xxx&lt;/i&gt; can be one of the following:

*Geom - For importing any spatial data type.
*Point - For importing point data.
*Line - For importing line data.
*Poly - For importing polygon data.


*GeomColl - For importing a Geometry Collection.
*MPoint - For importing multi point data.
*MLine - For importing multi line data.
*MPoly - For importing multi poly data.


and &lt;i&gt;yyy&lt;i&gt; can be

*Text - For importing data in WKT format.
*WKB - For importing data in WKB format.
*Gml - For importing data in GML format. (Note the case of Gml is important and this function lacks the leading ST e.g. GeomfromGml(.....))

===Example===


CREATE TABLE Districts 
( DistrictId int IDENTITY (1,1),
DistrictName nvarchar(20),
DistrictGeo geometry);
GO

CREATE TABLE Streets 
( StreetId int IDENTITY (1,1),
StreetName nvarchar(20),
StreetGeo geometry);
GO

INSERT INTO Districts (DistrictName, DistrictGeo)
VALUES ('Downtown',
geometry::STGeomFromText
('POLYGON ((0 0, 150 0, 150 150, 0 150, 0 0))', 0));

INSERT INTO Districts (DistrictName, DistrictGeo)
VALUES ('Green Park',
geometry::STGeomFromText
('POLYGON ((300 0, 150 0, 150 150, 300 150, 300 0))', 0));

INSERT INTO Districts (DistrictName, DistrictGeo)
VALUES ('Harborside',
geometry::STGeomFromText
('POLYGON ((150 0, 300 0, 300 300, 150 300, 150 0))', 0));

INSERT INTO Streets (StreetName, StreetGeo)
VALUES ('First Avenue',
geometry::STGeomFromText
('LINESTRING (100 100, 20 180, 180 180)', 0))
GO

INSERT INTO Streets (StreetName, StreetGeo)
VALUES ('Mercator Street', 
geometry::STGeomFromText
('LINESTRING (300 300, 300 150, 50 51)', 0))
GO

'''''Deutzia''''' is a genus of about 60 species of shrubs in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and central Asia (from the Himalaya east to Japan and the Philippines), and Central America and also Europe. By far the highest species diversity is in China, where 50 species occur.

==Description==
The species are shrubs ranging from 1-4 m in height. Most are deciduous, but a few subtropical species are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in panicles or corymbs; they are white in most species, sometimes pink or reddish. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds. Identification of the species is very difficult, requiring often microscopic detail of the leaf hairs and seed capsule structure.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Deutzia scabra plena.jpg|left|thumb|''Deutzia crenata'' 'Plena', a double-flowered cultivar]]
Deutzias are commonly grown as ornamental plants for their white flowers. Many cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden use, including selections with double flowers. 
For example, ''Deutzia'' x ''lemoinei'' is a hybrid of ''D. gracilis'' and ''D. parviflora''.  
Identification can be difficult, and in particular, many of the plants in cultivation sold as ''D. scabra'' are actually ''D. crenata'' (Huxley 1992). Some species are sometimes known as &quot;Pride-of-Rochester&quot; in cultivation.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

== German version ==

For the moment I'm focusing on the German version and especially on a version that can be published (through epubli.de). --[[User:Fasten|Fasten]] ([[User talk:Fasten|talk]]) 19:18, 5 January 2010 (UTC)

== Other languages ==

If somebody wants to translate to other languages here is a list of language priorities for the OLPC project:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Languages#Core_languages_for_OLPC

: See http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Parent_education_courses

== Life skills-based education? ==

http://www.unicef.org/lifeskills/index_7205.html

== Simple ==

One could &quot;translate&quot; the book to [[:simple:|Simple Wikibooks]] --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 18:55, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

== Note to potential contributors ==

The book shouldn't get too long. The use of external resources wasn't a strategy from the beginning but I think the book remains more &quot;readable&quot;,  even for pupils with a less academic background, if further information is supplied as Wikipedia articles and other resources that can be read or allow further research, but are not a part of the book themselves. Reading Wikipedia articles can be much more voluntary and interest-driven. That should, of course, not stop relevant contributions to the main book. --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 19:02, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

== German version 2.0 has been released as PDF ==

The German version 2.0 containes some passages that are not yet available in the most recent English version.
These changes are only in the PDF file and not yet in the wiki. --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 13:17, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
: The German wiki version has been updated to 2.0 (with the modifications that have been made to the German wiki previously). --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 09:51, 12 June 2011 (UTC)

== Preschool years ==

&quot;The essence of that knowledge is not complicated: learning begins at birth, and a loving, secure, stimulating environment, with time devoted to play, reading, talking and listening to infants and young children, lays down the foundations for cognitive and social skills. No government can therefore ignore the issue of what happens in the preschool years.&quot; [http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/repcard4e.pdf unicef-irc.org]</text>

== The Treaty of Waitangi ==

The modern political history of New Zealand began in 1840, when its founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, was signed between the British Crown and about 540 Maori Chiefs. The treaty officially brought New Zealand under British control.



===The English Version of the Treaty===

 
An original English version of the Treaty of Waitangi.HER MAJESTY VICTORIA Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland regarding with Her Royal Favour the Native Chiefs and Tribes of New Zealand and anxious to protect their just Rights and Property and to secure to them the enjoyment of Peace and Good Order has deemed it necessary in consequence of the great number of Her Majesty's Subjects who have already settled in New Zealand and the rapid extension of Emigration both from Europe and Australia which is still in progress to constitute and appoint a functionary properly authorised to treat with the Aborigines of New Zealand for the recognition of Her Majesty's Sovereign authority over the whole or any part of those islands – Her Majesty therefore being desirous to establish a settled form of Civil Government with a view to avert the evil consequences which must result from the absence of the necessary Laws and Institutions alike to the native population and to Her subjects has been graciously pleased to empower and to authorise me William Hobson a Captain in Her Majesty's Royal Navy Consul and Lieutenant-Governor of such parts of New Zealand as may be or hereafter shall be ceded to her Majesty to invite the confederated and independent Chiefs of New Zealand to concur in the following Articles and Conditions.

Article the first The Chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand and the separate and independent Chiefs who have not become members of the Confederation cede to Her Majesty the Queen of England absolutely and without reservation all the rights and powers of Sovereignty which the said Confederation or Individual Chiefs respectively exercise or possess, or may be supposed to exercise or to possess over their respective Territories as the sole sovereigns thereof.

Article the second Her Majesty the Queen of England confirms and guarantees to the Chiefs and Tribes of New Zealand and to the respective families and individuals thereof the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession; but the Chiefs of the United Tribes and the individual Chiefs yield to Her Majesty the exclusive right of Preemption over such lands as the proprietors thereof may be disposed to alienate at such prices as may be agreed upon between the respective Proprietors and persons appointed by Her Majesty to treat with them in that behalf.

Article the third In consideration thereof Her Majesty the Queen of England extends to the Natives of New Zealand Her royal protection and imparts to them all the Rights and Privileges of British Subjects.

- ''William Hobson, Lieutenant-Governor''.

Now therefore We the Chiefs of the Confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand being assembled in Congress at Victoria in Waitangi and We the Separate and Independent Chiefs of New Zealand claiming authority over the Tribes and Territories which are specified after our respective names, having been made fully to understand the Provisions of the foregoing Treaty, accept and enter into the same in the full spirit and meaning thereof in witness of which we have attached our signatures or marks at the places and the dates respectively specified. Done at Waitangi this Sixth day of February in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty.



===The Maori Version of the Treaty===


KO WIKITORIA te Kuini o Ingarani i tana mahara atawai ki nga Rangatira me nga Hapu o Nu Tirani i tana hiahia hoki kia tohungia ki a ratou o ratou rangatiratanga me to ratou wenua, a kia mau tonu hoki te Rongo ki a ratou me te Atanoho hoki kua wakaaro ia he mea tika kia tukua mai tetahi Rangatira – hei kai wakarite ki nga Tangata maori o Nu Tirani – kia wakaaetia e nga Rangatira Maori te Kawanatanga o te Kuini ki nga wahikatoa o te wenua nei me nga motu – na te mea hoki he tokomaha ke nga tangata o tona Iwi Kua noho ki tenei wenua, a e haere mai nei.

Na ko te Kuini e hiahia ana kia wakaritea te Kawanatanga kia kaua ai nga kino e puta mai ki te tangata Maori ki te Pakeha e noho ture kore ana.

Na kua pai te Kuini kia tukua a hau a Wiremu Hopihona he Kapitana i te Roiara Nawi hei Kawana mo nga wahi katoa o Nu Tirani e tukua aianei amua atu ki te Kuini, e mea atu ana ia ki nga Rangatira o te wakaminenga o nga hapu o Nu Tirani me era Rangatira atu enei ture ka korerotia nei.

Ko te tuatahi Ko nga Rangatira o te wakaminenga me nga Rangatira katoa hoki ki hai i uru ki taua wakaminenga ka tuku rawa atu ki te Kuini o Ingarani ake tonu atu – te Kawanatanga katoa o o ratou wenua.

Ko te tuarua Ko te Kuini o Ingarani ka wakarite ka wakaae ki nga Rangitira ki nga hapu – ki nga tangata katoa o Nu Tirani te tino rangatiratanga o o ratou wenua o ratou kainga me o ratou taonga katoa. Otiia ko nga Rangatira o te wakaminenga me nga Rangatira katoa atu ka tuku ki te Kuini te hokonga o era wahi wenua e pai ai te tangata nona te Wenua – ki te ritenga o te utu e wakaritea ai e ratou ko te kai hoko e meatia nei e te Kuini hei kai hoko mona.

Ko te tuatoro Hei wakaritenga mai hoki tenei mo te wakaaetanga ki te Kawanatanga o te Kuini – Ka tiakina e te Kuini o Ingarani nga tangata maori katoa o Nu Tirani ka tukua ki a ratou nga tikanga katoa rite tahi ki ana mea ki nga tangata o Ingarani.

- ''William Hobson, Consul and Lieutenant-Governor''.

Na ko matou ko nga Rangatira o te Wakaminenga o nga hapu o Nu Tirani ka huihui nei ki Waitangi ko matou hoki ko nga Rangatira o Nu Tirani ka kite nei i te ritenga o enei kupu, ka tangohia ka wakaaetia katoatia e matou, koia ka tohungia ai o matou ingoa o matou tohu.

Ka meatia tenei ki Waitangi i te ono o nga ra o Pepueri i te tau kotahi mano, e waru rau e wa te kau o to tatou Ariki.



===A Literal Translation of the Maori Text===


Here's Victoria, Queen of England, in her gracious remembrance towards the chiefs and tribes of New Zealand, and in her desire that the chieftainships and their lands should be secured to them and that obedience also should be held by them, and the peaceful state also; has considered it as a just thing, to send here some chief to be a person to arrange with the native men of New Zealand, that the Governorship of the Queen may be assented to by the native chiefs in all places of the land, and of the islands. Because too many together are the men of her tribe who have sat down in this land and are coming hither.

Now it is the Queen who desires that the Governorship may be arranged that evils may not come to the native men, to the white who dwells lawless. There! Now the Queen has been good that I should be sent, William Hobson, a captain of the Royal Navy, a Governor for all the places in New Zealand that are yielded now or hereafter to the Queen. She says to the Chiefs of the Assemblage (Confederation) of the tribes of New Zealand, and other chiefs besides, these laws which shall be spoken now.

Here's the first: Here's the chief of the Assemblage, and all the chiefs also who have not joined the Assemblage mentioned, cede to the utmost to the Queen of England for ever continually to the utmost the whole Governorship of their lands.

Here's the second: Here's the Queen of England arranges and confirms to the chiefs, to all the men of New Zealand the entire chieftainship of their lands, their villages, and all their property.

But here's the chiefs of the Assemblage, and all the chiefs besides, yield to the Queen the buying of those places of land where the man whose land it is shall be good to the arrangement of the payment which the buyer shall arrange to them, who is told by the Queen to buy for her.

Here's the third: This, too, is an arrangement in return for the assent of the Governorship of the Queen. The Queen of England will protect all the native men of New Zealand. She yields to them all the rights, one and the same as her doings to the men of England.

- ''William Hobson, Consul and Lieutenant-Governor''.

Now here's we: Here's the chiefs of the Assemblage of the tribes of New Zealand who are congregated at Waitangi. Here's we too. Here's the chiefs of New Zealand, who see the meaning of these words, we accept, we entirely agree to all. Truly we do mark our names and marks.

This is done at Waitangi on the six of the days of February, in the year one thousand eight hundred and four tens of our Lord.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a standard chapter in most calculus texts.  It has been suggested that this topic be merged into the calculus textbook, and this is a completely reasonable suggestion.  What does one have to do to achieve this? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scott.norris|Scott.norris]] ([[User talk:Scott.norris|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scott.norris|contribs]]) 16 December 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Agree with you &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:114.142.136.242|114.142.136.242]] ([[User talk:114.142.136.242|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/114.142.136.242|contribs]]) 26 September 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

It appears that the calculus book already has a section on trig substitution. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Calculus/Integration_techniques/Trigonometric_Substitution] Thus, someone needs to see if this book has any material that is not in the Calculus book. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Rmbzz|Rmbzz]] ([[User talk:Rmbzz|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rmbzz|contribs]]) 15:35, 5 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Agreed. The idea of having an entire book on this technique is ridiculous. It must be scavenged for anything useful to add to the proper chapter in the calculus book and then deleted. [[User:Jaimeastorga2000|Jaimeastorga2000]] ([[User talk:Jaimeastorga2000|talk]]) 04:04, 25 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

== A Note to Authors ==

== Overview ==

'''''Confringo''''' is a spell or curse used to make things explode.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is making his escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']] during the fourth chapter (The Seven Potters) of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the side car that has been bolted on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] flying motorbike, in which Harry is riding, breaks away due to the strain of flight. Harry is rescued by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], but then uses this spell to destroy the abandoned side car, disabling one of the attacking Death Eaters with the fragments.

This spell is used again in the battle with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]]; here, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] casts it, and it ricochets around the room before hitting something it can blow up. Hermione later identifies it as the Blasting Curse.

== Analysis ==

This is similar in effect to a differently-named spell used in some fan fiction; one may wonder whether the name was chosen specifically to avoid similarity to the name in the fan fiction. It also appears similar in effect to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expulso|Expulso]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deprimo|Deprimo]] spells.

type=Magical Device|

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Decoy Detonators''''' are products of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. They are small devices which scurry off into shadows and then make a noise, thus decoying people away.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see Decoy Detonators when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr.]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins']] new joke shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. Fred, giving Harry the tour of the shop, takes him into the back room where the more serious magical items are kept, and there shows him the Decoy Detonators, saying they can't keep them on the shelves.

When the Trio are planning to break into the Ministry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Decoy Detonators are one of the things on Hermione's list. Harry then uses one of them to distract a room full of witches and wizards so that he can enter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]]'s office undetected. The Detonator scuttles silently to the far side of the room, then blows itself up, making a sharp noise and a cloud of smoke. The witches and wizards examine it for a long time, finally deciding that it is an escapee from the department of Experimental Charms.

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

While we do appreciate your work in the Muggles' Guide, there are several points that are a concern:
*Deleting questions. Some questions are easy, yes; those are more review questions, for the less advanced reader. Note that I have re-instated your deletions in DH chapter 4 and changed the subheads; instead of deleting, in future please set up subheadings.
*Deleting blocks of text, and changing things to be incorrect. In the DH overview, you said not six Horcruxes, but seven. Had you forgotten that the Horcrux in Nagini had not yet been created? And you deleted the block of text about Dudley for no reason I could see.
*Framework. We have a standard framework for each type of article (chapter summary, magical item, place, et cetera); check the project standards [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|here]].
*Fanfic. This is a book about the Harry Potter series, fan fiction has very little place in it.

Finally, it would be useful if you would select a user ID so that we would know who was doing the editing. Without a user name, what gets recorded is an IP address, and IP addresses will change over time.

Thank you very kindly, and good luck! [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:17, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}Research psychology encompasses the study of behavior for use in academic settings, and contains numerous areas. It contains the areas of abnormal psychology, biological psychology, cognitive psychology, comparative psychology, developmental psychology, personality psychology, social psychology and others. All branches of psychology can have a research component to them. Research psychology is contrasted with applied psychology.

Research in psychology is conducted in broad accord with the standards of the scientific method, encompassing both qualitative ethological and quantitative statistical modalities to generate and evaluate explanatory hypotheses with regard to psychological phenomena. Where research ethics and the state of development in a given research domain permits, investigation may be pursued by experimental protocols. Psychology tends to be eclectic, drawing on scientific knowledge from other fields to help explain and understand psychological phenomena. Qualitative psychological research utilizes a broad spectrum of observational methods, including action research, ethography, exploratory statistics, structured interviews, and participant observation, to enable the gathering of rich information unattainable by classical experimentation. Research in humanistic psychology is more typically pursued by ethnographic, historical, and historiographic methods.

The testing of different aspects of psychological function is a significant area of contemporary psychology. Psychometric and statistical methods predominate, including various well-known standardized tests as well as those created ad hoc as the situation or experiment requires.

Academic psychologists may focus purely on research and psychological theory, aiming to further psychological understanding in a particular area, while other psychologists may work in applied psychology to deploy such knowledge for immediate and practical benefit. However, these approaches are not mutually exclusive and most psychologists will be involved in both researching and applying psychology at some point during their career. Clinical psychology, among many of the various disciplines of psychology, aims at developing in practicing psychologists knowledge of and experience with research and experimental methods which they will continue to build up as well as employ as they treat individuals with psychological issues or use psychology to help others.

When an area of interest requires specific training and specialist knowledge, especially in applied areas, psychological associations normally establish a governing body to manage training requirements. Similarly, requirements may be laid down for university degrees in psychology, so that students acquire an adequate knowledge in a number of areas. Additionally, areas of practical psychology, where psychologists offer treatment to others, may require that psychologists be licensed by government regulatory bodies as well.

Quantitative psychology involves the application of statistical analysis to psychological research, and the development of novel statistical approaches for measuring and explaining human behavior. It is a young field (only recently have Ph.D. programs in quantitative psychology been formed), and it is loosely comprised of the subfields psychometrics and mathematical psychology.

Psychometrics is the field of psychology concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement, which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, interests, achievement in particular degree or course, and personality traits (Carl Dellomos, 2009). Measurement of these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated knowledge in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena. Psychometric research typically involves two major research tasks, namely: (i) the construction of instruments and procedures for measurement; and (ii) the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement.

&lt;center&gt;[[Introduction_to_Psychology|Back to Table of Contents]]&lt;/center&gt;

Psychology is a science, to be approached as such.
Experiments should be designed using the scientific method.

There are several research methods that psychologists employ:

== Approaches in Psychology Research==
===Nomothetic (Quantitative Approach)===
This approach basically used inferential and descriptive statistics as both mediums of scientific method of investigation in analyzing, presenting, and interpretation of data gathered by the researcher through standardized or objective instruments (e.g. psychological Tests). The term “nomothetic” comes from the Greek word “nomos” meaning “law”. Psychologists who adopt this approach are mainly concerned with studying what we share with others. That is to say in establishing laws or generalisations. (Carl Dellomos, 2009)

===Idiographic (Qualitative Approach)===
This approach tends not to use inferential or descriptive statistics, but rather uses qualitative methods of data gathering such as interviews, diaries, and other written materials, obtained from or provided by the expected or anticipated respondents of a particular research. The term “idiographic” comes from the Greek word “idios” meaning “own” or “private”. Psychologists interested in this aspect of experience seek to discover what makes each of us unique. Despite the importance of our genetic individuality, proceeding from biology, the distinction between the nomothetic and the idiographic is often equated with two types of science — the natural sciences concerned with discovering laws of nature, and the social sciences concerned with individual meanings. We can examine these differences further by seeing how they relate to personality theory.(Carl Dellomos, 2009)

Both approaches were introduced by Gordon Allport. (Carl Dellomos, 2009)

== Research Designs ==
Although there are many different kinds of research designs in psychology, studies may be categorized into descriptive or qualitative, correlational, and experimental.  The method of data collection also varies, with self-report on one end of the spectrum, and naturalistic observation on the other.

===Descriptive Studies===
Studies that do not test specific relationships between variables are called descriptive studies.  In this research method, general or specific behaviors or attributes are observed and measured, without respect to each other.  These studies are generally the design of choice for breaking into new areas, as the vast but often inconclusive amount of information collected can be drawn upon for future hypotheses.

An example of such a study would be a researcher inquiring into the quality of mental health institutions.  This would be done by observation or measurements of various criteria, as opposed to relationships between variables.  Alternatively, the study could be conducted without any specific criteria in mind.

===Correlational Study===
This method of statistical analysis shows the relationship between two variables. For example, research has shown that alcohol dependence correlates with depression. That is to say, the more alcohol people consume, the more depressed they become. On the other hand, it could be the other way around as well: the more depressed people become, the more likely they are to consume alcohol. 

The attributes of correlations include strength and direction.  The direction may be positive (both variables both increase or decrease together), negative (one variable increases while the other decreases) or unrelated (a random relationship between variables).  The strength of a correlation ranges from -1 to +1 with a 0 reflecting no relationship between variables. A correlational study serves only to describe/predict behavior and not to explain it. This is so because a third variable could be shown to cause the occurrence of one of the variables. Furthermore, only experiments can prove causation.

===Experiments===

Experiments are generally the studies that are the most precise and have the most weight to them due to their conclusive power.  They are particularly effective in proving hypotheses about cause and effect relationships between variables.  A hypothesis is a prediction of how one variable relates to another.  There are two types of hypotheses, ''null'' and ''directional''.  The null is a prediction that there will not be any change in the dependent variable when the researcher changes the independent variable.  The directional hypothesis states that the change in the independent variable will induce a change in the dependent variable.  In a true experiment, all variables are held constant except for the independent variable, which is manipulated.  Thus, any changes in the experimental groups can be solely attributed to the action of the independent variable.  This is called being ''objective''.

For instance, in an experiment to test whether music improves people's memories, we would have a sheet of paper with ten unrelated words on it for people to memorize.
The control group would have no music playing in the background while the experimental group would have some music in the background.
Because as researchers we have adhered to the scientific method and held all variables as constant as possible, if the experimental group does report better recollection of words, then we could assume that the music had an effect on memory. 
However, we must be certain to do our best to ensure that any controllable differences between the two groups are eliminated in order to ensure that no confounding variable interferes with the experiment.

There are two main ways to pick, or ''sample'' the subjects in an experiment, ''random'' and ''stratified''.  In a random sampling each person has an equal chance at being picked.  This means that if 90% of the population being sampled from are Christian then 90% of the sample will be Christian.  If the researcher wanted all religions represented equally he would employ stratified sampling.  For instance, the experiment could be performed only on women, or on mixed groups with equal numbers of each sex in them, to eliminate the possibility of biased results from one gender having better average memory than the other.

Steps must be taken to make sure that there is no ''experimenter bias''.  Two common forms of bias are ''demand characteristics'' and ''expectancy effects.''  If a researcher expects certain results from an experiment and influences the subjects response this is called demand characteristics.  If the experimenter inadvertently interprets the information to be as expected in his hypothesis it is called expectancy effect.  To counteract experimenter bias the subjects can be kept uninformed on the intentions of the experiment, which is called single blind.  If the people collecting the information and the subjects giving it are kept uninformed then it is called a double blind experiment.

The experiment should also be reported so that other researchers can ''repeat'' it.  If an experiment isn't repeatable it will not hold much weight in the scientific community.  To help an experiment be repeatable the researcher should have the variables be measureable, this is called being ''empirical''.

Whether researching humans or animals the experiment should be ethical.  When humans are the subjects they should be ''informed'' of what the study is, ''consent'' to being in it, be ''debriefed'' afterwards, and their information should also be kept ''confidential''.

===Naturalistic Observation===
Researchers study organisms in their natural environments or habitats without trying to manipulate or control anything.
In this method, the researcher observes the behavior under study in its natural setting while attempting to avoid influencing or controlling it. The observations are done in a naturalistic setting without any preparation or participation of the researcher. Therefore, the behavior is observed in public places, streets, homes, and schools.  Observing people from other cultures response in the same setting is a way to provide information for ''cross-cultural research''.

===Self Report===
This method includes ''tests'', ''questionnaires'', and ''interviews''.  All of which do the same thing, give the subject a stimuli, i.e. the question, and get a response.  The advantage of using these is the ability to inexpensively and rapidly collect vast amounts of data.  This allows a psychologist to compare one person, or a group of peoples results to thousands of others.  The disadvantage is that they are not always telling what the subject's response is but what the subject says is the response.

==Information Display==

===Statistics===
Once the information is gathered it has to be put into some kind of form, usually numerical.  ''Statistics'' deals with the collection,  analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numerical data.  The goal of statistics is to summarize the data and let ''descriptions'' or ''[[wikt:inference|inferences]] be made''.  Inferences are used when making predictions of the relationships of variables.  Descriptions are concise displays, using ''statistical symbols'',of the information in ''frequency distributions, measures of central tendency'', or ''measures of variability''.

====Statistical Symbols====
There are agreed upon standard symbols used in statistical displays.  These symbols can be used by themselves or in equations.

N = number of scores

X = score (or scores)

M = mean

d = difference of a score from the mean

Σ = sum of

D = difference in rank

r or ρ = correlation

SD = standard deviation

====Frequency Distribution====
A frequency distribution is obtained by taking the score and splitting them into subgroups.  The subgroups are then put on either a histogram (bar graph) or a frequency polygram (line graph).  When a frequency distribution has most of the scores on one side of the graph it is considered skewed.  If it has most of the scores in the middle with equal amounts on both sides it is considered symmetrical.

====Measures of Central Tendency====
In measures of central tendency there is one number that is used to represent a group of numbers.  This number is either the [[w:Mean#Arithmetic_mean|mean]], [[w:Median|median]], or the [[w:Mode_%28statistics%29|mode]].

====Measures of Variability====
Variability is concerned with the dispersement of the scores, called ''variability'' i.e. are the scores clustered together or spread out.  ''Range'' and ''standard deviation'' are the measures most commonly used.  To find the range just subtract the number of the lowest score from the number of the highest score.  This can be deceiving if most of the scores are bunched together and one of the scores is very far away from it.  In this case standard deviation must be used.  A formula commonly used for standard deviation is SD = the square root of Σd²/N.

===Case Studies===
In the course of treating a patient a psychologist will take records of problems, insights, and techniques that were important in the patients treatment.  A ''clinical case history'' may be drawn upon by researchers to expose a factor that is important for understanding a behavior.

==Basic Concepts==
* a. independent variable = variable that one manipulates in order to see if it has any effect on the dependent variable (eg. in the example above, the independent variable would be music and its effect on memory)
* b. dependent variable = variable that depends on the effect of the independent variable (eg. in the example above, the dependent variable would be memory and better recollection of words)
* c. double-blind procedure = procedure in which neither the researcher nor the subjects know which group (experimental or control) the subjects are in in order to minimize experimenter cues.
* d. single-blind procedure = procedure in which only the researcher knows which group which kind of subject is in.
* e. experimenter cues - subtle and often unintentional cues that the experimenter makes which implies which group which kind of subject is in. for example, if an experimenter believes that music does indeed improve memory, some cues would be the experimenter's smiling/winking at the experimental group. This smile/wink would imply to the subjects in the experimental group that the researcher is secretly implying that they're in the experimental group.
* f. placebo effect - a treatment works because of the patient's belief that it works and not because it actually does.
* g. experimenter - the person who is researching through the participant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Can we know how genes govern a living organism, by principle?  ==

Can we determine systematically how genes build, and govern a living organism precisly, by principle? 
In other words, is it possible to determine what gene or genes need to be modified, inorder the change ONE and only one feature of the organizum? It may not be possible to change only one feature. We can change a feature, but it may change some other features at the same time. 

By manipulate my genes, can I make only my right ear bigger, without changing anything else? I mean by principle. I know we can not do that now, but is it possible at all?

We were built from the bottom up, gradually, from a single cell. So the top down approach may not be possible.
Let say we want to design a new animal from scratch. I don't think the top down approach will work easily, may not be possible at all. There is no separate &quot;ear&quot; gene, for say.

So creating a new organizum needs to start from an existing one with try and error, or we could simulate evolution in a computer, starting with a single cell, manipulate only the environment, and perform some other &quot;miracles&quot; for them to help them to evolve what we want.... This is science fiction now, but the end product of the simulation would be the set of genes that we need to create the new organizum. ...

Common names for this species include the '''Wild Strawberry''', '''European Strawberry''' and '''Alpine Strawberry''', the latter usually in reference to the cultivated varieties of the subspecies Fragaria vesca 'Semperflorens'. 

Like all strawberries, it is in the family Rosaceae; its fruit is more technically known as an accessory fruit, in that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries (achenes) but from the peg at the bottom of the bowl-shaped hypanthium that holds the ovaries.

==Description==
[[Image:Fragaria_vesca_close-up_3.jpg|left|thumb|150px|]]

==Growing Conditions==
Typical habitat is along trails and roadsides, embankments, hillsides, stone and gravel laid paths and roads, meadows, young woodlands, sparse forest , woodland edges and clearings. Often plants can be found where they do not get sufficient light to form fruit. Spread fast by runners and can form dense mats. The fruit are eaten and the achenes in this way spread by numerous mammals and birds.

==Uses==

The Woodland Strawberry was widely cultivated in Europe before being largely replaced by the Garden Strawberry (''[[../Fragaria x ananassa/]]''), which have much larger fruit and showed greater variaton, making them better suited for further breeding. Woodland Strawberry fruit is strongly flavored, and is still collected and grown for domestic use and on a small scale commercially as a gourmet offering and as an ingredient for commercial jam, sauces, liqueurs, cosmetics and alternative medecine. In Turkey several 100 tons of wild fruit are harvested  annually, mainly for export.&lt;ref&gt;Chronica Horticulturae Vol.47 Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the cultivated varieties are by botanists usually set to the subspecie Fragaria vesca 'Semperflorens' and they are usually called Alpine Strawberries. They have in common that they rarely form runners instead they form multiple crowns in a cluster, fruits over a very long timeperiod and are usually propagated by seeds or division of the plants. Some cultivars have fruit that are white, or yellow when fully ripe, in addition to the normal red. Plants tend to lose vigour after a few years. Cultivars that form stolons are often used as groundcover, while cultivars that do not may be used as border plants. Some cultivars are bred for their ornamental value.

Used as an indicator plant for diseases that affect the garden strawberry.

Used as a genetic model plant for garden strawberry and the Rosaceae familiy in general, due to
*It`s very small genome size
*Short reproductive cycle, 14–15 weeks in clima controlled greenhouses.
*Being easily propagated

''F. vesca'' is sometimes used as an herbal medicine; an herbal tea made from the leaves, stems, and flowers is believed to aid in the treatment of diarrhea.

[[Image:Waldmeister.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of flowers]]
'''Woodruff''' (''Galium odoratum'') is a herbaceous perennial plant in the family Rubiaceae, native to Europe, western Asia and north Africa. It grows to 30-50 cm long, often lying flat on the ground or supported by other plants. The plant is also known in English as Sweet Woodruff or Wild Baby's Breath. &quot;Master of the woods&quot; is probably a translation of the German name Waldmeister. Names like &quot;Sweetscented bedstraw&quot;, &quot;Cudweed&quot; and &quot;Ladies' Bedstraw&quot; should be avoided; the former two properly refer to ''[[../Galium triflorum/]]'', the latter to ''[[../Galium verum/]]''.

The leaves are simple, lanceolate, glabrous, 2-5 cm long, and borne in whorls of 6-9. The small (4-7 mm diameter) flowers are produced in cymes, each white with four petals joined together at the base. The seeds are 2-4 mm diameter, produced singly, and each seed is covered in tiny hooked bristles which help disperse the seed by sticking temporarily to clothing and animal fur.

This plant prefers partial to full shade in moist, rich soils. In dry summers it needs frequent irrigation. Propagation is by crown division, separation of the rooted stems, or digging up of the barely submerged perimeter stolons.

== Uses ==
[[Image:Illustration Galium odorata0.jpg|thumb|left|Woodruff &amp;ndash; from Thomé, ''Flora von Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz'' 1885]]
''Galium odoratum'' is a strongly scented plant, the sweet scent being derived from coumarin. This scent increases on wilting and then persists on drying, and woodruff is used in pot-pourri and as a moth deterrent. It is also used, mainly in Germany, to flavour May wine (called &quot;Maiwein&quot; or &quot;Maibowle&quot; in German), beer (Berliner Weisse), brandy, sausages, jelly, jam, a soft drink (Tarchun), and a herbal tea with gentle sedative properties.

High doses can cause headaches, and very high doses (far beyond those found in the aforementioned drinks) can even have mind-altering properties, as well as causing vertigo, somnolence or even central paralysis and apnoea while in a coma; so, some common sense should be applied when consuming woodruff. Since the 1980s, woodruff may no longer be used as an ingredient of industrially produced drinks and foodstuffs in Germany; it has been replaced by artificial aromas and colorings. However, the plant itself remains on sale and is also widely collected from the wild for private use. Using up to three grams of woodruff per litre of May wine is considered safe, as long as the drink is consumed no more than a few weeks per year.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, my name is KVDP and I have been active at Wiki(Cook)Books since 2007.
My main focus lies on foods linked with environmental topics. At the moment, I am trying to blend Indian cooking with veganism (something which can fairly easily be done; take a look at my contributions). In addition, I will also try to include more information about switching to a Caloric Intake Restriction Diet and regular veganism (both in the intrest of allowing environmental advantage and increased health benefits). Finally, implementing this information would not only allow the individual to switch to a more environmental way of eating, but it would also be helpful for one of my pending projects which involves a more imbedded approach for becoming environmentally friendlier.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Slough student

Thanks for reading the BTEC National Applied Science wikibook. You seem to have problems following links - both the ones you said 'dont work' actually are fine - and also if you find out about ISBN numbers then you'll find how useful they can be.

If you have anything positive to add, feel free. If not, stick to reading.

'''''Geranium maculatum''''', the '''Spotted Geranium''', '''Wood Geranium''', or '''Wild Geranium''' is a woodland perennial plant native to eastern North America, from southern Manitoba and southwestern Quebec south to Alabama and west to Oklahoma and South Dakota.&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?314414 ''Geranium maculatum'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bf&gt;BorealForest: [http://www.borealforest.org/world/herbs_shrubs/wild_geranium.htm ''Geranium maculatum'']&lt;/ref&gt; It grows in dry to moist woods and is normally abundant when found.

[[Image:G.maculatum.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers in late spring.]]
It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 60 cm tall, producing upright usually unbranched stems and flowers in spring to early summer. The leaves are palmately lobed with five or seven deeply cut lobes, 10–12.5 cm broad, with a petiole up to 30 cm long arising from the rootstock. They are deeply parted into three or five divisions, each of which is again cleft and toothed. The flowers are 2.5–4 cm diameter, with five rose-purple, pale or violet-purple (rarely white) petals and ten stamens; they appear from April to June in loose clusters of two to five at the top of the stems. The fruit capsule, which springs open when ripe, consists of five cells each containing one seed joined to a long beak-like column 2-3 cm long (resembling a crane's bill) produced from the center of the old flower. The rhizome is long, and 5 to 10 cm thick, with numerous branches. The rhizomes are covered with scars, showing the remains of stems of previous years growth. When dry it has a somewhat purplish color internally. Plants go dormant in early summer after seed is ripe and dispersed.&lt;ref name=bf/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp&gt;Missouriplants: [http://www.missouriplants.com/Blueopp/Geranium_maculatum_page.html ''Geranium maculatum'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gleason&gt;Gleason, H. A. (1952). ''The New Britton and Brown Illustrated Flora of the Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada'', Vol. 2, page 457. Hafner Press, New York. 63-16478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant has been used in herbal medicine, and is also grown as a garden plant.&lt;ref name=pfaf&gt;Plants for a Future: [http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Geranium+maculatum ''Geranium maculatum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ilex crenata''''' ('''Japanese Holly''' or '''Box-leaved Holly''' (Japanese: イヌツゲ inutsuge) is an evergreen shrub native to eastern China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin.&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?19691 ''Ilex crenata'']&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Holly is grown as an ornamental plant for its dense evergreen foliage. It is superficially similar in appearance to box (''Buxus''), and is often used in similar situations; it can readily be distinguished from box by its alternate, not opposite, leaf arrangement. 

==Description==
It is an evergreen shrub or small tree growing to a height of 3-5 m (rarely 10 m) tall, with a trunk diameter up to 20 cm. The leaves are glossy dark green, small, 10-30 mm long and 10-17 mm broad, with a crenate margin, sometimes spiny. The flowers are dioecious, white, four-lobed. The fruit is a black drupe 5 mm diameter, containing four seeds. It grows well in acidic soil, between a pH of 3.7 and 6.0.&lt;ref name=oht&gt;Osaka hundred trees: [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/osaka/100ju/Inutuge.htm ''Ilex crenata''] (in Japanese; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/osaka/100ju/Inutuge.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osu&gt;Okayama Science University: [http://had0.big.ous.ac.jp/~hada/plantsdic/angiospermae/dicotyledoneae/choripetalae/aquifoliaceae/inutsuge/inutsuge.htm ''Ilex crenata''] (in Japanese; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://had0.big.ous.ac.jp/~hada/plantsdic/angiospermae/dicotyledoneae/choripetalae/aquifoliaceae/inutsuge/inutsuge.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation===
[[Image:Parterre2.jpg|thumb|left|''Ilex crenata'' edging [[../Parterre|parterre]] beds in an English garden]]

==Growing Conditions==
Grows best in part shade, but tolerates both deep shade (where it will have a looser habit) and full sun (though it can be susceptible to [[../Tetranychus urticae|spider mites]] if in an exposed location). Like most hollies it prefers a deep, humus-rich, well-drained soil. 

==Varieties==
Numerous cultivars have been selected, including plants with the leaves variegated (e.g. 'Golden Gem', 'Shiro-Fukurin'), dark green (e.g. 'Green Lustre'), or greyish-green (e.g. 'Bad Zwischenahn'); with yellow fruit (e.g. 'Ivory Hall'); and with the habit erect (e.g. 'Chesapeake'), spreading (e.g. 'Green Island', 'Hetzii'), or dwarf (e.g. 'Mariesii', 'Stokes').&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;

==Uses==
Often grown as hedges or topiaries.

==Maintenance==
Tolerates severe pruning and even coppicing. 

==Propagation==
Cultivars generally propagated through cuttings.

==Pests and Diseases==
See ''[[../Ilex/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus.

*{{del}} Appears to be an original conlang, that is completely unverifiable. Violates NOR, at the very least. However, I make two caveats: First, this ''might'' be suitable for inclusion at Wikiversity, if I am properly understanding the goals of the book. Second, the other contributors from [[User:Fasten]] should not necessarily be suspect. The [[Mentoring Handbook]] for instance, is a perfectly suitable subject for a book, although if there are problems with NOR or the like, we could certainly nominate it for cleanup. If the mentoring book makes extensive use of this pilingual language, those parts may need to be removed or rewritten to use information which is verifiable and non-original. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:03, 10 December 2007 (UTC)
:: If I write a book on C++ and I publish my own example programs would you see that as original research?

{{comment}} Just a heads-up, this book is currently being mirrored at [[User:Fasten/Pilingual Primer]] and [[User:Laleena/Workshop]]. I don't know what, if anything, we should do about this. I'm sending messages to these two users to let them know that it's not really acceptable to circumvent VfD by hosting deleted pages in their userspace (although curiously, I can't find mention of it anywhere in policy, like i thought there was). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:13, 17 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ed_Chron}}
This [[w:Chronology|chronology]] of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]] [[w:History|history]] was derived principally from the ''Nonenmacher Papers'' compliled around [[w:1990|1990]] by Bob and Berni Nonenmacher.  The statements are quoted directly from the sources and should not be taken as absolute fact.  Where discrepancies are obvious to the editors, corrections have been noted in square brackets.  Feel free to add to these corrections, but of course, please don't change the original quotes.  Additional quotes are also welcome.

==A Quarter Millenium of Papers==
A collection of quotes and information derived from papers of various individuals, legal documents, maps, ledgers, and letters preserved in the Edmeston Museum.  Arranged in chronological order, they may answer some questions concerning the History of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston]] while raising others.

==Historic and geographic background==
This [[w:Edmeston, New York|locality]] was within the bounds of the [[w:Oneida tribe|Oneida Nation]] and along the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]] ([[w:Treaty of Fort Stanwix|Fort Stanwix Line]]) and was the undisputed land of the [[w:Native Americans|red man]] until [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1770|1770]]. — The surface of this land was an elevated [[w:upland|upland]] broken by numerous [[w:valley|valley]]s.  The highest [[w:elevation|elevation]]s were about 400 feet [''120 m''] above the Unadilla River. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''

[''The elevation of the town actually varies by about 800 feet (240 m): from just under 1100 feet (335 m) above sea level at the Unadilla River, to just over 1900 feet (580 m)] near [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]] and [[w:Summit Lake|Summit Lake]].'']
----
Years before any white [[w:settler|settlers]] had entered the [[w:Unadilla Valley|Unadilla Valley]], the Oneida Indians, one of the five nations of the [[w:Iroquois|Iroquois]], roamed its forests.  Since fish were plentiful in the streams and deer and other game in the forests, the Oneida Indians considered this valley one of their best hunting and fishing grounds. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Susan Hickling|Susan Hickling]]''
----
When [[w:Europeans|white men]] first came into the [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego]] region, the territory now covered by the county belonged to the [[w:Mohawk tribe|Mohawk Indians]].  [''Maps show the western edge of Otsego county, including Edmeston, as being in the [[w:Oneida tribe|Oneida]] Nation.'']  As early as [[w:1704|1704]] the Mohawks began to convey their lands to white men and in [[w:1736|1736]] this trend first affected the present [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]].  By [[w:1761|1761]], 150,000 acres [''607 km²''] had been thus transferred and a small settlement had been in existence at [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] for two decades.  With the concession of [[w:Canada|Canada]] to [[w:England|England]] in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1760s#1763|1763]], everyone in [[w:New York|New York]] was safe from the [[w:France|French]].  The [[w:frontier|frontier]] line could soon move to the &quot;Line of Property&quot;, set at the [[w:Treaty of Fort Stanwix|Ft. Stanwix treaty]] in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1760s#1768|1768]] to separate the area of white and Indian occupation.  This line, so far as it need be traced here, ran from the [[w:confluence|confluence]] of the Canada and Wood Creeks to the source of the west branch of the Unadilla River, the whole length of the stream, then overland to the north-east corner of [[w:Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]].  Almost at once the remaining Otsego lands were almost entirely taken up and [[w:settlement|settlements]] were begun on them in a dozen or more places.  Local government facilities nearer at hand than [[w:Albany, New York|Albany]] were now needed.

In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1772|1772]] [[w:Tryon County|Tryon County]] was erected, named for the [[w:colonial|colonial]] [[w:governor|governor]] at the time [''[[w:William Tryon|William Tryon]]''] and taking from Albany all its territory west of a point on the [[w:Mohawk River|Mohawk River]] that is now the southeast corner of [[w:Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]].  This  was followed twelve days later by a division of the new county into [[w:district|districts]] (corresponding to the present [[w:Town|Towns]]).

In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1775|1775]] Tryon County was formed. [''it was actually formed in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1772|1772]] as noted above'']  This was destined to be the last act ever to take effect in New York under [[w:Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] rule.  Sixteen days [''3 years''] later, [[w:April 19|April 19]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1775|1775]], came the [[w:Battle of Lexington and Concord|Battle of Lexington and Concord]].  In [[w:May|May]] a [[w:Provincial Congress|Provincial Congress]] took over the functions of the [[w:government|government]] for the [[w:revolutionary|revolutionaries]].

The boundaries of [[w:Old English District|Old English District]] began at the headwaters of [[w:Otsego Lake|Otsego Lake]], ran westward along the north line of the [[w:Otsego, New York|Otsego Patent]], continued to the Unadilla so as to include The [[w:William Edmeston|Edmeston]] [[w:Land Patent|Patent]]s.  Soon after the [[w:Revolution]] was won, more changes were made.  [[w:William Tryon|Governor Tryon]] had led hostile forces and Tryon county was renamed [[w:Montgomery County|Montgomery County]] in honor of an American General.  In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1780s#1788|1788]], the legislature redefined the subdivisions and established several new ones, but now a term &quot;towns&quot; was adopted. As obnoxious a reminder as ''Tryon'', ''Old English District'' became [[w:Otsego, New York|''Otsego Town'']].

[[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]] was erected [[History of Edmeston, New York/1790s#1791|February 16, 1791]] with [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] as its [[w:County seat|county seat]].  In its first form it was much larger than it is now. Revisions were frequently made, the latest being in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1850s#1854|1854]], leaving the County divided into 24 [[w:Town|townships]].  The County covers 648,320 acres [''2,623 km²''], so in area it ranks 17th among [''62''] counties.

Water courses served very well for exploratory trips, also for freight if continuous to a destination, but household goods and other merchandise had also to be sent far inland.  Land [[w:prospector|prospectors]] cut rough roads to their tracts to assist settlers, but federal authorities required better ones before approving [[w:postal service|postal service]].  For many years the interior regions were not developed to build proper roads by local labor or through property taxation, so &quot;great state roads&quot; were constructed with funds raised by [[w:Lottery|lotteries]] approved by the [[w:legislature|legislature]].  One of these extended from [[w:Catskill, New York|Catskill]] far to the west of the state touching [[w:Unadilla, New York|Unadilla]].  Other [[w:stagecoach|stage mail]] routes, connecting important points, were laid out by the county [[w:highway|highway]] [[w:commissioner|commissioner]]s.  These also came to be called &quot;great roads&quot; and there were several in this county.  Soon [[w:Toll roads|toll turnpikes]], built by incorporated stock companies, provided a better way.  Two of the most important of these served the county.  Both were in operation soon after [[w:1800|1800]].  The [[w:Catskill and Susquehanna Turnpike]] linked the [[w:Hudson River|Hudson]] with [[w:Unadilla, New York|Wattles' Ferry]] at Unadilla (by [[w:1844|1844]] this route was changed to come to [[w:Oneonta New York|Oneonta]] and by this time many of the turnpikes had become public roads).  The [[w:Great Western Turnpike|Great Western Turnpike]] was built piecemeal in many sections.  The first ran from [[w:Albany, New York|Albany]] to [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]], the second on through [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] and on to [[w:Sherburne, New York|Sherburne]] via the present route 80, the third from Cherry Valley to [[w:Cazenovia, New York|Cazenovia]] via the present [[w:U.S. Highway 20|route 20]].  Throughout the first half of the nineteenth  century stage lines were the chief carrying agents in carrying passengers, mail and express in this locality.

When the ambitious projects for the state's extensive [[w:canal|canal]] system were under consideration, Otsego county made a strong bid for the use of the [[w:Mohawk River|Mohawk]]&amp;ndash;[[w:Otsego Lake|Otsego Lake]]&amp;ndash;[[w:Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] route as part, but was finally by-passed and all of the former main objectives were reached by several extensions of the canal.  The [[w:Erie Canal|Erie Canal]] was of tremendous importance to New York's [[w:commerce|commerce]] and to farmers near its route, but long brought ruinous competition from the western states to such more remote regions as Otsego County.

[[w:Steam engine|Steam engines]] could go on [[w:rail|rail]]s where [[w:canal boat|canal boat]]s could not.  They could also operate throughout the year, a privilege denied to the canals.  [[w:Railroad|Railroad]] construction began in the [[w:1830s|1830's]] and just about [''a few decades later?''] the [[w:American Civil War|Civil War]] period reached this county.  Local steam roads were built and operated at first by comparatively small companies which later consolidated with major organizations. The [[w:Ontario &amp; Western|Ontario &amp; Western]] and the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla Valley]] ran close to the Western boundary, a spur of each reaching [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston]], [[w:West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]] and [[w:South Edmeston, New York|South Edmeston]], all now defunct.

During the [[w:20th century|twentieth Century]] we have been living in the [[w:gasoline|gasoline]] and [[w:rubber|rubber]] [[w:era|era]].  Its vehicles, like the [[w:automobile|automobile]], the [[w:bus|bus]], the moving [[w:van|van]] and the [[w:airplane|airplane]], are too familiar to need mention, but additions to this story can be foreseen as the [[w:atomic age|atomic age]] matures. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Roy L. Butterfield|Roy L. Butterfield]]''

'''The history of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]]: 1780 through 1789'''

==[[w:1780|1780]]==
In the [[w:1780s|1780's]] the &quot;Otsego Country&quot; was the Far West and an eagerly sought goal.  The great land patents, most of whose acres had stood as idle land since the acquisition fifteen, twenty or more years before, were now cut in farm-sized lots and soon rented or sold.

There was demonstrated an astounding rate of increase, and this was to be duplicated in many localities as the Western movement rolled on.  Otsego was the first New York County to experience it, also the first to feel the effects of its restless onward flow.  The [[History of Edmeston, New York/1830s|1830]] total was Otsego's highest population. The reasons are many and clear, but the one pertinent to this article is that Americans have always been on the move.  In the northern United States until [[History of Edmeston, New York/1790s|1790]] they were dammed up at the Line of Property along which lies Otsego's western boundary and the region became actually over-populated for an agricultural area.  With that obstacle removed, local families joined in the general western [[w:Hijra (Islam)|hegira]].  As Otsego men moved out, their places were often taken by more [[w:New England|New Englanders]], but the outflow exceeded the intake. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Roy Butterfield'']]

==[[w:1783|1783]]==
[[w:Percifer Carr|Carr]] finally returned to [[w:Edmeston, New York|Mount Edmeston]] in 1783, and according to tradition, found one of his horses still grazing in the woods.  [[w:William Edmeston|Colonel Edmeston]] had returned to British service and was stationed at [[w:Gibraltar]], but he directed the rebuilding of the settlement with energy and interest.  In [[#1788|1788]] Captain [[w:Robert Edmeston|Robert Edmeston]] came to America and promptly quarreled with Carr.  The faithful agent was discharged and spent his old age in poverty.

But while [[w:Percifer Carr|Carr]] and the Edmestons were on the ins, Parcifor wrote his bosses a series of letters, today treasured in the archives of the [[w:New York State Historical Association|New York State Historical Association]], [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]]. These form a fascinating revelation not only of the personalities of William and Parcifor Carr, but of the ways of settling a new land.

Edmeston was a man evidently schooled in the Roman and Greek classics that were the stock training for a gentleman of his day.  His knowledge of agricultural practices seems to have been gleaned largely from Virgil and other noblest Romans.  Carr often had a hard time persuading his distant boss to modify those practices in the Otsego County Hills.

Occasionally, though, Edmeston showed the shrewdness that had enabled him to rise in the world and to get hold of the land originally.  One time when he sent out a batch of new settlers, he instructed Carr to allot them farms in scattered spots with Edmeston land in between, that the new settlers might be the ones to build the roads, not the Edmestons.

They were a shrewd and sturdy breed, these men who tackled the wilderness and made it blossom. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Cunningham|''Mary E. Cunningham'']]
----
Upon Colonel Edmeston's death, the estate fell to the heirs residing in England, Since no title could be established from them for many years, the settlement of this part of the town [''the Edmeston patent''] was, for a time retarded. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hickling|''Susan Hickling'']]

''How did anyone find this remote section of New York State?''

After the terrible [[w:Cherry Valley Massacre|Cherry Valley Massacre]] in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1778|1778]], [[w:George Washington|General Washington]] organized a [[w:Sullivan Expedition|great campaign]] against the Indian villages of the hostile tribes in New York State. This march made Central New York and its beautiful country better known.  &quot;The soldiers gave such glowing descriptions of the country that as soon as the war closed, throngs of settlers began pouring in to the new western country.&quot;  [[w:Edmeston Centre|Edmeston Centre]] was a promising place to choose land because the [[w:town|town]]ship consisted of hills and valleys; the soil varied &amp;mdash; most being moist and excellent grassland.  The timber was [[w:deciduous|deciduous]], as [[w:maple|maple]], [[w:beech|beech]], [[w:Ash tree|ash]], [[w:basswood|basswood]], [[w:elm|elm]] etc., with groves of [[w:pine|pine]].  The [[w:Wharton Creek|Wharton Creek]] and [[w:Mill Creek|Mill Creek]] join near the center of the [[w:village|village]] [''[[w:hamlet (place)|hamlet]], it was and still is unincorporated'']; The [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]] edges the township.  There was a valuable quarry of building stone in Edmeston's southeast corner. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]
----
The first settlers of numerous [[w:Otsego|Otsego]] Towns preferred to locate on the hills instead of establishing their homes on the [[w:alluvial|alluvial]] [[w:bottomland|bottomland]]s.  One reason was less danger to crops from [[w:frost|frost]] on these higher grounds;  and again, the hills being covered with [[w:hardwood|hardwood]] [[w:timber|timber]], like  beech, maple, and ash, were easily cleared and the wood more quickly and effectually burned up, and gotten out of the way of the first crop, than was possible with the base growth of the hemlock and pines encumbering the low ground.

Another reason influencing the settlers in their preference for elevated ground was the local [[w:Ashery|asheries]] paying prices which materially increased current revenue for the first few years; and again, there was less danger from [[w:malaria]] than was the case on the low lands adjacent to the larger water courses.  So for quite a number of years following the coming of the first settlers after the Revolution, according to an assertion once made by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Elder Stephen Taylor]], the hill lands on the Edmeston Patents brought materially the higher prices in all sales made in that section. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Huntington Papers'']]

[[w:George Croghan|Crogan's]] 100,000 acre [''400 km²''] tract, later [[w:William Cooper|Cooper's]] comprised all of what was subsequently the town of [[w:New Lisbon, New York|New Lisbon]], an eastern part of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston]], most of [[w:Burlington, New York|Burlington]], an eastern part of [[w:Exeter, New York|Exeter]], and much of [[w:Otsego, New York|Otsego Township]] [''town'']. — Gazetteer of New York and — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Huntington Papers'']]

Often times Indians would be seen going along the trails that later became town highways on their way to Moss Hook, now West Burlington, to get supplies.  The story is told that the old Indian was returning with a jug one day from Moss Hook.  He was in a rather intoxicated condition.  When he attempted to climb a fence, the jug fell over the cork came out and the contents gurgled out upon the ground.  The old Indian tried to get to it, but in vain.  He leaned against the fence and said in despair, &quot;I know you say 'good, good, good' but I can't get to you!&quot; — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Janet Dockstader'']]
----
The northeast part of Edmeston was settled very early.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Elder Stephen Taylor]] came in 1783 and settled on what is called Taylor Hill.  Joseph Talbot, Elisha Johnson, Richmond Talbot, Timothy Taylor, Daniel Greene, and others come soon afterwards, and settled in the neighborhood of what is called Wright's Corners. There was a strip through on the east side next to Burlington, settled early by families from Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut and Massachusetts. [''This &quot;strip&quot; would be that portion of the Town East of the patent to the West line of Burlington.'']  Joseph Rudd was a very prominent man in town.  Benjamin Milks, Zenos Ashley, David Angell, Benjamin Hoag, Chad Burges, the Wilcoxes, Robert Rosher, Henry Randall, all from Rhode Island.  Thomas Slocum settled on the farm called the Beamos farm, just north of the fair ground, built a pot ash and pearling oven and made potash and pearlash for a number of years.  He had 12 leaches 30 bushels each, His oven would pearl 150m pounds at a batch.  he built his potash plant on the bank of a brook, so that he might get rid of the leached ashes, not knowing they were worth anything.  After being leached he had to carry it along to Albany, overland.  So we did everything we had to sell.  Sometimes in the early settlement they went to Fort Plain.  I have heard them say that they had carried rye and corn to Fort Plain and sold it for 44 cents per basket, and traded one half out at the store. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''James Slocum'']]

Scarcity was repeatedly felt by all during the first years of settlement, more especially by the families of the farmers, living beyond the village; and it is well known that the poor missionary family suffered severely in this way, on more than one occasion. There were those at hand however, always ready to offer relief, where privation was known. The most severe trial of this kind occurred during the season still remembered as &quot;'''''[[w:1789|the starving time]],'''''&quot; in the traditions of the country, and which fell upon the whole region, for many miles beyond the lake shores. It was at an early day when the green fields were yet very few, when there were no roads through the forest, and no mills to grind the little corn among the stores of the colonists. The hamlet [''[[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]]''] was then literally in the heart of a wilderness, and the number of newly arrived emigrants increasing beyond the amount of food within reach, something approaching to actual [[w:famine]] was felt in many a cabin. Families accustomed to abundance, in the homes they had left farther eastward, were now pining for the want of daily bread, the poor hungry children feeding on the scrapings of the iron pots in which their [[w:sapaen]] had been prepared. In this emergency, the leader of the little colony [''[[w:William Cooper (judge)|Judge Cooper]]''] exerted himself to the utmost; grain was purchased at a distance, brought up the [[w:Mohawk River|Mohawk]] in boats, thence on pack horses through the forest, from [[w:Canajoharie (town), New York|Canajoharie]] and [[w:Fort Plain, New York|Fort Plain]], out dealt and liberally to the people. Most happily shoals of [[w:herring]] came up the [[w:Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]], from the [[w:Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]], at the same moment, filling the lake so abundantly, that they were actually dipped out of the water, by the bucketful. Salt was sent for in great quantities, and the fish were cured, and carried into the cabins of the people, scattered through the neighboring woods. The pigeons also came in large flocks, and after a period of great distress for some weeks, plenty was once more restored to the half famished people. &amp;mdash; ''[[Author:James Fenimore Cooper|James Fenimore Cooper]]: Introduction to [[The Pioneers]], 1823''

In order to present clearly the early status of schools, some background should be given.  The first state constitution, adopted during the [[American Revolution|revolution]], made no reference to education.  The [[w:Board of Regents|Board of Regents]], established in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1780s#1784|1784]], had control only of academies and colleges and so began at the top &amp;mdash; or wrong end &amp;mdash; of the educational ladder.  Elementary education was left to parents and churches.  In 1795, for the first time, public appropriations were made for common schools (maintenance locally was a option).  Not until 1812 were schools obligatory.  Jedadiah Peck, of Burlington who was a legislator had valiantly sought this goal a decade or more earlier, was chairman of the commission which framed this measure.

Yankee Otsego parents did not wait for the compliance of law.  As soon as a half dozen families were settled within a reasonable distances a school sprang up. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Roy Butterfield|Roy Butterfield]]''

[''Diaries, town minutes and Taylor Hill Church records show schools already in existence in Edmeston when the official boundaries were defined for the purpose of conforming to the new education statute.'']

==[[w:1813|1813]]==
Soon after the first settlements were made, some of the &quot;pioneers&quot; began to raise sheep, and of course, to wear woolen in the winter, at first without dressing, then women would card it by hand and spin and weave it, and make it into frocks and pantaloons. But after a while there was a carding and jutting mill started where people got their wool made into rolls, when the women spun and wove it.  Sometimes the women would have spinning bees. They would put rolls among their neighbors and on a certain day they would all bring in their yarn and at night the boys would come with their fiddles for a dance.  I tell you the girl that could not spin had no business there.

When they had their cloth dressed at the mill, they had it cut by a tailor.  There was a Frenchman by name of '''Marquesee''', a tailor, that used to come to '''Mr. Southworth's''' tavern and do the cutting for them, and then there were sewing women that went around and made it up.  Misses '''Polly Munsell''', '''Betsy Gage''' and '''Rosetta Evans''' used to go together; and when the sewing women came and the school master, we must have nut cakes, and sweet cake, and a loaf of Indian bread baked in the big baking kettle — a deep kettle with a tight fitting cover with a rim all around the top.  This they set in the coals and piled coals on top,  and a johnny cake baked on a board before the fire.  At this time we had plenty of balogna sausages, and the school master would carry a section with some nutcakes to school for his dinner.

We had but three districts in town then, and the children had to go a great ways for what schooling they got, and through the woods at that.  In winter we had spelling schools every Saturday night and would hitch up the oxen and sled and pile in all the boys and girls in the neighborhood; then there was fun.  We chose sides and spelled down. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James Slocum|James Slocum]]''

In the survey of roads mention was made of the school on the road that ran past '''Timothy Taylor''' and '''Tucker''' homes on the corner where Taylor Hill Church was.

A copy of the School Districts in the Town of Edmeston laid out by the Commissioners of Common Schools in the month of May 1813 viz&amp;mdash;

:''And be it further enacted that the Commissioners of Common Schools be authorized and they are hereby authorized to take and receive a conveyance of a lot of land of Mr. Edmeston which he the said Edmeston proffers to the town of Edmeston for the use of Common Schools.''

On May 26, 1815, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Chapin/Chapen|Daniel Chapin]] alegedly stole a horse and saddle from [[w:James Fenimore Cooper|James Fenimore Cooper]]'s stable in Cooperstown.  He was arrested but hit the deputy in the face with a stick and escaped.  On June 22, after a manhunt, he was retaken and placed in the Cooperstown jail.  He almost succeeded in escaping from there by pulling up a plank and tunneling out.  In August, he was convicted and sentenced to 7 years hard labor in the state prison.

'''Dr. Halsey Spencer''', who settled on the turnpike between the centre and West Burlington in 1816 and was supervisor from 1835- 37, was  a member of the Assembly in 1828 and Sherriff in 1838. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''
----
About this time, '''Dr. Halsey Spencer''' came into town.  he rode all over these woods on horseback, and one night he got lost.  It being very dark, he gave up trying to find his way out, and putting the old mare's bridle over his arm, he lay down by the side of a big log and slept till morning.

'''Lyman White''' and '''Deacon Joseph Moss''' built a store and potash at '''Wright's Corners''', and '''Avery Tracy''' was their first Clerk.  There was quite a settlement there at that time.  '''Israel Taylor''' bought them out, and afterwards sold to '''Avery Park''', of Burlington, who built a tavern and store on the corners.  He, I think, sold to ''Hiram Wright''.  the Wrights, and Hopkins were the most prominent men in the settlement of that part of town.

Another pioneer physician and prominent citizen was '''Dr. Halsey Spencer'''. He settled on the turnpike between Edmeston and West Burlington where he lived until his death in 1870. He was an honored and influential citizen of the county and held office as member of the Assembly, supervisor and sheriff.  His son, '''Dr. William M. Spencer''', was the first physician residing in Edmeston Centre, as this village (hamlet) was then called.  He built and occupied the house at the corner of Gates Ave. and East St. &amp;mdash; ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|Myrta Kelsey]]''

In 1818 [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|William Stickney]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Samuel Simmons]] built a forge and triphammer for the manufacture of axes, rifle barrels, scythes and wrought iron plow shares.

A carding and fulling mill, a long needed industry was erected here in 1818 on the site of Cards Garage [''Tim’s in 1992''], where there was water power from Mill Creek.  It was built by a man named Stearns who sold it in 1820 to Joseph Bootman. &amp;mdash; ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|Myrta Kelsey]]''</text>

[[w:Percifer Carr|Parsifor Carr]] died in 1840 and was buried at the Tunnicliffs.   Prosser lived on the Carr farm after the death of Carr.  He cleared up a large section of the wilderness and cut down many large trees on the land, rolled them in heaped and burned them.  Mr. Prosser saw silverware roll out of some logs while they were burning.  Another story connected with Prosser was the capturing of a bear cub and the mothers persuit. The cub was afterward given its freedom and would shake apples in the old orchard but would never go near any sour apple tree.  Floyd Shawlers grandmother worked for Carr at times. — Ethel Edwards
About 1840 my husband bought a little over three acres of land on the corner and built what is known today as the Gaskin House [1992, Corner where the Cental National Bank now stands].  &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Preston|''Esther Preston'']]

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Thomas Southworth]] was born in Mansfield, Conn., in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1790s#1729|1792]] and died in Edmeston, N.Y.,in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1860s#1869|1869]].  As a baby he went with his father to Edmeston, where, like his father, Joseph, he was a farmer and also ran the roadside inn on the farm.  It was in 1890, when the family of Rev. Joseph moved temporarily to the farm, that a barrelhead inscribed in burned-in letters &quot;Thomas Southworth, Inn&quot; was found.  He was also a shoe maker. Since the father of Ellen Mary Southworth, Denzil Robinson, was a shoemaker too, and was contemporary with Thomas, the family in later years tied two baby wooden shoe lasts together with ribbons and hung them up as a coat of arms. Just prior to the Mexican War of 1848, Thomas learned that a local troop of horsemen was to be formed, to be sent to Mexico.  He mortgaged the farm heavily to raise money to buy great quantities of leather, and hired a force of men to make boots for the troopers.  Too late he learned that the troop was not to be formed, leaving him with all the accumulated boots.  It took many years of manual labor for him, and of teaching school for two of his sons, to pay off the debt.  This made a lasting impression on his two sons, William and the Rev. Joseph.

Thomas was in the [[w:War of 1812|War of 1812]] and in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1850s#1859|1859]] he was issued a certificate for $40.00 plus accrued interest for his expenses in the war.  He was extremely reluctant to make this claim because his services were patriotic and not for monetary gain.  His son Joseph states that one time when Thomas was busy in his tavern that a British soldier came in  and loudly commenced to boast to patrons &quot;what they would do to these damned Yankees&quot;.  This infuriated Thomas, who threw him bodily out of the door.  [''History tells us that there were numbers of Tories in that vicinity.'']

Scenes in the tavern and (other local occurrences), where even ministers were prone to stop en route for a glass of whisky in those days, and what he saw of too much drinking with its dire consequences, had a lifelong influence on Thomas' son, the '''Rev. Joseph''', in his long fight for temperance.  &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Southworth|''Southworth'']]

The [[Universalist]] Church was the first church organized in [[Edmeston Centre]].  This took place Nov. 23, 1843, with thirty nine members.  The church building was erected the year following its organization at a cost of about $2500.  The first officiating pastor was '''Rev. Z.Cook'''. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Jones|''Hazel L. Jones'']]

[[Methodist Episcopal Church]] was organized. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]

==[[w:1845|1845]]==
Around 1845 [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Talbot|Isaac Talbot]] taught in the '''Edmeston Centre school''' and boarded around.  He had from 60-80 pupils in his charge.  One winter day, when the snow had drifted so deeply that Mr. Talbot was the only one who was able to walk to school, '''Col. Eri Deming''' hitched up his ox team and brought the pupils to school.  At this time the curriculum was chiefly comprised of the three R&quot;s The text books used were: ''Dableaux Arithmetics'', the ''Columbia Speller'', ''Hale’s United States History'' and the old ''English Reader''. This school building was later moved to the further end of south Street and used as a dwelling [a questionable quote]. — ''Hazel L. Jones''

==[[w:1846|1846]]==
The Second Baptist Church was organized at Edmeston Centre May 30, 1846 and was recognized by council June 11, 1846.The first meeting house was erected of wood in 1853.  It cost about $2500, was 34 by 48 feet in size and had a fine toned bell.  Prior  to this time religious services had been held in schoolhouses and in the Universalist house. The house was begun in May 1853 and was dedicated in November 1853. — ''Hazel l. Jones''

==[[w:1848|1848]]==
In 1848 '''North street''' was laid out.  Mrs. Maria Davis told me that she well remembered going to the home of Truman White before North Street was laid out.  T. White lived where Chester Houk now lives.  To reach that place she had to go up west Street and then past Mr. Andersons and McManus', and she returned home by way of High Street to the village (hamlet).   Before South Street was laid out, a road led from East Street across the Wharton near the old mill, south to near '''Adin Deming's''' home. The remains of the road can be plainly seen through the pasture [1992 no longer clear]. — ''Myrta Kelsey''
----
In 1848 '''North street''' was laid out.  This provided a flat street along Mill Creek, for expansion;  East and West Streets were comparatively hilly.  On this street five years later, a Baptist Church was built to join a school and schoolmasters house. — ''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty''
----
In 1848 '''North Street''' was opened.  '''Truman White''' built and owned the first house on this street. — ''Hazel L. Jones''</text>

All these brave, hardy, adventurous, fearless, industrious pioneers endured many hardships and sacrifices while clearing the land and paving the way for our comfortable homes today. For a long time I have felt there is one important thing that should be done.  The least we might do would we to see that all the old cemeteries where these brave pioneers ar buried, are put, and keep, in good order.  That project has been carried through by many Women's Clubs.  They deserve at least that memorial.  &quot;Royal blood is an inheritance.  Noble blood, if it begets noble deed, is a blessing.  But above and beyond all, is the inheritance of a pious, God-fearing, God serving ancestry.&quot; — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

==[[w:1879|1879]]==
According to old records in and old account book of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Page|Thomas A. Page]] who resided in the Goodrich district, Edmeston, H.W. Stowe was making boots in New Berlin on December 16, 1879, for Mr. Page.  For one pair of boots Mr. Page delivered 115 lbs. of beef and .40 cents in cash.  The boots were valued at $5.00.

On November 24, 1879, Mr. Page bought of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ellis|Adicus Ellis]], Number 1 double harness and 2 halters for $30 for which he paid cash.  On April 28, 1879 Mr. Page sold S.E. Olin 20 qts. of top onion sets for 60 cents net.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Beers|Granville G. Beers]] was proprietor of the Central Hotel in New Berlin on January 7, 1878, for Mr. Page sold him 113 pounds of beef at 5 cents per pound.  On September 11, 1880, Mr. Page took home from the shops of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Hooker|Hiram C. Hooker]] in South Edmeston, one carriage, for which he paid $160, and on September 8, 1880, he purchased of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Humphrey|William Humphrey]] in Edmeston one single Harness for $25 which must have been worn by &quot;old dobbin&quot; to draw the new carriage.

On a balance sheet of January 1,1875, he lists as assets $900 value in M.R.R. bonds; (this must have been the old Midland [''Railroad''], before it became the N.Y.O.&amp;W.R.R. [''New York Ontario and Western'']) My grandmother, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Pope|Mrs. Samuel P. Pope]], held $4000 value of these &quot;gold bearing bonds&quot; which returned to her just the memory of their purchase.  I wonder if Mr. Page got out from under them before the bankruptcy sale of the Midland.

April 13, 1874, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Dupee|William Dupee]] sold Mr. Page one butter tub for 60 cents.  William Dupee lived on the road from South Edmeston to Edmeston, near where you turned off to go to the Goodrich schoolhouse.

On April 16, 1874, Mr. Page entered a charge against [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Hinds|Reubin Hinds]] for sharpening 1547 hop poles at ½ cent each; total $7.74.  Do you want a job like that boys?

The prices Mr. Page received for milk taken to a cheese factory in 1878 are as follows; May, .65; June .62 ½ ; July, .61 7/8 ; August, . .67 ½ ; September, .76 ¼ per cwt. And that year his farm paid him a good net profit.  But on the other hand, while he worked early and late, and enjoyed the best the land offered of food and happiness with his growing family, he bought no auto, tractor, gasoline, tires, driver or car license, or insurance, nor paid any hospital bills to have some of his family patched up, or morticians expense, to bury some of his loved ones destroyed by such conveyances.  He lived on a back dirt road, he traveled a dirt road and paid no tax to lay concrete highways for pleasure to pursue, or commerce to use to usurp the carriers who had paid to maintain their own right-of-way and road beds and also contributed taxes to the communities which they served.  There was no appeal to Washington for relief or bonus of any kind.  Us children whom he taught in the several “little red school houses” have come as near filling our niches in life with success and happiness and will revere his life and efforts with as much sincerity, as will the pupils of the large school edifices now being erected.  It is not how much you have but how you enjoy what you get.

'''The history of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]]: [[w:1900|1900]] through [[w:1999|1999]]'''

==[[w:1900|1900]]==
'''PUCKER STREET:''' Who can tell what gave rise to the bestowal of this name to this hamlet?  Where is Pucker street?  Well, sixty years ago when a lad ten years old was making trips with his parents from the [[History of Edmeston, New York/Schools#District 5 &amp;mdash; Goodrich School|Goodrich school district]] to [[w:Burlington Flats, New York|Burlington Flats]] to visit his Grandparents he traveled this street under cloudless, balmy skies and through winter's blustry winds and high piled snows.

When the old bobtailed brown mare topped the hill out of Edmeston, N.Y., where the journey was about one half done, she would bravely strike into a trot through Pucker Street, down to the home of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#R|Denzil Robinson]], where they turned into the road that led to Burlington Flats.

Pucker street was a very well kept and quite populous stretch of [[road]], through fertile lands.  The name of this street made an impression upon this lad's mind that even now brings clearly to his mental vision this bit of [[highway]].

The first residence on the right hand of Pucker Street when leaving Edmeston, was the rather imposing home of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#N|William Northrup]].  Among  those who resided on this street, there is now recalled the names of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#K|Daniel Kelsey]],  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Mary Comstock]], an old maiden lady, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#O|Barty O'Brian]], a caretaker for Mary Comstock, and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|John Sawyer]] had had a mill in the village [w:hamlet (place)|hamlet] of Edmeston where he produced [[w:barrel|barrel]] [[w:stave|staves]] and manufactured [[w:cherry|cherry]] [[w:wood|wood]] [[w:level|levels]] for [[w:carpenter|carpenters']] and [[w:mason|masons']] use.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|James F. Pope]] resided for some time on this street, while he employed his time as [[tin]] and [[lead]] worker and also made trips about the country, mending household utensils, repairing clocks and purveying novelties, notions, etc., which he made, and flavoring essences of his own compounding.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Wesley Harrington]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|Martin Merrit]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Rube Talbot]] were residents, as well as [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|U. D. Payne]], who lived near the cemetery that was established there about that time and which has now grown to be what [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Eddie Guest]] calls one of ''&quot;God's Great Slumber Groves.&quot;''  I think if not the first, that among the first to be laid at rest in this beautifully located and well kept cemetery was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Joseph Talbot]].

At one time, near the home of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Talbot|John Talbot]] was a [[cheese]] factory, where several times I was given [[curd]] to eat before they were pressed into cheese, which at that age, I prized as a great delicacy.  Later it was occupied as a [[cider]] mill but now stands idle.

John Talbot resided in a large well built house at the entrance to the fair grounds, where the '''&quot;Peet Hook&quot;''' fairs were held for many years, with large attendance.  The east side of these grounds was bounded by the highway that turned off to take the traveler to Taylor Hill.

Beyond, lived [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Wheeler|Henry Wheeler]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Prisco|John Prisco]], a great fox hunter, who had a son killed in the world war.  Pucker Street also had a school house located on it, which is now used for other purposes.

When we got down near the bridge, where crossing of the [[Wharton Creek]] was made to enter '''&quot;Burlington Hook,&quot;''' now called [[West Burlington]], we found the home of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Parker|Otis Parker]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|John Taylor's]] [[carding mill]], where wool was formed into rolls about the size of your finger, which the ladies would spin into yarn.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Anderson|Fortesque Anderson]] had a mill near here, where was made from hard [[maple]] wood the best designed and finished butter ladles the world has ever known.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Pierson|Robert Pierson]], who has helped refresh our memory, was a workman in this factory.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Robinson|Denzil Robinson]], who lived on the farm where the road branches off which you may take to Burlington Flats, was one of the pioneer settlers and resided there until his death.  His son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Robinson|Jared Robinson]], conducted this farm from his father's death until he died, when it came into possession of Jared's son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Robinson|Floyd]], who established a nursery for trees, shrubs and fruits, on it fertile acres; since floyd's death until now, it has been conducted by his widow and son.

The old brown mare in her bondage, made her way through the mud, dust and snows to Burlington Flats over this road, which now is laid down with concrete ands improved for the accommodation of motor driven vehicles.  The radiator of the old brown mare never froze up and the only cranking that was done, was to sing out, ''ged-dap''. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Edmeston Local|''Edmeston Local'']]

The following was derived from '''''Otsego county New York Geographical and Historical.''''' Edwin F Bacon, Ph D. 1902 [[w:Oneonta, New York|Oneonta N.Y.]]:

:'''''EDMESTON.''''' Area 27,075 acres [''110&amp;nbsp;km²'']. Population 1,767.

:Edmeston was formed from the town of Burlington in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1800s#1808|1808]]. The surface is an elevated [[w:upland (geology)|upland]], broken by numerous valleys. The highest elevations are about 400 feet above the Unadilla river which forms its western boundary. 

:The [[w:town|township]] takes its name from Col. [[w:William Edmeston|Edmeston]], an officer in the [[w:French and Indian War|old French war]] (1754-1763), who for his services received from the crown a tract of 110,000 acres along the Unadilla river. To this tract Col. Edmeston sent [[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]], a faithful old soldier of his command, who remained here until carried away with his family captive by the Indians, but after the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] he returned.

:In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1810s#1818|1818]] William Stickney and Samuel Simons built a forge and trip hammer for the manufacture of axes, rifle barrels, scythes, and wrought iron plow shares.
 
:The first physician was Dr. Gaines Smith, who came with his family from Vermont in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1800s#1800|1800]]. His grandson, Hon. David B. St.John became a resident of the town in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1820|1820]].

He bought the [[horseless carriage]] (a [[w:Locomobile|Locomobile]] [[w:Steam car|Steamer]]) and had it shipped by freight to Edmeston.

==[[1905]]==
In 1905 the second Edmeston flood occurred.  There was no loss of life but damage was determined to be in excess of $100,000. — barns were thrown off their foundations and knocked apart — debris pelted the Opera House — the railroad bridge was washed away and several rods of track uplifted.  All communication — both rail and stage — was cut off.  A gully was carved across the road in front of the Opera House so large that a bridge had to be built.  Many dams were washed out north of the village [editor’s note: hamlet] and their positions are evident today (circa 1960). &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]</text>

:In the Hollywood Dance Hall in Yong-dungpo (a suburb of [[w:Seoul|Seoul]]) last week, Sergeant John A. Wallace Jr. of Edmeston, N.Y., celebrated his 22nd birthday. Deciding to do well by himself and his friends, he hired the place, laid out a feast of roast beef, baked ham, potato salad, beer, whisky and champagne. While a six-piece native orchestra struggled manfully with U.S. dance music, G.I.s contentedly swung kisaeng girls (Korean equivalent of Japan's geishas) around the floor.

The '''Second [[w:Baptist|Batptist]]''' church was organized in Edmeston Centre, May 30, and recognized by council June 11, 1846. Its first officers were L. B. Gregory, deacon, and Stanton Tefft, clerk. Rev. Justus H. Wells are the first pastor. Its constituent members were Silas Coats, Stanton Tefft, Perry Pope, L. B. Gregory, D. O. Church, nelson Greene, Stephen Card, Harvey Pasco, with sisters Coats, Tefft, Pope, Gregory, Card, Caleb Perkins and Sarah, his wife, Sally Brown, Emeline Potter, Hannah Spafford, Freelove Kennedy and two or three others, making twenty-one or twenty-two in all. 

The first and only meeting-house was erected of wood in 1853. It cost about $2500, and is 34 by 48 feet in size, and has a tower and fine-toned bell. Previous to this time, religious services were held in school-houses and at the Universalist house. The house was begun in May, 1853, and was dedicated to the worship of Almighty God in November, 1853. Its present deacons are S. A. Coats, J. T. Richards, and c. W. Hopkins; Eli Chamberlain is church clerk. The Rev. Lawson Muzzy was chosen pastor in April, 1874, and still continues to fill that office. Rev. J. H. Wells served the church as pastor nearly five years; Rev. Hewett Fitch, nine years; Rev. J. C. Foster, two years; Rev. S. N. Westcott, four years; Rev. G. H. Hogeboom, two years; Rev. G. E. Flint, three years; Rev. J. H. Chamberlain, one year. The present membership is one hundred and thirty. 

This church has been blessed with an unusual degree of peace and harmony, and has for the most of the time enjoyed a good degree of prosperity. Three of its number has been called of God, as we believe, to preach the gospel to the perishing. The Rev. J. D. Pope is worthily serving the Master in St. John, Nova Scotia; his brother, Rev. D. B. Pope, is a faithful pastor in this State, and the third brother, John Greene, is pursuing his preparatory studies in the theological seminary at Hamilton. 

The meeting-house was built during the pastorate of Rev. H. Fitch, who served the church acceptably and faithfully. The most remarkable and extended revival known in the congregation, or in this town, was enjoyed in the winter and spring of 1875, under the labors of their present pastor, Rev. l. Muzzy. Meetings wre continued daily for three months, and were characterized by unusual solemnity, and striking exhibitions of divine power and grace. Over one hundred were hopefully converted. Some fifty were added to the church during that year. Their Sunday-school is a present as well organized and as prosperous as any school in the county.

===Universalist church=== 
The [[w:Unitarian Universalism|Universalist]] church of Edmeston was organized At Edmeston Centre, Nov. 25, 1843, with thirty-nine members. Rec. Z. Cook was the first officiating pastor. The church building was erected in the year following the organization, at a cost of about $2500. Only occasional services are now held.

===Free Methodist church=== 
The [[w:Methodist church|Free Methodist church]] of Edmeston was organized April 17, 1871, by William Southworth. The following were the first trustees: Artemus Welch, Wilbur F. Walling, Ezra Wheeler, Daniel Colegrove, Stephen Winsor, Warren Colegrove, and Darling Stephens. The name of the first minister was William Southworth. The names of the first members were Daniel Colegrove, D. Colegrove, Wilbur Walling, Lorenda Walling, Esther Preston, Mary York, Phoebe Hopkins, Paulina Mitchell, Ezra Wheeler, Darling Stephens, Rhoda Stephens, David Walling, Esther Babcock, Stephen Winsor, Henrietta Winsor, Warren Colegrove, Mary Colegrove, S. S. Webber. The first church building was erected in 1871, at a cost of $1000. The present trustees are Daniel Colegrove, Albert Denison, and Warren Colegrove.

Of the first settlement in town, authentic data of the precise date are wanting. It was made, however, on the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]], during the interval between the close of the [[w:French and Indian War|French War]], in 1763, and the commencement of that of the [[w:American Revolution|Revolution]], in [[w:1775|1775]], by [[w:William Edmeston|Col. Edmeston]], an officer of the French War, and [[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]], a faithful soldier who had served under him.

At the close of the war, Col. Edmeston, for his military services, received the grant of a tract of land covering a large portion of the town on which he made the first settlement. At his death the lands fell to heirs and minor children residing in [[w:England|England]], from whom no safe title could be obtained for many years, &amp;mdash; which greatly retarded the settlement of the town. During the Revolution, the hired men of Mr. Carr were killed while at work, his barn burned, his property destroyed, and himself and family were taken prisoners by the British and Indians and detained to the close of the war. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Gazetteer of the State of New York|''Gazetteer of the State of New York'']]

[[w:William Edmeston|William Edmeston]] served in [[w:Colonial America|America]] as a [[w:Captain|captian]] of the [[w:United Kingdom|British]] 48th [[w:Regiment|Regiment]] during the [[w:French and Indian War|French and Indian War]], ([[w:1754|1754]]-[[w:1763|1763]]), the [[w:George III of the United Kingdom|King]], by proclamation, bestowed land upon his loyal [[w:soldier|soldier]]s as a kind of a bonus. The amount of land given varied with the rank of the soldier and ranged from 50 to 5,000 [[w:acre|acres]].  Both William Edmeston and his brother, [[w:Robert Edmeston|Robert Edmeston]], a [[w:lieutenant|lieutenant]] in the same regiment, received the [[w:mandamus|mandamus]] of the king in council in [[w:1765|1765]] entitling each of them to 5,000 acres.

As a usual thing, the soldiers sold their claims to land [[w:speculator|speculators]] for a few [[w:shilling|shillings]] on the [[w:pound|pound]], but the Edmestons determined to develop theirs.  They first tried to locate their tracts in eastern New York among the river Indians or in the [[w:New Hampshire Grants|New Hampshire grants]] but finally had their claims laid out and surveyed in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1770|1770]], just to the East of the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]] and West of [[w:George Croghan (1720-1782)|George Croghan's]] [[w:Land patent|Patent]].

But they came to understand the warning of [[w:John Watts|John Watts]] not to settle in these places lest ''&quot;one take your scalp, the other your estate in law suits.&quot;''

The Edmestons finally had their claims laid out and surveyed in 1770 just east of the [[w:Tiendurran|Tiendurran]], or Unadilla River, west of George Croghan’s [[w:George Croghan (1720-1782)|Otsego Patent]].  Both tracts are contained today in the [[w:Edmeston, New York|Town of Edmeston]], [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]].

The negotiations described above were conducted for William Edmeston by [[w:Percifer Carr|Parsafor Carr]], who had been a [[w:sergeant|sergeant]] in the 48th regiment.  Carr became Edmeston's agent in administering the new tract, called [[w:Mount Edmeston|Mount Edmeston]], and in securing its settlement.

'''The history of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]]: 1790 through 1799'''

==[[w:1790|1790]]==
There is something about a new country that beckons one to come.  True it is, hunger and exposure are often stern and unpleasant companions, but there, and there only, may be found the work of the creator, untarnished by the relentless hand of man.

To such a land came [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Stephen Taylor]] in the year 1790 from [[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], accompanied only by the faithful horse that bore him, to the then far distant western wilderness of [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]], to select the sight of a new home.  Tradition records that the first act upon arriving was to kneel in the forest and pray that the new home might be dedicated to the uplift of God’s Kingdom. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Talbot|''Newell Talbot'']].
----
These first settlers came into Edmeston via horseback, oxen or foot; the road they used was an Indian footpath. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]
----
[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Gardner|Col. Gardner]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Parker|Alexander Parker]] returned as civilians to purchase land near [[w:Otsego Lake|Otsego Lake]]. In [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]], at the foot of Otsego Lake, they found the [[w:William Cooper (judge)|Judge]].  He had been put in charge of land that later became most of [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]].  He was to sell plots to those who wished to buy land and settle on it.  He did sell to our relatives that day, but an interesting story has been told about how that transaction transpired.

The young men introduced themselves and told the judge they wished to buy land to settle on.  The Judge looked them over and thought &quot;I wonder if they should be close to our settlement by the lake?&quot;  He asked them, &quot;What is your religion?&quot; Alexander is supposed to have replied, &quot;What business is it of yours?&quot;  You see he was still a &quot;[[w:free thinker|free thinker]]&quot;.  He did not wish to have any relations with the old [[w:Calvinism|Calvinism]] of [[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] and much of [[w:New England|New England]].  Judge Cooper was a [[w:Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] and had already built a Presbyterian Church in Cooperstown.  He thought, &quot;Well, lets get rid of them&quot;, so he sold them land on the western edge of his holdings as far west as Burlington extended.  [''At that time Burlington extended to the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]].'']

[[w:William Cooper (judge)|Judge William Cooper]] who had sold Alexander and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Gardner|Sam Gardner]] their plots of land, had great wealth for his day.  He was a generous person.  He had a good heart and only demanded payment each year on as much money as the settlers could afford and not starve.

Alexander and the Col. came in the spring of 1790.  They supposedly paid for the land mostly with their mustering out pay.  The capital required to start farming was small indeed.  A man with his neighbors could put up a log house 20 feet square, living room below and sleeping room above, almost without cost.  Alexander is supposed to have put up a lean-to, then returned the next spring with his wife and built the log house with a good fireplace. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Parker|''Winifred Wilcox Parker'']]
----
[[w:William Cooper (judge)|Cooper]] was not a landlord as some who owned land and leased it, nor was he a speculator who acquired land for profit.  Cooper was a colonizer.  Wild lands were a challenge to him.  He was eager to see them cut into farms, sold and occupied.

When he opened land sales here in the spring of [[History of Edmeston, New York/1780s#1786|1786]] his policies were firmly developed.  He was born in [[w:Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and kept store in [[w:Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington, N.J.]]  At both places he lived with wealthy men who had interests in [[w:New York|New York]] and [[w:Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] undeveloped lands.  There was evidence that he served in some capacity in their enterprises.  He always preferred to distribute land by deed on fee simple and would accept small down payments to attain this end, but money at the time was everywhere scarce and the prospective settlers were mainly poor.  Cooper willingly altered his policy to fit the realities and often sold on land contracts. When &quot;articles of agreement&quot; were first contrived is uncertain but Cooper used them in ways of his own.  He contrived &quot;perpetual&quot; leases whereby the tenant rented the land (for cash or produce) and at such time they were able to purchase the land they did so at the low pioneer prices originally quoted. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Butterfield|''Roy L. Butterfield'']]
----
In 1790 [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Bennett|Ebeneezer Bennett]] moved from [[w:Connecticut|Conn.]] to Otsego County, which at that time was a long journey, and far west.  He bought 160 acres of land of the Government, lying on the banks of the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]].  He built a log house (near the Bank's homestead) close to the river and planted an orchard of apple trees.  Your grandfather [''[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Bennett|Philo Bennet]]''] was then six or seven years old and remembered some of the hard times of that pioneer life, and used to tell how the snow sifted through the roof, and the wolves howled about the door.  There were five sons in the family: [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Bennett|Eben, Lemuel, Philo, Elijah and David]]. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Bennett|''Matilda C. Bennett'']]

When a girl, twelve and thirteen years of age, I used often to stay with my step-grandmother, while her daughter went away for a visit of a week or more.  She was a heavy old lady and like the woman in the Bible, was &quot;Bound of Satan&quot; into a bent double position and walked about the house with a staff.  a frame building had been added to the log house in which she lived;  from the windows of the living room we looked straight down into the river, and at the south door was an immense wild cherry tree, black cherries, in which we children delighted.  In the old days part of the house was one large room with a large fireplace and two bedrooms, in one of which was a shelf with books on it, while on the floor below was an old chest curiously carved, and bound with brass.  To climb the chest, get a book or two, go into the orchard and hide myself among the branches of a crooked apple tree and read, was my special delight.  One of these books was the &quot;Sorrows of Neither&quot; by Goethe.  The others were loved stories abounding ghosts, and hobgoblins, and all were yellow with age. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Bennett|''Matilda C. Bennett'']]

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Bennett|Lemuel Bennett]] who lived near us, was older than our father; his wife was a beautiful woman and lovely character.  He had four daughters.  Uncle Lemuel and our father had homes on the land their father gave them, not on the river, but on the main road that ran parallel with it and a half mile or so from it; between was meadow and pasture with a brook running though from the hills which bounded the farm on the east, to the river, the hills were covered with a growth of pine and [[w:Tsuga|hemlock]], elm and chestnut trees.  The home was a brown story and half  house built on a smooth low hill, across the road was the large barn, through whose spacious doors came the great loads of shining wheat and fragrant hay, until the &quot;bins&quot; and the &quot;mows&quot; were full, and later on, the corn and pumpkins lay in great heaps.  I can still recall the rhythmic sound of the [[w:Flail|flails]] as the wheat was thrashed on the large smooth floor, and just how father looked as he hatcheted the flax, as well as the sound of the wheel as our mother spun it. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Bennett|''Matilda C. Bennett'']]
----
'''First U.S. Census:''' this area a part of [[w:Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]], [[w:Otsego, New York|Town of Otsego]], which covered what is now the [[w:Otsego County, New York|County of Otsego]].  The Town of Otsego had 304 families, total population 1702.  Local names included: [[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]], James Canada (Kennedy), Chapin, Colegrove, Monroe, and Lull. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Kelsey|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

During the development of Edmeston as a town, Indians still lived around about on the hills.  An interesting incident is told of the farmers experience with these Indians.  It seems that this man had a rooster that always crowed at the same time in the early morning and therefore, served as an alarm clock to awaken the family.  One morning, however, the rooster failed to crow.  Upon making an investigation at the Indian camp, the farmer found his rooster already picked and being cooked.  He frightened the Indians so they agreed to make baskets for him in payment for the rooster. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Janet Dockstader &amp; Myrta Kelsey'']]

A well-known pioneer was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Rev. Steven Taylor]], tradition says he made his first trip from Rhode Island to this town in 1790 alone on horse-back.  He returned for his parents who moved in ox carts in [[#1792|1792]].  The next year meetings began to be held and 30 years later Elder Taylor gave the land on which the Church was built in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1822|1822]]. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Kelsey|''Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
Referring to '''[[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]]''', [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Colgrove|Israel Colegrove]] informed me that the Indians were afraid of this man, looking upon him as a being of super-natural powers and allied, in some way, with the Great Spirit; this more particularly being their feeling after the Revolution.  Carr was a large, strong, rough, resolute and dauntless individual, with  &quot;a voice like a lion's.&quot; He had served in the [[w:French and Indian War|old French war]], and nothing could frighten him. He had a pleasant side to his nature, and was kind to the first settlers, making them take along additional sustenance from his own limited supplies when departing from his house. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington|''Huntington Papers'']]

The Indians once stole a lot of Carr's personal property during his temporary absence from home and crossed back to the opposite or [[w:Chenango County, New York|Chenango]] side of the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla]] with their plunder. Upon returning and being informed of the larceny, the old frontiersman seized his hatchet and, crossing the river on a rude bridge to the other shore, strode angrily into their camp, exclaiming as he did so that he would kill them if they did not instantly carry back everything they had taken from him.  Much impressed by his formidable personality, the Indians, it is said, quickly complied with his demands. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington|''Huntington Papers'']]

For a limited time, in early days white ash was principally used in building fences in the Burlington-Edmeston region.  Log fences were made first; then rail fences; while later on, came stonewalls. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington|''Huntington Papers'']]
----
In the latter part of the eighteenth century, settlements were also made in the northeastern part of the present Town of Edmeston. Since the early settlers in this locality included [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Benjamin]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Timothy]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Thomas]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|William]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Stephen Taylor]], this section was appropriately called '''Taylor Hill'''. Other pioneers were; [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Colegrove|Major and Stephen Colegrove]] from [[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Talbot|Jacob and Richmond Talbot]] from [[w:Connecticut|Connecticut]], and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Burlingham|Charles Burlingham]].  An idea of the hardships that these, endured is illustrated by the following incident: the first home that was built by Jacob Talbot  was a long house that had a bed quilt hung up before the entrance for a door. Fire brands taken from the fireplace at night served as defense against wolves that prowled about the cabin. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hickling|''Susan Hickling'']]
----
[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Colgrove|Stephen Colegrove]] once stated that when he first settled in the Taylor Hill section it was the custom to tap maple trees about November first and to manufacture sugar following every frost, until well along in the Spring.  For several years, the early settlers had little else to live upon besides maple sugar and corn pounded in a mortar.  After 1790, the number of new settlers coming into [[w:Burlington, New York|Burlington]] rapidly increased. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington|''Huntington Papers'']]
----
I was talking to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Phelps|Dr. Phelps]] about the history of Edmeston.  He said, &quot;[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Parker|Donald Parker's]] great, great, great grandfather was the first occupant of Edmeston.  He brought his first wife here and settled on what is now the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Parker|Dorr Parker]] farm.  Shortly after he and his family moved here his wife died.  He put her body in an old hollow log and buried her in the swamp where the Indians couldn't find her.  He went back to [[w:Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] with their one child and married again.  He moved here with his second wife and they started the original [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Parker|Parker]] Family.&quot; — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Dockstader|''Janet Dockstader'']]

[[Image:Old Otsego County.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of Otsego County, New York, by [[Simeon De Witt]] c. 1792-1793]]
'''[[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]]''' taken from '''[[w:Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]]''' in 1791 and consisted of two towns, [[w:Otsego, New York|Otsego]] and [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]].
----
Otsego County was erected Feb. 16, 1791.  In its first form it was much larger than it is now [1990], including a very large part of [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]] and almost the Western half of [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie]].  Changes in its borders were made as late as 1854. The original Otsego town has been carved into sixteen Towns, and the Original Cherry Valley into eight, resulting in the 24 Towns now existing. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Butterfield|''Roy L. Butterfield'']]

'''Solomon Kelsey''' and wife, '''Anna Brown''', with one child came from Easton, [[w:Washington County, New York|Washington County, N.Y.]] near [[w:Vermont|Vermont]] before 1792, to the Kelsey home-stead (1500 [[w:acre|acres]]) in the southeastern part of Edmeston [''town''].  All of their possessions were in an ox cart and they also brought a cow with them.  It is impossible  for us today to picture the privations and hardships endured in those times.  A slight glimpse of conditions then is shown in the following tales handed down in the family.  In order to get grain ground Solomon Kelsey took bags on horseback to the nearest mill, which was so far away that he must be gone over night.  [''[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Tunnicliff|John Tunnicliff's]]?'']  That night about dusk, Great Grandmother Kelsey milked to cow, set the pail of milk under a tree close by, and went to put the cow in the pasture.  When she returned a panther was lapping milk from the pail.  She called to the little children in the house and they pushed back the blanket which served as a door.  It so happened that this allowed the light from the fireplace to shine directly upon the milk pail. The panther screamed and jumped into the tree over head, but she dare not pick up the pail and went into the house without any milk that night. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

==[[w:1792|1792]]==
[[Image:Otsego Town of Burlington.png|300px|thumb|right|Town of Burlington, c.1792]]
The '''Town of Burlington''' was formed consisting of what is now [[w:Pittsfield, New York|Pittsfield]], [[w:New Lisbon, New York|New Lisbon]], [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston]] and [[w:Burlington, New York|Burlington]].
----
In April 1792, the Township of Burlington was organized and [[w:Jedediah Peck|Jedediah Peck]], a farmer and millwright who lived on the eastern edge, was elected supervisor.  Peck, short, ugly, one-eyed, a war hero, a poor speaker, and a political operator of genius, began as a [[w:Federalist|Federalist]] and later switched to the [[w:Democratic Republican Party]]. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Shillieto|''David Shillieto'']]
----
'''Elder Stephen Taylor''' came from Rhode Island at the age of 20.  According to and taken from the notes of a Mr. Pierson's letter: 

:''On June 9, 1792, William Cooper, as attorney for [[w:Cadwallader Colden|Calwaller Colden]] conveyed 525 acres of land to Stephen Taylor, for 300 pounds, it being lot No. 13 in the Colden tract.  On the same day Stephen Taylor gave a Mortgage for 300 pounds to Josiah Ogden Hoffman of New York City, covering the same premises — doubtless a purchase money mortgage — this mortgage being discharged of record [[June 28]], [[1800]].  This discharge was given by [[w:William Cooper (judge)|William Cooper]] as agent and assignee''. —  [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Hazel L. Jones'']]
----
About 1792, '''[[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]]''' was in the habit of going to [[w:John Tunnicliff|Tunnicliff]]'s inn for his rum. Upon one occasion, having just returned home from the latter's, an Indian, living temporarily on the opposite bank of the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla]] from Carr's house, came across the stream and asked the white brother for some of his liquor, claiming that he was suffering a great pain. His appeal, however, had no desired effect, Carr promptly replying; &quot;You cannot have it&quot; and then, a moment later, and as an afterthought, adding  &quot;God, Almighty, send the pain near the cursed villain’s heart!&quot; — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington|''Huntington Papers'']]

Not far from this time, '''Elder Stephen Taylor''' was employed on Carr's farm.  From a point near his house on Taylor Hill, the dwelling being a little north of &quot;Carr's road&quot;.  Elder Taylor was in the habit of following that primitive thoroughfare through an unbroken forest in going to and from the scene of his daily labor in the fields of our old [[Tory]] acquaintance; the latter paying him in corn for his services.  Elder Taylor repeated the anecdote just given of Carr and the Indian to Israel Colegrove, who, when a very old man, gave it to the writer. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington|''Huntington Papers'']]
----
There was no other method of travel except horseback, at that early date.  There was a rude road, which had been an Indian trail, over the [[w:Catskill Mountains|Catskill Mountains]] from the [[w:Hudson River|Hudson River]] at Catskill, to the Susquehanna Valley at [[w:Wattles Ferry|Wattles Ferry]], which was at the site of the present village of Unadilla. In 1802 an important trail was constructed over this trail by the Catskill and Susquehanna Turnpike Co.  I think the eastern part of this route is the present beautiful [[Rip Van Winkle State Highway]].  All the earliest settlers of this western part of the county and the southern part probably came over this route There was another road to [[Cherry Valley]] from Albany and the [[Mohawk Valley]]. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
One of the first settlers was '''Adin Deming''', who came in [[1792]]. He was born in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield, Mass]].  As his father claimed the use of his time until he was 21 years of age, young Adin did not strike out until he was 20.  Then he bought the remainder of his time for $20 and hired out for four years at $60 a year.  He married '''Martha Phelps''' and in 1792 removed to Edmeston performing the journey with an ox team. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Huntington Papers &amp; Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
Aside from his oxen, Adin Deming's worldly goods consisted of two beds, a few cooking and farming utensils, 200 pounds of pork and $18 in money.  With these small beginnings and with the pluck and perseverance of himself and his wife he gradually accumulated a large fortune.  Before he died he owned nearly 2000 acres of land on the south side of the Wharton Creek and in Pittsfield, and his estate was valued at over $75,000 his home was where Hayes Welch now lives.  Before his death in 1847 he gave away nearly all his property. He and another settler, Mr. Goodrich, gave the larger part of the cost of the erection of the Universalist Church on South Street.  He left in his will a sum of money for public school aid with the careful provision that the money was to be perpetually loaned out only on safe first mortgages.  Each of his children received a home and a large portion of land.  He gave land for the Deming cemetery adjoining his home.—  [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

My great grandfather and wife, Anna Brown, with one child came from Easton Washington County, New York, near Vermont before 1792 to the Kelsey homestead in the southeastern part of the town of Edmeston [at that time still a part of Burlington].  All their possessions were in an ox cart and they also brought a cow with them.  We have the original deed which was given by Abraham VanVechten of Albany to Solomon Kelsey, yeoman.  No neighbors mentioned in the deed but states &quot;A certain tract of land situated in the County of Otsego, being part of a tract containing 1500 acres, formerly the property of William Jackson, being known and distinguished by the name of Lot No. 3 — beginning at a hemlock stake etc. etc.&quot;  This land stayed in the family for 140 years. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

It is impossible for us today to picture the privations and hardships endured in those times.  A slight glimpse of conditions then is shown in the following tales handed down in the family.  In order to get grain ground '''Solomon Kelsey''' took bags on horseback to the nearest mill, which was so far away that he must be gone over night.  (I have wondered if it were not the mill built by Tunnicliff near [[Schuyler Lake, New York|Schuyler’s Lake]]).  That night about dusk, Great Grandmother Kelsey milked the cow, set the pail of milk under a tree close by and went to put the cow in the pasture.  When she returned a [[panther]] was lapping milk from the pail.  She called to the little children in the house and they pushed back the blanket which served for a door.  It so happened that this allowed the light from the fireplace to shine directly upon the milk pail.  the panther screamed and jumped into the tree overhead, but she dare not pick up the pail and went into the house with out any milk that night. —  [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

==[[w:1793|1793]]==
[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Carr|Mistress Percifer Carr]] used to make cheese there as early as the period of 1792-'93.  In this connection is recalled the following incident.  It  seems that upon a certain occasion, a woman living in the neighborhood bought some of Mrs. Carr's product, and, after tasting it, declared to several of her intimates that it positively stank.  Although Carr and wife were both religiously inclined, his good lady, upon hearing of the foul calumny through friendly gossip, solemnly averred that she would kill the slanderer if the latter ever put foot in her house again. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Huntington Papers|''Huntington Papers'']]
----
Upon the death of [[William Edmeston|Col. Edmeston]], the estate fell to the heirs and minor children residing in [[England]] from whom no secure title could be obtained for many years, which greatly retarded the settlement of the [[Edmeston, New York|Town]]. [''[[patent]]'']  Except for Carr, all the pioneers in the Patent came after 1793. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
The second settlement of the patent was one in the northeastern part of Edmeston [''not part of the Edmeston patent'']. [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Elder Stephen Taylor]] came from [[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] at the age of 20.  According to and taken from the notes of a Mr. Pierson’s letter: on June 9, 1792, [[w:William Cooper|William Cooper]] 

:''&quot;Judge Cooper, the novelist’s father, as attorney for [[w:Cadwallader Colden|Calwaller [''Cadwallader''] Colden]] conveyed 525 acres of land to Stephen Taylor, for 300 pounds, it being lot NO. 13 in the Colden Patent.  On the same day Stephen Taylor gave a mortgage for 300 pounds to Josiah Ogden Hoffman of New York City, covering the same premises—doubtless a purchase money mortgage being discharged of record June 28, 1800.  This discharge was given by William Cooper as agent and assignee.&quot;''  

This settlement became known as [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]].  A school was erected here about the same time.

The first internment in the Taylor Hill burying ground was that of the remains of one, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Hadley|Henry Hadley]] in about [[1793]].  He had been working in the woods of Elder Taylor at the time of his death, which was caused by a falling tree.  The chopper associated with him at the moment, it appears, had given him sufficient warning of the impending danger, but Hadley seemed oblivious to the peril menacing him and, instead of shifting his position to a place of safety, remained motionless and dazed as it were, until a small limb had struck him and crushed his skull.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Talbot|Jacob Talbot]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Johnson|Elisha Johnson]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Talbot|Richmond Talbot]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Timothy Taylor]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Green|Daniel Greene]] and others came soon afterwards and settled in the neighborhood of what is called '''Wrights corners''' (North Edmeston).  Taylor gave land for a church which was erected about [[1822]]. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|''Hazel L. Jones'']]

Another very early pioneer was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Talbot|Jacob Talbot]], born 1761 died 1814, He was the ancestor of the very numerous Talbot family in this community.  He came to Taylor Hill from [[Connecticut]] in 1793 with his wife, '''Phoebe Chase''', and three children, Isaac, aged 6, Jacob 5 and Joseph.  They came in an ox cart and brought among a few other things, a bag of wool which served as a bed for the children on the journey, and later carded, spun and woven into cloth for family use.  It has been said that he had to cut his was through the trackless forest, which doubtless was the case in this town at least.  The nearest neighbors were the Carr family on the Unadilla and the Tunnicliff family near Schuyler Lake.  One of the earliest roads in this region led from the Carr farm, over Taylor Hill (I think) to the Tunnicliff's, I have been told. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

The first church [[w:Batptist|(Bap.)]] was formed at [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]], March 8, 1794; [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Rev. Stephen Taylor]] was the first preacher.— [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Gazetteer of the State of New York|''Gazetteer of the State of New York'']]

The [[History of Edmeston, New York/Churches#Taylor Hill|First Baptist church of Edmeston]], located on what is known as Taylor Hill, was organized March 8, 1794, by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Rev. Stephen Taylor]], who came from [[w:Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] and settled in the town in 1790. He donated the land on which to erect  the church, and assisted in the construction of the edifice. He died in 1841, aged seventy-one years.

==[[w:1797|1797]]==
The [[w:Pittsfield, New York|Town of Pittsfield]] was set off from the [[w:Burlington, New York|Town of Burlington]]. Pittsfield consisting of what is now [[w:New Lisbon, New York|New Lisbon]] and Pittsfield.  Burlington Consisting of the present Edmeston and Burlington.

Among the first settlers who came to [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]] in the last decade of the 18th century [1897] were [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|Reolff TenBroeck]] and his wife, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|Maria]], called &quot;Polly&quot; and born a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|Vanderveer]].  They came from [[w:New Jersey|New Jersey]].

We have no record of why they came.  But being neighbors in far away New Jersey, and perhaps friends, of [[w:William Cooper (judge)|William Cooper]] who founded [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] it is reasonable to suppose that some contact with him had influenced them to make the long journey north and found a new home in the incredibly rich lands to which William Cooper had recently acquired title.

Cooper came in the early autumn of [[History of Edmeston, New York/1780s#1785|1785]] from Burlington, New Jersey.  In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1760s#1769|1769]] [[w:George Croghan|Col.Geo. Croghan]] of the English Army, Deputy Indian Commissioner and successor to the great [[w:William Johnson|Sir William Johnson]] had been granted title by the crown to 100,000 acres of the [[w:Central New York|central New York]] wilderness.  These acres had dwindled in various ways until but 40,000 remained and Croghan had gone back to England.  William Cooper had acquired this tract of land and so in the early autumn of [[History of Edmeston, New York/1780s#1785|1785]] he came to look over these new holdings of his and determined their boundaries.

The land needed settlers in order to build the civilization in the wilderness which he visualized and Cooper set about the business of getting them.  Within the year they began to arrive.  They came mainly from [[w:New England|New England]] over the marvelous new highway in this western empire!

In his will written sometime later, Cooper set down for his heirs instructions for caring for these infant settlements as follows:

:''And as I have influenced many families to settle in those new places on my land where numerous difficulties do, and for several years to come must, prevent their paying with that punctuality that is reasonably expected form older settlements where all the conveniences of living are easily obtained, I therefore wish that my heirs will deal tenderly with them''.

May we not assume that our [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|TenBroeck]] family was one of those influenced by Cooper.  It is very probable that [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|Reolff]] came first with his brother, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|John]], or other male members of the family to choose the site for the new home. We know that [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|John TenBroeck]] was early a land holder in Otsego County.  Records in Cooperstown show many deeds made at various times during that period to other members of both [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|TenBroeck]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|Vanderveer]] families.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Ten Broeck|Reolff]], born in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1760s#1763|1763]], was then a man in his late thirties, well established at that age in his own community we may suppose &amp;mdash; and tradition has it that Polly's wedding dowry had been $20,000 in gold and two black servants.  What better proof of the golden dower can we have than that the wooden cash box in which they carried their money exists today!  Alas for tradition that it is of a size more likely to hold two hundred dollars in gold than any twenty thousand!

But the two black servants were real.  Husband and wife they were, and they made the journey with their mistress and her several small children to make a home in the wilderness.  A few years later the black woman died and &quot;[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Stewart|Joseph]]&quot; the husband, so saddened by the death of his companion, left ''Dutch Valley'' and &quot;went to Cooperstown to work for [[w:William Cooper (judge)|Judge Cooper]]&quot;.  How this came about when he was a slave we do not know.  Could he have been &quot;[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Stewart|Joseph Stewart]]&quot; who lies buried in the cooper lot in Christ Church yard in Cooperstown and whose simple stone records the fact that he was &quot;born a slave but for many years was a much loved servant of Judge Cooper.&quot;  He returned on several occasions to visit his former mistress and once Polly, sick and thinking she was about to die, sent for him and he went afoot over the hills in response to her summons.

|''Records show that William Cooper rented &quot;negro boy Joseph&quot; from Abraham C. Ten Broeck for $76 to $80 a year from 1799 to 1802.  This may have been Joseph Stewart who was later freed but remained Cooper's butler, and was buried in the Cooper family plot, not buried separately with the slaves. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Taylor|''Alan Taylor'']]

The Dutch had been slave holders in the manors along the Hudson River from the earliest day.  Personal relations with their negroes were most kindly.  Frequently they were provided for by will, and daughters of well-to-do Dutch families numbered a slave or two in her wedding outfitting. Nor were they uncommon in central New York in those early days.  A ''Gazateer of the State of New York'' written and published by Horatim Spafford in 1823 lists slaves in every community — In Otsego County were 235 free blacks and 16 slaves. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Aice H. Swinney'']]
----
In 1797, from New Jersey, came Reolff TenBroeck and his wife, who built the relatively famous ''Dutch Valley Farm'', just south of the village.  Being Dutch immigrants, they brought new customs with them:  he erected his buildings near the center of the farm, he raised and sold the best horses, he owned the first high blooded cattle in this section and he owned the first slaves in his area. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]

==[[w:1820|1820]]==
I remember attending school at the large school house on [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]], a little east of the church that was built in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1822|1822]].  It had a pulpit and was used for Church purposes.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Rev. Taylor]] was an exemplary man and a very acceptable preacher for thirty five years.  He never took a salary, had a farm of 80 acres and the church helped him get his wood (cut and drawn by a [[w:bee (gathering)|bee]]), and also his hay.  The old school house was burned about [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1820|1820]].  a boy built fires for the ashes, and one night set them in a wood box in the entry.  The next morning all that was left was old iron, melted glass, and nails.  The district was then divided into three parts.  A few years before that [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Arnold|Stephen Arnold]] of [[w:Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], taught there, and one Sunday, at home, while hearing a young girl, six or seven years old, named [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#V|Van Amburg]], who lived with him, spell and pronouncing the word gig call it jig, he flew into a passion and whipped her several times until she was badly cut to pieces.  When he see how she sank he ran away.  His wife called [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Smith|Dr. Gains Smith]] to try to save her.  He looked at her wounds and said &quot;A man should not whip a child like that when in a passion.&quot;  She reassured the Dr. he was not in a passion.  He said 
:''&quot;then d—n him.  Follow him to the end of the earth and [[w:gibbet|gibbet]] him.  What would he not do in Passion?&quot;''

The child died, and he [''Stephen Arnold''] was taken, I think at ''Black Rock'', tried, and sentenced to be hanged, but while in the scaffold at Cooperstown there came a reprieve from the Governor, and while riding back from the gallows he kept saying &quot;good governor, good governor.&quot;  — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James Slocum|James Slocum]]''

In spite of the fact that there were very few houses in [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston Centre]] in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1820|1820]], the town in that year had its largest population 2087.  It is now about 1700. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|Myrta Kelsey]]''
----
In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1820|1820]] Edmeston Centre had a grist mill, a saw mill, a [[w:forge|forge]] and [[w:triphammer|triphammer]] and a carding and fulling mill.  I have already spoken of the grist and saw mill.  The forge and triphammer, for the manufacture of axes, scythes, and plow shares was operated by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|William Stickney]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Samuel Simmons]].  the carding and fulling mill was erected and operated by Joseph Bootman on the site where Card's garage now stands. [''1992, Tim's garage''].

Honorable [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|David B. St.John]] became a resident of this town in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1820|1820]].  He did much to advance the interests of Edmeston as well as the adjoining town of [[w:Pittsfield, New York|Pittsfield]].  He at one time resided in Pittsfield where he served as supervisor for ten years.  His record in the board of supervisors together with his general integrity and character, won him the esteem of the people and he was subsequently chosen a member of the [[New York State Assembly|Assembly]] in the years [[History of Edmeston, New York/1840s#1849|1849]]-50-60, and was in the [[Constitutional Convention]] of [[1846]].  Most of the people in this area were [[Whig]]s and later became affiliated with the [[Republican Party]]. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''

==[[w:1822|1822]]==
Meetings were held on [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]] starting around [[History of Edmeston, New York/1790s#1793|1793]], in '''1822''' [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Taylor|Elder Stephen Taylor]] gave the land for the Taylor Hill Church.  No church was organized in the village [''hamlet of Edmeston''] for nearly 30 years.  Apparently the Taylor Hill section of the town was thickly settled much earlier than around the village. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|Myrta Kelsey]]''

[''The lands in the Edmeston patent were settled later because they were tied up in the settling of the estate.'']
----
The first meetings [''Taylor Hill Church''] were held in the open forests, then in a log cabin, then in a barn, a period of about thirty years presumably between [[1793]]-[[1823]].  The school house was destroyed by fire in [[1821]].  '''Elder Taylor''' felled the first tree for the building of the church proper and worked with the builders in its erection.

The church building was of one room, colonial windows, vaulted ceilings, a most rare piece of architecture for the time and place.  The building was heated by two large box stoves.  Bench seats lined the wall on either side, and across the door end of the auditorium, all facing the bay-window shaped pulpit for those at opposite end of the building.  Chairs, home made, were placed directly in front of the pulpit for those who were deaf.  Characteristic of the century which was to follow, a long row of sheds was built along the left side and along the back of the church. — ''Taylor Hill Church, Memories of West Edmeston''

==[[w:1823|1823]]==
The will of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Edmeston|Andrew Edmeston]]:
:''This is the last will and testament of Mr. Andrew Edmeston, of [[w:Cooperstown|Cooperstown, New York]] in the [[w:Otsego County, New York|County of Otsego]] in the [[w:New York|State of New York]], in the [[w:United States|United States of America]], but now residing at the borough of [[w:Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick-upon-Tweed]] in [[w:England|England]]. Esquire made published and declared this 3rd day of November in the year of our Lord 1823. I give and devise unto James Aitchison of Pelham in the County of Westchester in the State of New York, U.S.A. for and during the term of his natural life one annuity of annual rent charge of Three hundred fifty dollars to be paid to him or his assigns half yearly...''

[''There are six typewritten pages of the will in legal and out-dated terms, with codicils as late as January, 1826''].  Andrew Edmeston appointed Edward Hyde Clark and George William Featherstone to hold his land for his sister, Mrs. George (Elizabeth Francis) Ridell and his nephew, Robert Edmeston.  

:''...all my mekuages lands, Tenements and Real Estate situated lying and being on both sides of the River Unadilla in the Counties of Otsego and [[w:Chenango County, New York|Chenango]].''

There was a Seventh Day Baptist church in West Edmeston and was the only one of its kind in Otsego County.  They differ from the regular Baptists only in respect to keeping the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. The Church at West Edmeston was organized Sept. 28,1823.  It first took the name of the Third Church of Brookfield.  The meeting house which was built sometime before was located about a half a mile north of Babcock mills in the Beaver Creek Valley.  The first members were connected with churches of Leonardsville and Clarksville in the same town.  They believed that for their convenience, as well as their interests of the cause of God, required the formation of a new church so a council was called and the movement approved.  Eighty members were enrolled at the organization.  After fifteen years it was found that a majority of the members had become located in and near West Edmeston, and for their accommodation they built a meeting-house in 1843, which cost $800.  Subsequently it was enlarged to as to seat two hundred and fifty persons.  For ten years after it erection the meetings were held alternately between the two chapels.  They were all removed to West Edmeston in 1854 and soon the church was changed to the Seventh Day Baptist. ) — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''

==[[w:1824|1824]]==
'''[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Aden Deming]]''' set aside $4000, the interest of which was to be given to the schools of the town.  He established this fund in 1824.  (We still have the use of the interest-we call it the &quot;School Fund.&quot;  It took a special act of the legislature to set aside this fund for the school and it is understood it would take a special act of the Legislature to do away with it).  — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''

'''[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|John Bilyea]]''' built the first [[tannery]] where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Charles Bain's]] apartment now stands [''1992, Tim’s junk car lot'']. The first regular store was opened in 1824 by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Lyman White]].  The building was later used as a hotel by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Delos Davis]] where the present Brady House now stands [''1992, the fire house''].  Other early tradesmen were [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Silas Burleson]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Erastus Waldo]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Benjamin Peet]]. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|Myrta Kelsey]]''
----
In 1824 the first regular store opened.  This meant great changes in the way people bought supplies — great quantities were not necessary anymore.  Twice a year merchants went to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to buy enough stock to last six months;  each journey required over a week. —  ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|Sandra Lohnas Haggerty]]''

'''Spafford’s Gazetteer of the State of New York''', 1824:  
:Edmeston is a Post-Township in the western part of Otsego County, erected on April 1, 1808 from Burl;ington (the west end), 18 miles from Cooperstown and 84 miles from Albany; bounded on the north by Plainfield, east by Burlington, South by New Lisbon and Pittsfield, west by the Unadill a River (this being the boundary of Otsego County).  The area is about 26,628 acres.  The surface is considerably diversified with hills and valleys and the soil is various, the pricipal part being moist and excellent for grass.  The timber is principally deciduous as maple, beech, ash, basswood, elm, etc.  There are some groves of pine also.  The Unadilla Creek and the Wharton Creek supply mill seats.  A tract of about 10,000 acres in the northwest part, principally wild, is owned by Mr. Edmeston from whom the town is named.

:There is a valuable quarry of building stone in the southeast corner.  The inhabitants are principally farmers and their agriculture and domestic economy are respectable, their household manufactures increasing and already supply the principal part of their clothing.  the Great Westen Turnpike leads centrals across it east and west and the other roads are numerous and good.  The population in 1810 was 1,317.  There were 497 farmers; 70 mechanics; one trader; taxable property.  $169.555.  There were 12 schools kept eight months; 8,415 acres of improved land; 2,096 cattle; 387 horses; 4,401 sheep; 21,477 yards of cloth; 1 trip hammer; 3 distilleries; 2 asheries.  Mount Edmeston, the residence of a large proprietor must be noticed as worthy of mention.

==[[w:1825|1825]]==
Later, as there began to be considerable cleared land, we would have afternoon and evening huskings, and then a dance or a play after we got through.  Those who had horses came on horseback, with their girl behind them.  Then we began to have balls New years and Independence.  We would meet two or three weeks before and choose four managers.  They would get the tickets and distribute them, and engaged the music.  the girl that had a nice bombazette dress with a plump six yard in it, and a nice pair of calf slippers was fit to go with the first manager.  In those days I never saw a young man go into a ball room with his hat or boots on.  We all had pumps, and the girls had slippers of either cloth or leather, and no young man thought to go without a partner, and some carried two, so that if there should chance to be some young man without a partner and wished to join the dance, he could do so.  There was not much running around nights, especially alone, for there was occasionally a bear, and wolves were quite common, so they stayed at home and played [[w:fox and geese|fox and geese]], or [[w:Nine Men's Morris|twelve men of Morris]].

Speaking of wolves reminds me of several adventures with those animals.  One of my earliest recollections was in being waked up one night by the firing of guns.  I got up to see what was going on, and my father and Mr. Stephen Hoag, a neighbor of ours, who resided on the Hill east of us were building fires of the stumps and brush heaps, and firing their guns to keep off the wolves, which were collecting in great numbers on the hills to the west.  Both men had sheep which the wild beasts had scented, and they had taken this means to drive them off.

After a few years we began to have apples; then we had paring bees and quiltings.  Those were rich times for both young and old, and many of my readers can look back with pride and pleasure to those days when the hale and hearty aged people, as well as the ruddy and sprightly younger ones would meet together at the house of some one of the neighbors — first for work, and afterwards sport, with plenty of nut cakes and cider — and the various games and their &quot;forfeits&quot;. &amp;mdash; ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James Slocum|James Slocum]]''

'''NEW YORK BAPTIST REGISTER.''', Utica, New York, Friday July 6, 1827:

:'''REVIVALS'''

:Extract of a Letter from [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Brother Timothy Tailor]] to the Editor.

:Dear Brother,

:&amp;emsp; It is with a good degree of satisfaction that I have an opportunity of informing the friends of Zion, that it hath pleased a merciful God, in the dispensation of his providence, to favour this people with a shower of Divine grace.  The good work commenced the latter part of December, in a district school, taught by one of the students from the Theological Semenary at Hamilton. The pious instruction of their teacher, accompanied by the earnest addresses they heard him make at the throne of grace, were blessed in the hands of God, to the awakening of several of the larger scholars, who had hitherto been thoughtless about the welfare of their immortal souls.  The inquiry was most earnestly made. &quot;What must we do to be saved?&quot; A deep solemnity soon pervaded the school. The ususal hours for recreation were now spent in searching the Scriptures, and the big tear often bespoke the troubles of a wouned spirit; while the thoughtless began to inquire, &quot;What meaneth this?&quot; The light of eternity seemed to dawn. It was as solemn as silence in thick darkness. Meetings were thronged; Christains beheld the scene, and began to have great searching of heart. The Lord rolled upon Zion &quot;the travailing pains.&quot; The Spirit helped the infirmities of the saints, and they began to agonize at the throne of grace, with groanings unutterable. It was the set time, the day of salvation, and souls were born into the kingdom. ... parents and children obtained 'joy and ...ness,' and came with singing unto Zion. The glorious fire proved electric. Scholars from neighboring districts, visting this school, were made to share the blessings of the new covenent, and by this means, became the happy instruments of sowing the seeds of the Kingdom in their neighborhoods. I have baptizied, since the commencement of the revival, fifty-three; and there are yet more to behold the waters of Jordan, saying, &quot;and there will I be buried.&quot; The work still continues, and we trust there are yet &quot;berries to be gathered in from the uttermost boughs.&quot;

:&amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; Yours affectionately,&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; TIMOTHY TAILOR.

Several other gentlemen became residents of the place [[w:Cooperstown, New York|[''Cooperstown'']]] during the period already mentioned [''1805&amp;ndash;1820''], and continued to increase and improve its society; among these were Messrs. [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Edmeston|[''Andrew''] '''Edmeston''']], Atchison, Augustine Prevost, and G. W. Prevost.  A singular fatality attended the first three of these gentlemen. Col Prevost was lost in the well known shipwreck of the Albion packet. Mr. '''Edmeston''' was drowned while bathing [''in 1826''], and Mr. Atchison fell by his own hand during an access of fever. Neither of these melancholy events occurred in the village. &amp;mdash; [[w:James Fenimore Cooper|''James Fenimore Cooper'']], [[The Chronicles of Cooperstown/Chapter VI|''The Chronicles of Cooperstown, 1838'']]</text>

Prior to 1860 ''[in 1855]'' a third school building was erected on North Street.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Lucy P.

''[This building was moved to the east side of South Street, near the four corners.  It has been used at various times as a fire station, garage, apartments and a used clothing store. As of 1990, in poor repair is idle]''.

[[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]] was the leading national [[hop]] producing area.  Throughout the year weekly papers carried market quotations, crop prospects and news of the hop situation overseas. — The &quot;[[hoop skirt]]&quot; was all the fashion and occasioned much comment and caricature as the &quot;[[hobble skirt]]&quot; of a much later day. One [[New York City]] factory was employing a thousand girls, using 300,000 yards of steel spring wire and 150,000 yards of tape a week and turning out 3,000 skirts a day.  [[Harper's Weekly]] commented,

:''&quot;Smart girls, we are told, can easily make $4 a week...Four dollars a week, it need hardly be remarked, is very fair remuneration for work which is neither excessive or unhealthy.&quot;''

'''The history of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]]: 1880 through 1889'''

==1880==
We were in Edmeston a year ago and when we saw the telegraph poles and telephone lines, thought it would not be long before the steam horse would arrive.  And before this great change let us glance at some of the people as they are today, and whose example youth may well follow.

The owner of the splendid residence and large shoe store at the foot of the hill near the cemetery is [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#J|William Joslyn]], Fifty years ago he was a poor boy without parents to guide his way from the temptations that ruin so many;  always kind and generous to his playmates, ready to help all and wrong none, with but little time at school, he learned the tanners and shoe trade with [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Mr. Bilyea]] about a mile from the village.  Until sale shoes were made, shoe making was his only occupation, and by early learning Franklin's rule, &quot;that he must keep his shop who would have his shop keep him,&quot; and by the superiority of his work attracting customers for miles around, always careful of unnecessary expenses, (we do not know that he ever owned a horse, for his business did not need one), he occupies a position that many, with all the advantages of wealth to start with, might well be proud of.

A short distance down the creek we find the master mechanic and Natures nobleman, '''Louis Green''', standing perhaps at his forge, while in some of shops, iron is moulded in various forms, and in other plained as smooth as glass.  And all of this machinery is run by water wheel of his own invention, said to be the best wheel in the United States.  he also invented and manufactured for sale various farm implements — his plows and horseshoes are known the best in the section.

As we return, we pass the residence of '''James Ackerman''',  If fine Churches, academies, school houses, stores, hotels, and dwellings add to the beauty of the country and the welfare of the people, Mr. Ackerman should receive the thanks of the whole community, for it has been largely by his industry and executive ability, that both village [hamlet] and country presents so fine an appearance.  He has been a large purchaser of timber from all sections.  He paid five thousand dollars for what was on fifty acres of land.  The logs were hauled to this village and sawed, and thence to his large machine shops for doors, window sash, blinds, etc. His son Burt now carries on the shops, while he farms it as health permits.

We saw at least forty bushels of wheat to the acre on his farm last year. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James Slocum|''James Slocum'']]

==1882==
The first local paper was published in 1882;  The '''''Wharton Valley Echo''''' — later the '''''Edmeston Echo''''' and finally the '''''Edmeston Local'''''.  This enabled the recordings of history from which people can learn the interesting facts, but to the editors, their main function was record current happenings and spread the word.  the ''Edmeston Local'' left Edmeston to be published in [[w:Gilbertsville, New York|Gilbertsville]] during the 1940's Even with the same name, the &quot;hometown paper&quot; feeling was lost and the publisher sold to the '''''New Berlin Gazette''''', in which the Local is now swallowed. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]

==1883==
'''Owners of the two Edmeston hotels up to 1883:'''
:{|
|width=&quot;300&quot;|
[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Benjamin Peet]], a man of renown,&lt;br&gt;
Built and run the first hotel in town;&lt;br&gt;
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Levi Goodsell]] bought the same,&lt;br&gt;
He closed it up and sold him out,&lt;br&gt;Lost all he paid, I have no doubt.&lt;br&gt;
|''This first hotel was the '''Pleasant Street Hotel''', built around [[History of Edmeston, New York/1800s#1800|1800]] on East Street where the current fire house is.  High Street was the northern way out of town at that time. Bootman's Store was across from the hotel.'' 
|-
| 
[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|W. Burlingham]] run it one year,&lt;br&gt;
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#A|Benjamin Arnold’s]] records appear.&lt;br&gt;
I think I am right, but have not the dates,&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
And then to Aunt [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Sarah Smith]] it was sold,&lt;br&gt;
She married [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Dan H.]] and she had the gold.&lt;br&gt;
A great many years it was run in his name,&lt;br&gt;At last had to rent because he was lame.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
Uncle [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|John Gaskin]] run it a spell,&lt;br&gt;
And  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|E.G. Waldo]], how long I can’t tell.&lt;br&gt;
It once was rented to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Esq. Styles Gray]],&lt;br&gt;
And [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|Morgan]] to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#N|Nelson]], how long I won’t say.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
It was run by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#V|Vandenburg]], the miller,&lt;br&gt;
And then was sold to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Dr. Wheeler]].&lt;br&gt;
Was kept some time by his son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|John]],&lt;br&gt;
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#A|Adams]] bought it when he was gone,&lt;br&gt;
| ''By [[History of Edmeston, New York/1890s#1890|1890]], the hotel was known as the '''Brady house'''. It had many different owners, and at one time was the center of hamlet life.''
|-
|
And then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|John Davis]] was mine &quot;host&quot;,&lt;br&gt;
He kept it until he leaf the coast;&lt;br&gt;
It next was taken by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Deloss]],&lt;br&gt;
And he believes he is the boss.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
It now is sold to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|T. R. Barrett]],&lt;br&gt;
I understand he will repair it,&lt;br&gt;
He rented it to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Hoffman]] next,&lt;br&gt;
I do not mean the Governor EX.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
A man by name of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|S. H. Preston]],&lt;br&gt;
Built under the hill to learn us a lesson,&lt;br&gt;
That two hotels was better than one,&lt;br&gt;
And kept it himself when it was done.
|''This was the second hotel in town. Preston bought the land from [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Adin Deming]], the first settler in the area. He built the hotel sometime between [[History of Edmeston, New York/1840s#1840|1840]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/1840s#1843|1843]] at the location of the current Bank/Post Office building''
|-
|
He run it quite a spell;&lt;br&gt;
But afterwards desired to sell.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Lovett Hoag]] bought the stand,&lt;br&gt;
And opened it up to try his hand.&lt;br&gt;
Of course he kept a number one,&lt;br&gt;
Then rented to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Walter]], his son.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
Did not exceed his father a bit,&lt;br&gt;
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|E. G. Waldo]] hired it,&lt;br&gt;
He run it some years then left it off,&lt;br&gt;
It was then rented to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#R|Risedorf]].&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
In the time when things looked blue,&lt;br&gt;
It was rented to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Donahue]].&lt;br&gt;
I think that [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Waldo]] had it again,&lt;br&gt;
And run it and sold it to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Chamberlain]],&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
I forgot to mention [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#K|P. E. Kenyon]],&lt;br&gt;
Remembered by all in this dominion,&lt;br&gt;
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Chamberlain]] built over the whole,&lt;br&gt;
And sold it to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Mr. Cole]].&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
Cole run it for a term of years;&lt;br&gt;
But did not make much it appears.&lt;br&gt;
He sold it to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Hatheway]] &amp; Co.,&lt;br&gt;
The price he got I do not know.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Barton]] bought and owned it through,&lt;br&gt;
Until the Spring of eighty-two,&lt;br&gt;
|-
|
It was then sold to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Arthur Wells]],&lt;br&gt;
I need not tell of anything else.&lt;br&gt;Except to stop all further asking,&lt;br&gt;
It now belongs to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|John S. Gaskin]].
|''Gaskin, from [[w:New Berlin, New York|New Berlin, New York]] was the owner in 1883.''

:::::&amp;mdash; ''New Berlin Gazette, Jan. 23, 1883''
----
Subsequent owners of the '''Gaskin House''' included:
*[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|Mager Mitchell]] came along, and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Elmer Welch]] fits in there.

*Not many wanted the business for more than a year or two. 

*In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1900s#1901|1901]] steam heat was put in, and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#U|Mr. Utter]] sold in 1901 to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Earl Thomas]]. 

*In 1903 an addition was made to the west side (back).

*Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|Edward Masterson]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Roland Todd]] who sold it to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Joseph Tasior]]. 

*By this time a couple of fires had caused the elimination of the third floor.  The Tasior family resided on  the second floor.  Porches were removed and the only business transacted was a bar.  

*Joseph Tasior sold it to Central National Bank in 1987.  They tore it down and put a new bank and post office on the site.

*Dr.s Lough, Chambers and Chesebrough are physicians that are practicing medicine here and are men of skill in their profession.  
*We have two hotels; the Gaskin house and Lyman Barrett is about to open the new one on the hill, and then we will have the accommodations that will be second to none, and any one that has ever stopped with uncle John Gaskin well knows this to be a fact.

==1989==
The Erie Canal was of tremendous importance to New York’s commerce and to farmers near its route, but it brought ruinous competition from the Western States to this remote region and others.  The coming of the steam engines, which could operate in these regions and during the winter as well as in the summer, soon triumphed over river traffic.  In 1889, the railroad was extended from New Berlin to Edmeston;  it reached to Sidney at the opposite end.  The coming of the railroad led to the building of a shipping station in 1890 for the exporting of milk.  Farmers could then dispose of their milk more easily and get a better price, for instead of carrying their milk to cheese factories as they had to do, they could ship fluid milk directly to New York City; even then, Edmeston was recognized as one of the finest dairying section in New York State.  The railroad meant much to the town.  Edmeston was the rail head for a rich farming territory and the freight hauled was tremendous, both out and in.  But with the coming of good roads &quot;probably is only a short time until the right of way will be abandoned&quot; F.T.50  This prediction was correct — in the late 1940's the tracks were removed.

The worst and first flood was in 1889;  not much is recorded about this tragedy.&amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]</text>

'''The history of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]]: [[w:1930|1930]] through [[w:1939|1939]]'''

==[[w:1937|1937]]==

'''Scout’s Run to Warn Of Peril To Be Marked''' ''Edmeston Local'' June 25, 1937.

:Plans are underway already to mark the 160th anniversary next summer of the run of [[w:Adam Helmer|John Adam Helmer]], a [[w:Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] scout, from [[w:West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]] to [[w:Fort Herkimer|Fort Herkimer]] of the imminent approach of enemies, it was learned this week.  The exact course followed by the scout in his run, which is reminiscent of that from [[w:Marathon|Marathon]] and that of [[w:Paul Revere|Paul Revere]].
  
:Harry Bush of [[w:Canajoharie, New York|Canajoharie]] is chairman of the committee set up by the [[w:Mohawk Valley|Mohawk Valley]] towns association to lay plans for the observance.  Mr. Bush is now awaiting the historic facts from a descendant of Helmer in order that the exact route may be followed.

:The run, which is famous over a wide territory and part of the lore of the Mohawk Valley, will go down in the annals of that section.  It recently was brought before the eyes of the reading public in &quot;[[w:Drums Along the Mohawk|Drums Along the Mohawk]]&quot;, [[w:Walter D. Edmonds|Walter D. Edmonds]]’ best selling work and also was mentioned by the same author in a recent nationally known magazine article.
----
'''Question Over Famous Run Is Finally Solved &amp;mdash; Authentic Account of Adam Helmer’s Feat by a Descendant''', ''Edmeston Local,'' Oct 12, 1937.

:'''Historical Setting &amp;mdash; Start at Edmeston Manor, South East Outpost of Otsego Nearest Indian Stronghold.'''

:The ''St. Johnsville Enterprise News'' of Wed., Aug. 4th, published an account of [[w:Adam Helmer|Adam Helmer]]’s heroic run of September 16, 1778, made to save the [[w:German Flatts, New York|German Flats]] settlers from [[w:Joseph Brant|Brant’s]] raiders.  Helmer’s run was successful and only two of the people of the western Mohawk Valley settlements met death when the red and white savages destroyed houses, barns and crops. 

:&quot;Adam Helmer’s Famous Run&quot; is the work of Mrs. Mildred R. Staunton, a teacher of Mount Vernon and a great-great-granddaughter of Scout Adam Helmer.  As the Enterprise News Truly says: &quot;It is a valuable contribution to Mohawk Valley history.&quot;  Leu D. MacWethy, editor of the Enterprise News, has done a real public service in securing and publishing this thrilling account, which should have printing in pamphlet form.  Through his courtesy this paper is enabled to publish Mrs. Staunton’s article.

:Before the publication of Mrs. Staunton’s description, there had been many versions of Helmer’s run &amp;mdash; as to where it started and the route taken.  Her account now clears up the discrepancies and contradictions and the argument over the feat made famous in the popular novel &quot;[[w:Drums Along the Mohawk|Drums Along the Mohawk]]&quot;.  One of these, which affected the length of Helmer’s run, or seemed to, was the statement in the Gov. Clinton papers, Vol. 4, p 39, that Helmer lay in bushes &quot;about nine miles south of German Flatts and saw the enemy pass.&quot;  This was so but the brief report mentioned does not say that Helmer had previously run about 25 miles, as Mrs. Staunton’s account brings out.

:Following is Mrs. Staunton’s article in full.

[[Image:Three Scouts Killed 1778 Plaque.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Plaque at the [[Percifer Carr|Carr farm]] where Adam Helmer escaped and started his run to warn the residents of the Mohawk Valley.  It reads &quot;IN MEMORY OF THE THREE SCOUTS KILLED ON THE ESTATE OF PERCIFER CARR BY BRANDT'S INDIANS SEPTEMBER 1778&quot;]]

'''D.A.R. Marker in Plot Near West Edmeston''' &amp;mdash; ''Edmeston Local'' June 24, 1938.

:The marker erected by the Col. Israel Angell Chapter DAR. Of New Berlin on the Carr farm two miles south of West Edmeston and dedicated June 19, 1914, has been moved to a plot 12 by 20 feet farther south to the new road to South Edmeston.

:The old road has been abandoned.  The inscription on the tablet reads: &quot;In memory of the Three Scouts killed on the estate of Percifer Carr by Brandt’s Indians.  September 1778.  Erected by the Col. Israel Angell Chapter, N.S., D.A.R.&quot;

:It is fenced on three sides and is accessible from the highway.  The Carr farm is famous for the beautiful old dishes unearthed on it a few years ago.  They were buried by the Carr family in the Revolutionary times when Brandt made his raid. (The spelling of the name Brant and Brandt are interchangeable)

'''Albert Talbot Buys Interest in Theater''' &amp;mdash; ''July 1, 1938 Edmeston Local''
:[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Albert Talbot]] has bought of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|A.J. Menard]] his interest in the theater business and the opera block. Possession was given last week.  Mr. Talbot has conducted a farm near Burlington Flats for a number of years but plans to move to Edmeston to make his permanent home.  It will be recalled that Mr. Talbot and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Mr. Milton Shatzel]], now of Edmeston, started the moving picture business in Edmeston way back in the silent picture days.  They held their first shows in the [[w:Grange|Grange]] Hall, starting about [[History of Edmeston, New York/1900s#1918|1918]], and later moving the business to its present location.  Mr. Talbot continued in the business until about [[History of Edmeston, New York/1900s#1924|1924]] when he removed to his farm at [[w:Burlington Flats, New York|Burlington Flats]].

'''Motorcade to Mark Famous Run &amp;mdash; [[w:Adam Helmer|Adam Helmer’s]] Trip Started at the Carr Farm''', ''Edmeston Local'' September 2, 1938.

:A 35-mile run through Ilion which saved Fort Herkimer settlers from an Indian massacre in 1778, will be commemorated this month by a motorcade which will cover the same historic route.

:The hero was Scout Adam Helmer, who ran from the Carr farm, [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]], near South Edmeston, to [[w:Fort Herkimer|Fort Herkimer]], after eluding a band of [[w:redskins|redskins]] who were on his trail and intent on wiping out the Herkimer settlers.
 
:Helmer was one of eight scouts dispatched by Col. [[w:Peter Bellinger|Peter Bellinger]], commander at Fort Herkimer, to attempt to locate a party of Brandt’s Tories and Indians.  About 10 a.m. September 16, [[History of Edmeston, New York/1770s#1778|1778]], Helmer and his companions were surprised by a war party of 40 savages who attacked them at a spring on the Carr farm.  They were driven into the Unadilla River, but Helmer finally escaped and started his dash to Herkimer.</text>

[''Circa 1960 Sandra Lohnas Haggerty concluded her history of Edmeston:'']

'''CONCLUSION'''. None of these destroyed buildings has been rebuilt, which indicates the decline in business that our village has felt.  With improved transportation, people are apt to travel to the cities for shopping and entertainment;  there they find greater choices and lower prices because of the quantities with which city venders deal.  About two weeks ago, our restaurant &quot;folded&quot; and the closing of our small clothing store is rumored.  I'm afraid that the change in our culture hasn't helped the growth of our small village. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]</text>

'''Historic Houses in the [[w:Edmeston, New York|Town of Edmeston]]'''

==The Five Sisters==
The Five Sisters was a five-family house built by the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Underwood|Homer Underwood]] on the east side of South Street in the Edmeston hamlet.  The building burned to the ground in the late [[History of Edmeston, New York/1900s|1990s]], a victim of suspected [[w:arson|arson]].

In 1847 It was decided to raise $400 to build a new school on the site of the school they already had.  The trustees were instructed to sell the old school and apply the money toward the new one.  This was on the 19th of October.  On the 26th, it was decided to reconsider the vote of Oct. 19th and purchase a new site form '''Col. Deming''' for $50.  This would be on the northeast corner of his wood lot and in front of his horse barn.  they were to spend only $300.  Nothing more was done until September 1, 1854 when a special meeting of all [[w:Freeholder|Freeholders]] and inhabitants was called.  It was then resolved to purchase land from Col. Deming on the lot adjoining the [[w:Baptist|Baptist]] Church (on North Street) This was to contain one-half acre of land. Resolution was adopted.  '''James Ackerman''' and '''Eri Deming''' were drafted to draft plans for the new school.  
 
In 1855 The new school was built. $550 was collected for building the school, but it only cost $526.93, so there was a balance on hand of $26.93 for the coming year.

In 1898, this building was moved to South Street to make room for the new building.  While on South Street, it was used as a Town Hall, Fire Department, Gas Station, Apartment on the second floor, and a Second Hand Store.  It was torn down in the 1980's. &amp;mdash; ''[[Edmeston, New York#Echoes of the Past|Echoes of the Past]]''

The Union school was completed in 1898, replacing the [[History of Edmeston, New York/Schools#District 3|District 3]] flattop school on North Street. That year the ''Edmeston Local'' posted this review of the new building: 

:''The new school is a beautiful structure combining [[w:Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[w:Corinthian order|Corinthian]] styles of architecture.  It is heated by steam, has an approved system of lighting and perfect system of ventilation.  All of the air in the entire building can be changed every twenty minutes without reducing the temperature. fresh air is supplied directly from out doors by means of flues.  It may be passed around the boilers and warmed and thus brought into the rooms, warm and pure, or it may come directly to the rooms if desired.  In any case every pupil and teacher has a constant supply of pure air and thus be considered a very important feature by every thinking person.  We have no more complaints about the head aching; and that dull, heavy listless attitude of the pupil has disappeared. The interior of the building is even more important than the exterior; it is finished with oak throughout; the casements and so on are fine examples of art and workmanship.  The walls are covered with stained paper of delicate green and finished with flowers and numerous specimens of animals and birds, nicely mounted and protected by glass cases.  In fact the air of the entire building must inspire within the mind of every student an admiration for the beauty of art and the simplicity of adornment, because while it is rich and complete in all its appointments, still nothing has been overdone''. &amp;mdash; ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Echoes of the Past|Echoes of the Past]]''

The following excerpt from an article in the October 29, 1927 ''Edmeston Local'' described the 1922 founding of the Otsego School by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Florence Chesebrough]]:

:'''''Edmeston Boasts Unique Venture: Interest in Unfortunate child lead to Establishment of Useful School in Edmeston'''''

:''… Interest in an unfortunate child in this village of her nativity, going back to her own childhood, coupled with later contact with backward children in Utica during her professional duties prompted Florence Chesebrough, R.N., to undertake at firsthand the establishment of a school for the help of children not able to keep the pace in public schools.  Associated with her as a co-laborer from the very beginning is [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Susanne W. Jones]], B.A., M.S., who has had direct medical training.  These women bound together by personal friendship and common sympathy for the unfortunate have originated and developed this school to a point of great success, usefulness and interest. To chronicle its story, and voice appreciation of its methods and results is a pleasant task.''

:''In the first place, a unique feature of this school is the fact that it is housed in a home.  Mr. and Mrs. [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|C. H. Chesebrough]], parents of Miss Chesebrough, freely opened their own home for the beginning of the realization of the ideal of their daughter and her friend.  That realization is a growing success; and the older people are by no means the smallest element in its good fortune.  One needs to know these people  in order to understand how much the word home signifies in connection with the work of the school.  An atmosphere of quiet Christian dignity., a constant sympathy, a yearning love for children: these are some of the things which the parents contribute:  The Otsego School is a home in the most emphatic sense.''

:''It was in April, 1922 that the settled determination to establish a school took place. …''

In 1773, William Edmeston himself finally returned to America to supervise and develop personally his promising holdings west of [[w:Otsego Lake|Lake Otsego]]. But with the outbreak of the [[w:American Revolution|Revolution]], Edmeston, now a [[w:Kingdom of Great Bitain|British]] [[w:major|major]], quite naturally attracted the attention and suspicions of the patriotic element in [[w:Tryon County|Tryon County]]; and it was not long before he found himself placed on his best behavior as a parolee in either [[w:Kingston, New York|Kingston]] or [[w:Albany, New York|Albany]] (the accounts differ on this point). With Major Edmeston under the watchful eye of the Americans, the management of Mount Edmeston again fell to Carr, a known Loyalist who was strongly suspected by the patriot committees at [[w:German Flatts, New York|German Flats]] and [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] of selling provisions to the notorious [[w:Joseph Brant|Joseph Brant]]. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James H.

But the [[w:American Revolution|Revolution]] came along to ruin things.  [[w:William Edmeston|Edmeston]], as [[w:colonel:colonel]] of the [[w:British Army|British Army]], was viewed with suspicion and kept in [[w:Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[w:Kingston, New York|Kingston]].  Carr was known to be a [[w:loyalist|loyalist]] and to sell provisions to [[w:Joseph Brant|Joseph Brandt]] [''Brant''], so that the patriots at [[w:German Flatts, New York|German Flats]] and [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] kept close tabs on him. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Mary E.

{{Ed_Context|November 15 &amp;ndash; [[w:Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] approved the [[w:Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation]].}}

Upon the eastern shore of the Unadilla, opposite a portion of Brookfield, lay the Edmeston Estate. This was a large tract of land ceded to Col. Edmeston, a British officer in the French war of 1763. [''The grant for this tract was obtained by Robert and William Edmeston, in 1770''] About 1770, Col. Edmeston sent Percifer Carr, a faithful soldier who had served under him to settle upon the estate. Mr. Carr and his wife with their servants, were for a long series of years the only white inhabitants of the Unadilla valley. During the Revolution, Mr. Carr, it is believed, was friendly to the British Government. The following letter by [[w:Joseph Brant|Brant]] to Mr. Carr, in the Indian's own orthography, we extract from Campbell's ''Annals of Tryon County'' : 

::::::::::::''[[w:Unadilla|Tunadilla]], July 6 1777.''
:''M. Carr &amp;mdash; Sir: I understand that you are a friend to Government With sum of the settlers at the Butternuts is the Reason of my applying to you &amp; those people for some provisions and shall be glad you would send me what you can spare no matter what sorte for which you shall be paid you helping an account of the whole.''

That Mr. Carr was in sympathy with the cause of his countrymen and against that of the Colonies, can hardly be doubted, though there is no account that he at any time actually engaged in the struggle pending. There is no doubt, however, about one thing; that the Unadilla bore from this estate supplies to the British and Indian armies. The subjoined seems to confirm the view taken: &amp;mdash; 

::::::::::::''Tunadilla, July 9 1778.''
:''Sir: I understand by the Indians that was at your house last week, that one Smith lives near with you, has little more corn to spare. I should be much obliged to you, if you would be so kind as to try to get as much corn as Smith can spared, he has sent me five skipples already of which I am much obliged to him and will see him paid, and would be very glad if you could spare me one or two your men, to join us especially Elias. I would be glad to see him, and I wish you could sent me as many guns as you have, as I know you have no use for them if you any; as I mean now to fight the cruel rebels as well as I can; whatever you will be able to sent'd me, you must sent'd me by the bearer. I am your sincere friend and humble serv't, ''
::::::::::::''Joseph Brant.''
:''To Mr. Carr.''
:''P. S. &amp;mdash; I heard that Cherry Valley people is very bold and intended to make nothing of us. They called us wild geese but I know the contrary.         Jos. B.''

In Sep., 1778 [[w:Percifer Carr|Carr’s]] house was burned by a band of British Indians despite his loyalist leanings, and Carr was hauled off to [[w:Fort Niagara|Fort Niagara]].  Enroute he is said to have been curiously treated by the Indians, being forced to lie down and serve as a bridge at shallow streams. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Mary E.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Langworthy|George Langworthy]] bought the Carr farm from [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#DeLancy|Oliver DeLancy]] and found a large lead kettle buried in the ground and several large axes were recently found [''1926''] which by their appearance had been buried purposely.   There has been speculation as to the leaving of Carr and his family at one time.  Some have maintained he placed himself in the protection of the Indians as the [[w:Oneida tribe|Oneida Indians]] were very bitter toward the [[w:Tory|Tories]].  Others claim he was taken prisoner by the Oneidas.  However, the writer thinks he was taken prisoner by hostile Indians who knew nothing of his Tory sentiments.  

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Russell|Robert E. Russell]] acted as agent for the Edmeston heirs at one time surveying lands and selling them off as other settlers wanted them.  Some of the finest lands in [[w:Columbus, New York|Columbus]] were received by Russell for his services.  He was at one time a very wealthy man.  However, his dissolute habits and time spent at the tavern of ''Greenwood and Champlin'' proved his final ruin.  Russell boarded with [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Button|Silas Button]] who lived in a Carr house when [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#DeLancy|Warren DeLancy]] bought the Carr farm.  A [[w:powder horn|powder horn]] was found on the Carr farm and owned by the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Hoxie|Solomon Hoxie]] family.  It had the name of the maker, the date, and for whom made, with a map of the [[w:Hudson Valley|Hudson Valley]], the [[w:Mohawk Valley|Mohawk Valley]] and Albany and sketched at the top and bottom and forts and settlement in between New York and the upper lakes, etc.  ''Col. Timothy Bottles, owner; coat of arms;'' the maker was Joshua Parmenow. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Ethel Edwards'']]

The date is September 16, 1778 just one year and one month after the bloody [[w:Battle of Oriskany|battle of Oriskany]].  Since spring the western frontier in central New York has been subjected to raids and rumors of raids by Indian and [[w:Tory|Tory]] forces.

The enemy is centered around [[w:Onaquaga|Onaquaga]] [''near present-day [[w:Windsor, New York|Windsor, New York]] where Rt. 17 crosses the Susquehanna''] under the Indian chief, [[w:Joseph Brant|Joseph Brandt]] ['Brant'].  General [[w:Nickolas Herkimer|Herkimer]] had met with Brandt at Unadilla, south of Edmeston on June 28, 1777 in a peace attempt to keep the Indians of New York neutral during the Revolution.

The attempt to make peace failed and raids on border areas were a severe hardship on farmers trying to produce enough food for their families and the new nation.

Scouts assigned by the militia to keep track of enemy movements were discovered as they encountered a raiding party of 500 Indian and Tories bent on destroying [[w:German Flatts, New York|German Flatts]], westernmost settlement in the Mohawk Valley.

All the Scouts were killed near Edmeston except [[w:Adam Helmer|Adam Helmer]] who began the 40 mile run to warn the settlers of the [[w:Mohawk Valley|Mohawk Valley]].  Revolutionary Scout Adam Helmer was 24 years of age when on September 16, 1778, he ran 40 miles from Edmeston to [[w:Fort Herkimer|Fort Herkimer]] to warn the settlers of an impending raid by 500 Indians and Tories under Chief Joseph Brandt.  He was described by a descendant as thin, tall black haired, and a good runner.

[[Image:Drums along the Mohawk poster.jpg|right|'''Drums Along the Mohawk''' Poster]]

Word of mouth, fact, and legend has it that Adam Helmer ran through 40 miles of wooded, hilly terrain toward [''present-day''] [[w:Schuyler Lake, New York|Schuyler Lake]], up the west side of [[w:Canadarago Lake|Canadarago Lake]] to [''present-day''] [[w:Richfield Springs, New York|Richfield Springs]] to warn the settlers of the impending raid.  The settlement of [[w:Little Lakes, New York|Little Lakes]] may have been avoided because of the Tory sympathizers.

He continued running with Tories and Indians in pursuit to [[w:Andrustown, New York|Andrustown]] [''near present-day [[w:Jordanville, New York|Jordanville]]''] where two months before, on July 18, the settlement was destroyed in an enemy raid.  The enemy killed five and captured others before burning the buildings.  Andrustown had also been destroyed in the French and Indian wars twenty years before.  Members of the remaining families now living in Fort Herkimer had returned to harvest the remaining crops when Adam arrived in Andrustown.  Helmer ended his 40 mile run at Fort Herkimer, enabling the settlers to escape with their lives.  A few hours later Tories and Indians completely leveled their homes and crops on September 17, 1778.

The Adam Helmer Run was immortalized in the historical novel &quot;[[w:Drums Along the Mohawk|Drums Along the Mohawk]]&quot; by [[w:Walter D. Edmonds|Walter D. Edmonds]] and made into a popular movie starring [[w:Henry Fonda|Henry Fonda]]. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''anonymous'']]

[''The film version, directed by [[w:John Ford|John Ford]], omitted Helmer's run and a good deal else from the book.'']

==[[w:1800|1800]]==
This settlement had gained the name ''&quot;[[w:Peet Hook|Peet Hook]]&quot;'' principally from the fact that [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Benjamin Peet]] conducted a tavern on the site of the present Brady House [''location of Fire House in 2005''].  Other [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Peet|Peets]] also settled in the locality and ''[[w:Hook|Hook]]'' is a [[w:Dutch|Dutch]] word meaning ''settlement''.  [[w:West Burlington, New York|West Burlington]] was called ''Upper Hook'' or ''Tory Hook'' or ''Moss Hook'' from the Moss family. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|''Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
Why should I mention [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Peet|Benjamin Peet]] of the early 1800s — a tavern owner?  Because this settlement is still nicknamed ''&quot;Peet Hook&quot;'' — &quot;Hook&quot; being the [[w:Dutch|Dutch]] word for settlement. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]
----
Edmeston had a [[w:physician|physician]] at this time, for [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Smith|Dr. Gaines Smith]] had come here from [[w:Vermont|Vermont]] in 1800 and was highly respected. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|''Hazel L. Jones'']]
----
The first physician in the township was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Dr. Gains Smith]] who came with his family from [[w:Vermont|Vermont]] about 1800 and settled on the road from Edmeston to [[w:West Burlington, New York|West Burlington]].  He had a large practice and was highly esteemed in the community and died in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1810s#1819|1819]] aged 75.  One of his daughters, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Smith|Diantha]], married Benjamin St.John in [[w:Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]].  Their son, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#St. John|Hon. David B. St. John]] became a resident in 1820 and became a prominent citizen.  He was Supervisor and a member of Assembly and a surveyor who surveyed much of the land in this vicinity. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Myrta Kelsey|''Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
The coming (from Vermont) in about 1800, of the township's first physician &amp;ndash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Smith|Dr. Gains Smith]] &amp;ndash; must have had a huge cultural impact on the area.  Now there was a &quot;professional&quot; to help with births, sickness, and to prolong life.  This doctor's son [''grandson [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#St. John|David B. St. John]]''] was Supervisor, member of Assembly and surveyor.  His surveying of area land enabled real property transactions to take place. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Tenbroeck|Reolff Tenbroeck]] and his wife, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Tenbroeck|Maria]], called Polly and born a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Vanderveer|Vanderveer]], came from [[w:Rock Hill, New Jersey|Rock Hill, New Jersey]].  They may have prior acquaintance with [[w:William Cooper (judge)|[Judge William] Cooper]]; it is reasonable to suppose that some contact with him had influenced them to make the long journey north and found a new home in the incredibly rich lands to which Cooper had recently acquired title.  Tradition has it that [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Tenbroeck|Polly's]] wedding dowry had been $20.000 and two black body servants.  (the actual amount of dowry is in dispute) The black servants were husband and wife.

We can only guess at the reasons why [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Tenbroeck|Reolff]] chose the thousand acres on the Westernmost boundary of Cooper holdings for his [[Dutch Valley]] home. As was the custom of the Dutch, the house was located in the center of the farm.  Was Reolff able to discern all the great natural advantages even before the land was cleared?  That we do not know, but at any rate here they located.  A saw mill was erected and the lumber cut for erection of the house.  It started as a small, story and a half structure which would later be the &quot;ell' to the mansion. —  [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Alice H. Swinney|''Alice H. Swinney, Tenbroeck heir'']]

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#N|Reverend Daniel Nash]] was one of the first clergymen to be permanently located in Otsego County beginning his labors in what were later Morris and Exeter. A house which Father Nash often conducted religious services was that of [[Percifer Carr]].

[[Percifer Carr|Carr]] claimed to be a man of strong religious convictions.

Pine knots were often used in Edmeston for lights during [[nocturnal]] fishing in the waters of the [[Unadilla River|Unadilla]].

In the same period came the first physician of all this region in the person of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Dr.Gains Smith]] from [[Vermont]] who, accompanied by his family, settled on the road leading from Edmeston Center to West Burlington.

For quite a number of years following the coming of the first settlers after the Revolution, according to an assertion once made by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Elder Stephen Taylor]], the hill lands on the Edmeston patents brought materially the higher prices in all sales made in that section. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Huntington Papers'']]

'''Ed. Gazette''' — I said I would give you as good a history of the pioneers of this town as I could from its early settlement. I will begin at the east line of the turnpike, and go through [[West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]].

The first settler was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|David Chapin]], where his son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Laurentine]] now lives.  He settled there about [[1800]] and started a [[tannery]] and a shoe shop, and used to keep as many as ten or twelve hands in his shop and tannery.  He died in [[1821]], and was buried in [[Masonic]] order.

The next settler was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|William Southworth]], on the corner where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#R|Jared Robinson]] now lives.  He sold to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#L|Deacon Lee]], father of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#L|Martin Lee]], who carries on the carding and cloth dressing, where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|John Taylor]] is now.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Rufus Graves]] was next, a [[weaver]] by trade.  He kept the first tavern and small store.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Erastus Waldo]] married his daughter, and was clerk for him until her went into business for him.

The next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Joseph Southworth]], who built where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|David Talbot]] now lives, and kept a tavern some fifty years.  The next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#K|James Kennedy]] where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Joseph Talbot]] now lives.  He built the first mill at [[Edmeston Centre]].  Next came his brother [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#K|Wm.]] where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Daniel R. Barrett]] now lives.  They were Irish from [[Cold Rain, Ireland]], and died some fifty years ago. The next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|William Bates]], on the hill where the old tavern now stands, and next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Isaac Stern]], who built a carding machine and cloth dressing mill where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Truman Bootman's]] shop now stands.

The next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|John Sheldon's]] old log house, on the site now occupied by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#A|James Ackerman]], and next the old square roofed school house, where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#J|Joslyn's]] house stands.

Then came [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#F|Prentice Fitch's]] in his log house on the hill, where Edwin Phelps now resides.  Next beyond was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Jabez Groose]], a brother of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|John Groose]], the [[cooper]].

The next was a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Scott]] on what is known as the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Walter Chapen]] place. The next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#A|Ebenezer Alby]], who had a [[distillery]] under the hill.  The next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Daniel Chapen]], who built a [[tavern]] house, and kept it until he died some fifty years ago.  His son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|John]] lives on the place.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Gabriel Bilyea]] came next, on the farm occupied by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|James Hume]], while just beyond [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#I|Ingalls]], where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Dupee]] now resides.

Next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Capt. John Gross]], the [[cooper]], then old [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Mr. Dupee]], on the premises where his grandson now resides.  Before him was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Esq. Turner]], who went South near [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]].  The next was a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Tozer]], on the premises now owned by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Orson Toles]].

We now come to [[South Edmeston, New York|South Edmeston]].  The first settlers here were [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Abel DeForest]], Gideon, his brother, and a family of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Gazlays]], who were so slow and moderate that they named the place ''snail town''.  There was also a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Mr. Welch]] — I think he was the father of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|General Augustus Welch]], of your village [''[[New Berlin, New York|New Berlin]]''], — and was a taylor by trade.

Down the river was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Philo Bennett]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Abijah Beardsly]], and a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Mr. Banks]], while further east, on the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Dupee]] road, was a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Frederick Gorham]] and two brothers by the name of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Goodrich]], where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Charles Goodrich]] now lives and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Thomas Page]].

On the other road south from the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Chapen]] place, was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#A|Deacon Aylsworth]], father of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#A|Abel Aylesworth]], who built a [[potash]] where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Joseph Brown]] now lives.  A little farther was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Esq. Silas Peet]], one of the first men in town. He had five sons among them were [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Levi]], who went to Cataragus County, and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Benjamin]], who built the first tavern, hence the name ''Peet Hook''.

On the corner where the Dennison wood mills was a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Mr. White]], the bell maker — all the name I remember — the father of your townsman [''New Berlin''], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Thompson White Esq.]]   Then was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Peter Hawkins]] and in the hollow was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Arthur Hawkins]], who built a saw mill., the first in town; Then came [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Nelson Sherwood]], where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Hiram Briggs]] now resides, and next the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Reolf Tenbrock]] place, down on the creek.  On the Deming road was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Benjamin Parker]], and on the east line was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Miragher Bennett]].  He had two sons, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|William]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Sheffield]] some twentyfive.  Beyond Bennett's was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#L|Dea. Martin Luther]], and next was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Eber Gallop]], a blacksmith who had a shingled house, sides and roof.

Next we come to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Col. Aden Deming]], who bought the battlements of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Thomas Slocum]], my Grandfather.  Then [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Deacon Stedman]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Benedict Catly]], near Col. Deming; Then a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Mr. Hawkins]], where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Ed Wales]] lives, and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Westly Tenbrock]], where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|John Doolittle]] is.  He had [[slave]]s for a good many years after he settled in town. They are buried on the Doolittle farm.  The Tenbrooks were all [[Jersey Dutch]] were good inhabitants, they had plenty of money to begin with, but most of the settlers did not.  They had to depend upon the gun for meat.  They would take turns in hunting, one week, and another the next, until they all went through the neighborhood, the rest doing his work that week. [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Esq. Peet]] told me he had not a pound of [[pork]] or [[beef]] in his house the first two years he was in town.  They lived on [[potato]]es, [[bean]]s, [[partridge]] and [[cod fish]].  You must remember this was all  woods then.  I think at that time there was not more than six or seven framed buildings in town, the rest were all log houses and barns or barracks, thatched with straw.  There were no [[saw mill]]s so they had to split [[basswood]] for their floors, no [[glass]], so they used [[paper]] soaked in [[lard]] for windows, no [[chimney]]s, so they built up a back against the logs in one end for a [[fireplace]], with a hole in the roof for the smoke to go out.  They had north and south door, and if they had too large a backlog for two men to draw in, they hitched a horse to it, the horse going in one door and out the other. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James Slocum|''James Slocum'']]

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Col Adin Deming]] came here he told me, with a bundle in a handkerchief, and an ax on his shoulder.  He took a job chopping.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|David Chapin]] built a tannery and shoe shop.  He ground his bark with a stone set up edgeways in a curb with a sweep, and the bark was broken into the curbs and was smashed by the stone — that was the way they ground bark in those days.  He kept about six hands in the shoe shop, and about the same in the tan yard.  Mr. Graves was a weaver by trade and had three daughters and two sons.  One daughter married Erastus Waldo, and the other Doct. Bingham, the third lived an old maid.  Mr. Waldo was his first clerk in his store, and afterwards built for himself near the Southworth tavern.  That was all there was of Edmeston at that time.  About this time (1808) Edmeston was set off from Burlington.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Southworth|Mr. Southworth]] had four sons and three daughters.  His oldest son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Southworth|Joseph]] went to [[Michigan]] in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1830s|1830]].  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Southworth|Thomas]] lived on the old place until he died, about twenty years ago.  He was in the [[w:War of 1812|war of 1812]], and drew a [[w:pension|pension]].  His youngest, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Southworth|Horace]], lives now in [[w:Leonardsville, New York|Leonardsville]], the rest of the family are dead.

South of Adin Deming's was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Pope|Perry Pope]].  He came into town in [[1820]] and built a [[blacksmith]] shop, and carried on the home business.  Later he built a [[sawmill]] on his place.  A little farther south was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Perkins|Caleb Perkins]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Deming|John Deming]], who died soon after he settled there.  Next the Phelps place was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Jackson|Grindley Jackson]].

This is all I can remember south of the [[w:turnpike|turnpike]].  We will next turn our attention to the north part of town.  When the first settlers came in here there were no [[w:Sawmill|saw]] or [[w:Grist mill|grist mill]]s; no roads, only marked trees.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Gross|Mr. Crowel Gross]] told me he went with his [[w:Ox|oxen]] and sled to Oaks Creeks Mill;  was gone three days, and carried grists for the neighbors.  He went all the way through the woods guided only by blazed trees, while bears and wolves were plenty.  those who could not send to the mill had a stump hollowed out by chopping in the top and putting in coals and chips and burning out a deep hole.  In this way they put the corn or other grain and mashed  it with a [[w:Pestle|pestle]].  they could get no boards so their floors were split [[w:Basswood|basswood]].  They would pick themselves out a spot in the woods on their lot, fall the trees around and chop them into the right length, and call their neighbors for miles around, who would assemble and put them up a log house the next day, and cover it with bark — or straw if it was to be had — with two windows, one on each side, with as we have said before, paper saturated with [[lard]] for glass, and two doors, one at each end, to draw the logs in, at the chimney and fire places as stated last week, being only a back of loose stone up against the logs at one end, and a hole in the roof for the smoke to go out at.  I have seen many a log drawn by a horse, but we usually draw them in by sticking an ax into one end and two men put their shoulders together and taking hold of the lever, would draw a pretty big log.  As for barns they did not have many — only once in a while one needed any, and when they did have it was of logs.  When they got to raise grain, they built what they called barracks, put up four parts, with an umbrella top thatched with straw.

It was pretty rough digging for a number of years, until the [[mill]]s and [[mechanic]]s and [[merchant]]s put in an appearance.  When one of the pioneers had chopped down timber and got it in shape, he would make a logging [[bee (gathering)|bee]], get two or three gallons of New England Rum, and the next day the logs were in great heaps. — After the logging was over they would have a wrestle, and sometimes a Rhode Island boxing scrape.  they would be a black set of fellows when it came night, for they had burned the bushes and the ground all over, but they did not care for that, for they had their lintsywoolsy, made by spinning wool and flax, and twisting it together. I have seen men come to meeting on Sunday with that dress, and barefooted.  Their wives, would come with their copious colored petticoats, short gowns and checked aprons, all made by themselves from flax and toe.  They would bring their shoes and stockings till they got almost to the meeting house, and then put them on.  Children never thought of wearing shoes in the summer.  men wore shoes all winter, with leggings.  I knew a man to chop over sixteen acres one winter, and never had a boot on his feet. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Slocum|''James Slocum'']]

The first building erected in Edmeston village (hamlet) was a still and potash building that stood in the vicinity of Perry Knights home, opposite the grist mill, where the Wharton creek was dammed in the rear of Mrs. Bessie Chase home, was built in 1801 by James and William Kennedy.  In 1836 this first mill was replaced by a stone mill, built by William Stickney.. A few years ago this stone mill was taken down by Ambler Underwood and the stones carried to Utica where he built of them a home for his daughter, Mrs. Lisle Harrington. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Kelsey|''Myrta Kelsey'']]
----
James Kennedy was an active pioneer at Edmeston Centre and with William Kennedy built the first grist mill in the town in 1801.  Later this was the sight of a stone mill.  They, also, built the first saw mill in the town about the same time.  These were located on the present East Street.  The &quot;Gazateer of 1860&quot; states: &quot;the first inn was kept at this place by Rufus Graves, a weaver by trade.&quot;  Possibly this was the first regular inn, but Percifer Carr for many years kept a public house which was well known in the surrounding country. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Jones|''Hazel L. Jones'']]
----
There were some settlements north of the Centre, but a considerable distance apart.  There was William Greene, father of Esq. St.John's wife, and Asa Jakeways, John Mitchell, David Nichols, father of Nelson Deming and William Coon's wives.  The remaining part of the town was not settled for a number of years afterwards, owing to the death of Robert Edmeston, who owned the land, and his heirs being in England it was a long time before they could get any title.  but after a time it was taken up by what they called squatters.  They would go into the woods and build themselves a log house, chop off the timber, burn it into ashes, and make them into black salts, carry them to the store to get their groceries with.  They would come down out of the woods Saturday in the afternoon, like William Tell from the mountains, with their ox teams, men, women, and children;  then there was a gala time in the afternoon. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Slocum|''James Slocum'']]

==[[w:1801|1801]]==
Before [[#1800|1800]], the nearest mill to grind people’s grain was so far away that the men had to be gone over night;  supposedly the mill was at the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|John Tunnicliff]] marker near [[Schuyler Lake, New York|Schuyler Lake]].  The damming of [[w:Wharton Creek|Wharton Creek]] in 1801 provided power so their own grist mill could be built.  No longer was that long trip necessary. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]

==[[1802]]==
In [[1802]] the [[Catskill-Susquehanna Turnpike]] Company constructed an important highway over the Indian trails.  This made Edmeston much more accessible to travelers, who might settle, and to friends or relatives seeking to join the growing settlement. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Sandra Lohnas Haggerty'']]
----
There was no other method of travel except by horseback, at that early date.  There was a rude road, which had been an Indian trail, over the Catskill mountains from the Hudson River at Catskill, to the Susquehanna at Wattles Ferry, which was at the site of the present village of Unadilla.  In 1802 and important highway was constructed over this trail by the Catskill and Susquehanna Turnpike Co. I think the Eastern part of this route is the present beautiful [[Rip Van Winkle State Highway]].  All the earliest settlers of this western part of the county and of the southern part probably came over this route.  There was another road to [[Cherry Valley]] from Albany and the Mohawk Valley. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Myrta Kelsey'']]

==[[1808]]==
The Town of Edmeston, originally a part of the town of [[Burlington, New York|Burlington]], was organized [[April 1]], 1808.  It had a population at that time of 1300. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|''Hazel L. Jones'']]
----
Edmeston was formed from the town of [[Burlington, New York|Burlington]], on the 1st of April, 1808, the same year in which [[Westford, New York|Westford]], [[Decatur, New York|Decatur]], and [[Maryland, New York|Maryland]] were organized. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#John Barber|''John Barber'']]
----
Thereafter the towns were not settled rapidly because of the talk of the [[war of 1812]], and the suppression [''impression''] by British of American Sea men.  Hence settlers did not come so rapidly as they had previously. — Up at ''Smith's Pond'', then called, now ''Summit Lake'', outlet there was a large [[flax]] works, conducted by one [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Weatherhead]].  Here afterward, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#L|George Link]] and his brother manufactured linen cloth. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Edmeston Local|''Edmeston Local'']]

'''Snail Town:''' For years, the pleasant little village of [[South Edmeston, New York|So. Edmeston]] has been locally known as Snailtown.  It is said that years ago and old resident started to climb the hill, which I shall speak of later, and that a snail that started at the same time arrived at the top before the old resident.  This was the cause of the name Snailtown being given to the hamlet.

Sixty years ago, when I rode down to Snailtown with [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#E|George Edmonds]] on his milk wagon, as we neared the foot of the hill on the east side of this hamlet we passed on out left the home of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Mr. Gilmore]]. It was a wood-colored house, where he lived with his wife and son Adrian.  As we made the turn to penetrate further into this hamlet, on the right hand we passed the barn and red painted house of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|William (Billy) Phelps]], which was located on the corner where the road led out of Snailtown to the north.  Billy's vocation was filing saws and driving his black horse around the country to buy dekin calfskins.  On the opposite corner of this north street was the well kept yard and home of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|William Calkins]], who was a merchant in the hamlet and conducted a store where a general line of dry-goods, boots, shoes, and groceries was sold.  The next building beyond to the west was the hotel [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|&quot;Hod&quot; Terry]] owned and conducted until his death, after which, his son [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Seth Terry]] operated it during his life.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Alonzo Hooker]] rented rooms in this hotel when he first entered mercantile pursuits and ran a store there until he erected a new store, which we will speak of later.  Then came the hitching sheds and barn that belonged to the hotel property.

Since that time, a new dwelling house has been erected between the Calkins home and the hotel, which was built for and owned by a [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Mrs. Cushman]], who came from New York.  Her son Charles, who was an instructor of piano music, resided with his mother and later removed to [[Sherburne, New York|Sherburne, N.Y.]]

The next building west beyond the hotel barn, was the blacksmith shop run by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Alonzo Davis]].  A driveway separated them, which led into the log yard and to the saw and grist mill of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Stephen Walling]].  this was a first class mill in all its appointments and was noted for the accuracy of its sawed products and quality of the flours and meals that was ground between its stones.  Stephen Walling was an expert millwright and had patents granted him for valuable inventions and improvements in milling machinery.

Next beyond the Davis shop was a small building in which [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Truman Waters]] trimmed carriage tops and made the cushions for the famous vehicles made by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Hiram Hooker]].  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Hershall Chase]] also had a bench there where he manufactured boots and shoes and did cobbling.  then across the driveway that led out from the mill property was the well built residence of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Stephen Walling]].

The next house there was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Tracy Hawley]], an expert carriage painter lived.  Mr. Hawley did the painting and decorating of the wagons and sleighs made in Hiram Hookers carriage works for many years.  The writer, when 15 years old worked for Tracy in the shop for a time.  Then came the two mercantile establishments, run as general stores.  One was conducted by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|William Calkins]] and the other by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|Nelson Matterson]] at that time.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#L|Lewis Lamb]] occupied one of these at a later date, where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Hon. C. L. Banks]] served a clerkship when a young man.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Dr. Wiltsie]] occupied a small office building near the little brook that crosses the street here.

This completes the North side of the street as far as my memory allows.  On the south side opposite the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|&quot;Billy&quot; Phelps]] residence was a house and barn that was occupied by tenants and a short distance west was the house then occupied by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Milton Hubby]], a very devout man. With Mr. Hubby lived his widowed sister, [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#F|Mrs. Caroline Fox]], and a lady named [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#T|Nellie Tilton]], who later married [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Dr. E.Darwin Hayward]].  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Alonzo Davis]] resided next in a house nearly opposite his blacksmith shop, which we have mentioned, across the street.  The next house was occupied by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Orin Howard]] and his daughter [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Helen]], a maiden lady.  Mr. Howard was justice of the peace for a long term of years.

Then we come to the residence of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Hiram Hooker]] and his wagon shops, which occupied all the street as far as the little brook, across which was the house and lot owned by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Alonzo Hooker]], where he erected a store when he moved from the hotel.  This property was sold to [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Leon S. Page]], who conducted this store many years and now enjoys a lucrative business there.

Here we cross the road that enters the hamlet from the south and on this west corner was the residence of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|John Palmer]], who was the vulcan at the forge in the blacksmith shop of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Hiram Hooker's]] carriage works for many years.  His craftsmanship may have been equaled, but was never surpassed.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Caleb Card]] was a skilled man, who made the wheels and woodwork, with the utmost precision for the Hooker wagons for a long term of years.  A [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#M|Mr. Morse]], who worked at another bench, at gear and body construction, turned out work without a flaw.

We will now go down the west side of the street leading south.  The first building beyond the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|John Palmer]] house was the church that was but recently built at that time.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Arthur Spurr]] lived next beyond and in the rear was located the cheese factory, which was erected by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Albert C. Parker]] and then was being operated by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Arthur Spurr]]. Then we passed the homes of [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Angelia Graham]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Henry Holt]], whose wife [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Malena]], was the author of several books of fiction.  Beyond these lived [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Smith Schemerhorn]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Eunice Spicer]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Leon Page]].

We will now recall those who — Beyond the [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|&quot;Billy&quot; Phelps]] home was where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#H|Charles Hooker]] lived.  He followed the vocation of carpenter and builder.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Lon Page]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#P|Frank Page]] lived on this north street and both were carpenters.

The mason and brick laying trade was ably represented by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#L|Joseph K.Lloyd]] and [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Orlando Brooks]].  The vocation that followed in ancient days by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Tubal Cain]], was taken care of by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Andrew Dutcher]], who had his home and shop on this street and was the father of three very attractive daughters.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Joseph Gilmore]] also lived on north street.  If there were others I fail to recall.

Well! Well! I have rambled around Snailtown until [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#E|George Edmonds]] has gone home from the cheese factory and left me to walk home.  But it is not too far across lots, up the east hill and through [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Roswell Simmons']] pasture.  So long. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References|''Spencer B. Pope'']]
----
The first settlers in [[South Edmeston, New York|South Edmeston]] were [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Abel and Gideon Deforest]], and a family of Gazleys who were so slow and moderate that they named the place &quot;Snailtown&quot;. — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L.

'''The history of [[w:Edmeston, New York|Edmeston, New York]]: 1830 through 1839'''

==[[w:1830|1830]]==
By 1830 Edmeston had added to its other places of business a store, a tannery, and a post office [''opened in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1810s#1816|February 20, 1816]]''].  The store had been opened in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1820s#1824|1824]] by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Lyman White|Lyman White]], near the Peet Tavern and the tannery had been built by [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#John Bilyea|John Bilyea]] on this same street at the foot of the hill.  Despite the fact that there were few houses in Edmeston Center in 1830, the Town of Edmeston in that year had its largest population, 2087. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''
----
[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Esq. David Chapen]] carried on a large shoe shop, and also a tannery, keeping six or eight hands each.  In the shoe shop was [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#C|Pitman Cook]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|John Bilyea]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Mason Davis]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Pardon Wolley]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#B|Elisha Burnam]], [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Waterman Davis]], and others.  John Bilyea built the first tannery at the Centre.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#S|Thomas Southworth]] had a shoe shop on the corner, where [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#R|Jared Robinson]] now lives and kept four or five hands.   [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#G|Rufus Graves]] also ran a shoe shop, and employed several hands, and all had all they could do.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#D|Col. Aden Deming]] lived among the Shakers until he was 21, when he pulled out and settled the farm where he died in 1847, aged 79 years.  He was in the [[w:War of 1812|War of 1812]].  He called out his company and volunteered himself, and Benjamin Hopkins, Thomas Southworth, Israel Taylor, Joseph Howard, Ruben Rosier, and Merrill Lewis.  But the Col. and Hopkins were taken sick and did not stay long — Col. Deming became a great farmer having 500 or 600 acres [''2 to 2.4 km²''] of land all in a body.  Besides he had a timber lot in Norwich, and one in Pitsfield.  He built a saw mill on his land, and had a room furnished in the corner with a stove and bed in it, and I have heard his wife say he would often stay there from Monday morning until Saturday night.  He kept a large stock of cattle and sheep, for them days and made butter and cheese and fatted a good deal of pork.  I have known him to start for Albany with four or five teams with butter, and cheese and pork.  When he washed his sheep. all hands went, and when they were done all hands must play ball until chore time.  he would sit and keep tally, and hold the jug.  I remember I reaped for him one day in a seventy acre [''283,000 m²''] lot of [[rye]].  We could just reap through and bind back by dinner time.  He had hands that worked for seven or eight years in succession.  Among them were Mr. Catly, Mr. Forbush, Edwin Phelps, George Tyler, and Aaron Noble.  He was poor master in town for a great many years and I don't think he ever had a charge against the town in the time.  He would take those who applied to him for aid home with him and, make them pay their way.  He was a very thorough man, never hurried his hands, but they must keep busy.  His rule was, when chopping down a tree, never to look up after he struck it until it was half off, no matter how large it was.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#W|Erastus Waldo]] was a noble man;  He held some town office the most of the time until he left town.  Martin Lee was a man of some note and held several offices.  Esq. David Chapen was justice of the peace from the time the town was organized in 1808 until his death in 1821.  Mr. Rufus Graves was a noted man, the first to keep a tavern in town.  He had two sons, Rufus and Amos.  Rufus died here some sixty years ago, but Amos went to Michigan, where he died some twenty years ago.

There were many substantial men here at that time.  I can remember when they held town meetings in the school house.  they would come together and say &quot;Who shall we have for Supervisor?  Someone would nominate Mr. Waldo, or some other person, and he was elected, and so on through until all officers were elected, and then get home before night.  Isaac Brown held the office of Town Clerk for over twenty years in succession.  Silas Peet was justice of the peace for a great many years, and held other offices.

[[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Joseph Bootman|Joseph Bootman]] was a cloth dresser and wool carder and bought out Mr. Stern. He was father of our townsmen Truman and Edgar Bootman.  Wm. Stickney came here about 1820, and in company with Samuel Simmons, started a trip hammer shop below the mill. m They also manufactured scythes and rifle barrels.  John Bilyea built the first tannery at the centre.  Lyman White the first store, where the old tavern now stands.  Nelson Green built a blacksmith shop and forge, where his son Lewis now hods forth.  Captain John Gross a cooper shop to the west and Arthur Hawkins a saw mill a little south.  Perry and Pierce Pope, a blacksmith and hame shop at South Edmeston.  About this time Wm. Stickney bought the mills and the Kennedy farm, built a large house and lived there until he died, some thirty years ago. — ''Yours truly, [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#James Slocum|James Slocum]]''

From 1830-1860 Edmeston Center continued to increase in population and improve in appearance.  In 1836 the grist mill which had been built by the Kennedy brothers in 1801, was replaced by a stone mill.  (The stone from that mill now,1953, forms a large part of Dr. L.N.Harrington&quot;s home in Utica, N.Y.. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''

At an early date a [[still]] and [[potash]] building was erected on the upper side of the road from the [[grist mill]] and in 1832 Charles Hammond and Wright Caulkins built a cabinet shop and dwelling not far from the present opera house site.

In 1832 Nathan Hoxie came and settled on a farm near the villages of West Edmeston and South Edmeston.  His sons Samuel and Solomon did much to promote the agricultural interests of the town and greatly improved the dairying industry by introducing new and better breeds of cattle.  Samuel Hoxie was a leading member of the Unadilla Stock-breeders Association and was instrumental in its organization. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L.

In 1833 our father was sent to the legislature (Philo Bennet) and spent two winters, I think in Albany. I remember when he came home one time, he had the stage coach stop at the school house and take us children home with him, which was fine for us.  He brought a number of song books, new and very charming songs, a bolt of small neat figured calico.  Calico was of some account in those days; and a Chintz dress for mother, a dark ground with small bright roses all over it, very fine, but she feared to gay for her.  It was made with large sleeves, such as are worn now (Dec. 21, 1895), with pillows of down to make them puff out. She wore cape with full pleated boarder trimmed and tied with ribbon, such was the style, and a woman at forty was considered old.   — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Matilda C.

All the original building erected in Edmeston village [hamlet] was &quot;on the hill&quot; on East Street.  As late as 1834 there was but one street running east and west and there were but 16 houses from where the late Fred Hickling lived to the home of Howard P. Talbot. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Sandra Lohnas Haggerty|Sandra Lohnas Haggerty]]''

My father moved into Edmeston when I was 12 years old in 1834.  At that time there was but one street in the Village, the one running east and west and but 16 houses from where Reuben Talbot now lives to the present residence of Israel Talbot, about a mile [''2km''] apart. [''1953, Dorr Hickling and Howard P. Talbot respectively''].  About 1840 my husband bought a little over three acres [''12,000 m²''] of land on the corner and built what is known today as the Gaskin House [''1992 location of the central National Bank'']. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Esther Preston|Esther Preston]]''

==[[w:1835|1835]]==
Besides the settlements already mentioned, two others had been made in the Town of Edmeston on the [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]].  The one in the northwestern part of the town was first called ''Coonsville'', or ''Coontown'' because so many people by the name of Coon settled there.  [[History of Edmeston, New York/People#Coon|John S. Coon]] was born in [[w:Plainfield, New York|Plainfield]], Otsego County, in [[History of Edmeston, New York/1800s#1807|1807]].  When he was 28 years of age (1835) he built a furnace (at what is now [[w:West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]]) In which he made all kinds of farming implements, and continued to follow the same trade for some twenty years, then he manufactured wagons and cutters.  For many years he was the sole owner of all the mills at West Edmeston. — ''[[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|Hazel L. Jones]]''

One of the most prosperous stores in 1860 was that of '''Ephraim Chamberlain''', located &quot;under the hill&quot; on the northeast side of the four corners.  He dealt in general merchandise, groceries, etc.  In those days the merchants bought their goods in [[w:New York City|New York City]] or [[w:Utica, New York|Utica]] or [[w:Albany, New York|Albany]], but principally in the last named city.  They would go twice a year to the city and buy enough stock to last six months.  Much teaming was done during these years between Edmeston and Albany, over the [[w:Great Western Turnpike|Great Western Turnpike]] a state built¹ road from Albany to [[w:Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] and [[w:Bath, New York|Bath]] via [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]], Edmeston and [[w:Sherburne, New York|Sherburne]].

The following excerpt is from the '''''[[w:Gazetteer|Gazetteer]] of the State of New York''''' by J. H. French. Published by R. Pearsall Smith [[w:Syracuse, New York|Syracuse, N.Y.]] 1860.

:'''''EDMESTON''''' -- was formed from [[w:Burlington, New York|Burlington]], April 1, 1808. It lies upon the W. border of the co., N. of the center. The surface is elevated upland, broken by numerous irregular valleys. The highest elevations are 400 to 500 ft. above [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]], which forms the W. boundary. [[w:Wharton Creek|Wharton Creek]] flows across the S. E. corner. Mill Creek and several other small streams take their rise in the town. Smiths Pond is a small sheet of water in the N. E. corner. The soil is a sandy and clayey loam. Edmeston Center (Edmeston p.o.) contains 3 churches, a grist and saw mill, and tannery. Pop. 275. [[w:West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]], ([[w:postal village|p.v.]],) on Unadilla River, and partly in Brookfield, (Madison co.,) contains a church and 35 houses. [[w:South Edmeston, New York|South Edmeston]], ([[w:postal village|p.v.]],) on the Unadilla, contains 30 houses. Of the first settlement in town, authentic data of the precise date are wanting. It was made, however, on Unadilla River, during the interval between the close of the French War, in 1763, and the commencement of that of the Revolution, in 1775, by Col. Edmeston, an officer of the French War, and [[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]], a faithful soldier who had served under him.¹ The first church (Bap.) was formed at [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]], March 8, 1794; Rev. Stephen Taylor was the first preacher.²

:#At the close of the war, [[w:William Edmeston|Col. Edmeston]], for his military services, received the grant of a tract of land covering a large portion of the town on which he made the first settlement. At his death the lands fell to heirs and minor children residing in England, from whom no safe title could be obtained for many years, &amp;mdash; which greatly retarded the settlement of the town.  During the [[w:American Revolution|American Revolution]], the hired men of Mr. Carr were killed while at work, his barn burned, his property destroyed, and himself and family were taken prisoners by the [[w:United Kingdom|British]] and Indians and detained to the close of the war. '''Abel De Forest''' and '''Gideon De Forest''' were among the early settlers on the Unadilla; '''Aden Deming''' and '''James Kenada''', at Edmeston; and '''Stephen Taylor''', on Taylor Hill, where the first school was taught. '''Rufus Graves''' kept the first inn; and James Kenada erected the first gristmill, both at Edmeston Center.

Patent Claims Issued from the United States Patent Office for the week ending January 10, 1860:

:26,743. — '''Levi A. Beardsley''', of South Edmeston, N. Y., for an Improvement in Hop Frames:

:I claim the employment of a frame holder composed of a sliding box, K, with a windlass or seller to tighten the wire, and a vertical bed or strip, G, to guide or support the box. K. substantially as and or the purpose shown and described.

HOP FRAMES

This invention relates to a device for lowering the vines and bringing them within reach, for the facility of gathering the hops, and then for elevating them again to their original position, keeping the horizontal cords or wires, upon which the vines are entwined, under tension all the time. This invention consists in attaching to the posts a vertical strip with a small grooved pulley in its top over which passes a cord, which is attached to a sliding box for elevating and depressing this box, and to this sliding box is connected a yoke provided with a hook which hooks into an eye or loop on the end of the wires forming the frame upon which wires the vines are twined; the object being to tighten up these wires, and to keep them under tension while raising and lowering them. '''L. A. Beardsley''', of Edmeston, N. Y., is the patentee. &amp;mdash; [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1002%2F&amp;tif=00062.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1002-6&amp;coll=moa&amp;frames=1&amp;view=100 Scientific American/New Series, Volume 2, Issue 4, Pub.

MAGNETIZED WHEELS OF LOCOMOTIVES &amp;mdash; A TIMELY HINT TO INVENTORS,

MESSRS. EDITORS: &amp;mdash; When I notice the experiments that have been tried to make the driving wheels of a locomotive adhere to the rails by the application of magnetism to the wheels, I wonder why I did not put forth a suggestion noted down in my private journal, under date of March 21, 1848. But I have now to regret, like many other inventors, the folly of procrastination. The entry in my journal reads thus: &amp;mdash; &quot;Would a magnetized wheel rolling on a soft iron bar not slip, yet roll with ease; the driving wheels of a locomotive, for instance, being so covered with coils of wire that a portion or the whole of the circumference of it will be magnetized?&quot; I send you this to show that this invention was thought of some time prior to the claims of the present inventor, and for the forcible warning it gives to every inventor to secure, by Letters Patent, every good improvement as soon as it is made. '''L. A. B.''' South Edmeston, N. Y., Jan. 31, 1860.  &amp;mdash; [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1002%2F&amp;tif=00122.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1002-10 Scientific American/New Series, Volume 2, Issue 8, Pub.

==1895==
The [[w:New Berlin, New York|New Berlin]] branch of the [[w:New York Ontario &amp; Western Railway|New York Ontario &amp; Western Railway]] ran from [[w:Cooperstown Junction, New York|Cooperstown Junction]], (just north of [[w:Sidney, New York|Sidney]]) to New Berlin.  In 1895 the branch was extended north to Edmeston, when the Wharton Valley Railroad agreed to lease the line to the NYO&amp;W. In [[History of Edmeston, New York/1940s#1941|1941]] the entire New Berlin branch was sold to the [[w:Unadilla Valley Railway|Unadilla Valley Railway]] which ran the branch until [[History of Edmeston, New York/1960s#1960|1960]] when operations stopped.

==1898==
Aug 24, 1898, The new '''First Day Baptist Church''' building was opened in [[w:West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]].  The idea for a Church was conceived in January of 1897.  In Feb. of 1898  the Church was formally organized and admitted to the Otsego county Baptist Association. &amp;mdash; ''First Day Baptist Church, Memories of West Edmeston''

The new school is a beautiful structure combining Gothic and Corinthian styles of architecture.  It is heated by steam, has an approved system of lighting and perfect system of ventilation.  All of the air in the entire building can be changed every twenty minutes without reducing the temperature.  Fresh air is supplied directly from out doors by means of flues.  It may be passed around the boilers and warmed and thus brought into the rooms, warm and pure, or it may come directly to the rooms if desired.  In any case every pupil and teacher has a constant supply of pure air and thus be considered a very important feature by every thinking person.  We have no more complaints about the head aching; and that dull, heavy listless attitude of the pupil has disappeared. The interior of the building is even more important than the exterior;  it is finished with oak throughout, the casements and so on are fine examples of art and workmanship.  The walls are covered with stained paper of delicate green and finished with flowers and numerous specimens of animals and birds, nicely mounted and protected by glass cases.  In fact the air of the entire building must inspire within the mind of every student an admiration for the beauty of art and the simplicity of adornment, because while it is rich and complete in all its appointments, still nothing has been overdone. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#The Edmeston Local|''The Edmeson Local'']]</text>

[[w:Susan Fenimore Cooper|Susan Fenimore Cooper]], in her ''Small Family Memories'', recalled that during the period of her father [[w:James Fenimore Cooper|James Fenimore Cooper's]] temporary return to [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]], [[w:1813|1813]]-[[w:1817|1817]], he was &quot;quite intimate&quot; with a Mr. Edmeston, an Englishman &quot;of property&quot; who kept &quot;bachelor's hall&quot; with fellow countryman [[w:James Aitchison|James Aitchison]], the man to whom Cooper later dedicated ''[[w:The Spy|The Spy]]''.

*'''Reverend Daniel Nash''' (1763-June 4 1837) was one of the first clergymen to be permanently located in [[w:Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]], beginning his labors in what were later [[w:Morris (town), New York|Morris]] and [[w:Exeter, New York|Exeter]]. A house in which Father Nash often conducted religious services was that of [[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]]. &amp;mdash; [[History of Edmeston, New York/1800s#1800|''(1800)'']]

:The Reverend Daniel Nash was born in [[w:Great Barrington, Massachusetts|Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].  He graduated from [[w:Yale University|Yale University]], became a teacher, joined the [[w:Episcopal Church|Episcopal Church]], and studied for ordination. In the 1790's, he moved to [[w:New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon, New York]], taught school and became a lay leader in the Church. While there, he met Miss Olive Lusk, who later became his wife and partner in missionary work. 

:Traveling to the &quot;wilds&quot; of Otsego County, they lived in various one room cabins built of unhewn logs, with scarcely a pane of glass to let in light sufficient to read the Bible. Sunday mornings, he, Olive and child would make the trek to Exeter and Morris for services. Fr. Nash officiated and preached, and Olive led the responses and singing. 

:On October 11 1801, Daniel Nash was ordained to the priesthood by the [[w:Benjamin Moore|Rt. Rev. Benjamin Moore]], the newly consecrated Bishop of New York. The Bishop reflected upon this event and wrote &quot; Yesterday I ordained Fr. Nash a priest; and it affords me no little satisfaction to reflect that the first act of my Episcopal function has been employed in elevating to the priesthood so worthy a man.&quot; 

:Fr. Nash's ministry was marked by great devotion and energy, going from home to home, catechizing, teaching, and baptizing whole families. He preached to the Oneida Indians, and was loved by children. From 1804 to 1816, when the area was still wilderness, Nash reported 496 baptisms, and organized or founded at least 12 parishes in the Diocese of Albany. 

:At his death Fr. Nash left the words
::''Say, if you please, that I die in the faith of the Son of God. Of myself I am nothing. I trust alone in the merit and death of a crucified savior for pardon and acceptance.''

:He was buried beside his wife Olive who had died 20 years earlier. 
::&amp;mdash; [http://www.albanyepiscopaldiocese.org/about/revdnash.html Albany Episcopal Diocese: ''Reverend Daniel Nash 1763-1837'']

:The first even quasi-regular religious services in Richfield were performed by the redoubtable Father Daniel Nash, who founded numerous Episcopal churches in the county, presided at the funeral of Hannah Cooper in 1800, and became the first rector of Christ Church in Cooperstown. Nash himself thoroughly deserves a sketch among the founders of this country. No one should be misled by the supposed portrait of him as &quot;Mr. Grant&quot; in The Pioneers. It is, as one of Nash's own successors observed, much too &quot;anemic and depressing&quot; a portrait to serve for so rugged an apostle in the wilderness as Daniel Nash. One of Beardsley's best anecdotes relates to an occasion when Nash was to preach in the new school house. As he was about to begin, all of the males in the congregation ran off into the woods to chase a bear. The bear was killed, brought back, and barbecued. Nash partook heartily of the feast, declaring the hunt only a venial offense against the Sabbath.  The school in which Nash preached had been erected by a building bee as soon as &quot;six or seven families had settled within striking distance.&quot;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

      <comment>/* Course Structure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Welcome. This is a wikibook about the Edexcel A-level course for mathematics. Whilst it is aimed at students studying the course, it may be of interest to other readers, especially those taking other mathematics courses or considering taking an A-level mathematics course. 

This book is intended a revision aid. It is recommended that you use a textbook as well as this, as this may not cover the entire course. This wikibook is NOT endorsed by Edexcel.

More information about the course can be found in Edexcel's [http://www.edexcel.org.uk/VirtualContent/83441/GCE_Mathematics_Specification.pdf course specification]

== Course Structure ==
A-level courses generally last for two years. In the first year, you are most likely to take Core Mathematics 1 and 2, and one applied module. This will get you your Advanced Subsidiary (AS) qualification. In your second year, you will take Core Mathematics 3 and 4, and another applied module. This will get you your A-level qualification.

If you are doing the Further Mathematics A-level, you will probably do the above in the first year, and in the second year, you will do Further Pure Mathematics 1, either or both of Further Pure Mathematics 2 and 3, and three or four more applied modules. The AS qualification is restricted to Further Pure Mathematics 1 and one of any other unit not used in Mathematics. There is also a Further Mathematics (Additional) AS and A-level, available on top of the Further Mathematics A-level.

There is also an A-level in Pure Mathematics alone, composed of Core Mathematics 1 to 4 and Further Pure Mathematics 1, and one unit out of Further Pure Mathematics 2 and 3. Its AS contains Core Mathematics 3, unlike the Mathematics A-level which include Core Mathematics 3 as part of the A2 section. The AS and A-level in Pure Mathematics cannot be combined with any other mathematics-related qualification.

The Further Pure units and Decision units have been revised with effect from the January 2009 examinations. The former Further Pure units will only continue until January 2010, overlapping with the introduction of the new Further Pure units; the former Decision units have been replaced by the new.

== Modules ==

These are the modules I aim to have written for eventually. There are more, so if anyone is kind enough to help, please do.

== Kynning (Self Introduction) ==
Read the following self introductions from two Icelanders who are telling about themselves, what languages they speak, where their family comes from and what their names are. There will of course be some new words in these introductions that you will not be familiar with. Try to use your prior English knowledge to figure out some of the meanings. Write down words that you definitely cannot figure out or understand, and read the vocabulary box below. Once you have read over the vocabulary, try to read again the introductions for a better understanding and comprehension.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Core Mathematics 1''' ('''C1'''), is the first A-level mathematics module, and provides a foundation for the other modules. It is also the only module in which calculators are not allowed, so it is important to ensure you understand this module. The examination consists of one 1½ hour paper of around ten questions. The main company that writes these questions are Edexcel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to display your XML data in an HTML table and display alternate rows using a colored background.

== Data File ==

Assume you have a data file such as the following XML file which is a sample glossary of terms and definitions:

=== terms.xml ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;terms&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;
      &lt;term-name&gt;Object&lt;/term-name&gt;
      &lt;definition&gt;A set of ideas,
      
      &lt;/definition&gt;
   &lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;
      &lt;term-name&gt;Organization&lt;/term-name&gt;
      &lt;definition&gt;A unit consisting of people and processes established
      to perform some functions&lt;/definition&gt;
   &lt;/term&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;
      &lt;term-name&gt;Organization&lt;/term-name&gt;
      &lt;definition&gt;BankOfAmerica&lt;/definition&gt;
   &lt;/term&gt;
&lt;/terms&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;term&gt; tags will repeat for each term in your glossary.

You would like to display these terms in an HTML table.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-HTML-Table-screen-image.jpg|frame|center|HTML table screen image]]

The following XQuery will perform the task.

== Sample Code ==

== Discussion ==

=== Sorting before counting ===
There are two nested for loops.  The outer loop has the additional '''at count''' parameter that increments a counter for each result returned.  The inner loop has the loop that returns a generic sorted item to the outer loop.  Note that the inner loop does the sorting first and the outer loop does the counting of each item so that alternate rows are shaded.

Note that if you know the original file is in the correct order the nested for loops are not necessary.  A single for loop with the '''at $count''' is all that is needed.

=== Dynamic Element Construction ===

The following lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; {if ($count mod 2)
         then (attribute bgcolor {'Lavender'})
         else ()}
&lt;/source&gt;

conditionally creates a light blue background color for odds rows, rows which evaluate true because modulus 2 of their $count is not zero.  This is an example of dynamic element construction.

Odd rows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;Lavender&quot;&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Even rows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It does this by conditionally adding an attribute bgcolor=&quot;Lavender&quot; for odd rows in the table.  If the test ($count mod 2) is zero, i.e. on even rows, an attribute will not be added.

It is recommended best practice that the style of shading alternate rows of a table be done in a central cascading style sheet. The most general way to keep the table formats standard throughout your site would be to add semantic class tags to each row to label them even or odd.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; {if ($count mod 2)
         then (attribute  class  {'even'})
         else (attribute  class  {'odd'})}
&lt;/source&gt;

The CSS file would then contain the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.odd {background-color: Lavender;}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Embryonic Stem Cells ==
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), by definition, are primary cell cultures that have the ability to proliferate indefinitely  with unlimited differentiation potential, both in vitro and vivo. Each ESC has the property of pluripotency, or rather the ability to differentiate into any cell type found in somatic tissues, including germ cells. All ESCs maintain the property of self-renewal, whereas each ESC can divide to form two clonal daughter cells, each with the exact same properties as the original ESC. An ESC may divide asymmetrically as well, meaning one clonal ESC is produced as well as another daughter cell destined for differentiation. With these combined properties, the current and potential applications of ESCs for use in biomedical and biotechnological applications is advancing rapidly.

==History==

Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, several investigators began working with an specific type of tumor. This tumor, termed a teratocarcinoma, contained within it many fully-developed tissues normally associated with embryonic and fetal development (including teeth, hair, gut-epithelial tissue, etc.). The disorganized tumor containing fully differentiated tissues suggested that certain primordial cell types were directing its aberrant growth. Eventually, it was discovered that these tumors were related to germ-cell tumors, specifically those arising from the testis. These germ-cell carcinomas led directly to modern embryonic stem cell basic research as a first-cause investigation into the origin of the programming that led to the tumors.

By the 1980's research into mouse embryogenesis was advanced enough to allow for the first isolation and characterization of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by Evans and Kaufman in the 1980's. These cells were isolation on a monolayer of mitotically-inactivated mouse primary fibroblast feeder cells, aka &quot;feeders&quot; or &quot;MEFs&quot;. It was found that the addition of these support cells was necessary for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of the mESCs in fetal bovine serum-containing media. The replicative and proliferative properties were noticed immediately by researchers, and so more thorough investigations into the mechanisms that allowed these cells to grow like cancer cell lines, but have the properties of primary cell cultures. 

Shortly thereafter it was discovered by Dr. Austin Smith that the primary contribution of the feeders is Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), an IL-6 cytokine family member, that is secreted into the growth media and activates the LIF-JAK-STAT3 pathway to promote mESC self-renewal. These cells were further analyzed to express the canonical markers of pluripotency: Oct3/4, the master transcription factor responsible for the &quot;stem-ness&quot; of the cell; Sox-2, another transcription factor suggested to help re-model the epigenome; Nanog, like Oct3/4, a master pluripotency regulator, and Rex-1, a gene helps regulate the pluripotency network established by the previous three genes. LIF-supplemented culture medium has been sufficient thus far in maintaining most mouse ESC lines for lengthy passages (&gt;P50). However, many &quot;feeder-free&quot; cell lines have adapted to the differing culture conditions by becoming karyotypically abnormal. This again, reflects the need to understand the fundamental self-renewal mechanism to better control these cells in vitro.

Recently, however it has been demonstrated that for feeder-dependent cells lines, LIF is not enough to maintain the pluripotent undifferentiated state once the feeders are removed from the culture system. This so-called mESC &quot;crisis&quot; was first described by Sir Martin Evans. Investigations have tried to identify another soluble factor that may promote self-renewal or actively block differentiation cues, however no known factor has been implicated as yet. Several studies have suggested that the cell-dependent contact is the missing factor, and so many studies have implicated the extra-cellular matrix as a likely candidate. So far, though, the elusive self-renewal factor in mESCs remains un-identified. For most basic research applications however, the current culture system, although hetereogenous, is satisfactory for conducting rigorous testing.

The first human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line was derived in 1998 by Dr. James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin. These cells, like their murine counterparts, require a feeder cell layer to remain undifferentiated. Unlike mouse cells however, is their insensitivity to LIF for self-renewal. hESCs require bFGF, and in some cases, Activin A. A consistent media formulation is still being being debated by different researchers, so there is considerable variation between laboratories in the manner in which the hESC lines are maintained. This debate has fueled the dialogue necessary to develop a standard media for both human and mouse ESCs. Scientists in the field are trying to rid the culture system of the feeders, in hopes of homogenizing culture conditions. But a limited understanding of which signal pathway(s) are involved in both mouse and human ESCs are hindering this movement. Another obvious problem is the lack of homology between human and mouse ESC lines. Other than a few pluripotency markers, such as Oct3/4, Sox-2, Nanog, and Rex-1, differentiation  and self-renewal protocols used for each species is disparate at best. Yet, the potential applications for each are still better in comparison to the current tools available to researchers and clinicians now.

==Who is this book for?==
This book is aimed at anyone who wishes to learn how to use Bryce effectively and easily as well as anyone who wishes to use it as a reference.

==What is Bryce?==
Bryce is a 3D graphics program which specializes in creating and rendering landscapes and terrains. Usually this capability is restricted to high end software packages that tend to be quite expensive. This is not the case with Bryce since DAZ 3D - the company that now own Bryce - have released it for free.

==Capabilities==
[[Image:BryceScene.JPG|thumb|200px|An example of what can be achieved using Bryce]]
Although it is released free of charge, Bryce is a very powerful package capable of creating some stunning scenes. With practice it is possible to create anything you wish with it. The image opposite was created using Bryce 5.5.

==Software==
Bryce 5.5 can be downloaded from the [http://www.daz3d.com/bryce55 DAZ 3D] website and while Bryce is the only product required to render the scenes, it is helpful to have an image editing program on the side for some of the more advanced topics. Paint Shop Pro or PhotoImpact are fine. If these aren't available then you can make do perfectly well with MS Paint.

==Hardware==

Surprisingly for a graphics package Bryce isn't very memory hungry which is good news if you're running an older system. You should be able to run it comfortably with 356MB RAM. On the downside it is very processor intensive whilst rendering and can take over an hour to render complicated scenes and terrains. A dual or quad processor system is definitely an advantage here.

==The Bryce Window==

The main window is split up into 5 parts:
*Viewport controls (left hand side)
*Create and edit controls (top)
*Main viewing window
*Selection Tools (bottom)
*Display controls (bottom right)

==Creating a scene==
Almost all scenes in Bryce have 3 things in common:
*A ground plain
*A water Plain
*A terrain object

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:44, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:44, 17 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

Actually, this is legitimate. The Decoy Detonator is a Weasley's Wizard Wheezes product that has a cameo in book 6 and a small part in book 7. I believe we even link to it from those locations. I will be expanding it later today. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:50, 17 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

== The Agenda ==

The agenda is a queue that contains all the rules whose conditions have been met and are capable of firing. The inference engine will examine the rules on the agenda, and determine which rules will be acted upon.

=== Conflict ===

When there are 2 or more rules on the agenda, that is when there are several rules whose conditions have been met and are prepared to be fired. In these cases, the inference engine needs to decide which rules to fire, and which order to follow them in. 

== Rule Order ==

There are many different ways that the inference engine can decide which rules to fire on the agenda, and in which order.

=== First In, First Out ===

First in, first out (FIFO) means that rules are added to the agenda in the order which they appear in the knowledge base, and the inference engine fires rules in the same order in which they appear in the agenda.

=== Precedence ===

In a precedence system, each rule is given a precedence value, and rules with the higher precedence are fired. The problem with these systems, is that there is a temptation for the programmer to assign precedence values in such a way as to duplicate a procedural program.

Manually scripting the exact order in which rules fire is generally a bad idea.
Expert systems are far more robust when the knowledge engineer, instead, collects rules which are true no matter which order they are fired.

=== Number of Antecedents ===

Rules which have more antecedents, and therefore have more requirements, are likely to be more accurate, and more likely to lead to a goal quickly. This is the kind of logic that leads to systems which fire rules based on the number of antecedents.</text>

== Knowledge ==

== Rules ==

Rules are structured as &quot;if&quot;/&quot;then&quot; rules as follows:

 IF X THEN Y

Here, '''X''' is known as the '''antecedent''' and '''Y''' is known as the '''consequent'''. The antecedent represents a series of requirements, and if those requirements are satisfied, then the actions in the consequent are performed.</text>

== Backward Chaining ==

In a backward chaining system, the inference engine selects a goal, and then attempts to find evidence to support or disprove that goal. If a goal is disproved, a new goal is selected and new evidence is searched for to support it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mathematics revolves around '''Algebra''', so sufficient knowledge of this is essential. You should recognise most of this from your GCSE course, but it's important to ensure you understand this.

= Pure Maths 1, Module 1, Algebra =

== Collecting like terms ==

Several terms in the same unknown can be contracted, or collected together, making them much easier to work with, for example, &lt;math&gt;6x + 2x = 8x&lt;/math&gt;, similarly, the same works with subtraction, &lt;math&gt;5y - 3y&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;2y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Laws of indices ==

1. &lt;math&gt;x^a \times x^b = x^{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;.

 For example, &lt;math&gt;x^3 \times x^2&lt;/math&gt;. This is the same as &lt;math&gt;(x \times x \times x) \times (x \times x)&lt;/math&gt;. Or &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x \times x \times x = x^5 = x^{3+2}&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;x^a \div x^b = x^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;.

 For example, &lt;math&gt;x^5 \div x^3&lt;/math&gt;, expands to &lt;math&gt;\frac{x \times x \times x \times x \times x}{x \times x \times x}&lt;/math&gt;. Three of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'s on the top line cancel out, leaving us with &lt;math&gt;x \times x = x^2 = x^{5-3}&lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;(x^a)^b = x^{a \times b}&lt;/math&gt;

 For example, &lt;math&gt;(4^2)^3 = (4 \times 4) \times (4 \times 4) \times (4 \times 4)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;4^6&lt;/math&gt;

4. &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x\ne0&lt;/math&gt;

 For example, &lt;math&gt;5^0 \times 6 = 6&lt;/math&gt;

5. &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{a}{b}} = \sqrt[b]{x^a} = {\sqrt[b]{x}}^a&lt;/math&gt; 

 For example, &lt;math&gt;8^{\frac{2}{3}} = {\sqrt[3]{8}}^2 = 2^2 = 4.&lt;/math&gt;

== Expanding and factorising expressions ==

== Manipulation of surds ==
A surd is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be written exactly in decimal or fractional form, an example is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, numbers are written in surd form because writing it any other way would reduce the accuracy, and in mathematics an exact value is needed. There are two rules of surd manipulation required for C1:

1. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt;

 For example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{16 \times 25} = 20 = \sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{25}&lt;/math&gt;.

2. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ \frac{x}{y}} = \frac{ \sqrt{x}}{ \sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;

 For example,  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ \frac{5}{4}} = \frac{ \sqrt{5}}{ \sqrt{4}} = \frac{ \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes a surd may need to be expressed as &lt;math&gt;x\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt;, this is done by finding a square number, like 4 or 9, that multiplies into the surd, which then can be taken outside the square root and put in front 

 For example,  &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{ 9 \times 5} = 3 \sqrt{5} &lt;/math&gt;

== Simultaneous Equations ==
Simultaneous equations are two or more equations where you have to find values for unknowns that satisfy both. There are two methods you need to know about for solving them.

=== Elimination ===
Elimination involves 'taking away' or 'adding' the two equations together to eliminate on of the two unknowns. Here's an example:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
  5x + 4y &amp; = &amp; 33 \\
  6x - 4y &amp; = &amp; 22
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


In this case, adding the equations together will eliminate y:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lclc}
 &amp; 5x + 4y &amp; = &amp; 33 \\
+ &amp; 6x - 4y &amp; = &amp; 22 \\
\Rightarrow &amp; 11x + 0y &amp; = &amp; 55
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


We can then solve &lt;math&gt;11x = 55&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;x = 5&lt;/math&gt;. This value of x can then be put back into one of the original equations to find the value of y:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
  5x + 4y = 33 \\
  25 + 4y = 33 \\
  4y = 8 \\
  y = 2
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


Sometimes, you may have to change one of the equations to be able to use elimination. Look at the following two:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
  3x + 4y &amp; = &amp; 14 \\
  5x + 8y &amp; = &amp; 24
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


Neither of the unknowns can be eliminated at the moment but by multiplying the whole of the first equation by 2 it makes it possible to eliminate by taking one away from the other:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lclc}
 &amp; 6x + 8y &amp; = &amp; 28 \\
- &amp; 5x + 8y &amp; = &amp; 24 \\
\Rightarrow &amp; 1x + 0y &amp; = &amp; 4
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


This can then be substituted back into one of the original equations to find y:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
  5x + 8y = 24 \\
  20 + 8y = 24 \\
  8y = 4 \\
  y = \frac{1}{2}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


=== Substitution ===

== Inequalities ==

=== Linear ===
Inequalities can be manipulated in the same way an equation can be with an extra rule: when multiplying or dividing by a negative value, the greater/less than must be switched to the other.
 For example:
 
 &lt;math&gt;
 \begin{align}
 -6x + 3 &amp; &gt; -9 \\
 -6x &amp; &gt; -12 \\
 x &amp; &lt; 2
 \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Quadratic ===

==== Critical values ====
For the inequality &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, consider the corresponding equation &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;.   Solve the equation for x; the two values of x you obtain are known as the critical values, and represent the limits between which the solutions for the inequality lie.  For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (x + 1)(x - 3) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x = -1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x = 3&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore critical values are -1 and 3.

In the above example, the solution is either &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt; x &lt; 3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x&lt;-1;x&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.  To determine which one it is, plug in any value, apart from the critical values, into the original inequality and see if the inequality is true, if it is the value you plugged in is in the solution set.

Continuing from the above example, let &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;0 - 0 - 3 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that 0 is a solution, and as it lies in &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;x&lt;3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;x&lt;3&lt;/math&gt; is the solution

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Binomial Theorem==

The Binomial Theorem determines the expansion for the powers of different sums; written out, it is:
:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n=\sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}x^{n-i}y^{i}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\tbinom ni&lt;/math&gt; is the binomial coefficient for ''n'' and ''i'', which was defined in the previous chapter as a number counting the ways to choose ''i'' elements from a set of ''n'' and pronounced &quot;''n'' choose ''i''&quot;, and whose value can be computed as
:&lt;math&gt;\binom ni=\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;(x+2)^2=1x^2+2x^12^1+2^2=x^2+4x+4\,&lt;/math&gt; 

and &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^5=x^5+5x^4y+10x^3y^2+10x^2y^3+5xy^4+y^5\,&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients in the expansion are entries in a row of Pascal's triangle.
i.e. &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^5&lt;/math&gt; gives the coefficients for the fifth row of Pascal's triangle.

==Combinatorial proof==
There are many proofs possible for the binomial theorem. The combinatorial proof goes as follows:

Consider the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;x^{n-k}y^k\,&lt;/math&gt;, for a fixed ''k'', on both sides. The left hand side i.e. &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n=(x+y)(x+y)\cdots (x+y)&lt;/math&gt; when expanded will have terms only of the type &lt;math&gt;x^{n-i}y^i\,&lt;/math&gt; where ''i'' ranges from 0 to ''n''. The number of times &lt;math&gt;x^{n-k}y^k\,&lt;/math&gt; occurs will be precisely equal to the number of ways of choosing ''k'' numbers out of ''n''. This is because from each of the factors (''x''+''y''), ''n'' in all, we will have to choose ''k'' of the ''y's'' (the remaining will be ''x's''). Thus the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^{n-k}y^k\,&lt;/math&gt; on the left hand side will be &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt;. This matches the coefficient on the right hand side and the proof is complete.

==Consequences==
There are many consequences of the binomial theorem. 

Firstly on putting x = y = 1 in the theorem we get &lt;math&gt;2^n=\sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the total number of subsets of a set having n elements (which is &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;, a result we have already obtained) equals the sum of the number of ways of choosing i order sets out of the n set, for all i.

Secondly, on putting x = 1 and y = -1 in the theorem we have &lt;math&gt;0=\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently this means, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k\ odd}{n \choose k}=\sum_{k\ even}{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;,
which says that for any n order set, the number of its odd order subsets is equal to the number of its even order subsets.  

Thirdly, we have the Vandermode's identity obtained by comparing the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{k=0}^{m+n} {m+n \choose k}x^k
&amp;= (1+x)^{m+n}\\
&amp;= (1+x)^m (1+x)^n \\
&amp;= \biggl(\sum_{k=0}^m {m\choose k}x^k\biggr)
   \biggl(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^k\biggr)\\
&amp;=\sum_{k=0}^{m+n}\biggl(\sum_{i=0}^k {m\choose i} {n\choose k-i}\biggr) x^k,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that here we use the definition of the product of two polynomials with degrees ''m'' and ''n'', respectively, which is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\biggl(\sum_{i=0}^m a_ix^i\biggr) \biggl(\sum_{j=0}^n b_jx^j\biggr)
= \sum_{r=0}^{m+n}\biggl(\sum_{k=0}^r a_k b_{r-k}\biggr) x^r,&lt;/math&gt;

where we use the convention that ''a&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all integers ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''m'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all integers ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''.

On comparing the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; we get Vandermonde's identity: 
:&lt;math&gt;{m+n \choose k}=\sum_{i=0}^k{m \choose i}{n \choose k-i},\qquad m,n,k\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that putting m = 1 in Vandermonde's identity allows us to recover Pascal's relation discussed in the previous chapter albeit in a slightly different form:

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1 \choose k}= {n \choose k}+{n \choose k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Vandermonde's identity has a combinatorial proof too. The binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;{m+n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of k subsets of the m + n set &lt;math&gt;A\bigcup B&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A=\{1,2\cdots m\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=\{m+1,m+2\cdots m+n\}&lt;/math&gt;. The number of such k-subsets which contain i elements of A would be &lt;math&gt;{m \choose i}{n \choose k-i}&lt;/math&gt; (i elements from A ''and'' the rest k-i from B). The summation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k{m \choose i}{n \choose k-i}&lt;/math&gt; counts these subsets for all i.

Another useful result that arises from Vandermonde's is obtained by putting m = k = n in the Vandermonde's identity. That gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;{2n \choose n}=\sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Let us look at another consequence, the fourth one. Consider &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^{m+n+1}=(1+x)\cdots (1+x)&lt;/math&gt; where there are &lt;math&gt;m+n+1&lt;/math&gt; terms of the type &lt;math&gt;(1+x)&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side. The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; on the left side is &lt;math&gt;{m+n+1\choose n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. On the right side the coefficient would be obtained by looking at the number of ways of picking up n+1 x's and remaining 1's from the m+n+1 terms of the type (1+x), similar to what we had done in the proof of the binomial theorem. Let the right most x be picked up from the n+i+1'th term where i clearly varies from 0 to m. This gives us the choice of picking up n x's from the remaining n+i terms which can be done in &lt;math&gt;{n+i\choose n}&lt;/math&gt; number of ways. The total number of ways will be obviously obtained by summing over all possible i. So the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m{n+i\choose n}&lt;/math&gt; and hence we have the relation

:&lt;math&gt;{m+n+1\choose n+1}=\sum_{i=0}^m{n+i\choose n}&lt;/math&gt;

Like Vandermonde's identity this identity can also be proved combinatorically. The left side represents the number of ways of choosing n+1 order sets from an m+n+1 set, say &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\cdots m+n+1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose for any given n+1 order set, the largest element in n+i+1 where i varies from 0 to m. Then the remaining n elements have to be chosen from n+i elements and the number of ways of doing that is exactly &lt;math&gt;{n+i\choose n}&lt;/math&gt;. Summing over all i gives us the total number of ways which has already been decided to be the left side. It only remains to equate the two terms.

Changing the variables in the above identity gives us,

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1\choose k+1}=\sum_{i=k}^n{i\choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

Also this implies:

:&lt;math&gt;{n+1\choose k+1}-{m+1\choose k+1}=\sum_{i=m+1}^n{i\choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

==Pronunciation Guide==
===Vowels===
*e, i, o, and u, are short vowels--they sound similar to the English bet, bit, got, and put, respectively.
*ee, ii, oo, and uu are long vowels--they sound similar to the English, bat, beet, fought, and dude respectively.
*eee, iii, ooo, and uuu are extra long vowels. They usually have extra stress in the end or the beginning. They are like putting the long vowel oo followed immediately by the short vowel o (for example). 
*ei, ou, oe, i.e., are short vowel combinations, they sound similar to the English weight, boat, and bite. The last combination is rare in Arapaho and is pronounced by saying the short vowels (above) e and i right after each other.
*eii, oee, and ouu are long vowel combinations. ei is like a ei with an i added to the it, oee is like an oe  held a bit longer, and ouu is like a ou with a u added to the end.

===Consonants===
Unless somebody writes up a intro to the consonants, look up an IPA tutorial and use that :)

===Tones===
Arapaho is a tonal language and tones are marked like this é, í, ó, ú (with an accent going from up to down) means it's a high tone. ê, î, ô, û, (like a cap) means a falling tone.

The '''oxeye daisy''' (''Leucanthemum vulgare'', syn. ''Chrysanthemum leucanthemum'') also known as the '''marguerite''' is a widespread flowering plant native to Europe and the temperate regions of Asia. It is one of a number of plants to be called by the common name daisy. It is also sometimes called moon daisy or dog daisy.

==Description==
It is a perennial prostrate herb with small flower head (not larger than 5 cm) that consists of about 20 white ray flowers and numerous yellow disc flowers, growing on the end of the stem. The stem is mostly unbranched and sprouts laterally from a creeping rootstock.

The leaves are darkgreen on both sides. The basal and middle leaves are petiolate, obovate to spoon-shaped, and serrate to dentate. The upper leaves are shorter, sessile and borne along the stem.

It produces an abundant number of flat seeds without pappus. It spreads also vegetatively by rooting underground stems.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
The oxeye daisy is a typical meadow flower, growing in a variety of plant communities such as dry fields, meadows, but also under scrubs, open-canopy forests and waste places. It thrives in a wide range of conditions and prefers heavy and damp soils. It was introduced in parts of North America, Australia and New Zealand, where it is now a common weed displacing native plant species in some areas. It is difficult to control or eradicate, since a new plant can regenerate from rhizome fragments. However, in North Carolina it is planted on roadsides by the highway department.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wildflowers Find Favor With Highway Gardeners&quot; article by Felicity Barringer in the New York Times August 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The un-opened buds can be marinated and used in a similar way to capers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildfoods.ca/products-vegetables-ox-eyedaisycapers.html Ox-eye Daisy Capers] at [http://www.wildfoods.ca/index.html Forbes wild foods]. Retrieved December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The game &quot;He loves me, he loves me not&quot; (&quot;effeuiller la marguerite&quot; (in French)) is associated with this flower.

==Maintenance==

'''''Linaria vulgaris''''' ('''Common Toadflax'''&lt;ref&gt;Natural History Museum: [http://flood.nhm.ac.uk/jobj/java/runjava.jobj?java=ctol.CTOLServer&amp;method=printNamePage&amp;accountref=987&amp;NAMEID=7673 ''Linaria vulgaris'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blamey&gt;Blamey, M. &amp; Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). ''Flora of Britain and Northern Europe''. ISBN 0-340-40170-2&lt;/ref&gt;) is a low growing plant native to most of Europe and northern Asia, from the United Kingdom south to Spain in the west, and east to eastern Siberia and western China.&lt;ref name=flora&gt;''Flora Europaea'': [http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Linaria+&amp;SPECIES_XREF=vulgaris&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= ''Linaria vulgaris'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?102290 ''Linaria vulgaris'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Linaria acutiloba'' Fisch. ex Rchb. is a synonym.&lt;ref name=flora/&gt; Because this plant grows as a weed, it has acquired a large number of local colloquial names, including brideweed, bridewort, butter and eggs (but see ''[[../Lotus corniculatus/]]''), butter haycocks, bread and butter, bunny haycocks, bunny mouths, calf's snout, Continental weed, dead men's bones, devil's flax, devil's flower, doggies, dragon bushes, eggs and bacon (but see ''[[../Lotus corniculatus/]]''), eggs and butter, false flax, flaxweed, fluellen (but see ''[[../Kichxia/]]''), gallweed, gallwort, imprudent lawyer, impudent lawyer, Jacob's ladder (but see ''[[../Polemonium/]]''), lion's mouth, monkey flower (but see ''[[../Mimulus/]]''), North American ramsted, rabbit flower, rancid, ransted, snapdragon (but see ''[[../Antirrhinum/]]''), wild flax, wild snapdragon, wild tobacco (but see ''[[Nicotiana]]''), yellow rod, yellow toadflax.&lt;ref name=mabey/&gt;

[[Image:Linaria_vulgaris.jpg|left|thumb|''Linaria vulgaris'' in a meadow]]
The plant is widespread on ruderal spots, along roads, in dunes, and on disturbed and cultivated land.&lt;ref name=blamey/&gt; It has escaped from cultivation in North America where it is a common naturalised weed of roadsides and poor soils; it is listed as an invasive species in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces.&lt;ref name=grin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Invasive Plants: [http://www.invasiveplants.ab.ca/Downloads/CommonToadflax.pdf Common Toadflax] (pdf file)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Lord Britton and Hon. Addison Brown, ''An Illustrated Flora of the Northern United States and Canada'', Dover Publications, [[1913]], [[1970]]. ISBN 0-486-22642-5  vol 3, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is a perennial plant with short spreading roots, erect to decumbent stems 15–90 cm high, with fine, threadlike, glaucous blue-green leaves 2-6 cm long and 1-5 mm broad. The flowers are similar to those of the snapdragon, 25-33 mm long, pale yellow except for the lower lip which is orange, borne in dense terminal racemes from mid summer to mid autumn. The fruit is a globose capsule 5-11 mm long and 5-7 mm broad, containing numerous small seeds.&lt;ref name=blamey/&gt;

Because the flower is largely closed by its underlip, pollination requires strong insects such as bees and bumblebees (''[[../Bombus/]]'' species).&lt;ref name=blamey/&gt;

==Growing Conditions==
The plant requires ample drainage, but is otherwise adaptable to a variety of conditions.

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
While most commonly found as a weed, toadflax is sometimes cultivated for cut flowers, which are long-lasting in the vase. Like snapdragons (''[[../Antirrhinum/]]''), they are often grown in children's gardens for the &quot;snapping&quot; flowers which can be made to &quot;talk&quot; be squeezing them at the base of the corolla.&lt;ref name=mabey&gt;Mabey, R. (1996). ''Flora Britannica''. Sinclair-Stevenson ISBN 1-85619-377-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==
The plant is foodplant for a large number of insects such as the [[w:Sweet-Gale Moth]] (''Acronicta euphorbiae''), [[w:Mouse Moth]] (''Amphipyra tragopoginis''), [[w:Silver Y]] (''Autographa gamma''), ''[[w:Calophasia lunula]]'', [[w:Gorgone Checkerspot]] (''Charidryas gorgone carlota''), [[w:Toadflax Pug ]] (''Eupithecia linariata''), [[w:Satyr Pug]] (''Eupithecia satyrata''), ''[[w:Falseuncaria ruficiliana]]'', [[w:Bog Fritillary]] (''Proclossiana eunomia eunomia''), ''[[w:Pyrrhia umbra]]'', [[w:Brown Rustic]] (''Rusina ferruginea''), and ''[[w:Stenoptilia bipunctidactyla]].

'''''Lonicera maackii''''' ('''Amur Honeysuckle''' or '''Bush Honeysuckle''') is a species of honeysuckle in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to temperate Asia in northern and western China (south to Yunnan), Mongolia, Japan (central and northern Honshū, rare), Korea, and southeastern Russia (Primorsky Krai).&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?22596 ''Lonicera maackii'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as an endangered species in Japan.&lt;ref name=japan&gt;Ministry of the Environment (Japan): [http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/red_plants.csv Red List of Threatened Plants of Japan (excel spreadsheet)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redlistjp&gt;Red Data Book (Japan): [http://www.rdbplants.jp/RDB/map/sp-5/2/5281.htm ''Lonicera maackii''] (in Japanese, with map; [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://www.rdbplants.jp/RDB/map/sp-5/2/5281.htm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=10&amp; google translation])&lt;/ref&gt; It has escaped from cultivation and become naturalised in New Zealand and the eastern United States; in the forests of the latter, it has become an important invasive species.&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;

The common name Amur Honeysuckle comes from the Amur River which is the world's eighth longest river. This river forms the border between the Russian Far East and Manchuria in China. L. maackii is native to the area surrounding this river. The species name maackii is derived from Richard Maack, a 19th century Russian naturalist.&lt;ref name=osu/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:LoniceraMaackii5.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage and fruit in autumn]]
It is a deciduous large shrub growing to 6 m tall with stems up to 10 cm diameter. The leaves are oppositely arranged, 5–9 cm long and 2–4 cm broad, with an entire margin, and with at least some rough hairs on them. The flowers are produced in pairs, commonly with several pairs grouped together in clusters; they are 2 cm long, two-lipped, white later turning yellow or light orange in colour; flowering is from mid spring to early summer. The fruit is a bright red to black semi-translucent berry 2–6 mm diameter containing numerous small seeds; they ripen in autumn, and are eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. It is fast growing and favours shady habitats such as the forest understory, neglected urban areas, and fence rows. It can form extremely dense thickets.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mp&gt;Missouriplants: [http://www.missouriplants.com/Whiteopp/Lonicera_maackii_page.html ''Lonicera maackii'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=io&gt;Invasive.org: [http://www.invasive.org/weeds/asian/lonicera.pdf ''Lonicera'' species (pdf file)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:LoniceraMackii4.jpg|right|220px|thumb|''Lonicera maackii'' planted as a [[hedge]].]]
It is grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers, and also as a hedge. A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use, including 'Erubescens' with pink flowers, and 'Rem Red' with erect habit.&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;

The flowers are sometimes used by children, who remove the blossom by hand, and pull off the bottom to suck out the sweet nectar in the centre. The red berries are mildly poisonous to humans and should not be eaten.

==Invasiveness==
Spread of this plant is illegal or controlled in some areas of the United States due to its well documented invasive character.&lt;ref name=usfs&gt;[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/fhp/invasive_plants/weeds/amur-honeysuckle.pdf USA Forest Service Weed of the Week Fact Sheet (pdf file)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= prime&gt;[http://sain.utk.edu/invasives/species44.shtml Annotated Bibliography of primary research on invasive qualities of L. maackii in the USA: National Biological Information Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uconn&gt;[http://www.hort.uconn.edu/Plants/l/lonmaa/lonmaa1.html University of Connecticut Plant Database: ''L. maackii'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osu&gt;[http://hcs.osu.edu/pocketgardener/source/description/lo_ackii.html Ohio State University Pocket Gardener: ''L. maackii'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; It is listed as a &quot;invasive, banned&quot; species in Connecticut, &quot;prohibited&quot; in Massachusetts, and a &quot;Class B noxious weed&quot; in Vermont.&lt;ref name=plants&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=LOMA6 USDA PLANTS DATABASE: ''L. maackii'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also officially listed as an invasive species by government agencies in Wisconsin and Tennessee.&lt;ref name=plants/&gt; 

This plant is adaptable and successful in a wide range of conditions. In the United States, Amur honeysuckle was once planted to control erosion, and as hedges. It spread quickly as birds dispersed the seeds, and was soon naturalised. Notably, in deciduous forest understories of the eastern United States it forms dense growths with thick canopies that shade out native shrubs, young trees, and wild flowers.&lt;ref name=uconn/&gt;&lt;ref name=prime/&gt;&lt;ref name=osu/&gt;&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; Uncontrolled, these growths create a near monoculture of Amur Honeysuckle.&lt;ref name=uconn/&gt;&lt;ref name=prime/&gt;&lt;ref name=osu/&gt;&lt;ref name= usfs /&gt;&lt;ref name= mp/&gt; This species poses a serious threat not only to the diversity of the ecosystems which they invade but also to forest regeneration itself.&lt;ref name=uconn/&gt;&lt;ref name=prime/&gt;&lt;ref name=osu/&gt;&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;

Due to the invasive nature of this species and the ecological threat it possess it may be inadvisable to cultivate this plant in climates similar to those found where this species has become invasive (e.g. eastern United States).&lt;ref name=prime/&gt; It has been suggested that existing specimens found outside of their native range in east Asia should be removed and replaced with alternative non-invasive species.&lt;ref name=osu/&gt; Possible alternative fast growing, shade tolerant, deciduous shrubs include ''[[../Calycanthus floridus/]]'', ''[[../Cornus mas/]]'', ''[[../Cornus sericea/]]'', ''[[../Forsythia/]]'' hybrids, ''[[../Hydrangea/]]'' spp., ''[[../Syringa vulgaris/]]'', ''[[../Viburnum cassinoides/]]'', ''[[../Viburnum dentatum/]]'', ''[[../Viburnum dilatatum/]]'', ''[[../Viburnum opulus/]]'' , ''[[../Viburnum prunifolium/]]'', ''[[../Viburnum trilobum/]]'', ''[[../Weigela florida/]]''.&lt;ref name= osu /&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Control==
Honeysuckle can be controlled by cutting, flaming, or burning the plant to root level and repeating on two-week increments until nutrient reserves in the roots are depleted. To ensure eradication newly cut stumps should be treated with herbicide. Control through prescribed burning has been found to be most effective during the seed dispersal phase (late summer, early fall).&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt; Honeysuckle can also be controlled through annual applications of glyphosate which thoroughly soak the leaves, or through grubbing of the shallowly rooted young plants. Both of these methods are only practical if high labour costs and soil damage are not of concern.

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

So you want to learn Japanese in less time than it takes you to learn how to play a complex board game? Well, that might not be possible. However, if you dig in and try hard you might be able to learn the basics faster than you think.

== What this is and what this is not ==
This is not a complete guide to the Japanese language. This is not every possible correct way of saying each and every word. Those kind of books are useful but take a lot of mental investment on the part of the reader. This book is simply a step above a phrase book. This book is for those who want to jump in quick and learn from that moment forward. This book will let you know the basic phrases and words in an intuitive &quot;plug and play&quot; kind of way that will let you learn even more on your own. Remember this is just a quick introduction to a very complex language.  Don't sweat the grammar, just memorize the provided text. This book uses hiragana (a Japanese alphabet) to write the sounds of Japanese, it is easy to learn and you can do that next. And there is even a way for you to cheat and not learn, if you really don't want to. So even if you don't want to do learn a Japanese alphabet, click next and see if you change your mind. You should be up and communicating in no time! Goodluck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">OK. So you are thinking ''I want to communicate! I don't want to learn boring foreign letter-shape things!!'' Stop right there! Learning one of the basic Japanese alphabets is not that hard. You can pull out a note book and write each character over and over for about 20 minutes and you should have the basics. No? You want to get started faster than that? Well, leave this window open and read the other lessons in another browser window. Use this window to help you decode the phrases. That will help you start memorizing if you are in too much of a hurry to memorize these now. Why not provide the text in roman letters? Because it's not hard to learn a basic foreign alphabet and you'll soon realize that the key to &quot;jumping in&quot; so to speak, is to be thinking '''in''' the target language. 
Still haven't convinced you? OK. Heres the cheat button. Just hover your browser cursor over this icon [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|reading of Japanese here!]] and see what it is in English letters. You really should learn the Japanese letters though. So if you haven't already; learn hiragana it isn't that hard.

* basic hiragana: &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:あ|あ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(a)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:い|い]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(i)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:う|う]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(u)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:え|え]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(e)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:お|お]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(o)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:か|か]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ka)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:き|き]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ki)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:く|く]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ku)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:け|け]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ke)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:こ|こ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ko)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:さ|さ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(sa)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:し|し]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(shi)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:す|す]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(su)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:せ|せ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(se)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:そ|そ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(so)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:た|た]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ta)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ち|ち]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(chi)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:つ|つ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(tsu)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:て|て]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(te)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:と|と]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(to)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:な|な]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(na)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:に|に]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ni)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ぬ|ぬ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(nu)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ね|ね]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ne)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:の|の]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(no)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:は|は]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ha)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ひ|ひ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(hi)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ふ|ふ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(fu)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:へ|へ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(he)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ほ|ほ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ho)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ま|ま]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ma)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:み|み]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(mi)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:む|む]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(mu)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:め|め]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(me)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:も|も]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(mo)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:や|や]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ya)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ゆ|ゆ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(yu)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:よ|よ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(yo)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ら|ら]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ra)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:り|り]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ri)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:る|る]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ru)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:れ|れ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(re)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ろ|ろ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ro)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:わ|わ]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(wa)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:を|を]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(wo)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ん|ん]]&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(n)&lt;/small&gt;

* You should also know:

That if you add a ” to K row sounds (such as か) it becomes a G. &lt;big&gt;か&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ka)&lt;/small&gt; becomes &lt;big&gt;が&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ga)&lt;/small&gt;

If you add a ” to S row sounds (such as さ) it becomes a Z. &lt;big&gt;さ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(sa)&lt;/small&gt; becomes &lt;big&gt;ざ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(za)&lt;/small&gt;

In the same way, add a ” to T row sounds (such as た) it becomes a D. &lt;big&gt;た&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ta)&lt;/small&gt; becomes &lt;big&gt;だ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(da)&lt;/small&gt;

Also add a ” to H row sounds (such as は) it becomes a B. &lt;big&gt;は&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ha)&lt;/small&gt; becomes &lt;big&gt;ば&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ba)&lt;/small&gt;

Finally a new one! Add ° to H row sounds (such as は) it becomes a P. &lt;big&gt;は&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ha)&lt;/small&gt; becomes &lt;big&gt;ぱ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(pa)&lt;/small&gt;

* Three small exceptions
&lt;big&gt;じ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ji)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;big&gt;ぢ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(ji)&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;big&gt;づ&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;(zu)&lt;/small&gt;

That's it! Not too hard. There are other ways to tweak these letters and a whole other set of letters plus Chinese characters. Don't worry about those for now. Now it's on to learning to communicate!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Greeting people isn't that hard. It just depends on what time of day it is. In the morning Johnny would say:

| おはようございます [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|ohayougozaimasu]]

[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd004.ogg|left]]


























Now lets time travel into the future a little bit. In the afternoon Mary would say...

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]
{| align=&quot;right&quot;
| style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot; | '''Mary'''
|-
| こんにちは [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|konnichiWA]]
|-
| ''Good afternoon'' (hello)
|-
| ***&lt;small&gt; '''WARNING:''' &lt;big&gt;は&lt;/big&gt; is special and pronounced &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;like a WA sound. Also, don't fall into the &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;bad habit of saying KAN for the start. &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;Its KON. OK. Go back to using non-English &lt;/small&gt; 
|-
| &lt;small&gt;letters to read Japanese. &lt;/small&gt;
|}
[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd005.ogg|right]]
 


















Yawn... it's getting late, did we get in the time machine again? It's evening!

Nice. But what about if Johnny and Mary meet and they want to know how each other are doing? Pretty easy, let's listen in.

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png|left]]

{| align=&quot;center&quot;

|-
| げんき literally means something like ''base of your spirit/mood'' so people

| speaking Japanese are asking if you have vigor or energy or something. 
|- 
| But &quot;Are you vigorous? Yes, I am.&quot; just doesn't translate right!

Great! So let's move on to greeting people at different times of the day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many ways to say goodbye in any language. Both formal ways and friendly relaxed ways. Johnny seems like he is kind of rigid, but Mary wants to relax! 

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png|left]]
{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| さようなら [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|sayounara]]
|-
| ''Goodbye''
|-
| &lt;small&gt;NOTE: This is formal, when you wont &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;see the person for awhile.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|}
[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd009.ogg|left]]























Mary disregards the polite speech of Johnny and throws out a casual:
[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]
{| align=&quot;right&quot;
| style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot; | '''Mary'''
|-
| またね. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|matane]]
|-
| ''See you.''
|-
|}
[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd010.ogg|right]]




















Johnny can't shake his desire for formal language and before he goes away, he shares: 

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png|left]]
{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| またあいましょう. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|mata aimasyou]]
|-
| ''Let's meet again.''
|-
| &lt;small&gt;NOTE: The また in both of these &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;means simply &quot;again&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|}
[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd011.ogg|left]]























{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot; | '''～　Language note of interest!　～'''
|-
| またね is just one variation of the way people casually say &quot;see you&quot;  
|-
| when speaking Japanese. You might hear じゃ、またね or またあした 
|- 
| (that's literally &quot;again tomorrow&quot;) or simply  また！ 
|-
|}

OK! Done with the first chunk. Now it's on to some real sentences.

| は &lt;small&gt;(read this time as wa)&lt;/small&gt; is an article that gives focus to this sentence. 
|-
| Don't worry about it yet. You can learn grammar stuff later. 
|-
| なん means ''what'', although by it's self it is なに. Words need to be polite 
|- 
| so when next to a thing or description use です (not with action words!)
|-
| Notice the か is a question mark, without it we have a normal sentence. 
|}

Lets listen to Johnny and Mary talk about stuff. Notice how the sentences change when they are talking about different things. You'll be able to plug-in your own new words too! Johnny and Mary are at a restaurant, what will they talk about?

|-
| &lt;small&gt;NOTE: The little &lt;big&gt;っ&lt;/big&gt; like you see here &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;is always silent. It's a pause like the ' mark in I'm.&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Can you figure out how to plug-in these words? Let's look at a few examples from when Johnny met Mary suddenly by accident.

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png|left]]
{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| こんにちは.ここはとうきょう'''えき'''ですか？ [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|konnichiWA. koko WA toukyou eki desuka?]]
|-
| ''Good afternoon. Is this Tokyo '''station'''?''
|-

[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd014.ogg|left]]























Wow. That Johnny! He jumps right into the question right away. Well Mary? 

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]

|-
| そう does not mean ''it is'' literally. It means something like  
|-
| &quot;that way&quot; so with the polite marker です it means  
|-
| &quot;It is that way&quot; or a basic way to confirm something.
|}







Wow, is Johnny bringing beer with him into Tokyo station?


[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png|left]]
{| align=&quot;left&quot;

|-
| ''No. This is water.''

[[Image:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd016.ogg|left]]
























Oh! It's only water. But what if they want to ask about action? Easy!



{| align=&quot;center&quot;

|-
| &lt;small&gt;NOTE: The &lt;big&gt;ます&lt;/big&gt; make these words polite &lt;/small&gt;

|-
| &lt;small&gt;NOTE: を is read as &quot;o&quot; and it is &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;just some grammar referring to an object, &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;don't worry. Just use it in this frame. &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;Also keep in mind this tense can be &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;''' will''' or '''are you'''!&lt;/small&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

'''''Matricaria discoidea''''', commonly known as '''pineapple weed''' is an annual plant native to North America and NE Asia but which has become a cosmopolitan weed. According to ITIS the specific name is ''Matricaria discoidea'' DC, but many synonyms are in the literature, including ''M. matricarioides'', ''M. suaveolens'', and ''Chamomilla suaveolens''.

==Description==
The flower head is cone-shaped, composed of dense-packed yellowish-green corollas, and lacking ray-florets. The leaves are pinnately dissected and sweet-scented when crushed. The plant grows 3 to 12 inches (7.5 - 30 cm) high.

==Growing Conditions==
The plant grows well in disturbed areas, especially those with poor, compacted soil. It can be seen blooming on footpaths, roadsides, and similar places in spring and early summer. In the USA, it can be found from central Alaska down to California and all the way to Maine.

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
The flowers exude a chamomile/pineapple aroma when crushed. They are edible and have been used in salads (although they may become bitter by the time the plant blooms) and to make a herbal tea [http://www.nps.gov/klgo/flora/pineappleweed.htm][http://www.arthurleej.com/a-pineapple.html].

Pineapple weed has been used for medicinal purposes, including for relief of gastrointestinal upset, infected sores, fevers, and postpartum anemia &lt;ref&gt;http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Matricaria+discoidea&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==

[[image:Teheran conference-1943.jpg| thumb|225px| right]]


Stalin was General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953. This meant he was the leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (&quot;USSR&quot;), which was also called the Soviet Union. That country doesn't exist any more. It was made up of a large number of other countries like Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia and Georgia. In many ways he was very similar to Hitler - an absolute dictator.

The USSR was created in 1919 after the end of the Russian Civil War. Stalin became leader of the USSR after its first leader, Vladimir Lenin, died in 1924. Stalin tried to turn the USSR into a &quot;communist&quot; state. His ideas sometimes worked but sometimes went wrong. His plan to change the way crops were grown is believed by some to have lead to the death of up to 6 million people.

Then, in the 1930s, Stalin began to kill his enemies and rivals. He executed millions of his own people. These included many army officers and other people he saw as threat to his power. This greatly weakened the Soviet army. Although it was huge and well armed, its officers were very new and were scared of being shot if they seemed to be clever. They were at a loss as to how to fight the clever and experienced German army.

Before the war, Stalin did a deal with Germany and they both agreed to invade Poland. He thought that Germany wouldn't attack the USSR as they had made this deal. In fact, some historians think Stalin was planning to invade Germany but the Germans attacked first! Anyway, Germany did attack and to start with it looked like the Germans would win easily, but Stalin was ruthless. He was willing to sacrifice any number of soldiers to stop the Germans capturing important machinery (like tank factories) and to slow their advance on the capital, Moscow. Despite millions of deaths, this worked and in the end the USSR beat the Germans.

It might have ended differently if Hitler hadn't made mistakes. Many people in the USSR welcomed the Germans as &quot;liberators&quot;. They had been living with Stalin and his &quot;purges&quot;, where he killed those he didn't trust.  Many people, especially outside of Russia, might have joined the war on the German side. But Hitler didn't want their help, and by being even more cruel than Stalin and killing even more of them, turned them against the Germans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== location of the merge discussion ==

It would be nice if a merge discussion occurred in one place -- rather than half the discussion on the &quot;mergefrom&quot; talk page, and the other half on the &quot;mergeto&quot; talk page.

Wikipedia is set up so that, when someone slaps a &quot;mergefrom&quot; tag on a page, a message like &quot;Please discuss whether or not this merge should happen on the discussion page.&quot; shows up on the page.
Clicking that &quot;discussion&quot; link goes to that article's own discussion page -- just like clicking the &quot;discussion&quot; tab.

When someone slaps a &quot;mergeto&quot; tag on a page, a similar-seeming message like &quot;Please discuss whether or not this merge should happen on the discussion page.&quot; shows up on the page also.
However, on Wikipedia, when I click that &quot;discussion&quot; link, I don't go to talk page of the article with the &quot;mergeto&quot; tag.
Instead, it goes to the other article's discussion page -- the article mentioned by the mergeto tag.

Could someone fix this tag so it acts the way a Wikipedian would expect?
Or is there some reason for Wikibooks to be different?

:What would be your preference? Should the discussion occur on the &quot;to&quot; page, or the &quot;from&quot; page. I'll gladly make the change (it's a good idea) once we know where the discussion should take place. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:52, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

:: My preference is to do it the way Wikipedia does it. Currently this &quot;mergeto&quot; template links to the discussion page of the module it is placed *on*. I would prefer this &quot;mergeto&quot; template to, instead, link to the &quot;other&quot; discussion page. (Currently the &quot;{{tl|mergefrom}}&quot; template also links to the discussion page of the module it is placed *on*. Keep that template the same -- so the merge discussion occurs in that one discussion page). --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:46, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

That much makes good sense. Let me change around the links now, and hope nobody complains. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:07, 7 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A sensor is a device which converts a physical property into an electrical property (such as resistance). A sensing system is a system (usually a circuit) which allows this electrical property, and so the physical property, to be measured.

==Temperature Sensor==

[[Image:Thermistor_potential_divider.svg|right|thumb|200px|Use of a potential divider and thermistor to measure temperature]]
A common example of a sensing system is a temperature sensor in a thermostat, which uses a thermistor. In the most common type of thermistor (an NTC), the resistance decreases as the temperature increases. This effect is achieved by making the thermistor out of a semiconductor. The thermistor is then used in a potential divider, as in the diagram on the right. In this diagram, the potential difference is divided between the resistor and the thermistor. As the temperature rises, the resistance of the thermistor decreases, so the potential difference across it decreases. This means that potential difference across the resistor increases as temperature increases. This is why the voltmeter is across the resistor, not the thermistor.

==Properties==

There are three main properties of sensing systems you need to know about:

===Sensitivity===

This is the amount of change in voltage output per. unit change in input (the physical property). For example, in the above sensing system, if the voltage on the voltmeter increased by 10V as the temperature increased by 6.3°C:

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{10}{6.3} \approx 1.59&lt;/math&gt; V/°C

===Resolution===

This is the smallest change in the physical property detectable by the sensing system. Sometimes, the limiting factor is the number of decimal places the voltmeter can display. So if, for example, the voltmeter can display the voltage to 2 decimal places, the smallest visible change in voltage is 0.01V. We can then use the sensitivity of the sensor to calculate the resolution.

&lt;math&gt;S = 1.59 = \frac{0.01}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{0.01}{1.59} \approx 0.006&lt;/math&gt;°C

===Response Time===

This is the time the sensing system takes to display a change in the physical property it is measuring. It is often difficult to measure.

==Signal Amplification==

Sometimes, a sensing system gives a difference in output voltage, but the sensitivity is far too low to be of any use. There are two solutions to this problem, which can be used together:

===Amplification===

An amplifier can be placed in the system, increasing the signal. The main problem with this is that the signal cannot exceed the maximum voltage of the system, so values will be chopped off of the top and bottom of the signal because it is so high.

===Wheatstone Bridge===

[[Image:Wheatstone_bridge.svg|left|thumb|200px|A wheatstone bridge, using a thermistor]]
This solution is far better, especially when used prior to amplification. Instead of using just one pair of resistors, a second pair is used, and the potential difference between the two pairs (which are connected in parallel) is measured. This means that, if, at the sensing resistor (e.g. thermistor / LDR) the resistance is at its maximum, a signal of 0V is produced. This means that the extremes of the signal are not chopped off, making for a much better sensor.

==Questions==

An LDR's resistance decreases from a maximum resistance of 2kΩ to a minimum resistance of 0Ω as light intensity increases. It is used in a distance sensing system which consists of a 9V power supply, a 1.6 kΩ resistor, the LDR and a multimeter which displays voltage to 2 decimal places measuring the potential difference across one of the two resistors.

1. Across which resistor should the multimeter be connected in order to ensure that, as the distance from the light source to the sensor increases, the potential difference recorded increases?

2. In complete darkness, what voltage is recorded on the multimeter?

3. When a light source moves 0.5m away from the sensor, the voltage on the multimeter increases by 2V. What is the sensitivity of the sensing system when using this light source, in V m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;?

4. When the same light source is placed 0m from the sensor, the potential difference is 0V. When the light source is 1m away, what voltage is displayed on the multimeter?

5. What is the resolution of the sensing system?

6. Draw a circuit diagram showing a similar sensing system to this, using a Wheatstone bridge and amplifier to improve the sensitivity of the system.

7. What is the maximum potential difference that can reach the amplifier using this new system (ignore the amplification)?

8. If this signal were to be amplified 3 times, would it exceed the maximum voltage of the system? What would the limits on the signal be?

The '''Forget-me-nots''' are flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae, grown for their long-lasting blue flowers.

There are about 50 species in the genus, and among them there is considerable variation. Nevertheless a considerable number of the species fit the same description, of a small (1 cm diameter or less) rather flat 5-petalled blue flower growing profusely on straggly stems, flowering in spring. Colour variation is somewhat frequent within species, and white or pink forms are quite likely to be seen. They are popular in gardens, and cultivated forms often show a mixture of colours. The forget-me-nots need shade, not sun.

They are widely distributed. Most Myosotis species are endemic to New Zealand, though one or two European species, especially the Wood Forget-me-not, ''[[../Myosotis sylvatica/]]'' have been introduced in most of the temperate regions of Europe, Asia and America. ''[[../Myosotis scorpioides/]]''  is also known as ''scorpion grass''.

The name was borrowed from Old French &quot;ne m'oubliez pas&quot; and first used in English in c.1532. Loans and translations of it can be found in most European and some non-European languages, like German &quot;Vergissmeinnicht&quot;, Italian &quot;Nontiscordardimé&quot;, Polish &quot;Niezapominajka&quot;, Slovak &quot;Nezábudky&quot;, Danish &quot;Forglem-mig-ej&quot;, Swedish &quot;Förgätmigej&quot;, Dutch &quot;vergeet-mij-nietje&quot;, Spanish &quot;no-me-olvides&quot;, Russian &quot;Незабудки&quot;, Bulgarian “Незабравки”, Lithuanian &quot;Neužmirštuolės&quot;, Greek &quot;Μη με λησμονείς&quot; (also connected to the people who died during the 1974 events in Cyprus), Esperanto &quot;neforgesumino&quot;, Chinese &quot;勿忘草&quot; (wu wang cao), Korean &quot;물망초&quot; (勿忘草, mul mang cho), Japanese &quot;勿忘草&quot; (Wasurenagusa), Hebrew &quot;זכריני&quot; (Zichrini), Persian &quot;فراموشم مکن&quot; (farâmusham nakon), Hungarian &quot;Nefelejts&quot;, Turkish &quot;Unutma Beni&quot; etc. 

In the United States of America, the forget-me-not is the state flower of Alaska, precisely ''[[../Myosotis alpestris/]]''. The Forget-me-nots are traditionally worn by Newfoundlanders on July 1st in remembrance of those Newfoundlanders that died during the First World War. July 1 was chosen because of the high number of casualties suffered by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment on 1 July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.

==Description==
Forget-me-nots can be annual or perennial plants. Their root systems are generally diffuse. Their seeds are found in small, tulip shaped pods along the stem to the flower. The pods attach to clothing when brushed against and eventually fall off, leaving the small seed within to germinate elsewhere.

'''An LDR's resistance decreases from a maximum resistance of 2kΩ to a minimum resistance of 0Ω as light intensity increases. It is used in a distance sensing system which consists of a 9V power supply, a 1.6 kΩ resistor, the LDR and a multimeter which displays voltage to 2 decimal places measuring the potential difference across one of the two resistors.

'''1. Across which resistor should the multimeter be connected in order to ensure that, as the distance from the light source to the sensor increases, the potential difference recorded increases?'''

As light intensity increases, distance decreases. So, as distance increases, light intensity decreases. As light intensity decreases, the LDR's resistance increases, as does the potential difference across it. So, as distance increases, the potential difference increases. Since we want the potential difference to change in the same direction as the distance, the multimeter must go across the LDR, not the resistor.

'''2. In complete darkness, what voltage is recorded on the multimeter?'''

The voltage is split between the 1.6kΩ resistor and the LDR, which currently has a resistance of 2kΩ. Therefore, the potential difference across the LDR is:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{2}{2+1.6} \times 9 = 5V&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. When a light source moves 0.5m away from the sensor, the voltage on the multimeter increases by 2V. What is the sensitivity of the sensing system when using this light source, in V m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;?'''

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4\mbox{ Vm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. When the same light source is placed 0m from the sensor, the potential difference is 0V. When the light source is 1m away, what voltage is displayed on the multimeter?'''

Assuming a linear relationship between distance and potential difference, we know that:

&lt;math&gt;0.25 = \frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{m}{0.25} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4V&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. What is the resolution of the sensing system?'''

The multimeter measures to 2 decimal places, so the smallest measurable voltage is 0.01V.

&lt;math&gt;0.25 = \frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;m = 0.25 \times V = 0.25 \times 0.01 = 0.0025\mbox{ m} = 2.5\mbox{ mm}&lt;/math&gt;

'''6. Draw a circuit diagram showing a similar sensing system to this, using a Wheatstone bridge and amplifier to improve the sensitivity of the system.'''

[[Image:Wheatstone_bridge_LDR_amp_correct.svg]]

'''7. What is the maximum potential difference that can reach the amplifier using this new system (ignore the amplification)?'''

The maximum potential difference will occur when the LDR has no resistance. This will result in 9V on the left-hand side of the voltmeter, and 5V on the right-hand side. The difference is 4V.

'''8. If this signal were to be amplified 3 times, would it exceed the maximum voltage of the system? What would the limits on the signal be?'''

&lt;math&gt;4 \times 3 = 12V &gt; 9V&lt;/math&gt;

The signal would be limited to the range -9V &lt; V &lt; 9V.

'''''Paulownia tomentosa''''' (also known as the '''Empress Tree''', '''Princess Tree''' or '''Foxglove Tree'''; '''''pao tong 泡桐''''' in Chinese) is a deciduous flowering tree native to central and western China, but invasive in the US [http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?keywordquery=Paulownia+tomentosa&amp;mode=sciname&amp;submit.x=17&amp;submit.y=12][http://nbii-nin.ciesin.columbia.edu/ipane/earlydetection/tables.htm][http://www.tneppc.org/TNEPPC2004PlantList-8x11.pdf]. 

==Description==
It grows to 10-25 m tall, with large heart-shaped to five-lobed leaves 15-40 cm across, arranged in opposite pairs on the stem. On young growth, the leaves may be in whorls of three and be much bigger than the leaves on more mature growth ([http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/pato2.htm#Whole%20tree image comparing large and small trees]). The characteristic large size of the young growth is exploited by gardeners : by [[../Pollarding|pollarding]] the tree and ensuring there is vigorous new growth every year, massive leaves are produced (up to 60cm across). These are popular in the modern style of gardening which uses large-foliaged and &quot;architectural&quot; plants. The flowers are produced before the leaves in early spring, on panicles 10-30 cm long, with a tubular purple corolla 4-6 cm long resembling a foxglove flower. The fruit is a dry egg-shaped capsule 3-4 cm long, containing numerous tiny seeds. The seeds are winged and disperse by wind and water. Pollarded trees do not produce flowers, as these only form on mature wood.

==Growing Conditions==
Paulownia tomentosa can survive wildfire because the roots can regenerate new, very fast-growing stems. It is tolerant of pollution and it is not fussy about soil type. For this reason it functions ecologically as a pioneer plant. Its nitrogen-rich leaves provide good fodder and its roots prevent soil erosion. Eventually, ''Paulownia'' is succeeded by taller trees that shade it. It cannot thrive in the shade of other trees.

The soft, lightweight seeds were commonly used as a packing material by Chinese porcelain exporters in the 19th century, before the development of polystyrene packaging. Packing cases would often leak or burst open in transit and scatter the seeds along rail tracks. This, together with seeds released by specimens deliberately planted for ornament, has allowed the species to become an invasive weed tree in areas where the climate is suitable for its growth, notably Japan and the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Princess tree | work=Plant Conservation Alliance's Alien Plant Working Group Least Wanted | url=http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/fact/pato1.htm | author=Tom Remaley | date=2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
In China, an old custom is to plant an Empress Tree when a baby girl is born. The fast-growing tree matures when she does. When she is eligible for marriage the tree is cut down and carved into wooden articles for her dowry, and carving the wood of Paulownia is an art form in Japan and China.

 | '''Delete'''. I count about 5 or so votes to delete, none explicitly to keep (although some comments certainly lean in that direction). Even if we ignore the question of copyright, which I certainly don't advocate, we still have a set of images which are old, unused, of generally low quality, and for which there are many suitable replacements on commons of higher quality. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:50, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

Listed at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike.lifeguard/Sandbox2&amp;oldid=1024791 User:Mike.lifeguard/Sandbox2] (there are 52). I think it's safe to delete these images since they're not being used. Since we have no ''actual'' confirmation that they are licensed in any particular way, they're almost as bad as {{tlxs|nld}} images in terms of licensing.

We should try to email any uploaders who have emails registered. I wouldn't bother leaving messages on talk pages though, since all these uploaders are likely inactive.

: Why is there a need to delete them?  Shouldn't we assume good faith and treat them as licensed unless we know otherwise? [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:02, 10 November 2007 (UTC)
::That seems akin to assuming some random image is PD unless there's a copyright notice. That's not how things work; ''you assume &quot;all rights reserved&quot; until you're told otherwise''. We don't do that for anything else - if someone submitted text that we found on some other website that didn't have a copyright notice, we'd still say it was a copyvio unless the text is specifically licensed in some way that is GFDL-compatible.
::It's debatable whether or not GFDL-presumed is legit for images that are used (and those debates have happened elsewhere, though we don't necessarily have to follow suit) but to assume that these images are GFDL-licensed, as opposed to any of the other numerous licensing options including ''all right reserved'' (which is the default), seems like a Bad Idea to me.

:::I agree that the view that [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard]] expressed is the common accepted way of legally dealing with the problem. 
:::Wikimedia has legally provided our framework, we Wikibookians have historically worked in a preemptive way so to protect not ourselves but the project. I would support a change on how things have been done so to drop any preemptive tasks of addressing or expecting problems, the one that commits the violation is the one responsible (under the actual framework) nothing makes us works pro-activily in detriment of the content and legally the burden isn't really ours (the community in general or Wikibooks/Wikimedia), we just need to comply with our copyright requirements as set forth by Wikimedia.
:::It is my view that requesting for information and clarification is a beneficial move for us (the community). I was expecting someone to extend why we should or not delete just on the presumption of illegality, in my view the project will not benefit from the deletions. Like in any other online community the copyright holder should request and validate the claims, and we can delete them if they are blatant violations.
:::As for the specific case on the table if the images aren't being used they should be removed, saving them if possible into another project and that was Mike was attempting I think. I really don't understand why we must have a &quot;local gallery&quot; duplicating another project efforts and fragmenting contributions, but I'm not into image uploading :). All the images I use are from Commons. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:12, 11 November 2007 (UTC)
::::Erm, no. I wasn't suggesting that they be moved elsewhere. I was suggesting that they be deleted. If there are useful images and anyone has the inclination, by all means, let's remake them and license each one properly before deletion (I will now go through and make note of which ones are worth redoing). Since they're not being used, that may be a wasted effort. If anyone is willing and able, we should be remaking the GFDL-presumed images that ''are'' being used, so we can delete those and instead use images which are explicitly licensed. At issue for now, however, are these 52 unused GFDL-presumed images.

:::::Ok but if your intention was simple deletion why the issue of contacting the uploaders, only courtesy?
:::::In any case I agree with the removal (if they aren't being used) but since you intend to contact the uploaders why not attempt to save the images into another project at the same time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:39, 11 November 2007 (UTC)
::::::Courtesy is exactly why. If we were to get a hold of any of the uploaders, they could license their work properly (who wants to bet on how many will choose GFDL?) and we wouldn't need to delete the image.

*'''Comment''' - I don't mind deleting images that have no disclosure of copyright status but are also not used within Wikibooks.  As a general rule of thumb, images are support objects to help promote the main function of this website:  The creation of textbooks, other non-fiction books, and book-like webpages.  If you want to throw images into a generic repository, it is far and away better to put those images on the Wikimedia commons.  There is very weak support to keep images that are not used in any current book, nor show any promise of being used in the near future.  There is very little in terms of Wikibooks policy that can defend keeping these images on this project.&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I would like to point out that the GFDL-presumed images are mostly older images, and there is no pressing need to delete those images immediately.  If I have heard some people discussing fair-use and copyright law, you are required to assert copyright within five years after something is published in order to dispute copyright.  That is being done in many cases, and content has been removed from Wikibooks by copyright holders explicitly asserting their copyright in the past.  Most images that are GFDL-presumed were uploaded to Wikibooks prior to a project-wide requirement that some sort of copyright disclaimer be asserted to each image, which is one of the reasons why the images are presumed to have GFDL protection.... that was in fact the &quot;policy&quot; that all content added to Wikibooks had permission to be released under the terms of the GFDL.  Unfortunately, most people adding images to Wikimedia projects ignored this requirement and it proved to be unworkable from a general legal viewpoint to defend images that were clearly known to be a copyright violation.&lt;p&gt;To the point, these images are &quot;grandfathered&quot; into Wikibooks and allowed to exist as they were added under earlier policies.  This does not mean that new images should be given the same standard, as they clearly aren't.&lt;p&gt;So the ultimate question lays here, still unanswered..... does anybody want to use these images in a future Wikibook module? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:47, 14 November 2007 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike.lifeguard/Sandbox2&amp;oldid=1027475 This] version of the sandbox linked above has notes about which images may be useful. All could easily be redrawn by someone with a basic level of skill using Inkscape (a favourite around here, AFAIK). I think the best thing to do is remake any images that could be useful, use those properly-licensed versions, and delete the GFDL-presumed images. This has the dual benefit of ameliorating the licensing situation while retaining whatever images may be useful. I'd redo the images myself, but you wouldn't like the result.

::{{del}} It's bad enough that we're presuming to presume the intent of contributors. [[commons:Special:Search|Commons]] has almost 2 million images (more every day) to choose from, and the &quot;commonists&quot; have done a much better job than we have when it comes to making sure things really are free. If an image is needed in the future, [[WB:AGF|someone will surely contribute them]]. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:05, 14 November 2007 (UTC)
::{{del}} &quot;Assume good faith&quot; doesnt really play a part in this argument. Just as it would be good to assume that all GFDL-presumed images actually were donated to the good of mankind, it's also just as good to assume that some people may not have fully understood the implications of the GFDL, or that some people may have gathered some fair-use images for our use here. I think that we should take a good, long look at these images and see if some could be tagged with {{tlx|PD-ineligible}}. Images in that case, which are PD but are unused, should likely be moved to commons so that more people could make use of them. Emailing the original contributors is a good idea, but I suspect it will be fruitless. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:32, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

*:You aren't the first to try sending out emails, and you certainly aren't the first to receive no suitable replies. I spent several weeks at one point trying to track down a few long-gone contributors, and I have to say that the search was fruitless. Some of the articles really are worthless, such as the line-drawings and other bad illustrations. Some of them, such as the japanese characters, can likely be replaced using images from [[commons:Katakana]] anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:31, 20 November 2007 (UTC)

Besides the fact that this book is a videogame strategy guide (which I would normally say is cause enough for deletion), it is basically just a series of lists and tables of statistics about the game, and contains little to no prose. I advocate that this &quot;book&quot; be '''deleted''', although I would also be fine to hear that it was transwikied to strategywiki (if they will take it). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:30, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

==ICRU Reports==
*[http://www.icru.org/ Website]. 
*[http://www.icru.org/pubs_cat.htm Abstracts of ICRU Reports]


*The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU), since its inception in 1925, has had as its principal objective the development of internationally acceptable recommendations regarding: 
#Quantities and units of radiation and radioactivity, 
#Procedures suitalbe for the measurement and application of these quantities in clinical radiology and radiobiology, 
#Physical data needed in the application of these procedures, the use of which tends to assure uniformity in reporting. 
*The Commission also considers and makes similar types of recommendations for the radiation protection field. In this connection, its work is carried out in close cooperation with the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)


*'''ICRU 29''' (1978) - &quot;Dose Specification for Reporting External Beam Therapy with Photons and Electrons&quot;
**Superseded by ICRU 50 (see below)


*'''ICRU 38''' (1985) - &quot;Dose and Volume Specification for Reporting Intracavitary Therapy in Gynecology&quot;
**Definitions of concepts:
***LDR is dose rates between 0.4 and 2 Gy/h and HDR is &gt; 12 Gy/h
***Target Volume: tissues that are to be irradiated to a specified dose
***Treatment Volume: volume enclosed by a relevant isodose surface selected by the radiation oncologist; encompasses at least the target volume
***Reference Volume: volume enclosed by the reference isodose surface (based on agreed reference dose level)
***Irradiated Volume: volume which receives an absorbed dose considered significant in relation to tissue tolerance; may be a percentage of reference dose
**Recommendations for reporting:
***Due to steep dose gradient, maximum / minimum / mean absorbed dose irrelevant (ICRU 29)
***Description of technique used in terms of sources, simulation of linear sources, and applicator
***Reporting in terms of three complementary approaches: total reference air kerma, reference volume, and absorbed dose at reference points leading to calculation of dose distribution
***Total reference air kerma: kerma rate to air, in air, at a reference distance of 1 meter, corected for air attenuation and scattering. Expressed in μGy/h
***Reference volume: 
****For LDR, should use absorbed dose level of 60 Gy; for HDR an equivalent (according to treating radiation oncologist) dose should be specified
****Described by three parameters: height (dimension along intrauterine source), width (perpendicular to height in frontal plane), thickness (perpendicular to height in sagittal plane)
***Absorbed dose at reference points:
****Definitions apply when calculated from two perpendicular radiographs (AP/lateral)
****&lt;u&gt;Bladder reference point&lt;/u&gt;: Foley catheter is inserted; balloon filled with 7cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; radio-opaque fluid. Catheter is pulled downward to bring the balloon against urethra. On lateral radiograph, reference point is on an anterio-posterior line drawn through the center of the balloon, at the posterior surface of the balloon. On AP radiograph, the reference point is at the center of the balloon
****&lt;u&gt;Rectal reference point&lt;/u&gt;: Visualize posterior vaginal wall with intravaginal mould or by opacification of the vaginal cavity with radio-opaque gauze used for packing. On lateral radiograph, a separate anterio-posterior line is drawn from the lower end of the intrauterine source (or the middle of the intravaginal source). Reference point is on this line, 5 mm behind posterior vaginal wall. On AP radiograph, the reference point is at the lower end of the intrauterine source (or the middle of the intravaginal source)
****&lt;u&gt;Bony structures reference points&lt;/u&gt;: On a lateral radiograph, a diagonal line is drawn from S1/S2 to top of symphysis. A line is drawn from a midpoint on this line upward to middle of anterior aspect of L4. The corresponding point on an AP radiograph serves as the top of the lymphatic trapezoid. The right and left lateral points 2cm from midline provide the R PARA and L PARA dose to low para-aortic area. Inferior base of the trapezoid is at the midpoint of the S1/S2 - syphysis line. The right and left later points 6 cm from midline provide the R EXT and L EXT dose to right and left mid-external iliac lymph nodes. The midpoint line connecting the two points (R PARA and R EXT or L PARA and L EXT) is used for estimating R COM and L COM dose to right and left common iliac lymph nodes
****&lt;u&gt;Pelvic wall reference point&lt;/u&gt;: On lateral radiograph, the highest points of the right and left acetabulum in the cranio-caudal direction are joined, and the midpoint is the lateral projection of the pelvic wall. On AP radiograph, the pelvic wall point (RPW or LPW) is the intersection of two lines. A horizontal line tangential to the highest point of the acetabulum and a vertical line tangential to the inner aspect of the acetabulum 
***Duration of treatment should be reported; there is insufficient evidence fo radiobiological considerations


*'''ICRU 50''' (1993) - &quot;Prescribing, Recording, and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy&quot;
**Supercedes and updates Report 29
**Aim of Therapy: Should be defined as radical, palliative, or non-malignant
**Volumes are defined:
***&lt;u&gt;Gross Tumor Volume&lt;/u&gt; (GTV): Gross palpable or visible/demonstrable extent and location of malignant growth
***&lt;u&gt;Clinical Target Volume&lt;/u&gt; (CTV): Anatomical concept. Tissue volume that contains a GTV and/or subclinical microscopic malignant disease, which has to be eliminated. This volume has to be treated adequately in order to achieve the aim of therapy: cure or palliation. The CTV is an anatomical-clinical concept, that has to be defined before a choice of treatment modality and technique is made
***&lt;u&gt;Planning Target Volume&lt;/u&gt; (PTV): Geometrical concept. Defined to select appropriate beam sizes and beam arrangements, taking into consideration the net effect of all the possible geometrical variations and inaccuracies in order to ensure that the prescribed dose is actually absorbed in the CTV. Its size and shape depend on the CTV but also on the treatment technique used, to compensate for the effects of organ and patient movement, and inaccuracies in beam and patient setup
***&lt;u&gt;Treated Volume&lt;/u&gt;: Volume enclosed by an isodose surface (e.g. 95% isodose), selected and specified by radiation oncologist as being appropriate to achieve the purpose of treatment. Ideally, Treated Volume would be identical to PTV, but may also be considerably larger than PTV 
***&lt;u&gt;Irradiated Volume&lt;/u&gt;: Tissue volume which receives a dose that is considered significant in relation to normal tissue tolerance. Dose should be expressed either in absolute values or relative to the specified dose to the PTV
***&lt;u&gt;Organs at Risk&lt;/u&gt;: Normal tissues whose radiation sensitivity may significantly influence treatment planning and/or prescribed dose
**Recommendations for Reporting Dose
***ICRU Reference Point: 
****Dose at the point should be clinically relevant and representative of the dose throughout PTV
****The point should be easy to define in a clear and unambigous way
****The point should be selected where the dose can be accurately determined (physical accuracy)
****The point should be selected in a region where there is no steep dose gradient
****ICRU Reference point should be located at the center of the PTV and when possible at the intersection of the beam axes
****The dose at the ICRU Reference Point is the ICRU Reference Dose
***Dose at/near center of PTV, maximum dose to PTV, and minimum dose to PTV should always be reported
***&lt;u&gt;Maximum Dose&lt;/u&gt;: Highest dose in PTV. A volume is considered clinically meaningful if its minimum diameter exceeds 15 mm; however, if it occurs in a small organ (e.g. the eye, optic nerve, larynx), a dimension smaller than 15 mm has to be considered
***&lt;u&gt;Minimum Dose&lt;/u&gt;: Lowest dose in PTV. In contrast to Maximum Dose, no volume limit is recommended.
***&lt;u&gt;Hot Spots&lt;/u&gt;: Volume outside the PTV which receives dose larger than 100% of the specified PTV dose. In general considered significant only if minimum diameter exceeds 15 mm; however, if it occurs in a small organ (e.g. the eye, optic nerve, larynx), a dimension smaller than 15 mm has to be considered
***Levels of Dose Evaluation for Reporting: 
****Basic: Only dose at ICRU Reference Point and its variation along a central beam axis is available
****Advanced: Dose distribution can be computed for plane(s)
****Developmental: Dose distribution can be computed for volume(s)

*'''ICRU 62''' (1999) - &quot;Prescribing, Recording and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy (Supplement to ICRU Report 50)&quot;
**[http://www.icru.org/n_992_4.htm Report]
**No change to definition of GTV and CTV, since they are oncologic concepts independent of any technical development
**Global concept and definition of PTV is not changed, but definition is supplemented
***&lt;u&gt;Internal Margin&lt;/u&gt; (IM): Variations in size, shape, and position of the CTV relative to anatomic reference points; e.g., filling of bladder, movements of respiration. The internal variations are physiological ones, and result in change in site, size, and shape of the CTV
***&lt;u&gt;Internal Target Volume&lt;/u&gt; (ITV): Volume encompassing the CTV and IM. (ITV = CTV + IM)
***&lt;u&gt;Set-up Margin&lt;/u&gt; (SM): Uncertainties in patient positioning and alignment of therapeutic beams during treatment planning, and through all treatment sessions. The uncertainities may vary with selection of beam geometries, and may depend on variations in patient positioning, mechanical uncertainities of the equipment (e.g. sagging of gantry, collimators, or couch), dosimetric uncertainities, transfer setup errors from CT simulator to treatment unit, and human factors. These may vary from center to center, and from machine to machine
***&lt;u&gt;Planning Target Volume&lt;/u&gt;: PTV = CTV + IM + SM. The penumbra of the beam(s) is not considered when delineating the PTV. However, when selecting beam sizes, the width of the penumbra has to be taken into account and the beam size adjusted accordingly
***Dose variation between +7% and -5% is generally accepted
**&lt;u&gt;Treated Volume&lt;/u&gt;: Volume enclosed by an isodose surface (e.g. 95%). The relative value of the isodose that was selected to define the Treated Volume in relation to the dose at the ICRU Reference Point should be stated when reporting, or can be expressed in absolute values
**&lt;u&gt;Conformity Index&lt;/u&gt; (CI): Treated Volume / PTV; it is implied that Treated Volume completely encompasses the PTV
**Organs at Risk Volumes:
***&lt;u&gt;Organs at Risk&lt;/u&gt; (OAR): Normal tissues whose radiation sensitivity may significantly influence treatment planning and/or prescribed dose. For the moment, is may be useful to state if OAR is serial, parallel, or mixed serial-parallel
***&lt;u&gt;Planning Organ at Risk Volume&lt;/u&gt; (PRV): Analogous to PTV for OAR. PRV = OAR + IM + SM

'''''Phlox stolonifera''''' ('''Creeping phlox''', '''Moss phlox''', '''Flowering moss''', '''Ground pink''', or '''Moss pinks''') is a flowering native to the eastern United States in the forests of the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south to northern Georgia.

==Description==
It is a creeping stoloniferous perennial plant growing 15-25 cm tall. The leaves on creeping stems are 3-4.5 cm long and 1.8 cm broad, those on the erect flowering stems smaller, 2 cm long. The flowers are produced in early spring, 2-2.5 cm diameter, with the five-lobed corolla pale violet to purple, pink or white in color, and yellow stamens.

*&lt;u&gt;Contact Therapy Machines&lt;/u&gt;
**40-50 keV
**filtered with 0.5-1.0 mm aluminum to remove very low energy (beam hardened)
**SSD = 2cm
**50% depth dose at 5 mm


*&lt;u&gt;Superficial Therapy Machines&lt;/u&gt;
**50-150 keV

**filtered with 1-4 mm copper
**SSD = 50 cm, field 20 x 20 cm
**50% depth dose at 5-7 cm
**primary treatment machines &lt;1950's


===Megavoltage Units (&gt;1 MeV)===
*&lt;u&gt;Teletherapy Machine (Cobalt)&lt;/u&gt;
**Introduced in 1951
**[[w:Cobalt-60|Cobalt-60]] decay produces two photons with 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV energies
**dose rate of &gt;150 cGy/min
**SSD = 80 cm, field 40 x 40 cm
**50% depth dose 10 cm
**half-life 5.28 years, requiring replacement of source every ~5 years
**2cm size of source capsule results in a wide penumbra of the beam (esp compared with 4mm LINAC source size)


*[[w:Betatron|Betatron]]
**Developed in 1940 mainly for physics experiments
**Treatment energies up to 45 MeV (although betatron maximum energies were ~300 MeV)
**Massive size, high cost, and low dose rate prevented wide adoption


*&lt;u&gt;Linear Accelerator (linac)&lt;/u&gt;
**Introduced in 1953 for clinical practice
**Please see x-ray production section on more details
**Currently the main treatment machine in modern radiation oncology
**SSD = 100 cm, field 40 x 40 cm
**A single machine may produce several different photon beam energies, as well as function in an electron mode


*[[w:Microtron|Microtron]]
**Introduced in 1972 for clinical practice
**Accelerator that linearly accelerates the electrons (like linac), but confines them using a fixed magnetic field (like cyclotron). Electrons move in increasingly large orbits, and desired energy is selected out for extraction and photon production
**Compared to linac, are simple, small, and have easy energy selection. The beam itself is has small energy spread, beam divergence, and size
**Commercial medical energies up to 50 MeV


==Heavy particles==
===[[w:Cyclotron|Cyclotrons]]===
*Accelerate heavy charged particles (protons, heavy ions, deuterons for production of neutron beams)
*Developed in 1930's for physics research; introduced in 1960's for clinical practice
*Particles are accelerated in circular orbits between two D-shaped half-cyclinders using a fixed magnetic field and variable-radius orbits
*Proton energies of &gt;200 MeV are required for sufficient depth penetration
*Deuteron energies of ~50 MeV are sufficient for production of neutron beams


===[[w:Synchrotron|Synchrotrons]]===
*Accelerate heavy charged particles (protons, heavy ions, deuterons for production of neutron beams)
*Similar to cylotrons, but instead use a variable magnetic field and fixed-radius orbits
*Loma Linda has the first dedicated proton facility


==Production of X-rays==
*Electron Volt (eV) - unit of energy used in radiation oncology. Kinetic energy acquired by an electron at rest after being accelerated through 1 volt field. Acceleration distance does not matter, since shorter distance generates stronger field, leading to greater acceleration. Measure of the beam energy

*X-rays are produced by two steps:
**1 - acceleration of electrons
**2 - collision of these electrons with a metal target, converting their energy into x-rays
***2A - Bremsstrahlung (80% at diagnostic energies, 99% at treatment energies)
***2B - Characteristic x-ray production via ionization (20% at diagnostic energies, 1% at treatment energies)


Diagnostic and therapeutic x-rays differ in their acceleration of electrons; the collision with target and x-ray production is essentially the same

*Diagnostic X-ray electron acceleration
**A metal filament (tungsten) serves as a source of free electrons. The filament is heated to free up more electrons per unit time
**The filament is placed in vacuum to prevent air molecules interacting with the free electrons. Pyrex glass is used to withstand the heat
**High voltage is applied to generate appropriate X-rays

*Therapeutic X-ray electron acceleration
**to be continued ...


*Electron collision with metal target (and production of x-rays)
**&lt;u&gt;Bremsstrahlung&lt;/u&gt; (Radiation)
***Incoming negative electron is attracted by positively charged nucleus, resulting in directional change
***Direction change requires the electron to lose energy, radiated as x-ray photon
***The greater the bending, the greater energy loss, and the higher the generated x-ray energy
***180 degree bending results in all of the incident electron energy to be converted to x-ray. This is the maximum beam energy. Diagnostic x-ray are in the 10 - 150 keV range
***Spectrum of x-rays with different energies is produced, as a function of the different electrons bending differently
***The lowest energy x-rays are most commonly produced, but many are filtered out in the equipment
***The process is not very efficient, converting only ~1% into usable EM (x-rays) and remaining 99% into useless EM (heat)
***The higher the incoming electron energy, the more likely it is converted to x-ray and not heat
**&lt;u&gt;Characteristic X-rays&lt;/u&gt; (Ionization)
***Incoming electron knocks out a K or L shell electron, creating a vacancy in that shell
***Higher shell electron then &quot;jumps down&quot; to fill the vacancy, and in the process sheds the excess energy as EM radiation (photon)
***This radiation is characteristic for a given element (since it is a function of the difference in shell energy levels), and is thus called characteristic radiation
***Characteristic x-rays are produces as a series of peaks, depending on the difference between the source and target shells
***For tungsten, these are at 59.3 keV (L1-&gt;K), 58.0 keV (L2-&gt;K), and 67.2 (M-&gt;K). The L shells are not visible
***Characteristic x-rays do not vary in energy as voltage is changed, as their are a function of the different shell energies, caused by &quot;jumping down&quot; of electrons into a vacated orbital spot
**Since x-rays are generated as a complex spectrum, ''effective energy'' of the spectrum is defined as the single energy that has the same penetration in water as the actual spectrum. For tungsten at keV energies, it is approximately 1/2.2 (45%). For tungsten at MeV energies, it is approximately 1/3

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello

The link in the FASM section leads to infected peges.

== Missing: ASM86. ==

Missing from this page is the original Intel assembler. I think it was called ASM86.
If I recall correctly keywords like &quot;Offset&quot;, &quot;Proc&quot; and &quot;Endp&quot; (and others) came from
this assembler. MASM then copied this syntax.

== Missing: TASM. ==

It strikes me as TASM gets only a passing mention (its &quot;ideal mode&quot;) as part of the section devoted to FASM. Are there objections to making a paragraph about TASM proper ? Such should come just below MASM, IMO. Even though TASM is no more (actively?) sold by Imprise/Borland, it is a nice assembler of historical significance and still available at no cost, as part of downloads from their online &quot;Museum&quot; (packaged with the C,C++ and/or Pascal downloads).

Will someone volunteer to add this paragraph ?  - [[Special:Contributions/90.54.146.59|90.54.146.59]] ([[User talk:90.54.146.59|talk]]) 09:29, 3 May 2010 (UTC) Ninho -</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's divide Digital Art, meaning '''visual art using digital media''' into the following rough categories
* Imitation of traditional art (like Painter, ArtRage, ...)
* enhancing traditional work (like coloring scanned inkings or enhance colors of a scanned image)
* decontextualizing (using digital means for collages or seemingly real photographs)

&lt;big&gt;'''Radiation Interactions'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Atomic Physics==
===Radiation Types===
*Electromagnetic rays (photons)
**Duality of a particle (photon) and a wave (mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic waves)
**X-rays and Gamma-rays are identical in physical characteristics and biological effect, but differ in their origin:
***X-rays - originate outside of nucleus, typically as excess energy shed by an incoming electron when bending around a nucleus
***Gamma-rays - originate within the nucleus during radioactive decay or fluorescence
**Ionizing radiation is that with photon energies &gt; 1 keV
**Shielding by dense high-Z metals (lead, depleted uranium)


*Electrons, Beta-rays, Positrons
**Very light, in tissue do not travel in straight lines but are deflected by coulombic repulsions from atomic orbital electrons
**Lose on average 50% of their energy on interaction
**As a result, have a well-defined penetration &quot;range&quot; in tissue, even though their path is not straight but zig-zaggy = CSDA (continuous slowing down approximation) range
**For 12 MeV electrons, this is couple centimeters


*Protons
**Generated by cyclotron beams (eg MGH, Loma Linda)
**Because they are heavier than electrons, travel mainly in a straight line by &quot;boring&quot; a path through atomic electron clouds
**Toward end of their path rapidly increase interaction with incident atoms, and rapidly slow down, resulting in Bragg Peak
**Shielding by medium-Z metals to provide electrons to slow the protons down. High-Z materials should be avoided, as they produce secondary x-rays and neutrons


*Alpha Particles
**Produced by radioactive decay of heavy radionuclides
**At same energy, travel much more slowly than protons (due to much higher mass), with effective range of couple mm
**Well absorbed by skin (dead layer of cells) but dangerous in mucous membranes (ingestion, inhalation)
**Experimentally used in RT
**Shielding by low-Z materials


*Neutrons
**Interact by colliding with protons (Hydrogen nucleus mainly)
**Shielding by combination of highly hydrogenous (concrete) and highly absorbing (boron-10) materials


==Interaction of X-rays / Gamma-rays with Tissue==
*&lt;u&gt;Excitation&lt;/u&gt;
**Inner shell electron is imparted with sufficient energy to &quot;jump up&quot; to a higher energy shell, but not enough to separate from the nucleus
**It then immediately &quot;jumps down&quot; to its original shell to fill the vacancy, and in the process sheds the excess energy as EM radiation (photon)
**This radiation is characteristic for a given element (since it is a function of the difference in shell energy levels), and is called ''characteristic radiation''
**The chemistry of the atom is ultimately unchanged, but biological changes may be induced by disturbances of the electron cloud geometry


*&lt;u&gt;Ionization&lt;/u&gt;
**Inner shell electron is imparted with sufficient energy to separate from the nucleus (&gt; binding energy)
**Higher shell electron &quot;jumps down&quot; to fill the vacancy, and in the process sheds its excess energy as EM radiation. The EM energy is the same as the energy difference between the shells 
**In large atoms, yet higher shell electrons may then &quot;jump down&quot; in a cascade, resulting in multiple EM emissions
**Once a valence shell electron &quot;jumps down&quot;, the atomic is an electron short, and becomes a free radical
**The emitted x-ray(s) are called characteristic x-rays, and are unique to each element
**Grand average of binding energies across tissue elements and across different shells = 33 KeV (meaning, on average it takes 33 KeV to eject an electron from an atom, and thus ionize the atom)


X-rays/Gamma-rays interact with tissue in 5 different ways:
*&lt;u&gt;Coherent Scattering&lt;/u&gt;
**Only significant at lowest diagnostic x-ray energies (&lt;5% interactions)
**Incoming photon is deflected (absorbed and immediately re-emitted), with minimal direction and energy change
**Can cause problems with contrast in mammography, but not relevant in treatment energies


*&lt;u&gt;Photoelectric Absorption&lt;/u&gt;
**Strongly enhanced in high-Z tissues such as bone, or at lower EM energies (thus not very important at treatment energies)
**Incoming photon &quot;sees&quot; innermost shell electrons (85% K-shell, 14% L-shell, 1% rest), and is absorbed by them
**Depending on the absorbed energy, this can cause the electron to be excitated to a higher shell or ejected from the atom in ionization. If ejected, it is called ''photo-electron'' and causes projectile damage in tissue
**The vacancy is filled (see above in Ionization) from higher shells, leading to characterist x-rays
**These characteristic x-rays may be immediately re-absorbed by the same atom's electrons (common). If they have sufficient energy, may excite or eject another electron in a second ionization event. If ejected, it is called ''Auger electron'' and causes projectile damage in tissues
**The remaining atom may become a free radical, if valence electrons are affected


*&lt;u&gt;Compton Scattering&lt;/u&gt;
**Most dominant interaction in soft tissues at treatment energies
**Incoming photon &quot;sees&quot; individual outermost electrons, and bounces off them like a billiard ball. It is then called ''Compton photon'', and can undergo additional interactions
**In the process, it ejects the electron from the orbit in an ionization event, which causes projectile damage in the tissue. Accounts for ~75% of radiation damage
**The atom becomes a free radical, causing biological damage in the tissue. Accounts for ~25% of radiation damage
**Probability of a Compton interaction is inversely proportional to energy of the incoming photon. 
**It is independent of atomic number, so at treatment energies, bone and soft-tissue interfaces are barely distinguishable (= poor contrast)
**At diagnostic x-ray energies, Compton Scattering direction is fairly random; at treatment x-ray energies, it is forward-peaked
**Energy loss at interaction &lt;20%, so incoming electron can interact numerous times before losing sufficient energy to be absorbed via photoelectric absorption (below)
**This is the main tissue effect at energies 30 keV - 30 MeV


*&lt;u&gt;Pair Production&lt;/u&gt;
**Occurs only at high photon energies (&gt;1.02 MeV) and preferntially in high-Z tissues
**Incoming photon (energy) is converted to mass (electron and positron) in the vicinity of atomic nucleus via E=mc2
**Additional energy over 1.02 MeV is converted to kinetic energy, and divided between the 2 particles
**Positron then interacts with some electron (not necessarily from same atom), and is converted back into 2 EM photon at 0.51 MeV each
**Electron causes projectile damage in the tissue
**Significant pair production can be seen in blocking of the oncoming beam, since blocks are high-Z materials (for lead, this is the main effect at energies &gt;5 MeV)


*&lt;u&gt;Photodisintegration&lt;/u&gt;
**Occurs only at very high photon energies (&gt;7 MeV)
**Incoming photon deposits so much energy, that the nucleus disintegrates
**Source of low-level neutron production (important for radiation shielding)


*&lt;u&gt;Interaction Summary at Therapy Energies&lt;/u&gt;
**Coherent Scattering - no real effect
**Photoelectric Absorption - smaller effect: 1) free electron (photo-electron), 2) +/- free electron (Auger electron), 3) free radical atom
**Compton Scattering - main effect: 1) free electron (Compton electron), 2) free radical atom
**Pair Production - smaller effect: 1) free electron, 2) two 0.51 MeV photons
**Photodisintegration - no real effect


==Interaction of Electrons with Tissue==
*Same process as described above in &quot;Generating X-rays&quot;
*Two fundamental interactions:
**Radiation (Bremsstrahlung) - bending of electrons around nucleus =&gt; shedding of energy as EM x-rays
**Ionization (Characteristic X-rays) - impact with orbital electron =&gt; electron release =&gt; vacancy fill =&gt; shedding of energy as Characteristic x-rays
*Any given electron can in a single interaction lose a very small or very large fraction of its energy, and be deflected by a very small or very largy amount. This leads to large variation among incoming electrons in their path (and distance) into the tissue ('''range-straggling''')


==Interaction of Protons with Tissue==
*Incoming protons also lose energy mainly by interacting with orbital electrons; however, since they are much heavier (~1800x), they only lose very small fraction of their kinetic energy with each interaction, and thus scatter only minimally
*The interactions (and thus energy loss) become more frequent at slower energies. Thus the slower the proton moves, the more energy it loses to the tissue electrons, in a feed-forward loop, until it abruptly loses all energy. This region of rapid energy loss (and its deposition into the tissue) is called the Bragg peak.
*The distance at which Bragg peak occurs, and the energy is deposited, can be calculated very precisely (unlike electrons). The rapid drop-off in dose make it ideal for delivering dose precisely to the tumor, and not to the healty tissue beyond the tumor.
*Incoming protons also rarely interact with the nucleus, and may enhance cell kill by ~10% (PMID 472125 [No abstract] - &quot;The determination of absorbed dose in a proton beam for purposes of charged-particle radiation therapy.&quot; Verhey LJ, Radiat Res. 1979 Jul;79(1):34-54.)

==Interaction of Heavy Ions with Tissue==
*Several heavy ions (helium, argon nuclei) have been tested clinically
*They interact with tissue similarly to protons, but since they are heavier still, they scatter less initially, and have a faster dose fall-off (Bragg peak) at the end
*They also interact with nuclei more often, and may lose a large amount of their large kinetic energy in a single interaction. This high energy deposition is much more efficient per unit dose than x-rays in killing cells (high relative biologic effectiveness = RBE)


==Interactions of Neutrons with Tissue==
*Because neutrons are heavy and neutral, they only lose energy by interacting with nuclei. Similarly to heavy ions, this leads to a sudden large loss (deposition) of energy in a single event. They also have a high relative biologic effectiveness (RBE)
*Similarly to x-rays, the fall-off in dose is exponential (because the interactions are random, unlike proton/ion interactions with increase with slowing velocity). In tissues, 50% of dose is at ~10 cm</text>

&lt;/big&gt;'''Dosimetry'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Biologic damage to DNA and other structures depends on the amount of ionizing (directly or indirectly) energy absorbed from the radiation beam and deposited into the tissue
*Absorbed dose is defined as energy absorbed per unit mass of tissue. It is essentially the measure of liberated electrons
*It is difficult to measure absorbed dose directly in tissues; instead, ionization is measured in air (exposure) and then converted to absorbed dose tissue equivalent


==Radiation Exposure==
*Dose of radiation absorbed correlates directly with the energy of the beam
*Gray = basic unit of absorbed dose, in energy (J) per unit mass (kg). Replaces rad (100 rad = 1 Gy)
*to be continued ...


==CBCT Exposure==
*'''Vanderbilt; 2009''' PMID 19147025 -- &quot;Radiation dose from kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography in an image-guided radiotherapy procedure.&quot; (Ding GX, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Feb 1;73(2):610-7.)
**Monte Carlo simulation, adult and pediatric
**H&amp;N scan, half-fan mode: adult vs. peds eye 7 vs 8 cGy, cord 5 vs 6 cGy, brain 5 vs 6 cGy, vertebra 18 vs 23 cGy. Full-fan mode 10-20% lower dose
**Abdomen, half-fan mode: prostate 3 and 7 cGy, femoral heads 7 and 17 cGy
**Conclusion: Doses can total 3 Gy over entire treatment course

What are your ideas about a newsletter? I would love to help get this kind of thing going. Do you have an email address where you can be contacted, or are there other ways to get in touch with you (AIM, IRC, etc)? 

I would love to chat about this, let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:38, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Pilingual Primer ==

Could you please explain your point of view why the [[Pilingual Primer]] should be deleted in contrast to [[Klingon]], [[Quenya]] and other [[:Category:Constructed Languages|constructed languages]]? The language is, for instance, used for [[Mentoring_Handbook#Awards|Parenting awards]] in the Mentoring Handbook. --[[User:Fasten|Fasten]] ([[User talk:Fasten|talk]]) 17:01, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Help a little bit? ==

I can help, what do you need? Tell me what you want done and I can try to do it. 

We had a newsletter at one point, at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks Gazette]]. People lost interest and so it was abandoned. That may be a good starting point for you, at the very least to see what we had, and possibly pick up where others left off. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:46, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

:I like that idea. Monthly delivery is a good thing, a schedule will help to keep people motivated. Are we going to &quot;deliver&quot; it using some sort of bot, or are we going to simply use a template, and post changes to the template every month? How would we pick who the editors are? Have you taken a look at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks Gazette]]? I think that would be a good starting point, and we can modify what we want from there. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:24, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

::Good, I like it. I certainly would be willing to be an editor. We don't exactly have &quot;departments&quot; around here (not yet anyway), but I'll post out an announcement. This is going to be a small operation, at least at first, so we are going to have to find some stories ourselves. I would like to set this up at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks Gazette]], so we can delete all the old stuff that we don't want, and set up the new structure, templates, whatever. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:42, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

:I've set up a basic news template: {{tlx|Wikibooks gazette}}. feel free to edit/update it as you see fit. The template currently has enough space to hold 9 news stories each issue. Of course, we could expand that if we needed to. I've also cleared out the page at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette]], and set up a basic page for us. We can put stories at &quot;Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette/YEAR/MONTH/STORY NAME&quot;, or something similar to that.

I wanted to ask you a quick question about why you are keeping a copy of a deleted book here in your userspace? The community voted to delete this book, so you can't keep a copy in your user pages for too long.

My comment that Quenya should be nominated for deletion was intended for you, not Girdi. You said that &quot;the content itself does ''not'' belong on Wikibooks per [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Pilingual Primer|Pilingual Primer]] and its demise and eventual deletion&quot;. I'm not sure how that deletion would be a precedent here. Nevertheless, if you think something [[WB:WIW|doesn't belong]] on Wikibooks, then it should be nominated for [[WB:DP|deletion]] - not nominated for de-featuring. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:13, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

The best place to report users that need to be blocked is at the [[WB:AN|administrator's noticeboard]] page. most, if not all of the admins have that page on their watchlist, and requests there will often be handled very quickly. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:22, 12 January 2008 (UTC)
:Another minor point: When you warn users, please use {{tlxs|test|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} so your signature appears in the template. This makes it easier to tell who left what warnings and when - sometimes warnings are mistakes, or are from very long ago. Without the signature, it's tough to tell whether the warning is reliable when deciding whether to block or not. To make things easier, you can enable the Welcome User gadget (or whatever it's called) to automagically warn/welcome users.

== Warnings ==

Hi - I noticed a couple of warnings you placed.  I think I am right in saying that most templates should be &quot;subst&quot;'d so you would want &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for example.  Equally they should be signed so that someone knows who to contact if they wish to do so (newbies may well not understand &quot;history&quot; and the like - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:19, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
:Apologies - didn't realise I was so far behind folks.  The trouble is that with the &quot;+&quot; you tend not to look at what else is on a talk page.

For images with no license info, please tag the image with {{tlxs|nld}} then notify the user with the template code provided (tag all of a user's images with no info, but only one warning is usually needed, since there's a link to a tool to show all their problem images). As well, if you want to help me test a (rather buggy) script I'm working on, please ask me about it - it automagically tags things like this and notifies the user when appropriate. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:59, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

I re-worded your notice there. It's actually ''not'' anyone's job to do anything here unless they choose to do it. As well, deletion is probably not an option for many of those modules as they've likely been tagged as such after a VFD was closed as &quot;no consensus to delete, but there are NPOV problems.&quot; Great to see you still involved in cleanup though - keep it up! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:32, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

Hi - I noticed that yesterday.  In practice we both warned them about the same edit so there are not really &quot;two&quot; warnings.  Had they done anything else at the time I would have blocked them (&amp; will do so if they return).  Bear in mind that blocking is to prevent disruption and as they are not currently editing that is not necessary.  Thanks for spotting it - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:50, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

== Ip warning ==

Hi Laleena! I made a couple of changes to your new template. They should make it easier to do what you intended the template to do, I believe:
{{Ip warning|User:Laleena|this is a test|'''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 02:08, 25 January 2008 (UTC)}}
How's that? And by all means, feel free to change it back if you had other ideas in mind. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 02:08, 25 January 2008 (UTC)
:I also gave this a facelift. It now uses parserfunctions to return the most appropriate message. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:39, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

== Non-latin usernames ==

Those who had user names that were approximately related to latin characters (such as Ł,Đ,α, and others) didn't seem to be that big of a deal.  I think it was Arabic, Chinese, Thai, and other characters that were really off the reservation in terms of similarity to latin characters that really got a few admins into a tizzy for a little bit.  The rationale for removing these accounts (they had the user accounts blocked and the user pages/talk pages deleted) was the fear that non-latin characters would contain potentially offensive words (something IMHO that could be dealt with through other means than blocking all non-latin accounts) and the potential for abuse by vandals, such as the Willy on Wheels accounts.  Some users very legitimately insisted on keeping the non-latin usernames because they started on Wikipedia projects that were decidedly not using latin alphabets (such as the Japanese Wikipedia) and wanted to keep common account names across all Wikimedia accounts.

I pray that such attitudes never come to Wikibooks, and I will fight vigerously against any user/admin who tries to institute such a policy here.  I also fought against such a policy on en.wikipedia as well when it was a hot topic, and strongly voiced my opinion there.  But unfortunately I didn't have admin rights there to undo the actions (almost petitioned to become an admin there for that reason alone, however).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 20:30, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

== {{tlx|Image copyright}} ==

There's really no need to pile on many of these templates. The links in it will find all affected images for the user, so we don't need to fill up their whole talk page with warnings. On the other hand, we often will repeat a warning if the user is ignoring it and many images are slated for deletion. Not a big problem, but having a ton of big red template messages is a bit much for people to deal with, and isn't strictly necessary. Thanks! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:38, 25 January 2008 (UTC)
== Wikijunior ==

It'd be great to have your help on some of the wikijunior books. I think that the languages book looks pretty good but could use some refinement and work on continuity between chapters. That might be a satisfying place to start. The ancient civilizations book seems to have a good head start on it as well.  I'm interested in working on any of the books that could be used for school work. Do you want to just pick one or two books and work on them until they're as good as we can get them and then move on to some of the others? What ones interest you in particular? I'm not picky.

By the way, thanks for your interest. I'm a homeschooling mom and hope to teach orphans in the developing world at some point so I know that these books would be a really valuable resource with a little more work.

== Closing VfD ==

Can't spot the policy for now but certainly practice is that a VfD should rarely be closed in under 7 days (frequently longer) to allow the community time to evaluate the book properly.  It may be best if you revert your closure please - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:15, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

I noticed that you had upgraded Arabic to publishable status but I'm not sure if you noticed that it's still lacking a few things. First, which would have be easily missable, it doesn't include a section for famous authors or poets. The unknown author of Aladdin might be an obvious edition. Also, the section with the poem to learn doesn't have an English translation. What are your thoughts? [[User:Rmawhorter|Rose]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 23:31, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

Just a reminder that you don't need to move images from Commons to Wikibooks to use them. You can just pretend they exist here, and the software does will know what to do. For reference: [[m:Help:Images|Image markup etc.]] &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:24, 12 February 2008 (UTC)
== Making decisions ==

There's no rule that non-admins can't close VFDs, but it is [[Using Wikibooks/The Wikibooks Administrator/The Roles Of The Wikibooks Administrator#Norms and Guidelines|customary]] that decisions are made only by people who can actually take the action decided upon. So that means a nomination for adminship would be closed by a bureaucrat since only they can actually take that action. Admins decide whether to block, since only an admin can take that action. Deviation from this is fine in obvious cases when done properly, but otherwise can be seen as being bossy.

While we normally have no problems with non-admins closing VFDs in obvious cases if they do it properly, that's not been the case in the last 2 you've done. Similarly, when you come across vandals that you think need blocking, just let us know there's someone causing disruption. An admin will make the decision to block or not. Instead what you've done is to say &quot;Block this person,&quot; and almost every time you've done so, it's been a false positive. I think as a relatively new user here, you probably just need to be exposed to the community a bit so you get a better feel of the &quot;culture&quot; here. I'm certainly not asking you to stop participating, but I ''am'' asking that you try to adhere to the norm of letting those who can take the action decided upon to actually make that decision. Thanks for your understanding. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:48, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

'''TG 43''' (Dosimetry of Interstitial Brachytherapy Sources)
*Introduction: New formalism needed due to significant variance in exposure rate constants, and due to difficulty of accurately calculating 2D dose distribution in tissue due to significant anisotropy of actual cylindrical brachytherapy sources
*Description of sources: Iridium-192, Iodine-125, Palladium-103
*Recommended dose calculation formalism:
**Historically: Dose rate = A * f * Γ * 1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; * T(r) * Φ
**New: Dose rate = S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; * Λ * G(r,θ)/G(r0,θ0) * g(r) * F(r,θ)
***S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;: air kerma strength, usually specified at 1 m, unit defined by U (μGy m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
***Λ: dose rate constant, defined as dose rate to water at a distance 1 cm on the transverse axis
***G(r,θ): geometry factor, accounts for variation of relative dose due only to spatial distribution of activity within the source, ignoring photon absorption and scattering
***g(r): radial dose function, accounts for effects of absorption and scatter in the medium along the transverse axis of the source
***F(r,θ): anisotropy function, accounts for anisotropy of dose distribution around the source, including the effects of absorption and scatter in the medium
***Reference point (r0, θ0): lies on transverse bisector of the source, at a distance of 1 cm from its center
**Recommended dosimetry parameters provided for I-125, Ir-192, and Pd-103</text>

      <comment>[[Template talk:Random portal component]] moved to [[Template talk:Random TOC component]]: wikibooks doesn't have portals, but does have TOCs</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Max?==
'''Must''' the &quot;max&quot; variable be included?  - [[User:Tim1965|Tim1965]] 02:42, 9 May 2007 (UTC)
:The computer needs to pick a random integer from 1 to &lt;tt&gt;max&lt;/tt&gt;. The computer wouldn't know what to do if &lt;tt&gt;max&lt;/tt&gt; is unknown.

==Seed?==
What does the &quot;seed&quot; variable actually do? I'm hoping it creates a faux-randomization (e.g., if &quot;seed=3&quot;, then the portal will feature every third sub-sub-page).- [[User:Tim1965|Tim1965]] 02:42, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

:It's not how it works. See [[pseudorandomness]], [[random seed]], and [[pseudorandom number generator]]. I don't understand them myself. You only need to worry about it when there are two or more components in your portal with the same number of subpages. In this case, just specify different seed numbers for the components. Regardless, each and all subpages have equal chance. --[[User:Chochopk|ChoChoPK]] (球球PK) ([[User talk:Chochopk|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Chochopk|contrib]]) 08:20, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

== Description ==

How about a description of what this template actually does? [[User:Samuel Grant|Samuel Grant]] 17:08, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

:Done. --[[User:Chochopk|ChoChoPK]] (球球PK) ([[User talk:Chochopk|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Chochopk|contrib]]) 08:49, 13 August 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks! [[User:Samuel Grant|Samuel Grant]] 15:57, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

== Max max? ==

Is there a maximum number for the max value?  Can the random component randomize and cycle through, say, 100 or more entries?  [[User:Cirt|Cirt]] ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 20:48, 6 December 2007 (UTC).

:As far as I know, there's no maximum.  I'm not aware of anyone that's used a hundred entries; but, for example, [[Portal:War]] uses 60 with no problems. [[User:Kirill Lokshin|Kirill]] 02:37, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Purpose ==

This template is intented to be used to visually harmonize the documentation in the various templates using the [[WP:DOC]] /doc subpage paradigm. &lt;span class=&quot;user-sig user-Quarl&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;—[[User:Quarl|Quarl]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Quarl|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;2007-03-09 04:19Z&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

: Thank you, nice work. -- [[User:Earle Martin|Earle Martin]] [&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Earle Martin|t]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Earle Martin|c]]&lt;/sub&gt;] 13:17, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

: I really like it!  It does indeed appear visually appealing.  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:53, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
::Excellent man! --'''''[[User:Andersmusician|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Andersmusician&lt;/font&gt;]] [[user_talk:Andersmusician|&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;$&lt;/font&gt;]]''''' 20:46, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

::: '''This really is a good idea'''. It's alot easier to read the template if the &quot;doc&quot; section is split onto its own subpage. [[User:Timneu22|Timneu22]] 11:33, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

== Deprecates old way? ==

Does this mean that &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{FULLPAGENAME}}/doc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is totally deprecated? — [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 23:44, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

:Yes. This new solution is much better and looks much better. --[[User:Davidgothberg|David Göthberg]] 07:42, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

== Editprotected to finish merge tagging, and to fork template into template code and doc page per its own purpose (d'oh). ==

{{tl|Editprotected}}

Please add:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Mergeto:Documentation|{{subst:DATE}}}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
to the top of the documentation of this template (i.e. under the template code itself); someone has created and is deploying another system of template documentation templates, and now we have a sensless situation of competition between two sets of templates that functionally do precisely the same thing. I find it unbelievable ironic that this template's own documentation is not using its own advice and having the template and the documentation separated, thus necessitating this editprotected request. SO, please also fork this page into the template code and the documentation /doc subpage so this won't ever have to be editprotected for any reason other than changes to the template's actual code. — &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Tahoma;&quot;&gt;[[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#91;[[User talk:SMcCandlish|talk]]&amp;#93; &amp;#91;[[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|cont]]&amp;#93;  &lt;b&gt;‹(-¿-)›&lt;/b&gt; 05:17, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:There ''is'' a doc page. For clarity I have split up the code into an includeonly and noinclude part, so that the latter is standard.--[[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 08:06, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

==Merge Template:Documentation and Template:Template doc==
{{Discussion top}}
The result was '''merge''' into [[Template:Documentation]] with the merge talk page designated as [[Template talk:Documentation]]. -- [[User:ConradPino|Conrad T. Pino]] 07:23, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

Proposed by [[User:SMcCandlish]].
:'''Merge to &lt;s&gt;{{tl|Template doc}}&lt;/s&gt; {{tl|Documentation}}''': There should probably be only one of these templates, and I prefer {{tl|Template doc}}, since it is slightly more compact, it doesn't include confusing jargon (i.e., &quot;transcluded&quot;), and has the ability to &quot;preload&quot; a doc page (very nice feature). However, I do like the {{tl|documentation}} namespace better, since this doesn't need to be used exclusively with templates. &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;[[User:Mwtoews|m]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6B3FA0&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Mwtoews|t]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 07:58, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

::I did not propose it, I just fixed an error in the tag. Anyway, I support it. Preload works for both templates.--[[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 09:32, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

:::(sorry ... fixed the nominator) &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;[[User:Mwtoews|m]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6B3FA0&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Mwtoews|t]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 18:21, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

:::: See [[User:Pathoschild/Sandbox|my sandbox]] for a comparison between {{[[template:template doc|template doc]]}} and {{[[template:documentation|documentation]]}} (essentially a list of improvements). —&lt;small&gt;{[[WP:ADMIN|admin]]} [[User talk:Pathoschild/s|Pathoschild]] 04:04:00, 09 October 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

:::::This discussion seems rather stagnant. I think {{tl|documentation}} is clearer and it doesn't use an abbreviation. Also, {{tl|documentation}} uses better code. I vote to merge {{tl|template doc}} into {{tl|documentation}}. --[[User:MZMcBride|MZMcBride]] 18:54, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

::::::'''Agree''' — we can always merge any missing features from {{tl|template doc}} in the future. So I guess convert {{tl|template doc}} into a redirect to {{tl|documentation}} ? &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;[[User:Mwtoews|m]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6B3FA0&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Mwtoews|t]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 19:43, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

:'''support''' We need only one way to do this.  --[[User:Gadget850|Gadget850 ( Ed)]] 17:21, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

:'''Support''': I agree with the proposal to keep {{tl|Documentation}} and remove the other variant for aesthetic reasons as well as functional reasons.  I have worked with all the succession templates and have been adding /doc pages to all of them, and after considerable thought, enjoy the first option much better, although I agree that the second does have some handy features.  Keep the pretty one, merge the good features of the ugly one.  'Tis all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:90%;&quot;&gt;&amp;ndash;'''&lt;font color=&quot;Seagreen&quot;&gt;[[User:KuatofKDY|Darius von Whaleyland]],&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;Forestgreen&quot;&gt;[[User talk:KuatofKDY|Great Khan]]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;Lightsalmon&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/KuatofKDY|of the Barbarian Horde]]&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt; 23:48, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

:'''Support''': Keep it at {{tl|Documentation}}—the less templates for this purpose, the better. Perhaps there can be a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Documentation/template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; subpage option for specifying the template namespace (this method could also be applied to other name spaces). Or this can be built into the original, provided someone here has strong Wiki-fu to alter the template display based on its namespace. —'''[[User:Down10|Down10]]'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup style=&quot;font-size:75%;margin-top:-2px;&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Down10|TA]][[Special:Contributions/Down10|CO]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:51, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

:'''Support''': Keep {{Tl|Documentation}}. No need for multiple methods provided the function is equivalent. I've been reading both and finding significant behavior differences indicating lengthy discussion. Where and how shall we discuss the issues and determine consensus? &amp;ndash; [[User:ConradPino|Conrad T. Pino]] 16:54, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

'''Closure''': The merge was proposed [[2007-10-07]] and there are no dissents. Shall the close the proposal and move on to implentation? &amp;ndash; [[User:ConradPino|Conrad T. Pino]] 17:06, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

:There is only one: 1 = name of the documentation page.--[[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 23:19, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

== This template's heading ==

This template previously implemented the classic &quot;(icon) Template documentation&quot; heading but now implements the default {{tl|Documentation}} heading. This change is part of the [[Template talk:Documentation#&amp;#123;&amp;#123;Documentation, template&amp;#125;&amp;#125;'s final fate|&amp;#123;&amp;#123;Documentation, template&amp;#125;&amp;#125;'s final fate]] discussion. &amp;ndash; [[User:ConradPino|Conrad T. Pino]] ([[User talk:ConradPino|talk]]) 18:51, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

==Broken?==

I haven't been following the merge discussion, but I've noticed that yesterday's changes to this template appear to have broken it. See for example [[Template:Citation]] or [[Template:Infobox Football biography]] - doc subpages exist but aren't displayed properly any more. If this isn't a transitory thing I'd suggest reverting to the last functional version of this template.

__NOTOC__
This template automatically displays a documentation box like you are seeing now, whose content is transcluded from another page.  It is intended for pages which are [[w:Wikipedia:Transclusion|transcluded]] in other pages, i.e. templates, whether in the template namespace or not.  

==Usage==
===Normal /doc===
 &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;{{{template-name|Documentation}}}&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;

===Any /doc page===
 &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;{{{template-name|Documentation}}}|Template:any page/doc&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;

===In-line content===
 &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;{{{template-name|Documentation}}}|content=This is documentation.&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;

===In-line content with [view][edit] links===
 &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;{{{template-name|Documentation}}}
 |1=Template:any page/doc
 |content=&amp;#123;&amp;#123;Template:any page/doc|parameters&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 &amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;

===Best practice===
This code should be added at the bottom of the template code, with no extra space before &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (which would cause extra space on pages where the template is used). The parameter can be used as shown above to transclude an arbitrary documentation page.

Add categories and interwiki links to the documentation page inside &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;includeonly&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/includeonly&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags.

If the documentation page contains includeonly or noinclude tags as part of the documentation, replace the &quot;&lt;&quot; with &quot;&amp;amp;lt;&quot;.

===Customizing display===
Overrides exist to customize the output in special cases:
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;documentation|'''heading'''=}}: change the text of the &quot;documentation&quot; heading. If this is set to blank, the entire heading line (including the first [edit] link) will also disappear.

==Functions==
If the documentation page doesn't exist, the &quot;edit&quot; link includes a [[mw:Manual:Creating pages with preloaded text|preload]] parameter so that clicking it will pre-fill the edit form with the basic documentation page format.

==Rationale==
*Use of this template allows templates to be [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protected]] where necessary, while allowing anyone to edit the documentation, categories, and interwiki links.
*Text on the template page itself adds to the amount of text which must be processed when displaying the template, which is limited for performance reasons: there is a [[w:Wikipedia:Template limits|pre-expand include size maximum]] of 2,048,000 bytes. Placing the documentation in a subpage reduces the wikitext for documentation on the template page itself to a template call and noinclude tags. MediaWiki developers have &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=69888944 recommended]&lt;/span&gt; this system for this reason.

This subpage is transcluded into several /doc subpages to identify
the near relataves, far relatives and ancestors of the templates
transcluding this subpage.

Listing additional unrelated templates should be done at the bottom
with section headers clearly stating the relationship between such
additions and the templates transcluding this subpage.

__NOTOC__
This is the {{tl|nowrap}} template.

This template prevents word wraps (line breaks) in text and links that contain spaces. 

=== Usage ===

&lt;pre&gt;
Lots of text {{nowrap|10 kg (22 lb)}} more text.
&lt;/pre&gt;

It may render like this:

:Lots of text 10 kg (22 lb)
:more text.

Or like this:
:Lots of text
:10 kg (22 lb) more text.

But it will ''not'' render like this:
:Lots of text 10 kg (22
:lb) more text. 

=== Handling interpreted characters ===

[[Help:Template|Templates]] have problems to handle parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or vertical bars &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. In such cases consider using {{tl|nowrap begin}} + {{tl|nowrap end}} instead. But there are also workarounds:

For text that includes an equal sign &quot;=&quot;, precede the text with &lt;code&gt;1=&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap|&lt;/nowiki&gt;1=2 + 2 = 4}}&lt;/code&gt;

Which renders this:
:{{nowrap|1=2 + 2 = 4}}

For text that includes a vertical bar &quot;|&quot;, escape the bar(s) with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For instance like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;#124;2&amp;amp;#124; &lt; 3}}&lt;/code&gt;

Or like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap|{{!}}2{{!}} &lt; 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Which renders this: 
:{{nowrap|&amp;#124;2&amp;#124; &lt; 3}}

=== Technical details ===

The actual code that does the job is this HTML+CSS code:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;This text will not wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Spaces at the beginning or end of your text will fall outside the no-wrap tag in the rendered text due to MediaWiki rendering mechanisms.

=== See also ===

* {{tl|nowraplinks}} - Prevents wraps inside links and only allows wraps between the links and in normal text. Very useful for link lists and easy to use.

Hi there. Do you know any Wikipedians who would be willing to come over? I am from Wikipedia myself, but I left do to spam that inflamed my talk page more then once. I'm not coming back for a ''long'' time. Cheers, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 01:49, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|JavaScript|Dates|Operators}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
An '''array''' is a type of variable that stores a collection of variables. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-based - they start from zero. (instead of foo[1], foo[2], foo[3], JavaScript uses foo[0], foo[1], foo[2].)

==Basic use==

To make a new array, make a variable and give it a value of &lt;code&gt;new Array()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;var foo = new Array()
&lt;/source&gt;

After defining it, you can add elements to the array by using the variable's name, and the name of the array element in square brackets.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
foo[0] = &quot;foo&quot;;
foo[1] = &quot;fool&quot;;
foo[2] = &quot;food&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can call an element in an array the same way.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
alert(foo[2]);
//outputs &quot;food&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can define and set the values for an array with shorthand notation.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;food&quot;];
&lt;/source&gt;

===Exercise===
Make an array with &quot;zzz&quot; as one of the elements, and then make an alert box using that element.

==Nested arrays==
You can put an array in an array.

The first step is to simply make an array. Then make an element (or more) of it an array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo2 = new Array();
foo2[0] = new Array();
foo2[1] = new Array();
&lt;/source&gt;

To call/define elements in a nested array, use two sets of square brackets.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
foo2[0][0] = &quot;something goes here&quot;;
foo2[0][1] = &quot;something else&quot;;
foo2[1][0] = &quot;another element&quot;;
foo2[1][1] = &quot;yet another&quot;;
alert(foo2[0][0]); //outputs &quot;something goes here&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can use shorthand notation with nested arrays, too.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo2 = [ [&quot;something goes here&quot;, &quot;something else&quot;], [&quot;another element&quot;, &quot;yet another&quot;] ];
&lt;/source&gt;

So that they're easier to read, you can spread these shorthand notations across multiple lines.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo2 = [
    [&quot;something goes here&quot;, &quot;something else&quot;],
    [&quot;another element&quot;, &quot;yet another&quot;]
];
&lt;/source&gt;


==Properties and methods of the Array() object==
===concat()===
The concat() method returns the combination of two or more arrays.

To use it, first you need two or more arrays to combine.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var arr1 = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;];
var arr2 = [&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;];
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, make a third array and set its value to &lt;code&gt;arr1.concat(arr2)&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;var arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2) //arr3 now is: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

===join() and split()===
The join() method combines all the elements of an array into a single string, separated by a specified delimiter. If the delimiter is not specified, it is set to a comma. The split() is the opposite and splits up the contents of a string as elements of an array, based on a specified delimiter.

To use join(), first make an array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var abc = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;];
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, make a new variable and set it to &lt;code&gt;abc.join()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var a = abc.join(); //&quot;a,b,c&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also set a delimiter.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var b = abc.join(&quot;; &quot;); //&quot;a; b; c&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

To convert it back into an array with the String object's split() method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var a2 = a.split(&quot;,&quot;); //[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;]
var b2 = b.split(&quot;; &quot;); //[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

===pop() and shift()===
The pop() method removes and returns the last element of an array. The shift() method does the same with the first element. (note: The shift() method also changes all the index numbers of the array. For example, arr[0] is removed, arr[1] becomes arr[0], arr[2] becomes arr[1], and so on.)

First, make an array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var arr = [&quot;0&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;];
&lt;/source&gt;

Then use pop() or shift().
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
alert(arr); //outputs &quot;0,1,2,3&quot;
alert(arr.pop()); //outputs &quot;3&quot;
alert(arr); //outputs &quot;0,1,2&quot;
alert(arr.shift()); //outputs &quot;0&quot;
alert(arr); //outputs &quot;1,2&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===push() and unshift()===
The push() and unshift() methods reverse the effect of pop() and shift(). The push() method adds an element to the end of an array and returns its new length. The unshift() method does the same with the beginning of the array (and like shift(), also adjusts the indexes of the elements.)

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
arr.unshift(&quot;0&quot;); //&quot;0,1,2&quot;
arr.push(&quot;3&quot;); //&quot;0,1,2,3&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.
