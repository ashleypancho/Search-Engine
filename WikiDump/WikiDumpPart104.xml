== Hi ==
I've &quot;sighted&quot; (made it the current version shown to readers) your last changes that removed the quotation marks from several operators. I have no special issue with the change, they were added to make it more evident to readers, but the usage should be consistent. For this reason I've made changes to the rest of the text. If you have second thoughts please remember to revere them all.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:15, 13 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

If you like, you can substitute turkey, beef, or even tuna for the chicken.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 cups shredded cooked chicken
* 3 cups cornbread, crumbled finely
* 1/4 tsp each salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tbs minced garlic
* 1/2 large onion, finely diced
* 2 cups shredded Monterrey Jack cheese, divided
* 2 tbs unsalted butter
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 2/3 cup dried breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup unsalted melted butter

== Procedure ==
#In a large straight-sided stainless steel sauté pan set over medium high heat, melt butter with olive oil. Add onion and cook until onion is translucent.
#Add garlic and sauté until golden. Remove and set aside until cool.
#Combine chicken with onion mixture along with the salt, pepper, and 1 cup cheese. Set aside.
#Place enough cornbread to lightly coat the bottom of a parchment-lined high-sided roasting pan in the aforementioned pan. Place a layer of chicken mixture on top and repeat until all has been used up.
#Combine remaining ingredients and sprinkle over top layer. Cover with foil and place in the center of a 375 degree F oven 20 minutes.
#Remove foil and bake for 15 more minutes or until browned and bubbly on top. Serve warm.</text>

[[Image:Music Scale Theory - Circle of Fifths.png|thumb|300px|Circle of Fifths]]

The Circle of Fifths is a memory aid for learning all the keys. Here are some fundamental observations:

Clockwise direction shows all the sharp keys

Anti-clockwise shows all the flat keys

Both directions start at the key of C major which is 12 o’clock

C major is the only key that has no sharps or flats

Clockwise ends with the key of C sharp

Anti-clockwise ends with the key of C flat

C, C flat and C sharp use the same notation letters

Each successive &quot;hour&quot; clockwise adds a sharp

Each successive &quot;hour&quot; anti-clockwise adds a flat

The name &quot;circle of fifths&quot; refers to the interval between the root note of each successive scale in the clockwise direction.

Anti-clockwise the root note of each scale forms the interval of a fourth with the root note of the following scale.

==1. Make at least one puppet, and make or buy two other puppets.==
Before you make (or buy) your puppets, you should have an idea of what the puppet show is going to be about, and the type of puppets you will use.  It is generally a good idea to write a script first, and then develop the puppets needed for the script.  If you will be performing for a multi-cultural audience, you might consider using animal characters instead of human characters.  People of any race can identify with an animal more easily than they can with a human character belonging to a different race.

There are many types of puppets to choose from, and the choice will depend on the skill of the puppet maker as well as the skill of the puppeteer.  Because they are generally easier to build and work with, we will present only the sock puppet.  Other puppet types include hand puppets, rod puppets, shadow puppets, human puppets (think of Sesame Street's &quot;Big Bird&quot;), and others.
===Sock Puppets===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A sock puppet is a puppet made from a sock (or similar garment). When the manipulator fits a hand into the closed end of the sock, the puppet can be seemingly made to &quot;talk&quot;. The puppet's mouth is formed by pushing the sock's toe into the puppeteer's palm, with the puppeteer's thumb forming the jaw.  The top of the puppet's head is formed by the sock's heel.  If desired, felt can be sewn into the sock to stiffen it and form the inside of the mouth.  The sock is stretched out fully so that it is long enough to cover the puppeteer's wrist and part of the arm. 

Sock puppets can be made from socks or stockings of any colour. Worn-out socks may be used, although socks that are too tattered may fall apart during performance, but socks are usually bought brand-new from the store in order to make sock puppets. Various additions can be glued on in order to give the sock a personality. Streamers and felt strings are popularly glued on for hair. Buttons are sewn on or Googly eyes (obtained from craft or fabric stores) are glued on for the puppet's eyes. Some of the eyes in the gallery above were made by attaching Googly eyes to pom-poms.
===Other Types of Puppets===

You can make a hand puppet from a stuffed animal plush toy.  Do be sure that the toy you select is not one anyone (especially a younger sibling) would object to having cut up.  You might consider buying one for this purpose, as used plush toys can be found inexpensively at thrift shops.  The plush toys from which the puppets on the right were made were purchased a week before Valentine's Day at a big box store.  Deals can be found.  Select a plush toy that will allow room for the puppeteer's hand to fit inside.

To turn it into a puppet, examine it carefully and decide where you would need to cut it open so the puppeteer's hand can be inserted.  In general, this means cutting the puppet off at the waist.  Make the cut and remove most of the stuffing.  Trim the ragged edge.  Then insert a sock (or a glove) into the puppet and sew it to the bottom edge of the plush toy.  The purpose of the sock is to prevent the rest of the stuffing from coming out.  If the toy's arms are hollow and can be accessed from inside of the puppet, use a glove instead of a sock, and insert the pinky and thumb of the glove into the arms (you may wish to tack them in place). 

If hand sewing, you may find it easier to insert a plastic cup into the sock before trying to sew.  Then you can insert the needle until it strikes the cup, and then you know that you have picked up exactly one layer of the sock (it would not be good to miss the sock or to sew the sock closed).  Once the sock has been sewn to the plush toy all around, you can either use the puppet as is, or you can make a garment for it.

Puppets can also be made by [[../../Arts and Crafts/Knitting|knitting]] or [[../../Arts and Crafts/Crocheting|crocheting]], or with [[../../Arts and Crafts/Paper Mache|paper mache]].

==2. Develop at least three puppet characters with their own voices.==
Before you choose a voice for your puppet spend some time deciding what the puppet is going to be like.  

===Pitch===
If the puppet is a female or a child, choose a higher-pitched voice.  For a male, choose a lower-pitched voice.  For a large male, make the voice even lower.  
===Accent===
Decide what kind of accent the puppet should have.  Think about where the puppet may have come from.  For instance, if the puppet is a border collie, perhaps it should have a Scottish accent (border collies were originally bred in Scotland).  Other distinctive accents to choose from could include British, Southern U.S., Boston, The Bronx (part of New York City), or even a foreigner speaking English (or other) as a second language.  Listen to people who have such accents (the Internet is filled with videos of people speaking with various accents).  

===Habits of Speech===
See if you can think of a ''hook'' word or phrase that your puppet likes to use, and incorporate that into the script.  For instance, a puppet with a Southern accent might say &quot;I reckon,&quot; and a teenage puppet would use a lot of teen jargon.  An old lady or old man puppet might speak with a crackly voice and would use antiquated phrases.  Decide whether your puppet speaks proper English or makes heavy use of slang.  All of these things contribute to the puppet's voice.

===Practice===
Record yourself speaking in your puppet's voice, and listen to it.  Try out a lot of different voices, and then listen to the recordings.  If you hear something you like, see if you can refine it, again with the recorder running.  Once you think you have something, perform the voice for one of your friends and see what they have to say about it.  More refinements could be suggested.

==3. Write three two-to-three minute scripts.==
The hardest part about writing a script is getting a story idea.  You could choose a story from the Bible and either play it as written or adapt it in some way (much the way several VeggieTales movies have a different take on a Bible story).  Another source of ideas would be your AY curriculum.  All of the progressive classes have requirements that can be met by putting on a skit or by role playing.  These can easily be translated into puppet shows.

It's OK to work on these scripts as a group, but be sure that everyone participates.

==4. Perform to any audience (not family or immediate friends) at least three times.==
Now that you have puppets, voices, and a script, it's time to rehearse your puppet show.  Appoint someone the director of the puppet show.  This person should not have a puppet to operate, but rather, should take charge of the entire operation.  The director will tell the puppeteers what type of expression to use in their voices, and will watch the play as it progresses.  The director's job is to point out any mistakes the puppeteers make so that they can correct them rather than reinforcing them.  The puppeteers need to understand that the director is only trying to improve the play, and they must be open to constructive criticism.

Once everyone knows their lines and knows how to move their puppets on the stage, it is time to perform the play.  This can be done during a Pathfinder meeting, as the children's story during church, or even as the sermon (in whole or in part) on Pathfinder Sabbath.  You could also take your show on the road and perform it for school children (though you need to make sure that the school knows the nature of the play - public schools in the U.S. are not allowed to host religious events, and schools in other countries are expressly forbidden to allow evangelism from religions that are not expressly sanctioned by the state.)

You could also offer to perform your play at a day care center.

Another thing you might consider which may (or may not) help your performance go more smoothly is to pre-record the puppet show's sound track, including all the voices.  In this way, you may utilize a larger group of people by using different people to operate the puppets and provide the puppet voices.  Or you can use the same people.  This approach will also allow you to add music and sound effects, and it eliminates the risk of a person botching their lines or succumbing to stage fright.  

Other risks are added however.  Prerecording the audio removes spontaneity (though in some cases this might be desired) and precludes the possibility of adapting to an unforeseen situation (such as prop or stage failure).  You also take on the risk of technical failure of the audio equipment.  As with a completely live performance, the key is to ''practice''.

==5. Obtain an assessment of each performance by someone not related to the puppeteer.==
The reason for have the assessment done by someone who is not related to the puppeteer is to avoid bias.  Sometimes relatives will tell you you did a great job even if you did not because they do not want to hurt your feelings.

It is important to get honest feedback, because that is the only way you will be able to improve.  If possible, video tape the performance and go through it with the puppeteers afterwards, pausing the videos to discuss various points.  The assessor should not only point out the weaknesses and what went wrong, but should also point out the strengths and the things that went right.

Try to keep in mind that this honor belongs to the Outreach Series of AY honors, and remember what that implies.  The purpose of learning puppetry in this honor is so that it may be used as an evangelism tool.  Good puppets, good voices, good scripts, and good execution of the play can be a very effective evangelism tool.  Poorly made puppets, boring voices, ill-conceived scripts, and inexpert execution are far less effective.  The audience may lose interest, or start thinking about how awful the presentation.  Rather than the audience getting lost in the message, the message gets lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell offers this advice: &quot;Every Scout ought to be able to fish in order to get food for himself. A tenderfoot [beginner] who starved on the bank of a river full of fish would look very silly, yet it might happen to one who had never learned to catch fish.&quot;

Requirements

1. Do the following:
a. Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you may encounter while participating in fishing activities, and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to these hazards.
b. Discuss the prevention of and treatment for the following health concerns that could occur while fishing, including cuts and scratches, puncture wounds, insect bites, hypothermia, dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and sunburn.
c. Explain how to remove a hook that has lodged in your arm.
d. Name and explain five safety practices you should always follow while fishing.

2. Discuss the differences between two types of fishing outfits. Point out and identify the parts of several types of rods and reels. Explain how and when each would be used. Review with your counselor how to care for this equipment.

3. Demonstrate the proper use of two different types of fishing equipment.

4. Demonstrate how to tie the following knots: clinch, Palomar, turle, blood loop (barrel knot), and double surgeon's loop. Explain how and when each knot is used.

5. Name and identify five basic artificial lures and five natural baits and explain how to fish with them. Explain why baitfish are not to be released.

6. Do the following:
a. Explain the importance of practicing Leave No Trace techniques. Discuss the positive effects of Leave No Trace on fishing resources.
b. Discuss the meaning and importance of catch and release. Describe how to properly release a fish safely to the water.

7. Obtain and review the regulations affecting game fishing where you live. Explain why they were adopted and what is accomplished by following them.

8. Explain what good outdoor sportsmanlike behavior is and how it relates to anglers. Tell how the Outdoor Code of the Boy Scouts of America relates to a fishing sports enthusiast, including the aspects of littering, trespassing, courteous behavior, and obeying fishing regulations.
9. 
Catch at least one fish and identify it. If regulations and health concerns permit, clean and cook a fish you have caught. Otherwise, acquire a fish and cook it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tutorial to build a basic house:

Note updating the images is awkward in wikibooks so 2.65 instructions have been simply added.

We start with the default screen in Blender.  For 2.65 click on view menu lower left corner then select right.

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender1.jpg]] 

We want to be able to adjust the size easily and exactly so we need the properties on screen.  Press the &quot;N&quot; key to show this. 2.65 has a super set of properties. Also note in 2.65 you may need to go to view and select view persp/ortho to select the ortho view.

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender2.jpg]]

Our basic house is going to be 18 feet wide, 30 feet deep and 18 feet high.  It's simpler to work in meters with Blender so go to Google and type in &quot;18 feet in meters to feet&quot; the answer is 5.48, 30 feet is 9.144 so we type these numbers into the dim property tag.  Z is height, y is width, and X is depth.  For 2.65 these go into the dimensions: 

Blender centers the object at 0,0,0 we want our house to be at ground level.  So we divide the Z value (height) by two and put that number into the Z location field.

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender3.jpg]]

To make the roof we will first duplicate the house, so &lt;shift D&gt; followed by &lt;escape&gt;.  Now we need to raise the roof by the height of the house so add in 5.48 to the existing Z value to give 8.22.

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender4.jpg]]

Roofs are usually pointed so we need to edit our cube.  We press &quot;A&quot; to deselect everything. 

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender5.jpg]] 

Next we switch into edit mode from object mode at the green arrow.  Then we select the top corners by pressing B then drawing a box round the top corners.  We merge them together by scaling the y axis to zero, &quot;S&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;0&quot; &lt;enter&gt;.  Now we eliminate duplicate vertices by pressing &quot;W&quot; then &quot;remove doubles&quot; from the menu.  For 2.65 you may need to repeat this for the rear two vertices.



[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender6.jpg]]

To adjust the shape go back to object mode and adjust the numbers in the properties tag to make the roof a little wider than the house giving it eaves by increasing the Y value and a little lower in height by reducing the Z value.  We can also change the name of the cube to roof too make it a bit easier for us to keep track.

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender7.jpg]]

That is the basic house created.  Now we need to texture it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">File, save before doing anything else.

[[Image:Create house tutorial export screenshot in Blender9.jpg]]

Then File, export, Trainz export XML.  If Trainz export XML is not an available option exit Blender and ensure that the Trainz exporter has been installed in the correct script folder.


[[Image:Create house tutorial export screenshot in Blender10.jpg]]

Click OK to export the mesh data.  Technically you can also export an animation here or scale the export if you prefer to work in feet.

[[Image:Create house tutorial export screenshot in Blender11.jpg]]

In this case the file being exported is called Leopold street, it will create both the &quot;leopold street.xml&quot; file and a &quot;Leopold street.im&quot; file.  File names without spaces in them are easier to handle so you can change the suggested file name to body to create a body.im file which is simpler in the config.txt file.


[[Image:Create house tutorial export screenshot in Blender12.jpg]]

The export is complete.

Now to get the asset into Trainz we need some red tape so 

Download kuid:86627:1791 this is the cylinder scenery asset.  Clone this asset.  Then use edit, edit in explorer.

Then you copy the .im, the &quot;terrace one.tga&quot; and &quot;terrace one.texture.txt&quot; file into the cloned folder.  Now we have to tell Trainz to look at the new .im file so open the config.txt file in notepad and change the following lines 

name                                    &quot;cylinder scenery&quot;
trainz-build                            1.5
asset-filename                          &quot;cylinder&quot;
username                                &quot;cylinder scenery&quot;

name                                    &quot;test house&quot;
trainz-build                            1.5
asset-filename                          &quot;body&quot;
username                                &quot;test house&quot;

Save the config.txt file and commit &lt;Ctrl&gt;M.

Now look for &quot;test house&quot; in surveyor.

Before uploading it you will need to do a screenshot and resize it to 240 by 180 .jpg, either rename this reskin240.jpg or change the name in the config.txt file.  You will also need to go through the config.txt file and put your name in as the author etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have studied computer programming, computer science, engineering, electronics, and a range of other things including massage, aromatherapy, law &amp; politics... but strangely, I mainly worked in sales &amp; entertainment.

I grew up with the earliest paper &amp; dice games that made things like World of Warcraft possible (R.I.P. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax Gary Gygax]). So I am keen to use Wikiversity &amp; Wikibooks to learn as much as I can about programming &amp; electronics to further my studies, and eventually develop my own games.

==Working On==
* Currently working on a hobby business as a consultant &amp; problem solver. I will write more about this later.</text>

This sauce is great with chicken, but there's a bit of sugar in this sauce, so put it on things 15 or 10 minutes before you take it off.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 quarts ketchup
* 1 1/2 cups maple syrup
* 1 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Hickory BBQ Rub|Hickory BBQ Rub]]
* 2 tbs yellow mustard
* 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
* 2 habanero chiles, stemmed

== Procedure ==
#Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan or pot. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until liquid has reduced by 1/3. Remove chiles and discard.
#Keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks.

== Notes ==

By maple syrup, I do not mean that pancake syrup! Grade B Amber would be very nice.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ technique }}

Backyard grilling is sometimes used synonymously for 'barbecuing', though it is one method of barbecuing.  Barbecuing actually encompasses three distinct types of cooking techniques. One type is charbroil-grilling over direct dry heat on a ribbed surface, usually a hot fire (i.e., over 500°F) for a short time (minutes). A similar technique is griddling over direct dry or moist heat (sometimes with the additions of oils and butter) on a flat surface over a hot fire, at the same pace as charbroiling. Grilling and griddling may be done over wood, charcoal, gas (natural gas or propane), or electricity. Another technique is braising, which combines direct dry heat charbroil-grilling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat, cooking at various speeds throughout the duration (starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours). The other technique is cooking by using indirect heat or low-level direct radiant heat at lower temperatures (usually around 240°F) and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), often with smoke.

== Charbroil Grilling ==

Charbroil grilling is done on some kind of ribbed surface or grill over direct, dry heat.  The heat source used can vary.  The most common heat sources are:

[[Image:Barbecue_DSCF0013.JPG|thumb|right|200px]]

* Wood
* Charcoal
* Natural gas or propane
* Electricity

This method of cooking is very quick and easy.

==== Wood ====
Cooking over wood is very flavourful.  Different woods are used to control the burn rate and temperature.  In general, hard woods are burn slower and slightly cooler, while soft woods burn faster and slightly hotter.  Wood needs to be dried and appropriately aged before use as a fuel.  Cooking over wood can be very expensive, so usually wood chips are combined with some type of charcoal, which is very inexpensive and more readily obtainable.  Charcoal also burns far more predictably than wood.

==== Charcoal ====
There are generally two types of charcoal you can purchase:  briquettes and lump charcoal.  

[[Image:Charcoal_Briquette.JPG|thumb|right|200px]]
Briquettes are inexpensive and have a controlled and very predictable. You can buy them in most grocery stores.  They come in heavy paper bag and consist of pillow-shaped pieces that contain everything from sawdust to sodium nitrate (&quot;Chile saltpeter&quot;) to cow manure.

[[Image:Charcoal.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
Lump charcoal is also relatively inexpensive, and some varieties have a good, controlled burn rate.  Many grocery stores are also starting to carry lump charcoal, which is usually comprised of pre-charred hardwood and contains nothing else.  These usually impart a nice, smoky flavour to the food.

==== Meats ====

When cooking outdoors, it is extremely vital to cook any meat products thoroughly in order to eliminate any bacteria. The easiest way to accomplish proper and thorough cooking is through the use of a grilling thermometer which can be purchased at your local hardware store. In order to improve efficiency, a meat slicer may be used to thinly slice your meat before it is cooked. 

When preparing meat, various spices and flavor enhancers may be added to improve the overall quality and taste of your meal. It is common to bathe chicken in a mixture of flavoring before cooking, allowing the uncooked meat to soak up the flavoring.</text>

This idea is revolutionary. I mean, who would ever think about making a burger that was crispy and breaded, right?

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound ground chuck
* Olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 3 eggs, beaten
* Panko breadcrumbs
* 4 hamburger buns, split in half and toasted
* Mayonnaise

== Procedure ==
#Form chuck into 4-ounce patties, about 3/4 inch thick, with a slight depression in the middle. Season on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Dip burgers into beaten egg. Dredge in panko breadcrumbs and set aside.
#Heat a griddle over medium high heat 2-3 minutes. Add enough olive oil to generously coat the pan, and add patties. Cook 3 minutes per side for medium rare, 4 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes per side for well done ('''NOT RECOMMENDED''').
#Spread cut side of buns with mayo. Add a patty on top of the bottom half of a bun, then top with top half. Serve warm.</text>

I've been working with A/D and D/A converters for over 25 years, and I have never seen an A/D that output floating point numbers, or a D/A that accepted them.  Therefore, I suggest removing the floating point section of this page.

I think this article was intersting because it game me a better understanding of what the different teaching programs were available at schools but also what they are really about. I think that by having these programs in place in school they kind of take away what college experience should be all about. I al think that by having these programs it weeds out students that are promising in some areas as well as get them better prepared for college. In conclusion I approve and disaproove of the programs in different areas. [[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 03:48, 26 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

I really enjoyed reading your article. Excellent job breaking everything down into easy to read sections. I especially liked the paragraph you wrote that discusses the principal. I think it is imperative that the principal is involved in all aspects of the school. My daughters elementary school principal is a principal that is very involved. Believe it or not, he knows the name of a majority of children that attend there and welcomes everyone in the morning by name. When my daughter went to kindergarten she had problems adjusting for the first week...the principal took her by the hand and they skipped to the classroom. Another aspect of the principal being involved can be seen in each classroom. During observation week, the teachers are not stressed at my daughters school because they are not afraid of the principal. The principal frequently drops in the classrooms and takes time to interact with the children and teachers so that when it comes time for testing or observation, you won't see everyone running around trying to get last minute things done...this is due to known expectations of the principal and his demeanor around the students and teachers.  Great job on the sidebar information...kudos[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:21, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I thought there was a lot of great information.  At the beginning two of the three learning targets were not measurable and could just use a little tweaking and work fine.  I liked how the layout of the page was nice and uniform.  I found it easy to read and I thought it flowed very well.  I may have chosen a darker font or something a little easier to read.  I thought that article really hit on some great topics that atrribute to an effective school.  I also thought the pictures and the small additions throughout the article really added to it and broke up all of the writing to make it more enjoyable to the reader.

I really enjoyed this article. The topic is one that we as education majors will probably face for the extent of our careers. It is full of very valuable information. I feel that I got a lot out of the article, because it is all relevant information. The article was very well written. I like how you included the comment about it taking the whole village to educate a person. I think that this is one of the most important pieces of information in this article. Without the cooperation of all of those listed people it would be hard to be able to run a successful school let alone an entire district.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Number of Pre-Randomized Quizzes==

If you're using any randomization in your quiz or sections, Question Writer handles this by generating a number of pre-randomized quizzes when you publish. One of these is selected at random each time a quiz-taker accesses the quiz. It is usually better to have more rather than less of these pre-randomized quizzes as this minimizes the possibility that two quiz-takers will see the same quiz or the same quiz-taker will see the same quiz twice in a row.

Balance this against the time it takes to publish your pre-randomized quizzes and the space that the pre-randomized quizzes will take up.



[[Image:QW3Pre Randomized.jpg|center]]


See [[../../../Frequently Asked Questions/Randomization|Frequently Asked Questions]] for an idea of how this can be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This page allows you give initial instructions to the Quiz Takers and collect basic identifier information from them.  The “next” button will not appear until all the input fields have something entered in them – so forcing the quiz takers to supply you with their id information.

[[Image:QW35 Introduction.jpg|center]]

===Display Instructions===
If you tick the '''Display Instructions''' box a short message will be shown to the quiz taker at the start of the quiz.  You can amend the text of this message if you wish.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |You can also include an image (or audio or video as .swf) in this screen.  You do this by browsing for the required image, uploading and then adding it.  For more detailed instructions see [[../../About Questions/Adding Questions|Adding Questions]].{{clr}}
|}

===User Identification===
A Tick box gives you the option collect personal identifiers for your quiz takers, eg Name or ID number.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |

===User Identification===
With the Professional version, tick boxes allow you to set and collect up to 5 different identifiers for your quiz takers, eg Name, ID number, Email address, Company, Location.  You can change the information that you collect by changing the name of each identifier in [[../Other Labels/]].  These identifiers will appear in the results reports.

===Field Length for User Data===
The Professional version also allows you to input the field length for the user identification fields.  You can enter anything you feel appropriate - but remember that space on a web page is limited.{{clr}}

This book is for students interested in understanding the variety of Japanese literature and its importance in the realm of world literature.  Japanese literature has a long and illustrious history; in fact, the first known novel was written by a Japanese woman over a thousand years ago.  In comparison to that novel, which translates (with notes) to roughly two thousand pages, the field is now best known for ''haiku'', a form of short poetry.  This book will discuss how Japanese literature spanned the distance between thousand-page novels and 17-syllable poems, working its way to modern Japanese literature and developments such as the light novel.

This format allows student to learn about the large and diverse category that is &quot;Japanese literature&quot; in a simplified manner.  When works are brought up that appeal to a given student, it is hoped that she will find copies to read on her own.  In this way students will gain a comprehensive overview of a complicated topic.

This properties window contains a series of tick boxes relating to the appearance of the question on the screen, most of which are self explanatory.

[[Image:QW35 General Question Properties.jpg|center]]

===Show Question Number===

The question number can be displayed at the top of each question page using this option

===Randomize Question Options===

This randomizes the order in which answer options are displayed in Multiple Choice, Multiple Response and Partial Credit question types. In Sequencing and Matching question types, options are always randomized.

===Display Point Values For Questions===

The number of points awarded for each questions is shown to bottom right hand side of the question if this option is selected.

===Display Title With Each Question===

This option displays the title of the quiz at the top of each question page.

===Use Image Zooming===

When an image or piece of Flash is displayed with a question, it can optionally be shown in the top left hand corner and zoomed to full size when the mouse moves over it. If this option is not selected, the image appears at its default size at the top of the question.

===Never Show Back Button with Questions===

|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | [[Image:QW3 Pro star icon.png]]
| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |
This tick box allows you to give quiz takers credit for an answer that is not 100% correct in the sequencing and matching question types.  

For matching questions a score based on the number of correct matches is awarded. 

For sequencing questions, a more complex scoring method is used by calculating the number of correct relative pairs sequenced. (There's a blog article here that goes into more detail, [http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2008/02/sequencing_question.html]). {{clr}}

===Allow Overall Negative Marks From Partial Credit Questions===

|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | [[Image:QW3 Pro star icon.png]]
| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |
You can choose whether or not you allow negative scores for Partial Credit Questions. These negative scores will the be set against positive scores achieved in other questions. If you don't allow negative scores, the minimum score that can be awarded for any question is 0.{{clr}}

===Allow Overall Negative Mark for Whole Quiz===

[[File:QW35 Question Options 2.jpg|center]]

===Fill In The Blank Answers Must Use Correct Capitalization===

This determines whether the scoring for Fill In The Blank style questions is case sensitive. If Correct Capitalization is required and the required answer was 'Blue' but the quiz taker entered 'blue' - they would not score any points.

| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | [[Image:QW3 Pro star icon.png]]
| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; | 
===Award Points for Answers with Spelling Errors===
A very big drawback to Fill In the Blank questions is having to identify the exact characters that a quiz taker must type in to get a question right. This feature allows you to award full or partial marks to quiz takers who come close enough.

You can also specify how close they have to be.  The default setting is 30%, meaning 3 errors in a 10 letter word or 1 in a 4 letter word.

An error is either
#Wrong letter (Necessery)
#Missing letter (Necesary)
#Extra letter (Neccessary)
#Two letters switched around (Recieve)
#Where case-correct answers are required, switching the case of a letter is also marked as a single error. (washington)

You can still define multiple correct answers, and the one with fewest errors compared to the student's answers will be used


===Award only Partial Credit for Spelling Errors===
This tick box enables partial credit to be awarded for partially correct answers.{{clr}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Text Settings==

This section allows you to use HTML or a variety of embedded fonts (selected from a drop down box) and to select a different font  or font size for your title or body text to replace the default fonts set up within the theme used.

[[Image:QW4 Text settings2.jpg|center]]


===Use HTML To Format Text===

When this option is switched on, you can change the way text is displayed by using HTML formatting. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags bold. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags italic. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;24&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Arial Red at point size 24&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags point size 24, color red, font face Arial. Relative sizes can be used - eg -2,-1,+1,+2 to make the text relatively larger or smaller. Absolute sizes can be used also - eg 36. Absolute sizes smaller than 8 are treated as HTML sizes (1 is very small, 7 is very large). Font colors can be HTML colors(red, yellow, white etc) or RGB style colors (color=&quot;#FFCCFF&quot;) 


[[Image:QW3 Using html1.jpg|left]]


[[Image:QW3 Using html2.jpg|right]]

{{clear}}
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Center Alignment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This causes a new paragraph to be created and any text in that paragraph to be aligned in the center. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This creates a new line.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;superscript&lt;/sup&gt;
E = MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a superscript.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;subscript&lt;/sub&gt;
The chemical symbol for Oxygen is 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a subscript

HTML formatting can be used in all text fields with one exception - it cannot be applied to the text that appears on next and back buttons.&lt;br&gt;

===Accept Newlines in HTML===
If you are using HTML tags in text fields you will need to tick this box so that a new line is started when you use return when entering the text. &lt;br&gt;

===Optimize Text for Small Screens===
Tick this box if you are creating quizzes for use on portable devices.

===Embed Font===
When the quiz taker enters text at the keyboard, the quiz can either use a system font or (with this option checked) an embedded font. Using an embedded font guarantees that the font will be used and the chosen characters will be available. You can ensure that all the letters and accents that a user might want to enter are embedded by choosing the right character set for the quiz taker's language.

The embedded font is used in the Fill in the Blank and Essay style questions. It is also used when the user is prompted for Name/UserID at the start of the quiz.

For text entry in Japanese and other languages with large character sets, it is usually better to switch off this option as the number of characters is very large and leads to a very large file size.

===Override Title Text Font===

Each theme can define a different font to use in the quiz for titles - you can override that selection by choosing your own font here.


===Override Title Text Font Size===

As well as changing the font used you can also change the default font size for the titles.  This could be useful eg if you want to display your quiz using an OHP and need to make sure everyone in the room can read the text.

===Override Body Text Font===

Each theme can define a different font to use in the quiz for body text - you can override that selection by choosing your own font here.

The body text font is also used for text entry, next and back button text, and generally any text that isn't Title text.

===Override Body Text Font Size===

You can override the default font size used in the body text.  This might be useful eg if you have particularly long questions and have trouble fitting them on to a single page.

Quiz authors using the Professional version can use this option to adjust the quality of any jpg images used.  Set the size/image quality balance to suit your own quizzes.  If your quiz is designed for use on a CDROM - you won't mind having a large file size and usually you'll want to have high quality images.  If the quiz is to be available over the internet you'll often want a smaller file size to minimize quiz download times and so might choose to have a lower quality image.{{clr}}

===Allow User To E-mail Report to===

You can give the quiz taker the option to press a button on the final report screen to email their report. This will use the user's e-mail client and the user will have the opportunity to change the e-mail address / report details.

[[Image:QW3 email results.jpg|center]]


This is a convenience for the user - the results by e-mail service offered in the [[../Web_Settings/Send_Results_over_the_Internet|Web Settings]] is much more reliable for most purposes.

===Allow User To Print Report===
You can give the quiz taker the option to press a button on the report screen to print their report. This can be a good way to provide a certificate for the quiz-taker.

There are errors on this page.

ga, njega are NOT reflexives but accusative forms. The reflexive is SE. This is a serious factual error.

There are other verb types, for example

* gurnuti - gurnem
* darovati - darujem
* tresti - tresem

That are not mentioned at all. This module may mislead people to concluding there are only three verb types in Croatian.</text>

==Some comments==

&quot;Feminine nouns such as Hrvatska (in its nominative form) will have an -e replacing the -a on the end of the noun, so Hrvatska in its genitive form is Hrvatske.&quot;

This is VERY misleading, since Hrvatska is NOT a normal feminine noun, but changes as an adjective: gen. Hrvatskoj.

&quot;The dative also is used in prepositions such as u (in), na (on), pod (under), pred (in front of) and kroz (through)&quot;

This is actually the '''locative case''' after u, na, o. But it's forms are the same as the dative, something that '''has to be''' mentioned.

&quot;The accusative is the object of a sentence. From the earlier sentence, I was going home, I was the nominative, and home is the accusative. Masculine and feminine nouns in the singular accusative endings depend if the object is moving. If the object is inanimate like a town or house, the word doesn't change, it stays as the accusative, but if the object is moving, it will be the same as the genitive, like say that the town was moving, for some strange reason.&quot;

This is simply false. Accusative of '''masculine inanimate''' nouns is same as nominative, and of '''masculine animate''' nouns same as genitive. This has nothing to do with the feminine nouns. Also, has nothing to do with the motion.

The motion has to do something with prepositions u, na, which must use accusative if it means motion (the same as in German).


&quot;The locative is used to denote certain locations, such as:&quot;

It's used with some prepositions denoting locations, but not with all of them. &quot;ispod stola&quot; uses gen. and it's a location. &quot;pod stolom&quot; uses ins. and it's a location, etc.

&quot;The masculine nouns end with -u when in the locative, and feminine nouns end with -i when in the locative. The main prepositions followed by the locative are &quot;in&quot; and &quot;on&quot;.&quot;

Neuter nouns are not mentioned, and neither i-class of nouns...

&quot;The instrumental is used to denote actions, such as:&quot;

Not actions, but means of doing actions or any tools used. And it's used with prepositions s, pod, nad...

&quot;Below are a few examples of some nouns and how they change with what case, whether they're masculine, feminine, singular or plural. It is very hard to remember the cases and how nouns follow, so this will help to have a clearer picture of it all.&quot;

It fails to mention that cases are much simpler in plural, also pattern for i-nouns like &quot;stvar&quot; is not given.

&quot;Nouns that have -k as the last letter change to -c before going into the cases.&quot;

This is again incorrect. k, g, h changes to c, z, s only before -i- in case endings:

putnik, putniku (dat.), putnika (acc.), putni'''c'''i (nom. pl.) putnika (gen. pl.) putni'''c'''ima (dat., loc., ins. pl.)

&quot;Locative is only when we have preposition about. Eg. 'About school' translated to Croatian 'O školi'. This is locative. And with in can be only accusative or dative eg. I'm at school. - Ja sam u školi. - dative; I'm going to school. - Idem u školu. - accusative&quot;

And even this rule doesn't work always for dative sg. of feminine nouns.

This page needs a lot of work.</text>

\badness
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
Every time TeX constructs a box, it calculates a measure of the quality of spacing within the box known as ''badness''. It is an integer between 0 and 10000. The TeX primitive \badness is a integer parameter that is set by TeX each times a box is constructed. If there is no overflow error for the box being constructed, then \badness is set to the ''badness'' of the constructed box. If there is an overflow error, then \badness is set to 1000000.

==Class Project Guidelines==
You may find this page helpful: [[Wikibooks:Guidelines_for_class_projects]]. It would also be good if you could encourage your students to create and log in to their own Wikibooks accounts rather than editing pages anonymously like recent edits to [[Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Clustering]] &amp; [[Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Clustering/Density-Based_Clustering]]. Anonymous editing is a trick used by a small number of vandals who try to disrupt our work here, so the fewer anonymous edits occur the easier it is for the local counter-vandalism team to maintain the site. Anonymous editing also makes it difficult to credit contributions to particular authors, which you may need for assessing different individuals.

&lt;pre&gt;
\pretolerance=&lt;integer&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
The TeX primitive \pretolerance is an integer parameter that is used in TeX's line breaking algorithm as described below. The quantity &lt;integer&gt; is an integer from -1 to 10000. 

If \pretolerance is an integer from 0 to 10000, then TeX's line breaking algorithm first attempts to break up a paragraph without hyphenation. In this attempt TeX ties to minimize the [[TeX/definition/badness|badness]] of each line. If TeX can break up a paragraph so that none of the lines have badness greater than \pretolerance, then TeX accepts it. If this is not possible, TeX will re-attempt to break up the paragraph with the allowance of hyphenation of words. In this second attempt, the integer parameter [[TeX/tolerance|\tolerance]] is used instead of \pretolerance.   If TeX is unsuccessful in the second attempt an error is reported in the log file.

If \pretolerance is -1, then TeX bypasses the first attempt at breaking a paragraph without hyphenation.

=Danish Gambit Accepted=
White is almost forced to recapture the pawn with his bishop.  This regains a pawn, prevents black's pawn from promoting,and develops the dark squared bishop to a great square.
The most likely line is:
5.  Bxb2   d5 
6.  Bxd5   Nf6 
7.  Bxf7+  Kxf7 
8.  Qxd8   Bb4+ 
9.  Qd2    Bxd2+ 
10. Nxd2   Re8
with even chances.

\noindent
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
If TeX is in vertical or internal vertical mode, then \noindent will force TeX into horizontal mode, otherwise it does nothing. The transition from vertical or internal vertical mode to horizontal mode signals the start of a paragraph. Most things that cause such a transition, also insert an empty box of length [[TeX/parindent|\parindent]], but \noindent is an exception, as its name indicates.

\ifvmode &lt;TeX code 1&gt; [\else &lt;TeX code 2&gt;] \fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
The \ifvmode command denotes the start of an if-then-else control structure that tests whether TeX is currently in either [[TeX/definition/modes/Vertical mode|vertical mode]] or [[TeX/defintion/modes/Internal vertical mode|internal vertical mode]]. As indicated in the Synopsis, the \else part is optional. &lt;TeX code 1&gt; is processed if TeX is in one of the vertical modes, otherwise it is ignored. If the \else section is included and TeX is not in one of the vertical modes then &lt;TeX code 2&gt; is processed; otherwise it is ignored.

==Description==
The \ifhmode command denotes the start of an if-then-else control structure that tests whether TeX is currently in either [[TeX/definition/modes/Horizontal mode|horizontal mode]] or [[TeX/definition/modes/Restricted horizontal mode|restricted horizontal mode]]. As indicated in the Synopsis, the \else part is optional. &lt;TeX code 1&gt; is processed if TeX is in one of the horizontal modes, otherwise it is ignored. If the \else section is included and TeX is not in one of the horizontal modes then &lt;TeX code 2&gt; is processed; otherwise it is ignored.

&lt;pre&gt;
\inputlineno
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
\inputlineno is an integer parameter that TeX sets to the current line number of the input file.

==Examples==
Recall that the command [[TeX/number|\number]] will typeset the decimal representation of whatever follows it, and so if the source file begins with 
&lt;pre&gt;
\number\inputlineno
&lt;/pre&gt;
on the first line, then TeX will typeset 1 at the beginning of the page.

If
&lt;pre&gt;
\message{\number\inputlineno}
&lt;/pre&gt;
occurs on line n of the source file, then TeX will output 'n' to the screen as a message.

These ribs have beaten some of the best BBQ joints around, including Famous Dave's and Roscoe's, in local competitions. I'm not famous or anything, though.

== Ingredients ==
:2 slabs baby back pork ribs
:[[Cookbook:Rib Rub|Rib Rub]]
:[[Cookbook:Maple Barbecue Sauce|Maple Barbecue Sauce]]
:Hickory and applewood chunks

== Directions ==
#Remove membrane on the bottom of the ribs. Season both sides liberally with Rub and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
#Place enough hickory and applewood chunks in the firebox of a smoker to keep the temperature around 200 degrees F.
#Place ribs in smoker and cook, brushing with barbecue sauce every 1 1/2 hours, 4 hours or until very tender, changing chunks as needed. 
#Brush meat side of ribs liberally with sauce and place meat side down on a very, very hot grill until well browned and slightly charred.
#Slice into one rib portions and serve with additional sauce.</text>

== Ingredients ==
* 2 (6-8 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts
* Olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp freshly ground coriander (I'm American, so I'm talking about the seeds)
* 2 medium untreated maple planks, soaked in water at least 1 hour

== Procedure ==
#Brush chicken with olive oil. Sprinkle liberally on both sides with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and the freshly ground coriander.
#Place chicken on planks and insert a probe thermometer into one of the breasts. Heat one burner or push all the coals to one side and place planks on the cooler side. Cook until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#Remove chicken to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

== Warnings ==

Use untreated wood. I don't think any of you would like to be eating pentachloraethylne, creosote, and/or arsenic! If you would not like to eat this stuff, remember to purchase untreated wood that is furniture grade and kiln-dried.</text>

&lt;/noinclude&gt;


== Decimals ==
Decimals are a means of representing a partial number without using fractions.  You will see them when dealing with currency, and may find them in other situations as well.  They will otherwise appear to be normal numbers. 

== Addition and Subtraction ==

When adding or subtracting decimal numbers, the decimal points need to be aligned.  If this causes missing digits on the right, then treat them as zeros.  

&lt;pre&gt;
 16.42
+ 2.3
------
 18.72
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Multiplication ==

When multiplying numbers, the right-most digits are aligned, with the decimal point being placed within the normal location for the number.  Multiply the two numbers as if they are normal numbers to get the initial result.  Next, count the number of digits to the right of the decimal points of the two numbers; the total of the two counts indicates the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

&lt;pre&gt;
  8.32 -- 2 digits after decimal
 * 3.2 -- 1 digit after decimal
------
 1 664
24 96
------
36.624 -- 2 + 1 = 3 digits after decimal
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Division ==

Normally, the decimal point in the quotient is in the same location as the dividend.  If a decimal point appears in the divisor, the quotient's point is moved to the right by the same number of digits in the quotient.  

== Fractions to Decimals ==

Converting a fraction to a decimal simply involves long division.  However, some numbers may repeat infinitely as they can't be described in decimal form. 

If you need to add digits to continue the decimal, simply add zeros to the quotient.
&lt;pre&gt;
      2.375
    ___
24 / 57
     48
     --
      9.0
      7.2
      ---
      1.80
      1.68
      ----
        120
        120
        ---
          0
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the example above, you get an exact value.  

&lt;pre&gt;
      2.157...
    ___
19 / 41
     38
    ---
      3.0
      1.9
      ----
      1.10
       .95
      ----
        150 
        133
        ---
         17
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the example above, the number continues on without end. In general, you will want to stop after only a few digits or until you find the repeating pattern.  When you find the repeating pattern, a simple notation is to draw a single line above the digits that continuously appear.  

== Converting to fractions ==

Finite-length decimals are trivially converted into fractions.  The numberator contains the number without the decimal point, and the denominator starts with 1, and has an additional '0' appended for each digit to the right of the decimal point.

Infinite-length decimals are more complex, but are possible.  The procedure for converting them requires a knowledge of [[Algebra]], but will be summarised in an example.  First, write x as the repeating decimal:
        x =      0.71428571428571428571428571428571...
Find the length of the repetition, and both sides by 10 until they line up again:
 1000000x = 714285.71428571428571428571428571428571...
Subtract the first equation from the second, which should look like this:
  999999x = 714285
Divide both sides by the left number:
        x = 714285/999999
Reduce to lowest terms. In this case, both sides are divisible by 142857:
        x = 5/7

== Significant digits ==

In practice, decimal numbers (such as those obtained from measurements), may have a degree of error.  Thus, it might not make sense to always keep full precision when subtracting 0.001 from 1 million. 

When adding or subtracting, a result is normally kept to the same precision as the least precise number.  When multiplying or dividing, a result contains the same number of significants as the one with the least number of significant digits.  

When dealing with measurements, there is usually only need for at most three significant digits.  Handheld calculators, having no direct concept of significant digits, will simply display them all and will have to be rounded manually. 

More information on significant digits will be found in a later chapter.

I think that the acidic, fruity flavor of Pinot Noir perfectly matches the fatty, slightly gamey taste of the duck.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 (7 ounce) boneless duck breasts
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 1/2 cups Pinot Noir wine
* 1 shallot, very finely minced
* 1 tbs olive oil

== Procedure ==
#Score skin of duck in a diamond pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat. Sprinkle on both sides liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Heat a large stainless steel skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 duck breasts, skin side down, and cook until skin is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip and cook 3 minutes. Move to a greased roasting pan and repeat with remaining duck.
#Bake at 400 degrees F 12 minutes for medium rare. Remove and keep warm.
#Pour most of the fat out, leaving 2 tbs. Place pan back on medium high heat and add shallot and sauté until translucent. Deglaze pan with wine and ignite carefully with a firestick, if desired. If you ignited it, wait until flames die before continuing. Bring to a boil.
#Cook wine until reduced by 2/3. Slice duck on the bias and drizzle with sauce. Serve immediately.</text>

Health nuts out there, did you know that the amount of oil absorbed by a chicken tender fried in 350 degree peanut oil is 1/2 tbs (1 1/2 tsp)? If you still won't eat fried foods, this recipe is for you.

== Ingredients ==
*4 (6-8 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts
*1/4 cup garlic-flavored croutons, finely crushed
*1/4 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
*3/4 cup all-purpose flour
*Canola oil
*1 tbs Italian seasoning
*1 tbs each salt and freshly ground black pepper
*2 tbs paprika
*4 eggs, beaten

== Procedure ==
#Combine flour and seasonings in a pie plate. Combine croutons and breadcrumbs in another pie plate, and place the eggs in another pie plate.
#Dredge chicken in flour then dip into eggs. Dredge in crouton mixture and let rest 2-3 minutes.
#Coat chicken with canola oil and place onto a greased sheet pan. Insert a probe thermometer into one of the pieces.
#Bake in a 425 degree oven until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Serve warm.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

I notice you had been editing the [[Linguistics]] Wikibook a while ago. Would you be interested in collaborating? [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 00:32, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
:Depends in what capacity. I know zilch about linguistics, but if you'd like help with prose and formatting or feedback on the clarity of explanations/what is confusing, I'd be glad to help out. Let me know [[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] ([[User talk:DroEsperanto|talk]]) 01:28, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
::That would be quite useful. I'd like to at least get some of the sections of the book to look relatively professional, and in that respect copyediting would help a lot. [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 03:35, 7 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

I'd appreciate it if you could add {{tl|BookCat}} to the bottom of pages you create.  This will put them in the book's category, allowing an automatic index of pages and keeping them out of the listing of pages with no category.

For all of you lazy Americans (that includes most of us) who would like to make your own applesauce, but without having to do much work, this recipe is for you.

== Ingredients ==
* 5 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
* 1 1/2 cups apple jelly
* 1/4 cup Grade B Amber maple syrup (Grade A Dark Amber would be okay too)
* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1 cinnamon stick

== Procedure ==
#Combine all ingredients in a microwave safe container. Cover, leaving 1 corner open, and microwave on high 7-8 minutes or until apples are easy to mash.
#Remove cinnamon stick and discard. For a chunky sauce, use a potato masher. For a slightly smoother sauce, use a hand mixer. For a smooth pureé, use an immersion blender.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 1. Definition ''' ==
&lt;/big&gt;
In many private and public school districts across the United States, there are district-generated guidelines for using technology.  These guidelines support safe and responsible use of technology by all members of the district.  Sometimes the guidelines are individualized for teachers, students, and administration ([http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=NETS see Section 4: ISTE Educational Technology Standards]). These rules often constitute what is referred to an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptable_use_policy Acceptable Use Policy] or AUP. Here is an example of [http://technologyworkshops.wikispaces.com/file/view/Lower+Merion+School+District+Acceptable+Use+Policy.pdf one school district's Acceptable Use Policy]. However, the AUP alone is not enough to promote continuing education in relation to the appropriate use of the ever-changing Internet. There is a need for continual education in navigating this new digital landscape.  This comes in the form of establishing a set of norms for technology use known as [http://www.digitalcitizenship.net/uploads/1stLL.pdf Digital Citizenship].  In an article entitled [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/TeachingDC.pdf &quot;Teaching Digital Citizenship: When will it become a Priority for 21st Century Schools?&quot;] Mike S. Ribble and Gerald D. Bailey advocate for the implementation of a program that would promote a set of norms for safe and responsible use of the Internet. Ribble and Bailey sum up digital citizenship best in this following excerpt from their book ''Digital Citizenship in Schools'': &quot;What is digital citizenship and why is it important for individuals to become contributing members of a digital society? Moreover, why should anyone--administrators, teachers, parents, students--even be concerned with such a thing as a &quot;digital society&quot;?
The term citizen is most commonly defined as a 'a native or naturalized person who owes allegiance to a larger state or collective and who shares in the rights and responsibilities afforded all members of that collective.' As the definition states, a citizen both works for and benefits from a larger society. The concept of digital citizenship, then, reinforces the positive aspects of technology so that everyone can work and play in this digital world.
To date, few social guidelines have been developed for the use of digital technologies. We can decide, as a society, that anarchy should be the norm. Or we can decide that digital technology should be used for the benefit of all. This is why those of us who work for and benefit from a larger society need to be involved in deciding how best to support digital technology in our communities. This is why there needs to be digital citizenship.&quot;

== 2. The 9 Elements of Digital Citizenship''' ==
Mike S. Ribble and Gerald D. Bailey in their book ''Digital Citizenship in Schools'' outline what they refer to as The 9 Elements of Digital Citizenship.  They also have a [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/index.htm website] with specific definitions of each of the elements along with links to current events that concern each of the nine elements.

1. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Access.htm Digital Access]
Digital access deals with equity for all people in digital access.  In no way should anyone be discriminated against in digital access.

2. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Commerce.htm Digital Commerce]
Items once sold in the physical world are now sold in the digital world.  Students should understand the implications of online transactions.  In addition, students should be able to differentiate between illegal and legal transactions.

3. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Communication.htm Digital Communication]  There are now a myriad options available to communicate with almost anyone online.  These new opportunities pose many dangers to students, so they should be taught how to communicate appropriately online.

4. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Education.htm Digital Literacy] Since information is available instantaneously in most locations, students must be taught to learn in any circumstance.  In addition, students must be taught how to navigate the plethora of information available to them.

5. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Etiquette.htm# Digital Etiquette] Students must be taught proper etiquette in online situations.  Since students understand such etiquette in the physical world, it is imperative that they understand it in the context of an online environment.

6. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Responsibility.htm Digital Law] Students should understand what is legal and illegal on the Internet.  In addition, students should understand the nature and extent of illegal activities on the Internet including worms and viruses.

7. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Rights.htm Digital Rights and Responsibilities] Students should know what they can and cannot do on the Internet.  They should know that they do have rights and responsibilities in the digital realm.

8. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Safety.htm Digital Health and Wellness] Students should understand that there are certain health risks associated with the Internet, and they should learn how to avoid these pitfalls.

9. [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/Security.htm Digital Security] Students should learn how to take the proper measures to protect their information digitally.

== 3. Digital Driver's License ''' ==
There are many advocates of a technology &quot;driver's license&quot; which, when passed, would denote that an individual is capable of following a set of norms based on safety and responsibility.  In an article entitled [http://coe.ksu.edu/digitalcitizenship/ElDLD4.pdf &quot;Do Elementary Students Need a Technology Driver's License?&quot;] by Mike S. Ribble and Gerald D. Bailey, the authors argue that elementary school students should acquire a technology driver's license just as much if not more than secondary students.  In an article entitled [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/DALic.pdf &quot;PointofView on Technology Drivers' Licenses&quot;] published out of Kansas State University, the authors argue for a technology &quot;driver's license&quot; and offer up some questions that might appear on such an exam.  In another article by Mike S. Ribble and Gerald Bailey entitled [http://coe.k-state.edu/digitalcitizenship/TechDL2.pdf &quot;Do Students Need a Technology Driver's License?&quot;], the authors examine the importance of encouraging and developing a digital &quot;driver's license&quot; for all students.  PBS Kids has a [http://pbskids.org/license/ site] where kids can go and earn their web license.  Here are some other sites that test one's knowledge of Internet safety: [http://www.kidsmart.org.uk/ KidSMART], [http://www.safekids.com/quiz/ Safe Kids], and [http://quiz.ivillage.com/parenting/tests/kidinternetsafety.htm iVillage Cares: Internet Safety Quiz for Kids].

[[File:Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg]]

== 4. ISTE Educational Technology Standards ''' ==

The International Society of Education in Education (ISTE) promotes National Educational Technology Standards for students, teachers, and administrators. Every few years, these standards are refreshed to produce standards more relevant to educational technology.  These NETS may be accessed from [http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=NETS ISTE's website].  These NETS may be used to better design schools so that technology is harnessed for its pedagogical potential on all levels.  Too many times, technology is used for its &quot;bells and whistles&quot; in an educational setting.  Such technology should be examined for its [http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~mryder/aect_96.html affordances and constraints]. These standards include Digital Citizenship and may be a great force for encouraging safety and responsibility among students.




== 5. Digital Citizenship &amp; Social Networking Sites ''' ==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iROYzrm5SBM&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=7F6F5BC8643A861A&amp;index=0&amp;playnext=1 This YouTubeclip] is a humorous example of how a set of guidelines might help students better navigate social networking sites such as MySpace, Friendster, and Facebook. Since many students are not aware of privacy settings and of how many people can access their information, Digital Citizenship would most likely prove beneficial to them.  Here is a [http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/445640-do-they-really-check-facebook.html great discussion]from College Confidential's website about colleges and universities checking the FaceBooks of prospective students. This [http://digiteen.ning.com/ site] from Ning is called Digi Teen and is a forum for teenagers interested in appropriate use of the Internet.  This [http://teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=660&amp;title=Think_Before_You_Post TeacherTube clip] and  [http://teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=9439&amp;title=Think_Before_You_Post__2 this follow-up TeacherTube clip] are lucid examples of what students should be aware of when accessing social networking sites.  Here is a [http://edorigami.edublogs.org/2009/06/14/digital-citizen-facebook-2/ blog entry] with information about a student who posted inappropriate information about a teacher on Facebook.  The entry proceeds to outline what responsible behavior looks like on Facebook.

== 6. Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, and Digital Citizenship ''' ==
Marc Prensky in his article [http://technologyworkshops.wikispaces.com/file/view/Marc+Prensky+Digital+Natives+Digital+Immigrants.pdf &quot;Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants&quot; ]coined the terms &quot;digital natives&quot; and &quot;digital immigrants&quot;.  Prensky's article delineates the differences between those who grew up with the Internet at their disposal and those who did not. He claims that those who grew up with the Internet are &quot;natives&quot; who speak a digital language unknown to the &quot;immigrants&quot;.  Prensky encourages the &quot;immigrants&quot; to learn the language of the &quot;natives&quot;, especially &quot;immigrants&quot; who are in the field of education.  Prensky claims that the &quot;natives&quot; have multi-tasked so many times through technology that their brains are wired differently than the brains of the immigrants.  As a result, the &quot;natives&quot; become easily bored when taught in traditional ways by the &quot;immigrants&quot;.  These &quot;immigrants&quot; must learn to incorporate technology into the classroom in order to fully engage the &quot;natives&quot;.  

Though Prensky's work is widely acknowledged to various degrees, there are a number of critics who are argue his assertions about the &quot;digital natives&quot;.  In particular, Jamie McKenzie complains about Prensky's central metaphor in [http://www.fno.org/nov07/nativism.html &quot;Digital Nativism Digital Delusions and Digital Deprivation&quot;].

If one buys into Prensky's claims, technology is something that both &quot;natives&quot; and &quot;immigrants&quot; must deal with in some capacity.  Both must learn to find some degree of common ground.  Digital citizenship is something which both sides can embrace, all the while losing the &quot;immigrant&quot; and &quot;native&quot; statuses.  If both sides become citizens, they can teach each other.  The &quot;natives&quot; can teach the &quot;immigrants&quot; the new technologies, and the &quot;immigrants&quot; can teach the &quot;natives&quot; the proper way to use any new technology.

There are a number of conversations taking place online about how digital citizenship can be incorporated into today's society.  One such example can be seen in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CabIF7ML9Zo YouTube clip].  There are some debatable points in the clip, including whether or not digital citizenship should be a compulsory or optional.  The members of the classroom discuss both sides of argument.  This particular video is powerful because it examines the issue of equity in relationship to digital citizenship, especially in the context of race and socio-economic backgrounds.  In this next [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HTXq-71S8&amp;feature=related YouTube video], Wesley Fryer answers the question, &quot;What is digital citizenship?&quot;  Fryer presents some analogies to help students understand exactly what digital citizenship represents.  Fryer refers to Ribble and Bailey in his response, addressing rights and responsibilities in particular.

== 7. Technology Zone ''' ==
In many schools, the issue of the inappropriate use of technology in the classroom is becoming a serious issue.  Check out [http://issuu.com/hhbanner.com/docs/oct08 here] how one high school has decided to deal with the issue through the creation of a technology zone.  Students, teachers, and administration have come up with a designated &quot;technology zone&quot; on campus where students may go to make calls on their cell phones, listen to their ipods, etc. Because of the &quot;technology zone&quot;, students are learning some of the elements of digital citizenship.  Since the implementation of the &quot;technology zone&quot;, students have drastically cut the use of technology in inappropriate places throughout the schools.  In this last [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A-ZVCjfWf8&amp;feature=related YouTube video], it is easy to see how students are changing because of technology and how digital citizenship is needed more than ever.  Overall, these conversations shed some light on some of the important issues in relationship to digital citizenship.

== 8. Lesson Plans ''' ==
In order to help students understand the nine elements of digital citizenship, educators from a variety of locations have developed lesson plans for digital citizenship.  The Kenton County School District has posted a variety of resources related to digital citizenship on its [http://www.kenton.kyschools.us/internet_safety/default.htm website]. ISTE has a [http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/Digital+Citizenship wiki] with a number of ideas for promoting digital citizenship.

== 2D, Toon, &amp; CAD Rendering ==

'''Rendering a 2D Black &amp; White Line Drawing.''' (ver.2.49, defaults)

1) ''&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;''. Under the menu selections, '' &quot;Shading&quot; '' ('''F5''') &amp;rarr; '' &quot;World buttons&quot; '' &amp;rarr; ''&quot;World&quot;'' tab. Turn the background (default is blue) color to white. The color selection box above the ''&quot;HoR&quot;'' slider.

2) ''&lt;u&gt;Edges&lt;/u&gt;''. Under the menu selections, ''&quot;Scene&quot;'' ('''F10''')&amp;rarr; ''&quot;Render buttons&quot;'' &amp;rarr; ''&quot;Output&quot;'' tab. Click the ''&quot;Edge&quot;'' button to turn on the edge lines. Adjust the ''&quot;Edge Settings&quot;'' if wish to change the edge intensity (sensitivity) &amp; edge color. Under the ''&quot;Format&quot;'' tab of the same menu you can also choose to change the file format (default is Jpeg) &amp; render size.

3) ''&lt;u&gt;Object Color&lt;/u&gt;''. Under the menu selections, ''&quot;Shading&quot;'' ('''F5''')&amp;rarr; ''&quot;Material buttons&quot;'' &amp;rarr; ''&quot;Links and Pipeline&quot;'' tab. Select the materials to be rendered. Once a material is selected, move to the ''&quot;Material&quot;'' tab and change the color (default is gray) to white as well. It is the top box of 3, next to the 'Col' button. Each material instance will need to be changed.

4) ''&lt;u&gt;Shading&lt;/u&gt;''. Eh, who needs it? Menu selections, ''&quot;Shading&quot;'' ('''F5''')&amp;rarr; ''&quot;Material buttons&quot;'' &amp;rarr; ''&quot;Material&quot;'' tab. Click on the ''&quot;Shadeles&quot;'' [sic] button to remove shading. Each material instance will need to be changed here as well. 

5) ''&lt;u&gt;Camera&lt;/u&gt;''. Select the Camera in ''&quot;Object Mode&quot;''. Under the menu selection, ''&quot;Editing&quot;'' ('''F9''') &amp;rarr; ''&quot;Camera&quot;'' tab. Click on the ''&quot;Orthographic&quot;'' button, to flatten the image. 

6) That's it folks. Hit '''F12''' to render, and '''F3''' to save your render.

&lt;u&gt;''*Note: Camera in Orthographic Mode''&lt;/u&gt;::
Leaving the camera in Perspective mode will result in mesh lines being barely visible, almost white washed. Where as Orthographic mode will allow the mesh lines to become much more visible. And combining Orthographic mode with SubSurf, can help to create well defined curved surfaces. Just remember to change the camera lens scale, and Crease edges ('''Shift+E''') where needed.

'''Edge Line Thickness'''

Overall edge line thickness can be changed by adjusting the render resolution. As such, the greater the render resolution, the thinner the edge lines will appear. Under the menu selections, ''&quot;Scene&quot;'' ('''F10''')&amp;rarr; ''&quot;Render buttons&quot;'' &amp;rarr; ''&quot;Format&quot;'' tab. Change the &quot;''SizeX''&quot; &amp; &quot;''SizeY''&quot; entries (Max = 10,000x10,000). For complicated images at high resolution, you may wish to change the number of tiles rendered. Found under the ''&quot;Render&quot;'' tab, &quot;''Xparts:''&quot; &amp; &quot;''Yparts''&quot; (Default = 8x8).

'''Edge Line Feathering'''

Edge line weight can be adjusted by changing the planar distance, in the 3rd dimension, of objects relative to each other. Or in other words, how close an edge is to a common plane or an angle to 180 degrees. Resulting in edge lines appearing lighter (gray) or even totally disappearing.

Some gradient can also be created in lines by sloping an edge towards a common plane. Causing lines to fade from black to white depending upon the relative angle.


'''What's Needed:''' A way of defining edges with line type, line weight, &amp; color using blender. Any suggestions?

      <comment>Couple of suggestions or ideas.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You should put in a link in the first chapter on how to get the Gtk+ API code for various platforms.

Also, it would be a good idea to establish some best-practices.  What bought me here is trying to decide if I should be using one of the Glib object collections to pass multiple data in callbacks, or if I should be using a custom data structure.  On the one hand, the custom data structure seems to be more in vogue, but then all of those collections were implemented for a reason, and I'm thinking one such reason was to store links to all the various data one might want to pack into the gpointer data argument in the callback.  Only I've only seen two other people using it that way.

Finally, you should have both a hierarchy of the layout (at least of the widgets, if not the various libraries), and a breakdown explanation of all the libraries and their purpose and usefulness, in the intro.

Of course, as you continue to write this, I'm sure you'll find sections and even chapters make more sense when you move them around.  So perhaps the intro is the wrong place, but the intro looks a little anemic, so it looks like a good place to start.

And perhaps this is just me, but it would probably be better to pick a rather large scale project -- something ambitious -- that would use most or all of the stuff the user would need, and slowly build piece by piece, compile, run, explain, explore, discuss and then continue by adding the next piece.  When I tried to learn to play guitar, I spent years learning the scales before I finally gave up.  It wasn't until someone tried to teach me to play specific songs that I had to motivation to actually learn the scales, why they were important and useful. I had a practical goal, not just a hello world.  Don't get me wrong, hello world's a nice start.  But then, it's already been done before.  Dozens of times.  Do something different.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What client is most often used to dial in?  What settings are necessary?  I've been unable to find documentation about this.  --[[Special:Contributions/74.203.193.33|74.203.193.33]] ([[User talk:74.203.193.33|talk]]) 17:33, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

The only supported client is Reynold's EraLink. With that said there are a few commercial alternatives that can emulate tvi955 -- the difference between tvi955, and rtvi955 is a further proprietary extension that nothing other than EraLink officially supports, you'll have to do it from scratch....

Education has long been a topic of debate. The world's greatest thinkers continue to revolutionize methods to create a better generation. But every time a seemingly flawless method is devised, a later and greater thinker proves it to be complete nonsense. The philosopher Freidrich William Neitzche comments that, &quot;Philosophical systems are wholly true only for their founders. For all subsequent philosophers they usually seem one great mistake...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear President Obama and Education Secretary Duncan, 

	We the future educators of American public schools have identified twenty pertinent challenges facing modern education.  As undergraduates at the College of Coastal Georgia we have thoroughly researched and concisely condensed each of these issues. These contemporary troubles are presented in a manner for general public understanding.  To investigate these challenges further we have interviewed and surveyed leading scholars from related fields and practitioners from within the school walls.  Their thoughts and insight are also captured. From these conversations we have indentified disparities in theory and practice. Based on this data we provide you with a one page action item statement to be implemented in future education policy.  To seriously reform education and assist us as future educators we urge you to seriously consider the recommendations presented in this book. We all strive to educate and mold the next “Greatest Generation” of Americans.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Texturing the house ==

Note if you get lost then do the texturing tutorial here first that goes into more detail.  

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/Tutorial_for_Blender#Textures

First we need a texture file kuid 86627:2491 Leopold Lane has a suitable texture file.  It is actually larger than we need for a simple house but does have the roof and stone work we need.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace one.jpg]]  

None essential information:  The texture is laid out for tiling in Blender, the house and roof are actually mirrored in the center so they will tile seamlessly.  The garden wall can either be used under the house if the house is extended below ground level useful for hills or it can be used separately as the garden wall texture.  If you build a terrace then by adding planes over the existing doors you can change the colour of the doors to vary the terrace.  The planes are mapped to the doors in the texture below.  Note also that the night mode texture or lit windows are included in the main texture.


After starting Blender, open the house we have already created in the previous tutorial.

[[Image:Create house tutorial screenshot in Blender7.jpg]]

Life is easier if we can see the model and the texture file at the same time so we'll split the screen.  Right click the mouse to get the split screen option then left click to split the screen.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace two.jpg]]

We need to tell Blender what we are about to texture so select the cube or house by right clicking it.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace five.jpg]]

Press F5 followed by F6


select 'image' from the texture type.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace three.jpg]]



Now under the image tab, press 'load' then navigate to your image file. Double click the image file and its name appears in the navigation widow. Press 'select image' and the details and confirmation will appear in the image tab.


[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace four.jpg]]


[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace six.jpg]]


F5 to change the map input to UV


[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace seven.jpg]]

Change one window to UV/Image editor and texture file.  Select which window is active by moving the mouse to it.


[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace eight.jpg]]


We have to unwrap the image so change from object mode to edit mode.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace nine.jpg]]


Note you may need to select the texture file in the UV/Image editor window, note the word view, then image and a double arrow.  Click on the double arrow to select which texture file to make active.  In this screenshot you can see only terrace .tga is available.

Blender actually works with materials which are associated with texture files.  You can use more than one texture file by adding new ones and it's here that you select which one to use.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace 12.jpg]]

Blender has different views for texturing to see which face is being selected to be textured more clearly wireframe works best.  Note the drop down menu next to the object / edit menu.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace 13.jpg]]

Type U to unwrap, selecting 'Unwrap (smart projections)'. 
[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace 14.jpg]]


Accept the defaults.

Now we need to map a face to the texture.  There are three symbols to the lower right of the screen, you may have to &lt;Crtl&gt;&lt;up arrow&gt; to see them.  The four dots is the vertex select, the triangle is the face select.  First toggle the selection to nothing by typing &quot;A&quot;. Select the triangle or faces one.  Right click our house to select the face, in wire frame mode. If the image doesn't show then select it with the up / down arrow next the the letters UVs. 
[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace 15.jpg]]


Then change mode to texture to view the result.


[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace 16.jpg]]

Mouse to the UV/Image editor (the one with the texture) Select vertex (four dots).  Select each vertex with the RMB (right mouse button)  move it to the desired location on the texture then LMB (left mouse button) click to accept.

[[Image:Blender texturing tutorial Terrace 17.jpg]]

After mapping the first face use 1 (top keyboard number), 3, &lt;Shift&gt;1, &lt;Shift&gt;3 to bring up each face in turn and to map it.

When finished return to object mode.

To map the roof you can either go through the process again or after noting it's X, Y, Z dimensions and location delete it, clone the house with &lt;Shift&gt;D, &lt;esc&gt; then feed in the numbers for the height, width, location you used for the roof into the properties tab and adjust the mapping on the texture file.


When finished return to object mode and save the file.

This entire meal cooks up in 4 minutes. Try getting pizza delivery that fast.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 (8 ounce) salmon filet
* 1/3 cup fresh dill
* 1/3 cup fresh parsley
* 1/3 cup fresh oregano
* 1/3 cup fresh thyme
* 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp paprika
* 4 lemon slices
* White wine
* 1 tbs unsalted butter, cubed

== Procedure ==
#Take a 15 by 36-inch piece of parchment paper and fold in 1/2 like a book. Draw a large 1/2 heart on paper with fold of paper being the center of the heart. Cut out heart and open.
#Place fresh herbs in the bottom of 1/2 of the heart. Place 2 lemon slices on top of the herbs and top with the salmon. Sprinkle both sides with salt, paprika, and freshly ground black pepper.
#Drizzle salmon with white wine and top evenly with butter cubes. Top with remaining lemon slices.
#Fold other side of heart over fish and starting at top of heart shape, fold up both edges of parchment, overlapping folds as you move along. Once you reach the end tip, twist several times to secure tightly.
#Place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high 4 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 131 degrees. Open parchment and serve warm.

== Variations ==

If you don't like the idea of microwaving it, feel free to use your oven. 425 degrees F for 12 minutes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear President Obama and Education Secretary Duncan,

We the future educators of American public schools have identified twenty pertinent challenges facing modern education. As undergraduates at the College of Coastal Georgia we have thoroughly researched and concisely condensed each of these issues. These contemporary troubles are presented in a manner for general public understanding. To investigate these challenges further we have interviewed and surveyed leading scholars from related fields and practitioners from within the school walls. Their thoughts and insight are also captured. From these conversations we have identified disparities in theory and practice. Based on this data we provide you with a one page action item statement to be implemented in future education policy. To seriously reform education and assist us as future educators we urge you to seriously consider the recommendations presented in this book. We all strive to educate and mold the next “Greatest Generation” of Americans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is a brief overview of the history of the Anishinabe tribe and their traditional homelands.

== Creation and migration ==
[[File:Ojibwe land.including NAN.jpg|230px|thumb]]

&quot;Anishinabe&quot; is often translated as &quot;first man&quot; or &quot;original man&quot;. (The plural, Anishinabeg or Anishinaabeg, means &quot;first people&quot;.) In the Anishinabe creation myth, Git-chi'e Man-i-to', &quot;Creator&quot; or &quot;Great Mystery&quot;, lowered the original man down from the heavens as the ancestor of all North American tribes. There are many interesting parallels between Anishinabe mythology and the bible, including the naming of all the creatures of the earth by an Adam figure and a great flood.

According to oral tradition, the Anishinabe originally lived near an ocean, a belief also held by the Ottawa and Potawatomi. Because of this shared heritage, the three tribes are collectively known as the Three Fires. It is unclear whether this was the Atlantic near the gulf of the St. Lawrence or the shores of the Hudson Bay, but the latter is considered more plausible by most. Less disputed is the Anishinabe's migration west to Lake Superior and the Apostle Islands.

==In the United States== 

=== The 17th and 18th centuries ===
The first probable encounter between the Anishinabe and the Europeans occurred sometime in the 17th century. This first contact was probably with the Jesuits. Further contact ensued with the French Voyageurs (fur traders and explorers), then British fur traders and explorers, and finally the U.S. government and her citizens.

Trading the rich resources of their lands to the Europeans, especially beaver pelts for goods such as firearms, ignited a fierce competition and arms race between tribes that would end in war. With the help of the firearms the Anishinabe pushed the Fox tribe south into Wisconsin; fighting with the Dakota and Winnebago (Sioux) was especially brutal but the Anishinabe eventually succeeded in forcing them to the southwest and claiming the resource-abundant northeast of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan for their own.

There were also several European epidemics during this time, notably smallpox. The Anishinabe tribes escaped relatively unscathed compared to their counterparts to the east.

===The 19th century===
[[File:Anishinaabe-Anishinini Distribution Map.svg|right|thumb|Anishinabe distribution around 1800]]
The Anishinabe were truly a superpower among the native peoples of the Great Lakes and possibly even out of all the tribes west of the Mississippi. Their division between America and Canada, the many names attributed to their tribe (Ojibwe, Chippewa, Mississauga, Bungi and Saultreaux as well as dozens of variant spellings) and their location to the north of the main flow of settlement masked much of their true size and influence. The Anishinabe have also signed over fifty treaties with American and European governments, more than any other tribe in North America.

The Anishinabe fought their last battle against the Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century; most inter-tribal warfare had also ceased by this time. However, the battles between the Anishinabe and Dakota continued for half a century. The first half of the 19th century signaled the exchange of tribal lands for reservations, notably the Ohio territories of the Anishinabe and other tribes after particularly bloody fighting during the War of 1812. These disputes over lands and reservations fueled the fighting with the Dakota, which slowed after the Dakota were moved to reservations in the far southwest of Minnesota, and only ceased entirely when they were driven out of the state entirely by the Americans during the Minnesota Valley Uprising in 1862.

By the mid-19th century the Anishinabe had split off into five geographical and cultural groups: the Southeastern Anishinabe, living on the shores of Lake Huron in what is now Michigan and southern Ontario; the Southwestern Anishinabe, along both the northern and southern shores of Lake Superior; the Northern Anishinabe, in northern Ontario; and the Plains Anishinabe (also known as the Bungi), spread across North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Bungi culture resembled that of many other plains tribes, with their reliance on buffalo for food and clothing as well as their horses and tipis.

In the late 19th century there was some haggling over the size and location of Anishinabe reservations; at one point when the desire for the copper and timber surrounding Lake Superior was particularly strong there was talk of moving the Minnesota Anishinabe to reservations in Kansas. However, this order was rescinded by Millard Filmore in 1853. Twelve years and nine treaties later, Anishinabe reservations were finally settled in Minnesota.

The Plains Anishinabe, however, were not so lucky. During one of their frequent excursions from the reservation for a buffalo hunt, a group of almost 5000 Anishinabe and Metis were cut off from their Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota when the government decided that the reservation was too large for the amount of Anishinabe that lived there and parceled off 90% of the land for sale to Americans. The government offered 10 cents an acre (the settlement was later known as the Ten Cent Treaty) as compensation, and most Anishinabe took the money and kept their homes on the now-overcrowded reservation. However, Little Shell's band refused the settlement and currently remains without federal recognition or a reservation.

For a list of Anishinabe bands and reservations that exist today, please see [[Introduction to Anishinabe Culture and History/A1|Appendix 1]].

==In Canada==
The Canadian Anishinabe are usually referred to as Saulteurs, Saulteaux or Mississaugas. Canada currently recognizes over 100 Anishinabe and part-Anishinabe bands, located in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Epidemics of smallpox and other diseases were especially devastating to the Canadian tribes in the 17th and 18th centuries, but the Anishinabe escaped relatively unscathed compared to many Algonquian tribes to the east. In Canada as in the United States the Anishinabe were moved to reservations (known as reserves) by the mid-19th century. However, the Anishinabe in Canada seem to have survived the onslaught of the Europeans better than their American counterparts, holding on to more of the culture and language and maintaining smaller, more tightly-knit reserves.

==Discussion questions==
# What is your opinion on the creation and migration myths of the Anishinabe, Ottawa and Potawatomi and their similarities to other myths found throughout the world? Do you believe that this shared mythology between cultures adds or detracts from their credibility as a theory for how the world began?
# Do you believe that contact with the Europeans caused the massive tribal warfare of the 17th and 18th centuries or simply worsened it? Or would the wars have occurred that way no matter what? Do you believe that an arms race was inevitable when trade with the Europeans began, or could it have been avoided by more ethical trading practices?
# What makes a tribe? Is it culture or common heritage? In the end, what distinguished the Bungi (Plains Anishinabe) from their enemies, the Dakota, whose culture they seemed to adopt?
# How do you feel about the American government's management of tribal lands and affairs? Do you believe that the Anishinabe were treated more fairly than other tribes? If so, why do you think this favoritism occurred?

==Description==
The \ifhbox command denotes the start of an [[TeX/definition/if-then-else control structure|if-then-else control structure]], where &lt;0..255&gt; must expand to an integer from 0 to 255. If the [[TeX/definition/box register|box register]] \box&lt;0..255&gt; contains a [[TeX/definition/hbox|hbox]], then &lt;tex-code-1&gt; is processed and &lt;tex-code-2&gt; is ignored, if the \else section is included. If \box&lt;0..255&gt; does not contains a hbox then &lt;tex-code-1&gt; is ignored and &lt;tex-code-2&gt; is processed, if the \else section is included.

==Khennjo==

My ''real'' name is Kenneth Jo Deles. Most of my friends call me Khennjo or Ken - ''Kenneth Jo seems to be too cumbersome''.

I'm presently involved with the Adventist International Institute of Advanced Studies (AIIAS) Pathfinder club. As Deputy Director for the Teen Pathfinders, It's always a challenge to find quick and real answers for the various Honor requirements. The [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]here at WikiBooks is very nifty and convenient tool for any Pathfinder! - Thanks to Jim Thomas for initiating this.

I am an Accountant by profession and but currently works as part of the team for technical accounting support. I love the outdoor, photography, cycling and stamp collecting.

I can be reached at khennjo@yahoo.com</text>

Quiz authors using the Professional version of Question Writer can publish questions to text format.  This can be useful if you need to find out how to format your questions for import (and create a basis for importing future changes to the quiz) or to export your questions for use in another system. Respondus in particular can import this kind of text format.

The text format just includes the raw questions - none of the theme, properties or section settings.{{clr}}

== Religion should be shared... ==

I just ran across this by chance and have to say that this short paragraph of words put my mind at ease to know others feel the same as I do.  I consider myself Christian but have spent my life open to others religions by attending their church or listening to their beliefs.  I have been told by some extreme Christians that people of certain religions are going to hell. I just can't buy in to the fact that if someone is praying to the same God as me that they are dammed because they practice a different religion?  I am comfortable with my spirituality and am happy that I don't feel threatened by another persons belief system if different from mine.  I have had the pleasure of being close friends with Jehovah Witness, Mormons LDS, Seventh Day Adventist and more.  All of these people have strong belief systems but never judged me for mine.  I feel that their presence in my life actually helped me grow more as a Christian and as a person.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===OUTLINE OF THE BOOK===
The central theme of this letter is `justification by grace through faith' for salvation with the purpose of refuting false teachers which are teaching a gospel of salvation through 'works'. It is the means of salvation that is being addressed in the letter. It is a letter that was written to deal with false teachers of Judaism whose teaching was rooted in legalism.

Chapters 1 &amp; 2 is defending the Good News against the false doctrines
Chapters 2 &amp; 3 is defining the Good News from legalism, and,
Chapters 5 &amp; 6 is how to demonstrate the Good News in one's life

===THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING GALATIANS===
There are scriptures which have been translated to read that we are no longer under the law of God, that it has been done away with and that we are now under grace; the law of God no longer applying to the believer in the new covenant.

Here is the main basis for the teaching:

Gal. 3:23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

Gal. 4:4 But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

Gal. 4:5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

Gal. 4:21 Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?

There are two ways in which the word 'law' is used by Paul, one where he is referring to the Law of God and the other where he is using it in a general sense. These two different usages are differentiated by the use of the definite article or lack thereof. When 'the' is used in the original text before the word 'law' in the original, it is referring to the Law of God. When the definite article is not there, it is being used in the general sense. The translation into English does not reveal this difference though, causing the reader to be unable to discern this difference.

The two differences:
:A. When the original test says 'the law', it is the eternal Law of God which is meant.
:B. When the original text omits the definite article 'the', and only has 'law', then it is being used as a general term.
The general usage of the word 'law' when it is without the definite article 'the', covers three basic ideas:
1.  Any legal code of do's and don'ts or rules, for any type of institution
2.  The bondage of Legalism - such as a Pharisaical attitude
3.  The perversion of the Law into a system of works

===THE KEY SCRIPTURES ON LEGALISM===
[Where the definite article is missing in the text it has been bracketed. Where it is in the text it is underlined]

&quot;Knowing that a man is not justified by (the) works of law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the works of (the) law; for by (the) works of law shall no flesh be justified&quot;  (Gal.2:16) 

&quot;For I through (the) law died to (the) law that I might live to God.&quot;   (Gal.2:19)

&quot;I do not seek to set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through (the) law, then Christ died in vain&quot; (Gal.2:21)

&quot;Did you receive the Spirit by the works of (the) law or by the hearing of faith?  (Gal.3:2)  

3. Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?
4. Have you suffered so many things in vain? if indeed it was in vain.
5. Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of (the) law, or by the hearing of faith?
6. Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
7. Therefore know that only those who are of faith, are sons of Abraham.
8. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, In you all the nations shall be blessed.
9. So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.

&quot;For as many as are of the works of (the) law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of &lt;u&gt;the law&lt;/u&gt; to do them.&quot; (Gal.3:10)

&quot;But that no one is justified by (the) law in the sight of God is evident, for &quot;the just shall live by faith. Yet &lt;u&gt;the law&lt;/u&gt; is not of faith, but &quot;the man who does them shall live by them.&quot;  (Gal.3:11-12) 

&quot;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of &lt;u&gt;the law&lt;/u&gt;, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:&quot;  (Gal.3:13)

&quot;And this I say, that (the) law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot disannul the covenant that was confirmed before God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect.&quot;  (Gal.3:17)

&quot;For if the inheritance is of (the) law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.&quot;  (Gal.3:18)

&quot;What purpose does &lt;u&gt;the law&lt;/u&gt; serve then? It was added because of transgressions till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made;&quot;  (Gal.3:19) 

&quot;Is &lt;u&gt;the law&lt;/u&gt; then against the promises of God?  Certainly not!&quot;  For if there has been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by (the) law.&quot;  [lit. out of that law]   (Gal.3:21) 

&quot;But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under (the) law [lit. becoming born under law], to redeem those who were under (the) law [lit. becoming under law], that we might receive the adoption of sons&quot;  (Gal.4:4-5)

4:21 &quot;Tell me, you who desire to be under (the) law, do you not hear &lt;u&gt;the law&lt;/u&gt;?  (example given of the two covenants)

&quot;Abraham had two sons, one of the flesh: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free-woman&quot;  [The allegory is between Isaac who inherited the promise and Ishmael who was of the flesh and received no inheritance.
Although Sinai and Zion are used as comparisons, Sinai is being identified with Hagar who received no inheritance and not to the 	children of Israel who were the recipients of the law at Sinai. It is a comparison of natural to spiritual. i.e. 'works of the flesh' cannot inherit the promises - the issue is salvation by works. Abraham's efforts in the flesh were unproductive]

&quot;And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law&quot;    (Gal.5:3)

&quot;But if you are led of the Spirit you are not under (the) law&quot;  (Gal.5:18)

===RELATED SCRIPTURES===
&quot;Know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under (the) law [lit. in the law], that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of (the) law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by (the) law is the knowledge of sin.&quot;   (Rom. 3:19-20)

&quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under law but under grace&quot;  (Rom.6:14)

&quot;What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?  Certainly not! Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?   (Romans 6:15-16)

&quot;To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win the Jews, to those who are under (the) law, as under (the) law, that I might win those who are under (the) law, to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ) that I might win those who are without law; ..&quot;   (1 Cor.9:20-21)
[Those under law are a different group of people to those he identifies as the &quot;Jews&quot;.  He is referring here to legalists.The subject is not those who are under the Law of God which were the Jews, but those under legalism]

ADJUSTED FREE TRANSLATION  -  based upon Wuest's expanded translation of Galatians and the Interlinear Greek text

Gal.2:16 &quot;Knowing that a man is not justified by law-keeping but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the legalistic enactment of the law's principles; for by law-keeping shall no flesh be justified&quot;   [the word 'law' here is used in its qualitative and legalistic sense - Wuest Word Studies  i.e. as Pharisees]

Gal.2:19  &quot;For I through enactment of law [through Christ]  died to legalistic statutes that I might live to God.&quot; 	[Paul does not say that he is dead to law (i.e. as being lawless), but to it as a body of legalistic statutes - Wuest Word Studies]

Gal.2:21 &quot;I do not thwart the efficacy of the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through law, then Christ died in vain&quot; 

Gal.3:2. &quot;Did you receive the Spirit by means of the law's principles or by the message of faith? 
 
:3. Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?

:4. Have you suffered so many things in vain? if indeed it was in vain.

:5. Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does He do it by means of the law's principles, or by the hearing of faith?

:6. Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

:7. Therefore know that only those who are of faith, are sons of Abraham.

:8. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, In you all the nations shall be blessed.

:9. So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.

:10. For as many as are operating by the principles of laws, are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them.&quot; [quote from Deut.27:26]

:11. But that no one is justified by law-keeping in the sight of God is evident, for &quot;the just shall live by means of faith. And the law is not of faith, but the man who has done them, shall live in them.&quot;   [The two principles of law and faith are opposite of one another. Same scripture from Lev.18:5 quoted in Romans 10:5 to say that righteousness by the law is possible]

:13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:&quot;  [It is the Law's penalty which brings a curse, the Law itself is not a curse - it is good and holy]

:17. And this I say, that the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot disannul the covenant that was 	confirmed before God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect.&quot; 
 
:18. For if the inheritance is by means of the law's principles, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise. 
   
:19. What purpose does the Law serve then? It was added because of transgressions till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made;&quot;  

:21. &quot;Is the Law then against the promises of God?  Certainly not!&quot;  For if there has been a law given which could impart life, truly righteousness would have been by means of that law.&quot;  [The Law and the promises each have their own function.The law is a ministry of condemnation. The law judges a person on the basis of obedience or disobedience. The promises are a ministry of salvation. The promises judge a man on the basis of faith - Wuest i.e. man's eternal destiny is judged by faith in Christ]

Gal.4:4-5 &quot;But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, made subject to law, to redeem those who were under the law's principles, that we might receive the adoption as sons&quot;   [the law brought death]

Gal.5:3 &quot;And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole Law&quot;  [the old covenant]  

Gal.5:18 &quot;But if you are led of the Spirit you are not under the jurisdiction of the law&quot;  [The flesh and the law are closely allied, 	whereas the flesh and the Spirit are diametrically opposed  - Wuest  i.e. it is necessary to live in the Spirit to not be under the Law]

Contrary to a surface reading of the letter, Paul is not speaking against the Law of God, except as a means of salvation. He is addressing efforts made in the flesh to gain righteousness and legalistic interpretations of scripture by false teachers.

Though salvation is not earned by following God's commandments, the principles of the Law are to be obeyed by the grace which He gives to live in the Spirit. Yeshua said in Matthew 5:17 &amp;18 `Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no way pass from the law.' Romans 7:12, says the Torah is `holy, righteous, and good.'

The curse that Yeshua took upon Himself enables believers to walk out the commands of the whole Bible without the fear of being cursed, for not fulfilling the instructions completely. Through His life and sacrifice He did not bring the Law to an end, rather He modeled how we as followers should live in obedience to His commandments.  John 14:15-17
 
The purpose of this letter was to show that justification or right standing with God comes through faith, and not through attempting to keep the demands of the law by one's own efforts to gain righteousness. The righteousness of God is imparted to us through faith in the sacrifice of Christ as a free gift by grace alone - not by any works of ours apart from faith.

&quot;But no man is justified by the law in the sight of Yahweh, it is evident: for, the just shall live by faith&quot;  (Galatians 3:11)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===ABRAHAM  -  THE FATHER OF OUR FAITH===
The Bible starts an account of Abraham's life when he was called out of the land of Ur of the Chaldees (Gen 12) and follows the stages of his spiritual growth in following the Lord from the time he leaves his place of birth and his own people, until the time he matures in his faith and receives the various promises later made to him. The account begins at a time when he already has a relationship with God in the midst of an idol-worshiping household and community, when Nimrod's power was taking over the city-states of the area of Babel. Abraham was a contemporary of Nimrod and of the time of judgment on Babel (Genesis 10:8,11:1-9).

Josephus tells us that he came to a conviction that the idols his father worshiped were lifeless and preached against the idolatry that was practiced around him in Ur. It was at this time due to an uprising against him and the threat to his life, that Yahweh God directed him to leave that godless society (Josephus Antiquities Ch. 7.1).  The Book of Jasher also records this in more detail in Chs.11&amp;12, as does The Legends of the Jews.

Abraham's faith was imputed to him for righteousness when he was promised an heir which would become like the stars of heaven in number (Genesis 15:5-6). Although Abraham had believed in God previous to this and faithfully followed the directions He gave him in his life, it was not until this point, after he had separated from his family and honoured the priesthood of Melchizedek, that righteousness was imputed to him.
 
The promise of a spiritual inheritance which the new covenant apostles refer to, did not come till many years later when he entered into the covenant of being a &quot;father of many nations&quot; (Genesis 17:5). We see here the two covenants, first the natural and then the spiritual, are based upon and proportionate to, his developing faith.

These two promises, both based upon faith, are identified in the new covenant, &quot;Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all (as it is written, I have made you a father of many nations Genesis 17:5) in the presence of Him who he believed - God,&quot;  (Romans 4:16-17)

He was promised a natural seed as well as a spiritual seed and inheritance.

We are told that this same righteousness with God shall be reckoned to us also, if we believe in God and His provision of deliverance for us from our sins through His Son dying and being raised again to justify us, as it is written,  &quot;It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences and raised for our justification&quot;  (Romans 4:24-25)

Abraham turned from idols to serve the living God in Ur, but it was not until he was in Canaan that he came to saving faith in the promised Messiah. We are told that Abraham believed God regarding the promised Messiah which would come through his son Isaac, and it was accounted to him for righteousness (Romans 4:9-23). Abraham and the other Patriarchs each had a personal walk with Yahweh God based on their faith in Him as the one true God and in His promised salvation through the Messiah which was to come.

This is the basis of the salvation He has provided for all nations, who like Abraham, turn from the many forms of idolatry in the world, to worship the one true God and believe in the salvation He has provided for us. They that &quot;are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham&quot; (Galatians 3:9)

We are the children of Abraham, not by natural genealogy as the natural seed, but by faith in Christ Jesus.

&quot;And if you are Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise&quot;  (Galatians 3:29)

&quot;For the promise that he would be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith.&quot;  (Romans 4:13; Galatians 3:7; 16)

===ABRAHAM  -  THE FATHER OF FAITH KEPT THE LAW===	
Due to the emphasis that Paul makes on faith, as compared to those of natural descent, it can be overlooked that Abraham was chosen to be the father of the faith on the basis of his faithfulness to the charge that was given to him and for his obedience in walking in accordance to Yahweh God's ways.

&quot;Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his his works and by works faith was made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which says, 'Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.' And he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.&quot;   (James 2:21)

CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM have a FAITH WALK (Romans 4:13,16; Gal.3:6-7)  =  FAITH + WORKS

&quot;was not our father Abraham justified by works .. &quot;
&quot;Do you not see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?&quot;	

Abraham had faith + works in his life and this requirement also applies to us.  See James 2:23-26

His spiritual 'children' should order their lives in the same manner in which he trained his natural children, as that was why he was chosen to inherit the promises in the first place, not on the basis of his faith (Gen. 26:4-5).
 
HE KEPT YAHWEH'S CHARGE, LAWS, COMMANDS AND STATUTES  -	Genesis 18:19; 26:5

His faith was in the promises of God and his works were in obeying all the commandments, laws and statutes of Yahweh God. Yahweh said in Genesis 26:5, that He chose Abraham on the basis that he, &quot;kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws&quot;.  Although he lived before before the formal giving of the 'Law'  at Sinai - he kept the principles of the Law, and Yahweh God knew he could be trusted to order his household likewise, to keep His  commandments, statutes and laws, and therefore bring forth a godly lineage.

As new covenant people in the nations, we are of faith like faithful Abraham, and like him we also should keep His charge, His commandments, His statutes and His laws. Abraham entered into relationship with Yahweh God by faith but maintained that relationship with Him by walking in His principles.

===ABRAHAM'S FAITH IN MESSIAH===
We see how Abraham came to a place of saving faith when the promise of an heir was made to him (Gen. 17:5).

Yeshua said, &quot;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&quot; (John 8:56)  Stephen, when speaking before the Jewish council also referred to the &quot;God of glory&quot; appearing to Abraham (Acts 7:2).

His faith was so rooted in this reality of the Messiah to come through his seed, that he offered up his son Isaac, full expecting him to be raised from the dead, if need be, as a perfect type of Messiah's death and resurrection; &quot;being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform&quot;  (Romans 4:21; Genesis 22)

We see many instances where Abraham exercised his faith in the offering of  sacrifices which represented the One who was to come (Genesis 12:7, 8; 13:4, 18; 15:9-11; Ch.22). He was a man of faith in Messiah under the sacrificial system before the law, who looked forward in faith to the coming of Messiah. They had the sacrificial lamb as a token of THE sacrificial LAMB to come.

Those of the old era and those of the new all must exercise faith in the atonement of Yeshua as our Saviour.We look back in history to exercise faith in the atoning work of the Lamb of God (John 1:29) Whether forward or backward, it was the same exercise of faith that was required.

The Law of sacrifices has not changed. Yeshua met all the requirements of the laws pertaining to sacrifice. We still offer a sacrifice for sin by faith in His blood, initially for conversion and afterward if we should be overcome in a fault, and commit sin. The blood of the Sacrificial Lamb is our means of atonement (1 John 1:7-9)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===ABRAHAM THE FATHER OF FAITH===
&quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law. What then shall we say that our father Abraham has found according to the flesh? .. ..  For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&quot;  (Romans 3:31; 4:1,3)

Pauls' discussion at the end of chapter 3 is regarding the need of circumcision for believers from he nations and he uses Abraham as a type of one who made the transition from the heathen culture of his time to a place of saving faith. The problem is Judaisers desiring to bring the new converts under Judaic practice regarding conversion. This was dealt with later by the Apostolic Council in Acts 15 which made the decision that it was not necessary for them to prove their faithfulness and be circumcised first to be accepted into the Messianic community, as had been the practice in the old covenant for converts.  As Peter said, 
&quot;So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them (non-Jewish believers) by giving them the Holy Spirit, just  as He did to us, and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith&quot;  (Acts 15:9)

This is the same issue Paul is attempting to teach upon, prior to the ruling of the Jerusalem Council, that a person's heart is purified by faith through the operation of the Holy Spirit, and not by &quot;works&quot; in the new covenant. Converts previously were accepted for circumcision after they had proved their faith by their works for usually a year, spanning all the festival seasons.

Abraham is taken as a type as the spiritual father of all who would come into the faith from a heathen background. He was the first of a kind, as all the previous patriarchs had followed in an unbroken line from Adam, being instructed in righteousness orally, father to son, down through  the generations. Abraham came to faith in a idol-worshiping family in a pagan society. The main point Paul is making is that Abraham came into faith prior to the covenant of circumcision being given, which was a sign for all his natural descendants of the nation which came forth from him, to which the Law was given at Sinai. 

Notice the point that Paul makes,  &quot;Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.&quot;  (Romans 4:16)

The promise through faith, is for &quot;all the seed&quot; and it was given that way so that in the fullness of time, others would be included, who like Abraham, came to faith out of the nations. It would be a contradiction to assume that Paul's reference to &quot;those who are of the law&quot; was meaning those under legalism when he had just stated that the promise by faith through grace was for &quot;all the seed&quot;. He is merely differentiating those who come in just by faith (the Gentiles), from those who come into faith through the knowledge of God and His ways through the Law (the Jews). They are not being contrasted one against the another as if those &quot;who are of the law&quot; are not also of faith. He is the &quot;father of all&quot;, the difference is how they come to faith.

Abraham set a precedent for all who would follow after and transact the spiritual journey from unbelief to faith in the new covenant. He had forsaken the idolatry of his family in Ur and turned to the living God to serve and worship Him and thereby became a prototype, or spiritual &quot;father&quot; for those who would do the same, knowing that, &quot;God would justify the heathen by faith&quot; and so, &quot;they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham&quot;  (Galatians 3: 7, 8)

===THE SAVING FAITH OF ABRAHAM===
The type of faith which is attributed to Abraham as the &quot;father of faith&quot; resulted in the righteousness of God being imputed to him. This is the &quot;new covenant&quot; experience of receiving the nature of God through Christ by faith.  &quot;For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:21).  He imparts His nature to us whereby we become new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17).
In this experience he became the father of all who would afterward believe, both under the system of the law and apart from the law. To all the promise was extended that Abraham reached forward to embrace in that city whose builder and maker is God, the eternal city, the New Jerusalem (Hebrews 11:10, 13-16).

&quot;But now the righteousness apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God, through faith in Yeshua the Messiah, to all and upon all who believe.&quot;  (Romans 3:21-2)
The righteousness &quot;apart from&quot;  (CHORIS)  the law means 'separate from', not instead of the law. This new creation experience was available to all. David was another who entered into this experience by faith (Romans 4:6), as did many of the patriarchs. Notice that Abraham was a believer before God called him out of Ur (&quot;By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out&quot;  Hebrews 11:8) and it was many years before his faith was perfected and he was able to receive the promise. Again, 
'By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who received the promises offered up his only begotten son ... ... concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:17, 19)  Here we see the operation of Abraham's faith in the resurrection of Messiah, of which he knew Isaac was a type, wherein he received the reward of his faith, the righteousness of God;  &quot;Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&quot;  (Galatians 3:6)

===THE WALK OF FAITH AND THE LAW===
Yahweh God chose Abraham to be the father of faith because he had already proved himself faithful to walk in the revealed will of God to him. The basis of the fulfillment of the promises as said to Isaac was, &quot;because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws&quot;  (Genesis 26:5).

He knew because of that He could trust him to order his children and his household after him. As He said,  &quot;For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice, that the Lord may bring to Abraham what he has spoken to him.&quot;  (Genesis 18:19)

Yahweh's faith not misplaced, Abraham faithfully taught his household, and they in turn the next generation, so that all the principles, laws, and commandments of God were orally taught to each succeeding generation until their absorption in Egypt. We are given to understand that after the patriarchs died, in the process of time, the nation fell into idolatry and a process of assimilation into Egyptian culture and worship took place. Yahweh then gave them over to a ruler who oppressed them, to cause them to turn back to Him, in their need.

God does not send oppression upon any people while they walk in His ways. Judgments and oppression comes as a result of ungodliness. We see that it was not until fourth plague that Yahweh made a difference between the Israelites and the Egyptians, causing Goshen to be separated and free from the plagues  (Exodus 8:23). Up till that time we can assume that He made no difference between them because Israel had not separated itself from Egypt. The mighty demonstrations of His power drew them back into knowing and worshiping Him again. The Passover was a determining symbol of faith in the sacrificial Lamb for their redemption and deliverance. It separated the believers from the unbelievers among them. Jewish historians say that there was only a small proportion of the nation which had descended from the patriarchs that actually came out in the exodus. There were many added to them from other nations who had also been taken into slavery into Egypt who identified themselves with the God of Israel and formed the mixed multitude of other nations that came out with them.

This mixed multitude of redeemed people which came out in the exodus, was largely untrained in the way of righteousness. Transgression had overtaken the nation itself and the Law needed to be given to them to instruct them in righteousness  -  &quot;The law was added because of transgression&quot;  (Galatians 3:19)

When the Law was given at Sinai, it was given in 70 languages, according to the number of the nations of the world, because it was for the whole world, not just for Israel, although they were intended to be the Priest-nation to the world. Just as also at Pentecost, all the nations present at that time, heard them speak in their own languages. So did the Word speak to each of the mixed multitude in their own language at Sinai.

What had been orally transmitted before Israel became a nation, was now transcribed on tablets of stone to become a  national constitution in a written covenant with Almighty God  (Exodus 20-23). It was &quot;added&quot; after their redemption, for instruction in righteousness, not as a means of salvation or acceptance with God.

&quot;What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.&quot;  (Galatians 3:19)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE MELCHIZEDEK ORDER===
Abraham, the father of faith came under the Melchizedek order of priesthood. This type of Firstborn-priesthood began with Adam as a king-priest with dominion and care-taking responsibilities over the earth. It was not revoked when he disobeyed Yahweh God and it continued on down through to Noah, and after the flood to Shem, then to Eber, and then passed down to him as the chosen one to bear the responsibility of the lineage.

Jewish historical records bear witness to the fact that Shem, as the officiating king-priest of the time was the figure identified as Melchizedek which is actually a title, meaning 'king' (Melech) 'priest' (Zedek), and not a name of a person. The ceremony recorded in Genesis 14:18-20 was actually the transference of the priesthood to Abraham and it is after this event that the first covenant was made with Abraham in Chapter 15.

Shem was portrayed as a type of Messiah's future High Priestly role, as the Redeemer-King-Priest of the earth. King David spoke prophetically of Messiah's role as the King-Priest in the plan of redemption in Psalm 110:1, saying, 
&quot;Yahweh said to my Lord (Adonai), Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool.&quot;

and in verse 4, &quot;You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek&quot;

The epistle to the Hebrews confirms this, saying, &quot;For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. And yet it is far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. For He testifies, &quot;You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek&quot;&quot;

The writer here is differentiating between the Levitical priesthood which served as a replacement for the dysfunction and disqualification of the priesthood in Israel as a nation after their bondage in Egypt, and the Melchizedek priesthood which was re-instated through Messiah. He came from the tribe of Judah and not from the tribe of Levi. Under that interim priesthood, only those of the tribe of Levi could serve in the priesthood. 

=== THE CHANGE IN THE PRIESTHOOD ===
The Levitical priesthood brought nothing to perfection, but it trained the nation in the principles of Yahweh God until such time as they were ready to receive Messiah (Hebrews 7:11). The law which they were under served as a schoolmaster to train them in the ways of righteousness until the time of redemption came. When the fullness of time came and the 'schoolmaster' had served it's purpose, there was &quot;a change of the law&quot;.

&quot;For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law&quot; (Hebrews 7:12 - see Gal. 4:1-5)

The word used here for 'law' is NOMOS, which is used for matters of law generally. In the Hebrew of the Old Testament, there are many words used to differentiate the various aspects of commandments, statutes &amp; laws. 
So, context has to be the determining factor as to the actual aspect of God's administration which is referenced.

The word used here for 'change' is METATHESIS which means a transposition or a transference (Vines's Expository Dictionary), and is not the Greek word which would be used for a complete change or transformation. So what we have to understand is that it was a transference from the 'laws' which applied to the Levitical order back to those which applied to the Melchizedek order. A better word for 'laws' here would be 'principles'. So what the writer is addressing, is the transference of the principles of priestly service back to the original Melchizedek order which was functional in the Abrahamic covenant before the establishment of the Levitical system.
  
The context of the whole exegesis in Hebrews is the change in the priesthood and its relationship to the terms of the covenant. The change in the priesthood from the Levitical order to the Melchizedek order meant that all of the laws which applied to the Levitical order became redundant, and so there was a &quot;change&quot; in the 'laws' (principles) relating to the priesthood of the new covenant under the Melchizedek order, from the old covenant. 

=== THE EFFECTS OF THE CHANGED PRIESTHOOD ===
The writer to the Hebrews expounds on the superiority of the priesthood of Yeshua, as the High Priest of the Melchizedek order and the greater benefits this has given to those in the new covenant,
&quot;He has become the surety of a better covenant&quot; (Hebrews 7:22). The word used here for 'surety' actually means the &quot;bail&quot; - that which was paid to bail us out from our sentence of judgment and spiritual death.

&quot;But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also mediator of a better covenant which is established on better promises, for if that first [covenant] were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.&quot; (Hebrews 8:6-7)

The translators here have supplied the word 'covenant' when it is not in the original. The next verse goes on to say, &quot;But finding fault with them, He says,&quot;. What is usually understood is that it is referring to the first covenant, however this implies that Yahweh God gave them a covenant that was imperfect. The fault here is in the translation supplying the word &quot;covenant&quot;. What was imperfect and which has been referenced all through out the discourse on this subject, is the inferiority of the previous sacrifices to take away sins and make a complete atonement for sin. In each case, the terms of the covenant were established on the basis of the priesthood in the covenant. It was the priests in the former covenant who failed in their service which required the implementation of the Levitical priesthood in their sin with the Golden Calf (Exodus 32)

So, it was not the fault of the covenant but their unregenerated heart, for which reason he gave them the new, or really, a renewed covenant as he goes on to say in verses 8-12.

The same error is made in verse 13, again supplying the word 'covenant' when it is not in the original, and where the subject matter is the priesthood which is ready to &quot;vanish away&quot;. The fact is that the new covenant was brought into effect with Yeshua's offering as the sacrificial lamb, but it was the old priesthood which was still operational in the temple and was &quot;ready to vanish away&quot;, which it did with the destruction of the temple in 70AD. The point is, that the new covenant was a renewing of the original covenant, but on better promises with a better sacrifice and that was what changed it and made it a better covenant.

Note. The word used for 'new' is KAINOS and not NAOS indicating that it was new in the sense of its quality and nature but not 'new' as being different. 

The sacrificial laws of the Levitical order made nothing perfect.
&quot;For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of those things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.&quot; (Hebrews 10:1) here again, it is the laws pertaining to the sacrifices which is being referred to here as images and shadows of the realities which were introduced with the priesthood of Yeshua in the Mechizedek order. The imperfection of them was in the continual need for them to be offered as against the perfect offering in the sacrifice of Yeshua the Messiah, once for all, for all sin (Hebrews 10:11-13).

&quot;By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Yeshua the Messiah once for all&quot;

&quot;For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.&quot; (Hebrews 10:10, 14)

What the previous order could not do with all its order of service, He achieved in one offering for all time. And so, we rest in the finished work of Yeshua the Messiah for our personal sins. The blood of the Sacrificial Lamb is our means of atonement. See 1 John 1:7-9

Now in the Melchizedek priesthood which has been re-instated with Yeshua the Messiah serving as it's High Priest, all those who now serve as priests, do so under that order of priesthood. As priests unto God serving in that order of priesthood, we also offer spiritual sacrifices unto Him (1 Peter 2:5-10; Hebrews 13:15).

We have become a kingdom of priests unto our God which is the fulfillment of purpose of the original covenant given at Sinai (Exodus 19:6; Revelation 5:9-10)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE ORIGINAL COVENANT - A KINGDOM OF PRIESTS===
The original covenant at Sinai in Exodus 19, continued the Patriarchal pattern of every man being a priest over his own household. It was under this priesthood which had functioned from Adam down to Noah and finally to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that was still current when the nation of Israel was in Egypt, although it had been dysfunctional due to the oppression of the taskmasters of Egypt.

The first instruction once they come out of Egypt was for the firstborn of all males to be consecrated to function again in their service. (Exodus 13:1-2, 12) Then He says to them once they arrive at Sinai,

&quot;Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure unto Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&quot;  (Exodus 19:5-6)

But Israel defaulted on this covenant at the incident of the golden calf (Exodus 32) and so the Levitical system was introduced of one tribe, who was accounted worthy through their faithfulness, to do the priestly service for the whole nation. (Exodus 32:28, Numbers 3:5-14). They would no longer be a kingdom of priests, but a nation served by one of their tribes doing the priestly service. The nation as a whole lost its status and the original purpose of Yahweh God was deferred until One came who had the power to bring the covenant into effect.

===THE NEW COVENANT REPEATS THE OLD===
When Peter expounds on the priesthood of the new covenant, he refers back to the original covenant in Exodus 19:4-6 of them becoming a kingdom of priests. This covenant which was made with Israel before the incident of their sin with Golden Calf that broke the covenant, became effective in the new covenant (1 Peter 2:4-10).

Through the sacrifice of Yeshua the Messiah and His High Priestly service, He has made the covenant effectual so that now they are as Peter says, &quot;His own special people&quot;, a &quot;royal priesthood, a holy nation&quot; (1 Peter 2:9). To have a &quot;kingdom of priests&quot; was, and is, His eternal purpose (Ephesians 3:11).

Into this now &quot;chosen&quot;, &quot;holy&quot; nation, the Gentiles have been grafted in to become part of Israel. What was once a wild branch, has been grafted into the Olive tree, which is Israel (Romans 11:13-24). The kingdom now is comprised of Jew and Gentile which becomes one &quot;new man&quot; in Him, no longer Jew and Gentile but all part of the greater Israel of God. (Romans 11:11, 16-18 - Jews broken off - wild grafted in)

===THE ERROR OF REPLACEMENT THEOLOGY===
Replacement theology is the doctrine that the Church has replaced Israel. This presumes that the Jews have been forsaken because they did not embrace their Messiah as a nation when He came, and have therefore been cast away. But, their 'casting away' is a temporary &quot;blindness&quot; to admit the &quot;Gentiles&quot; to be grafted in that the Gentile believers might by their example, provoke the Jews to jealousy as they behold the spiritual riches they have inherited. This is all part of God's wisdom that the Gentiles/nations might be included in His purposes and that all might be saved eventually. Paul warns against the believers in the nations becoming proud and assuming that the Jews have been permanently cast away, rather than realising that it is all the providence of God and His mercy that they are included. (Romans 11:11-15, 25-33).

What Paul is actually saying, is that the restoration of all things for the completion of Yahweh God's purposes, is dependant upon the natural branches being grafted back into the olive tree again to bring it forth into the fullness of resurrection life. Believers in the nations are not a separate from Israel.

Paul taught that in the new covenant, although they are still identified separately, there is no longer Jew/Gentile as being different before God, BUT one new man - the new order of 'man' (Galatians 3:28; Coloss.3:11).
The Gentile &quot;Church&quot; has not become a new entity BUT, according to Paul, they are  - &quot;fellow-heirs, of the same Body, and partakers of the same promise&quot;  (Ephesians 3:6)

===THE LAW AND THE COVENANT===
Paul takes the non-Jewish believers back to Abraham to establish the foundation of their faith in Yeshua and the promises, saying, &quot;Now to Abraham and to his Seed were the promises made.&quot; (Galatians 3:16)
Abraham is the father-figure who walked by faith with Yahweh God in the principles of His Law before the formal giving of the Law at Sinai. Abraham was chosen for this role-model because he was faithful to walk in all the principles of God's laws, precepts and commandments etc., and not apart from them (Genesis 26:4-5).

The new covenant believer is called to walk in this same faith relationship as their spiritual father who was also called out of the idolatry of the 'world' of his day, and to function under the Melchizedek priesthood. 

Abraham needed to offer animal sacrifices because Yeshua had not yet come, but when He did, He was the perfect sacrifice for sin, slain once for all. Through His sacrifice, the daily sacrifices for sin became obsolete, both in the previous Patriarchal order and in the Levitical priesthood. Therein, all the ceremonial rites for the priesthood and all the laws regarding the animal sacrifices came to an end.

Those laws became obsolete, but the eternal Law of God remained the same. The Law is, after all, the standard of God's righteous nature in which man was created before he fell into sin. Yeshua said that He did not come to do away with the Law of God although He did fulfill it through His life and His sacrifice for sin (Matthew 5:17). He fulfilled the prophecies regarding Himself as the Saviour of Israel , to be that &quot;lamb led to the slaughter&quot; that bore the iniquity of His people (Isaiah 53:4-8; Acts 3:18), so that they would be freed from judgment.

The animal sacrificial laws were given because of man's transgression, as a ceremonial rite to impress upon the sinner the consequences of his sin and to be a means whereby he could express his faith in the promised Messiah, which they represented. All of the sacrifices pointed toward His redemption of the Adamic race.

All ceremonies and laws which were added to instruct the nation in righteousness are separate from and in addition to the eternal Law of God.  In the progressive plan of man's redemption, changes have been made in the terms of the covenants which He has made with His people, but His eternal Law is unchanging. God's standards of holiness and righteousness are according to His own nature and cannot change.

Paul makes such a strong case against circumcision, in taking the believers back to Abraham before the 'law', that it would appear as if he is negating the Law of God. But this is not the case, as can be seen by comparing what he is saying with other scriptures. He was dealing with a contemporary problem caused by the Judaisers who wanted to bring the new converts under the old covenant procedures in circumcision. See Acts 15.
See what Paul himself says, that the only way that we can know what sin is, was by the law.

&quot;Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. &quot; (Romans 7:12)

&quot;The law/torah of Yahweh is perfect converting the soul&quot;   (Psalm 19:7)
&quot;What shall we say then? Is the law sin?   Certainly not! I would not have known sin, except through the law: for I had not known covetousness, except the law had said, you shall not covet&quot;.  (Romans 7:7)

&quot;Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.&quot;  (Romans 3:20)  

Although we are not made righteous with God by our own efforts at keeping His Law, it's holy standard gives us the yardstick with which to measure all that we do. Without it, there would be no regulation upon our behaviour, every man would be free to do what was right in his own eyes (2 Timothy 3:16).

The other function of the Law is to bring judgment, because the penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23). Because the law brings about wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. (Romans 4:15) 

Because the Law exposes what sin is, it also is the means whereby judgment can be justly executed.
 
&quot;But we know that the Law is good if one use it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers ... for manslayers, for fornicators ... etc., and if there is anything that is contrary to sound doctrine, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.&quot; (1 Timothy 1:8-11)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot; Whosoever commits sin also commits lawlessness:  and sin is lawlessness.&quot; 	(1 John 3: 4)
Sin is breaking God's law.   Whether it is wilful or by neglect, everything that falls short of His righteous, holy standard is sin.  All that deviates from His perfect way is sin. That is why Cain was not accepted, because he chose to go another way other than what Yahweh had decreed.  Not being subject to His Law, is lawlessness and is the original sin of being independent from God. In other words, you have committed a sin when you break any one or more of Yahweh's commandments.  See 1 Timothy 1: 9; 1 John 3:10-12

===THE BONDAGE OF THE LAW===
&quot;Even so we, when we were children,  (under the instruction of the Law) were in bondage under the elements of the world.    But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, the we might receive the adoption as sons.&quot;   (Galatians 4: 3-5)

When we were spiritual children under the tutelage of the Law we were in bondage to the principles of the system of this world.   Yeshua redeemed us from the bondage and control of the operation of the fundamental principles of life in this world.    This includes all the basic human instincts, self-preservation, self-motivation, appetites of the flesh, procreation etc.. Having been adopted into the spiritual family of God, we come under the influence of spiritual motivations in our lives. The bondage was to our natural appetites, the cycle of natural instincts. Now we have begun to enter into the glorious liberty of the sons of God  (Romans 8:21) 

&quot;For the creation was subjected to futility (&quot;as failing of the results designed, because of sin&quot; - Vine ) .....

Because the creation itself will be delivered from the bondage of corruption  into the glorious liberty of the sons of God&quot;    (Romans 8:21)
The Law itself is not bondage,  It becomes bondage to us because the keeping of it becomes a yoke of servitude contrary to our own nature.  Our performance of it either becomes legalistic, or we rebel and follow our own desires.   We therefore are in bondage,  i.e. slavery to sin, we serve sin instead of serving righteousness.  See Hebrews 2:15;  Romans 6:13-20

... ...  &quot;for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage&quot;   (2 Peter 2:19)

Yeshua kept the law and it was not bondage to Him, He delighted to keep the Father's precepts.

Paul also said,  &quot;I delight in the law after my inward man&quot;   (Romans 7:22)
and David,  &quot;I delight to do Your will, O my God&quot;   (Psalm 40: 8)

The problem is not the law,  but us - our sinful nature. The law exposes our sin without which we are not conscious of it as sin.   We measure ourselves by ourselves, or by others, whereas the law reveals His standard which is contrary to our fallen nature,  and convicts us of our shortcomings.

The Law - the covenant of Mt. Sinai  &quot;gives birth to bondage &quot; (NKJ)  because of what it generates in us, &quot;but the Jerusalem which is above is free&quot;   - it is freed from corruption and is in the liberty of the Spirit - by the Spirit of life which is in Yeshua the Messiah.   See Galatians 4:24-26;  Romans 8: 2

&quot;For where the Spirit of Yahweh is,  there is liberty&quot;    (2 Corinthians 3:17)

Obeying His Word which is His Law,  brings liberty whereas sin brings us into bondage.

&quot;Then said Yeshua to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;  And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot;    (John 8:31)
 
The truth is His Word - His Torah - the principles of His Law.   That is what sets us free!   See John 17:17 

&quot;I will walk at liberty for I seek Your precepts&quot;   (Psalm 119:45)
Paul said - &quot;the Law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just and good&quot;  (Romans 7:12)

&quot;for we know that the Law is spiritual -but I am carnal sold under sin&quot;   (Romans 7:14)

The problem then is not the law, but sinful man. The Law is spiritual, but man is carnal, controlled by fleshly desires, under the domination of sin, and therefore violates Yahweh God's holy Law.

The fault in the old covenant was found with the people whose hearts were hard, disobedient and without faith.

&quot;For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second. Because finding fault with them, He says, &quot;Behold the days are coming when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the House of Judah .. .. &quot;   (Hebrews 8:7-8)

It was the heart condition of the people which proved the covenant to be inadequate and ineffective, not the covenant itself. To say that Yahweh God's covenant in itself was at fault, is to charge God with sin.

The fault with the old covenant was it's powerlessness to deal with the nature of man.  The law is perfect, holy, just, good and spiritual in nature, but it cannot change us. Knowing what the law decrees as righteous, does not enable us to be righteous. The natural man needs a new nature to be able to obey God's law which Yeshua provided by the impartation of His Spirit/life into us, to give us the power to live the law. That is, to live the life of Yeshua the Messiah who is the embodiment of the Law.

===THE LAW IS OUR SCHOOLMASTER===
The Law is, after all, the standard of God's righteous nature in which man was created before he fell into sin.
The Law is therefore the standard of holiness which was revealed in Yeshua the Messiah, the Word made flesh

The Law is not done away with, as it is the means whereby sin is exposed and our need of a Saviour becomes apparent, because we cannot by our own &quot;works&quot; (efforts), keep God's holy standard of righteousness, which is what the Law outlines. The Law is God's eternal standard of righteousness, so how can it be done away with?
It sets the standard and convicts of sin through the Holy Spirit, to bring men to Messiah  (Galatians 3:24)

THE JEWS HAD THE MINISTRY OF THE TORAH (the schoolmaster) - which was the Pentateuch - the five books of Moses.  The Holy Spirit came upon vessels at Pentecost that were filled with the Word -- thoroughly taught in the Law of God, from father to son for generations. When Yeshua had said to His disciples that the Holy Spirit would teach them, it was on the basis that they were already filled with the Word (1 John 2:27; John 14:26; 16:13)

The Gentiles coming into the Assembly were ignorant of the Torah, the Law of Yahweh God, and so needed to be taught the ways of God through the preaching of the Word (Acts 15:21).  When the issue of what was required of the Gentile converts was taken to the apostles in Jerusalem, they did not lay upon them many pre-requisites. They decided to only decree what was necessary for the mixed community to fellowship together, on the understanding that they would hear Moses/Torah each Sabbath as they went to the synagogue and would learn what was required of them from the preaching of the Law.  They needed instruction from the scriptures, as well as the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, to instruct them in the ways of righteousness. 

===THE LAW IS ENGRAVED ON THE HEART OF THE NEW MAN BY THE SPIRIT===
--  2 Corinthians 3:3	
	
But, we still need the written Word for instruction - 2 Timothy 3:16
We are no longer under the Schoolmaster, but we still need the knowledge which the Schoolmaster gave us.  When Paul outlined the use of scripture to Timothy, it was the O.T. scripture - i.e. Torah readings. They had no other resource other than the scriptures which we now call the old covenant section of the Bible.

The faith which is necessary to bring us into an initial righteous standing with God (Romans 4:7-8), is not sufficient to establish a walk in the ways of righteousness, only a knowledge of God's righteous requirements can do that from His law. Therefore faith is not a substitute nor does it make void the law of God.

&quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: rather, we establish the law.&quot; (Romans 3:31)

&quot;For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.&quot; (Romans 2:13)	
				
THE LAW IS NOT DONE AWAY!!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE TERMS OF THE NEW COVENANT===
Yeshua said, &quot;If you love me, keep my commandments&quot; .. ..

WHAT ARE YESHUA'S COMMANDMENTS?
&quot;If you keep My commandments you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.&quot;  (John 15:10)

An analogy is presented of keeping His commandments just as He kept the Father's commandments.	 The Father's commandments, were of course, the Law. Yeshua kept His Father's commandments in order to stand in for the Adamic race as a perfect sacrifice, without sin. 

These same commandments He presented to the people and taught on in the temple. He summarised them into two main principles of loving God and loving our neighbour, as the essence of His Father's commandments.
&quot;On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets&quot; (Matthew 22:37-40 from  Deuteronomy 6:5). 

The apostles take these two principles and teach them as new covenant commandments,
&quot;Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, &quot;You shall not commit adultery&quot;, you shall not murder&quot;,  .. ... .. ... .. ...  and if there is any other commandment, all are summed up in the saying, namely, &quot;You shall love your neighbour as yourself.&quot;  Love does no harm to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.&quot;  (Romans 13:9-10)

Here are some of the ten commands quoted specifically in relation to the summary Yeshua made of  them. But Paul has only quoted those in relation to our neighbour, and not any of those that refer to our relationship with Almighty God; and then, only five of the six that apply there, omitting honouring parents. 

&quot;And this is the commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also&quot; (1 John 4:20-21).  Again, what is being addressed is one's relationship to our neighbour that requires more observance. 
The statement here of loving God and loving one's brother is a reference to the summary that Yeshua gave of the ten commands, as being the &quot;commandment we have from Him&quot;.

Both Paul and John are using the ten commands which are the Father's commandments, as being Yeshua's commandments which He asked us to keep to abide in His love. This is how they interpret His Word to them when He spoke to them and said, &quot;keep My commandments&quot;. And the reason for that is that His commands did not originate in Him but in the Father. He kept His Father's commandments  -  the Law, as He said,

&quot;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word;  ...  ..  ...  ..  ...  He who does not love Me, does not keep My words; and th word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me.&quot;  (John 14:23-24)

His commandments   = Father's commandments  (John 15:10;  Matthew 5:17)

===OBEDIENCE IS THE PROOF OF LOVE===	
&quot;He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me ...  &quot;   (John 14:21)

&quot;Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, I know Him,&quot; and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&quot;  (I John 2:3-6)

&quot;And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk  in it&quot; (2 John 2:6)

Having a genuine relationship and loving Him, are equated with keeping His commandments. Our obedience to His commandments are the proof that we love Him and the evidence that we have a personal relationship with Him. By living in His Law we live in His Love and are recipients of His blessing. 

&quot;Now he who keep His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.&quot;  (1 John 3:24)

Yeshua constantly taught the people to keep the commandments.
&quot;And He said unto him, Why do you call me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.&quot;  (Matthew 19:17)  -  being a partaker of His life depends on keeping the commandments. You need to be in the Vine to be a partaker of it's life; to have the sap flow through the branch.

&quot;Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.&quot;  (Revelation 22:14)  - entering into the immortal and incorruptible state also depends on keeping His commandments. The authority to enter New Jerusalem is limited to those who do so. 

KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS   =  OBEDIENCE   =   eternal life

Yeshua set us the example of obeying His Father's commandments, even unto death, &quot;though He was  a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. And having been perfected He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him.&quot;  (Hebrews 5: 8-9)

The power of His salvation is available to those who walk in obedience to Him. It is a relationship of walking in His love and being a partaker of the blessings which come from doing that. it is not a burden to keep His law.

===YESHUA SAID LAW WAS NOT DONE AWAY===
&quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law, or the Prophets.  I did not come to destroy, but to fulfill&quot;  (Matt. 5:17)The word used here for 'destroy' is KATALUO and has the meaning of destroying utterly, or overthrowing completely (Vine). And with that statement, He issues the warning that, &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;  ...  ..  ...  (Matt.5:19), and also that breaking one of the least of the commandments will effect one's status in the kingdom.

In verse 18, He emphasises this by saying that not even the jots and tittles in the Hebrew text, will &quot;pass from the law till all is fulfilled&quot;.  This means that it will not be made redundant until it is fulfilled.

The word &quot;pass&quot; -  CHOREO [S 5562]  according to Vine's Expository Dictionary it means, &quot;to make room, retire, pass&quot;

Seeing that Yeshua's ministry is still ongoing and there is much of prophecy still to be fulfilled, we have to understand that the Law is still in effect and has not been made redundant or put out of operation.

If the Law is not done away and there is a recompense to every violation of it, how careful we should be!

&quot;Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. For is the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:1-3)

Some of Paul's writings would seem to contradict this, but it is a wrong understanding based on false teachers' rendition of the scriptures. The problem is added to, by the fact that the translators have rendered the text according to this misunderstanding, and so, it is only by going to the original text, that we uncover the fact that in many cases where Paul said that we are not under the law now in the new covenant, he was intending the understanding that we were not under the power of the law, imposing it's penalty upon us because of sin.
 
We are living in the new covenant within the framework of the Law, but not under legalism to the Law. We live in the spirit of the Law by the power of His life. We are in submission to Him, and not to a set of rules, as of the letter of the law, which Paul refers to, and which is legalism.

We live in a faith-based relationship with Him through His grace, and walk in obedience to His commandments. The difference between the old and the new covenant, is that we have now received an impartation of His life and are enabled to keep His commandments, and live the life He lived, in obedience to the Father.

== Customizing Distance Learning Experiences With Web-based Metrics ==

At the epicenter of good instruction is the fundamental principle that assessment drives instruction. This truth endures in all good classroom environments. A seasoned educator will utilize a combination of student feedback and both terminal and ongoing assessments. Clearly, assessment’s relationship to instruction continues to affect distance learning environments. Most would agree that assessment affects distance learning to the same degree as an in-person classroom; however, a new form of assessment informs distance learning to an even greater extent than a traditional classroom setting.

With the advent of Web 2.0 multimedia tools, a new dimention has been added to the variety of Internet-based distance learning environments. Although both Web 2.0 and distance learning environments are ultimately in their infancy (so their destiny presently remains uncertain), many of the core principles of excellence in teaching and learning unrelentingly apply. Simply stated, a teacher must manage the classroom (virtual or otherwise). A distance learning instructor must acutely supervise her/his class similarly to the manner in which a good K-12 classroom teacher practices efficient management skills. Until recently, technological limitations inhibited distance learning instructors from easily monitoring many of the aspects of sound classroom management. The lack of first-person direct contact placed limits on the instructor’s ability to manage student collaboration, dialog, and scheduling issues.

The information gap among students and teacher which was created by Internet-based distance learning platforms has receded due to web-based metrics. Web-based metrics are a form of ongoing assessment used by website designers, marketing researchers, and, heretofore distance learning instructors to gauge the accessibility, efficiency, and the popularity of their website. More specifically, website metrics provide detailed statistics on a given website. Information includes: name, IP address, location (physical), browser and version, OS, date, time, accessing point, duration onsite, movement within a website, point of exit, and more.
Melding lessons learned in the arenas of website development, marketing research, and instructional best practices, web-based metrics are an excellent means of gathering relevant information for customizing distance learning environments. Using web-based metrics, the instructor can view the frequency with which her/his coursework is being accessed. The instructor can better manage the dates for posting new instructional materials, and he/she can create more thoughtful due dates for discussion posting requirements. Moreover, the instructor can assess the efficiency of the platform; thereby, she/he can better decide if the platform is good, needs improvement, or should be entirely replaced. 

The primary tool for evaluating website metrics is Google Analytics. Google Analytics gives the website designer, business owner, or distance learning instructor the ability to scrutinize website traffic data. Technologically speaking, Google Analytics is a java script that one embeds into the coding of his/her webpage or Internet-based learning platform. After the website designer signs up for an open source Google Analytics account, the java script is provided free online. Then, when a user opens that page, that users information is sent to Google, archived, and analyzed according to the account holder’s specifications. When the account holder wants the pre-analyzed information she/he can login to Google Analytics, or he/she can have that information automatically emailed to a designated email address.
The java script that Google Analytics is based on creates a system of metrics that enables the account holder to view the history of Internet volume on a given website. Beyond simple measurements of volume, Google Analytics provides its administrator with the opportunity to view metrics including: bounce ratio, number of new visitors, average time on site, goals met, and percent change of the aforementioned statistics. Furthermore, Google Analytics provides the designer with the ability to organize each series of statistics by day (within an approximate three hour delay), week, month, and year.

Among the most powerful metrics provided by Google Analytics, is goal setting. Goal setting enables the designer to assign a website starting point endpoint, and pathway, or series of pathways, to actualization. The process begins by designating a starting point called a landing page. Channels are then created by assigning one or more suitable pathways. These pathways are referred to as funnels, and thus, multiple funnels can be assigned to a singular goal. For example, a person designing a website for a small business can view the frequency with which a visitor is finding her or his way to Paypal. Or, a distance learning instructor can view the efficiency with which students are locating online instructional materials.
Google Analytics provides data on where traffic came from prior to opening the landing page, and it provides data on where those who exited the funneling process went next. Thereby, Google Analytics enables the designer to see the degree to which a site is being efficiently (or possible inefficiently) used. Conceptually, Google Analytics is a nearly instant feedback system of marketing research data in the context of website design that a distance learning instructor can assimilate into the body of knowledge requisite to manage an Internet-based classroom environment.

Using the time on site, goals, and bounce rate tools, a distance learning instructor can ensure that students are properly adhering to the distance learning class regulations. Consider this example: A teacher is creating an Internet-based distance learning platform; class will be taught on video to be streamed in its entirety each week, but according to the students’ schedules; the student must login, view the video, and conclude by authoring a posting. 
As long as the video is streaming, the time on site metric will guarantee that the student accessed the video in its totality. Although the instructor can’t be certain that the student is paying attention to the video, often that cannot be ascertained in-person either. The goals tool ensures that the students are able to find the discussion board, and it very quickly informs the instructor of the number of students who have completed the assignment.

Bounce rate is the number of users that opened the website, in this case a distance learning platform, and immediately left. So, the bounce rate further certifies that the student did not just login and leave. It is possible the student believed they could deceive the wary instructor by logging in, skipping the video, and posting later. Or, potentially the site is too confusing or misleading, and the instructor should amend it. Very often, users will immediately give up if they perceive a website as confusing. The degree to which users resign themselves to convoluted oblivion and immediately quit incontrovertibly applies to distance learning platforms.
Additionally, the instructor views his/her students’ web traffic data and can change requirements and due dates accordingly. Given the prior example, the instructor uses Google Analytics finding that ninety percent of the class views and posts on Sunday nights just before the last possible moment that the work is due. The instructor wants to actualize the cumulative knowledge of the class by having students’ postings build upon one another. Since the instructor now knows the exact time, date and volume of postings, she/he could either move the group’s due date forward or could assign students individualized, differentiated due dates to each class member. Thereby, the instructor could utilize the data from Google Analytics to regulate peer-to-peer discussions.

Identifying trends in students’ Internet traffic is made easier with the Google Analytics graphic dashboard. The Google Analytics dashboard provides metrics represented in the form of a variety of graphing tools and data-based maps. Google Analytics provides flexible graphing tools to view number of visits over time as pie chart, list of percentages, or in linear graph form. A sliding tool further enables the instructor to highlight and compare usage trends over time, and the mapping tool provides data ranging across country, state, and locality. By using the information discerned from past trends, the instructor can then predict the future habits of students in a given distance learning scenario.
Since Google Analytics is a powerful tool for instructors developing or simply using distance learning platforms, it can enable instructors to transcend the confines of an in-person classroom environment. Past limitations imposed on distance learning experiences can be minimal by studying web traffic data; moreover, Google Analytics can assist the instructor in flexibly grouping students in different ways that make it superior to in-person models. Using the aforementioned example, the instructor can combine students in groups based upon specific days and times relating to the confines of their work schedules. Or, by using the mapping feature from the dashboard the instructor may assign specific content organized by geographic region. Therefore, Google Analytics gives the instructor the opportunity to customize the class content and schedule around the needs and interests of the students.

In conclusion, many enduring principles of excellence in instruction continue to apply to distance learning. However, new evolutions in technology offer the potential for new types of educational experiences. Strong instruction is built upon pragmatic elements of classroom management. Student-to-student dialog, ensuring the thorough completion of activities, sensible scheduling, and self-evaluating the clarity of instruction can all be improved upon in the web-based distance learning environment by keeping a system metrics. Google provides this service free; and although it is typically used by webpage designers and marketing researchers, Google Analytics can empower educators with the ability to better supervise online classes.

&lt;big&gt;Quick Reference Music Education Websties&lt;/big&gt;

This page will list and describe websites that have application in a music classroom. Some of the sites listed are compilations of other music education websites themselves. As more websites are created, a comprehensive catalog is indispensable when trying to quickly find sites that suit the need of the teacher. For this reason this page will sometimes offer a catalog within a catalog


Quick Reference can be used by educators as a starting point for ideas for activities and learning in their classroom. Each link has a brief description of what is on the site and suggestions for potential uses.

Artist House Music is a catalog of other music education links and was published in 2006. The following is taken from the main page. “A search for “music education” using any search engine literally yields hundreds of thousands of links. Are you looking for teaching resources such as lesson plans, down loadable media materials such as MIDI and audio files, Web sites that can be used in the classroom to demonstrate musical concepts, or information on specific music related topics? To get you started, here are 25 Web sites that represent some of the best music education resources online”.

This site is sponsered by the San Fransisco Orchestra and allows students to explore the instruments of the orchestra. The site is very basic and could be navigated by even young elementary students. 


By clicking on pictures of the instruments, factual information will appear in addition to sound clips. There is also a section that informs students about basics of music like pitch, harmony, melody, rhythms, symbols etc.. A small section of the website is devoted to students investigating their own creativity with a composition and performance section. However, the composition section is very simplistic. Pre-written blocks of music can be placed on a staff. The student may only manipulate the order of the blocks.

The NIU World Music Instrument Collection is a site that is valuable for people of any age, but has a format that is accessible for very young elementary students. The site is devoted to discovering hundreds instruments from around the world. The instruments presented are all ethnic and non-orchestral. 


The layout of the site is very clean and clear. The following is from the home page. “Welcome to the NIU collection of musical instruments from around the world. These instruments can be viewed using a variety of methods. If you know the name of the instrument you can find it by using the '''''Alphabetic''''' icon. If you would like to learn about musical instruments from various regions of the world use the '''''World map''''' icon. Musical instruments are often classified as chordophones (strings), aerophones (woodwinds and brasses), idiophones (percussion), and membranophones (drums) which are listed under the '''''Classification''''' icon. The '''''Ensemble''''' icon will take you to examples of the various instruments being played in groups or as solos. Finally you can always return to this page by clicking in the '''''Home''''' icon. Which ever path you take, have fun with the many musical instruments throughout the world.”


All the instruments have a sound clip (run by Quicktime) to accompany the picture. Pictures also may be printed. The quality is clear and very useful for potential projects.

The website is sponsered by the New York Philharmonic and is designed to be an interactive experience for students learning about music. There are many facets to this site, each with a great deal of depth. This is one of the most comprehensive and interactive sites. Children as young as third or fourth grade could enjoy this site, and it could still be relevant to early high school students. 


There are nine “rooms” to visit. The Main Stage, Composer’s Gallery, Musicians Lounge, Instrument Labs, Composition Workshops, Games Room, Instrument Storage, Dressing Rooms, Newsstand. 


* '''Main Stage:''' The main stage is where there are links for all the other “rooms”. Students can see all the activities in one spot. 
* '''Composer’s Gallery:''' The composer gallery has a character that allows students to “walk” through an art gallery with pictures of composers. Clicking on a picture will bring up a bio of the composer. This format is somewhat interactive.
* '''Musician’s Lounge''': The Musician’s Lounge is the backstage, or green room for the members of the orchestra. The students can “chat” with the musicians and find out tidbits of trivia on the players. For example, there is information like, where they went to elementary school and how they started playing their instrument. Each chatting musician has a link about the instrument they play. 
* '''Instrument Labs:''' The instrument lab shows a number of nontraditional instruments. By clicking on an instrument, a window with directions on how to fabricate the instrument pops-up. Just like the Composer’s gallery, the students can “walk” through the instrument lab and look at all the wacky instruments. 
* '''Composition Workshops:''' The composition workshop is very interactive. The music writing process is very structured so that anyone can use it. Blocks of pre-written music can be dragged from a bank and dropped on to a staff. Then the composer can listen to the summation of the blocks and edit the position of the pre-written blocks. The music available to compose is based on western tonal harmony. 
* '''Games Room:''' There are eleven games to select from in the game room. Many of the games are based on very popular mainstream games. 

# Piccolo Pete is like Super Mario Brothers. 
# Music Quest is a RPG like Star Wars.
# Puzzles and Quizzes are seat work activities.
# Percussion Showdown is a rhythmic matching and composition competition. 
# Musical Mingles is iconic notation that is streaming so music may be composed live. There are style settings for the composition, i.e. jazz, classical. It is possible to hear what other kids have done; like a composer’s forum. 
# Music Match is matching audio and visual cards; Sometimes a song must match the same song, or the correct composer must be matched with their own writing. 
# Make Your Own Instrument is a virtual Partch project but no sound. Harry Partch was a musician inventor from California that would take old junk and make musical instruments. This is a virtual version of that.
# The Orchestra Station and Minuet Mixer also in the composition workshop. 
# Instrument Frenzy is a bit like snood. Instruments must be categorized by family: woodwind, brass, percussion, string. 

* '''Instrument Storage:''' In the instrument storage room, the student can “walk” around the locker room where the instruments are kept. By clicking on an instrument, a new window appears and historical and practical information comes up about that instrument. In this new window there is a tab for “friends and relatives”. “Friends and Relatives” are instruments from around the world that are related to orchestral instrument in the storage room. There are also listening links to hear what that instrument sounds like. 
* '''Dressing rooms:''' In the dressing room, the student can also “walk” to the private rooms of all the NY Phil conductors and many of the most notable soloists. Like composers gallery, by clicking on the picture of the soloist/conductor their bio will come up. Some of the soloists and conductors have interviews on video.
* '''Newsstand''': This room has “newspapers” with great anecdotal stories on composers.

This site is devoted to the listening of music. People in the fourth grade and older can find this site manageable and pertinent. 


Pandora is internet radio that allows the user to customize a “station” based on personal preferences. When a song is presented, the listener may skip it, click “I like this song” or click “I don’t like this song”. Based on the human input, Pandora will begin to “learn” the users preferences. The next song presented on the radio will be centered on the feedback from the previous song. 


Students could be presented with a new artist\composer to explore. By using this site they can be exposed to new music and be in control of the direction their tastes take them. The students can make connections between a classical composer and current pop-culture music. 


Below is Pandora’s self description:

“With Pandora you can explore this vast trove of music to your heart's content. Just drop the name of one of your favorite songs or artists into Pandora and let the Genome Project go. It will quickly scan its entire world of analyzed music, almost a century of popular recordings - new and old, well known and completely obscure - to find songs with interesting musical similarities to your choice. Then sit back and enjoy as it creates a listening experience full of current and soon-to-be favorite songs for you. You can create up to 100 unique &quot;stations.&quot; And you can even refine them. If it's not quite right you can tell it so and it will get better for you. 

The Music Genome Project was founded by musicians and music-lovers. We believe in the value of music and have a profound respect for those who create it. We like all kinds of music, from the most obtuse bebop, to the most tripped-out drum n bass, to the simplest catchy pop tune. Our mission is to help you connect with the music YOU like”.

&lt;big&gt;[http://www.8notes.com/ http://www.8notes.com/]&lt;/big&gt;


8 notes.com offers free sheet music to download and print. Much of the music requires at least two years of study on an instrument to be able to perform. A great web site for students to find music interesting to them not found in traditional band or lesson books. 


The site is very easy to navigate and find music transposed for any Western orchestral instrument. There is also music for voice, woodwind ensembles, string ensembles, and brass ensembles. The student simply has to click on the picture of the instrument they play. 


The gif file is the free down loadable and printable file available. Each song has an accompanying midi file so the students can hear what the piece sounds like. Some of the more popular instruments, like flute, also have theory instruction links.

=Four Knights Game=
White's 4.Bc4 in here looks like a natural developing move, targeting f7 and getting ready to castle. There is however a tactical trick Black has (4...Nxe4!) which has made masters shun away from 4.Bc4. For some history, we might mention that Tarrasch played this against Lasker in the 1916 World Championship, and was crushed.

If Black wants to accept a normal game, there is nothing particularly wrong with a natural developing move like 4...Bc5, but 4...Nxe4! is the best move in the position, and White is then fighting for equality.

In fact, below the master level, this position crops up very often. One online chess database ([http://www.365chess.com/opening.php?m=7&amp;n=57&amp;ms=e4.e5.Nf3.Nc6.Nc3.Nf6&amp;ns=3.5.5.6.47.57 365chess]) says that 4.Bc4 is played in one out of every five games featuring the Four Knights, and since most amateur games never make it onto that database, the real figure is probably higher. Larry D. Evans (see references below) says that his students wind up in this line about once a tournament.

Since 4.Bc4 is played so often, learning the theory on 4...Nxe4 will let you get many good positions with Black after only a few moves. With best play, White should probably equalize (according to Pinski's book on the Four Knights), but has to work a bit for it.

=Four Knights Game=
Black makes a temporary sacrifice of the knight, and if White plays 5.Nxe4, Black can play ...d5 with a fork which wins back the piece. This tactical trick does not win any material for Black, but knocking out the important White center pawn on e4 has secured Black a good foothold in the center.

Even so, 5.Nxe4, falling in with Black's plan is White's best move. 5.Bxf7+ looks good at first glance because Black's king gets slightly exposed, but White is not developed enough to sustain an attack.

The tactic employed by Black is called the &quot;Fork Trick&quot; and pops up in a number of openings, but it is particularly potent in the Four Knights.

I have looked at a lot of crispy baked chicken recipes, and all of them use things like breadcrumbs or cracker crumbs. So I thought, &quot;Why not add a little flavor in the form of garlic flavored croûtons for a little more flavor?&quot;.
  
== Ingredients ==
* 4 (7-8 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1/2 cup crushed garlic flavored croûtons
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground cumin
* 1 tbs chili powder
* 1 tbs salt
* 1 tbs cayenne pepper
* 1 tbs freshly ground black pepper
* 3/4 cup grated Monterrey Jack cheese
* Olive oil

== Procedure ==
#Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
#Combine butter, seasonings, and salt in a pie plate or a large wide dish.
#Dip chicken into egg mixture then dredge into croûtons. Let rest 2-3 minutes.
#Coat chicken pieces on olive oil then place on a greased baking pan. 
#Insert a probe thermometer into one of the pieces and bake in the oven until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#Sprinkle chicken pieces evenly with cheese and bake until cheese is melted. Serve warm.</text>

It is a guide to understanding and using Wikipedia, for readers with a basic understanding of the project.  It was published in the United States  by [[w:No Starch Press|No Starch Press]] under the GFDL, so that it would be compatible with Wikimedia projects, and in 2013 was relicensed under CC-BY-SA (see talk).

Wikipedia is made up of people just like you: students, professors, and everyday experts and fans. With about 10,000 articles added to Wikipedia each week, there are plenty of opportunities to join this global community. ''How Wikipedia Works'' explains how you can make the Web’s go-to source for information even better.   After reading, feel free to contact the authors or submit errata.

:''&quot;This book was created by Wikipedians, and as a result, I have never read a better summary of how Wikipedia works. Anyone who wants to understand this miracle of the Internet should buy this book!&quot;'' --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimmy Wales]]

:''&quot;...resolves Wikipedia's paradox: Anyone can edit it, but to make your edits stick, you need to know what you are doing.  Editing Wikipedia means navigating a minefield of implicit norms, tacit knowledge, secret lore, suggested policies, and enforceable regulations.&quot;'' - [[w:Barry Wellman|Barry Wellman]]

: ''&quot;It is probable that the idea of an encyclopaedia may undergo very considerable extension and elaboration in the near future.  Its full possibilities have still to be realized. . . .

== What's in the book? ==
We cover Wikipedia from soup to nuts: for readers trying to understand what’s in Wikipedia, how and why it got there, and how to analyze the quality of the content you might find on the site; for current and future editors, from basic editing techniques and wikisyntax to not-so-basic information on complicated syntax, referencing and researching content, and editing collaboratively and harmoniously; and finally for anyone interested in how Wikipedia’s vibrant and complicated community comes together to produce content, resolve disputes, and keep the site running. Finally, we touch on the wider world of Wikipedias in other languages, other Wikimedia projects, and the Wikimedia Foundation itself. We close with appendices about reusing Wikipedia content according to the terms of the GFDL license, and thoughts on using Wikipedia in a classroom setting.

Throughout, we provide community consensus viewpoints and our own thoughts on a common-sense approach to using and participating in Wikipedia, and a selection of carefully-chosen links to the thousands of pages of documentation, help and Wikipedia-space pages that we discuss — not to mention a sprinkling of humor. In every discussion, we try to provide a sense of the community that supports and is at the heart of the Wikipedia project and mission.

 I think that all the teachers I have worked with have been mentors for me.  I have learned so much from each of them.  I hope that when it comes for me to have a mentor I get someone that will guide me in the right direction and will always want to be there for me.  I can believe the turnover rate because there are many teachers that come in for a year at least and then leave. I enjoyed reading the article and it was very informative.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 22:10, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


I liked this article, it was interesting to read and presented interesting information.  I would take issue with the example of the student who was pregnant and came to the teacher for help because the boyfriend wanted her to get an abortion.  The author wrote, &quot;You realize that not only is her future at stake but also the life of another human being.&quot;  I think it was biased because it was showing a pro-life stance in an article that had nothing to do with reproductive rights.  Other than that, I enjoyed the article and thought it was well-written. [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:47, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading this article and I think that it offered so many great points! I think that a mentoring program is a huge part in getting through the first few years of teaching. It can be very overwhelming and stressful to think about and deal with, but if you know you have someone to guide you through new challenges and difficult times, things can seem much more manageable. I am definitely in favor of having a strong mentoring program for new teachers and I hope this becomes a more widely used idea! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 15:04, 1 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I think this is a great and important article.  It is disappointing to hear the number of teachers that leave the profession so soon after starting.  I believe that mentoring could be an answer.  I would definitely welcome the opportunity to work with a veteran teacher that has life experience in the classroom.  Their guidance would only help ensure that I would be a successful teacher.  You can only learn so much from books and lectures, but the &quot;real&quot; situations you can only learn in the classroom.  
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 00:40, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

I am a huge proponent for mentoring programs in any school district.  Why not?!  This article was well written and very informative.  I would have liked to know more about the kinds of mentoring programs in Virginia schools.  These valuable relationships between novice teachers and veteran teachers could ensure my success in the beginning of a new career.  A 30% turnover rate is high and scary.  Almost a third of all teachers leave the field within the first three years.  Wow.  I do not want to be that teacher.  I do not want to have worked so hard to complete my education program and then be too overwhelmed with my actual work environment.  My dreams for my classroom and my students are high.  I would like to ensure their success.  Mentoring is a great option.[[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 20:10, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I thought this was a well written article and very appropriate for future teachers.  It is disheartening to know the turnover rate for new teachers is so high.  I think EVERY new teacher should be given a mentor for the first year, someone with experience who WANTS to be a mentor.  The paperwork alone can be overwhelming for first year teachers, especially combined with all the new technology you might want to add to your curriculum like webquests and cooperative learning activities.  A mentor can help you keep your focus on what's important and help answer questions and guide you through the school system. [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 21:18, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I enjoyed this article as well. I believe that mentoring programs are excellent for first year teachers and should be implemented into every school system. First year teachers are so overwhelmed with everything else it is nice to have someone to talk to and take advice from. This would help the turnover rate and have someone lead you into how the school is conducted. The department chair would be an excellent mentor for the department that the new teacher is teaching in. The mentor program would produce more successful teachers and hopefully reduce the turnover rate. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:23, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed the article. I did not know that the turnover for teachers was so high! I think that the mentoring program would be great. Just like anynone who graduates from college and enters the working field there are alwasy situations that are not necessarily learned in school. Having a mentor and a go to person to bounce off ideas from and to review lesson plans would be great, not only to help you possibly succed in the field but also the students the new teacher is trying to reach.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 01:06, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I am very pro for the idea of a mentoring program for teachers. It is a sad reality that teachers quit because of different circumstances or because there are a lot of difficulties that get in the way. I think if new teachers had the opportunity to work along someone else for the first year it will help a lot, as well as develop new ideas to integrate in the classroom.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 16:56, 2 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

As I look back, the teachers I had were born teachers; they were the ones that took zero tolerance seriously.  I don't think they had as much schooling to go through as we have today.  I think the teachers of today are made because of all the courses and politics that are involved.  It didn't matter if a teacher was qualified then as it does today. Teachers of my school days classroom management was they would punish you and then call your parents; where as today if a teacher punishes a child the teacher will lose their job.  Teachers are born and made because they all have the same common goal:  to teach students and give them the best education possible.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 22:24, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I both enjoyed and agreed with this article and the author.  I think that teachers are a combination of both born and made.  I feel people are born loving children andwanting to work with them.  I also think a good portion of a teacher is learned. I think many of the teacher's characteristics come from genes but the information is learned through life experiences and schooling.

I thought this article was full of great information.  I liked how the author covered all aspects of the argument and covered them well.  The three learning targets were not measurable and would just need some rewording.  I enjoyed reading all of the quotes and how the author threw in the color to make it more interesting.  I would say this was an interesting topic and it sort of goesa long with the question is an athlete born or made?  I do appreciate when all sides of an argument are introduced.

This article was interesting and made me think.  I believe that teachers are born and made.  Obviously teachers need some characteristics like patience, and the love of working with kids which you would probably be born with.  But a lot can be taught to make you a better educator.  How to be an effective teacher can be learned.  How to manage a positive classroom effectively can be taught.  There are a lot of different strategies that we can learn.  For sure teachers need to be good role models and be able to motivate their students.

I agree with the author and believe that teachers are both born and made.  We are born with characteristics that are essential for imparting knowledge to students.  I also believe that you learn specific strategies, such as classroom management and integration of technology, which help you on your journey to being an educator.  I personally believe my mother has helped shape me as a teacher. As a little girl, I swore I would never become a teacher.  Needless to say I have changed my mind.  I see a lot of my mother in my teaching.  So, I guess I could include genetics in my transition from a planner to a teacher.  I like to to think of myself as the new and improved version of my mom...Ms. Crowder 2.0.   [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 19:43, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I do not really understand this debate.  Are teachers born or made?  I am positive it is a little of both.  Anyone can realize, as a child, their lifelong dream is to work in a classroom and instruct students.  Sure, people can also be born with certain personality traits that would enable them to be more successful at this career.  Ultimately,…who cares one way or the other?  I did not grow up telling myself I would just die if I were not a teacher.  I am, however, a person of compassion, empathy, strong-willed temperament, patience, etc.  I have always been a counselor by nature.  I knew I would fit well in an environment where I could nurture the dreams and aspirations of our nation’s children.  We come from a country with many broken homes.  Teachers have the important job of developing strong willed individuals.  Developing our future.  The question that concerns me most is not whether teachers are born or made, or why they even made this career choice.  More concerning…are we truly developing a future of independent, creative minds?  Or, are we test teaching and narrowing curriculum so much that the result will be the loss of individuality?  This is a more important date.   [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 20:23, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


Like most people I agree with the author. It seems like almost everything in life is based on some mixture of nature and nurture. Although, in this instance, I do disagree on a few points. I understand that inclination and natural disposition can be conducive to teaching, but both of these things can be controlled with enough intellect and willpower. While being naturally inclined and disposed to being “positive” and nurturing are infinitely preferable to a person who dons the persona of a positive outlook when needed, it does not necessarily make them much better of a teacher in a long run. Also, this article seems not to consider different methods of pedagogy that may be better suited to individuals with a less “natural” affinity for the profession. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 15:08, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

This article was great because it was clear and direct to the point. I think that teachers are created by a lifetime gain of knowledge and personal experience. I don't know if I really beleive that being a teacher is in someones genes, that might be to much of a thought... The teachers who impacted my life were alwasy the ones who beleived in me, told me things like they were and pushed me forward. Great teachers know how to use there personal experiences and education to help and guide the next generation.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 01:18, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Aside from the fact that this article was very interesting, it made me think as well. I too believe teachers are born and made. For example, I always dreamed of being a ball player but teaching also called my attention. I say, I was born with a teaching instinct but also developed it throughout my schooling. I think is great to influence someone else's life and mentor young children. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 17:04, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I also agreed with the author. Teachers are both born and made. People are born with certain innate characteristics and qualities that would make them a good teacher. However, they are also given skills that can make them even better teachers. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 01:16, 3 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===YESHUA SAID THE LAW IS NOT ANNULLED===
&quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law, or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy, but to fulfill.&quot;  (Matt. 5:17)

Just as Yahweh God Himself is unchanging, so is His Law which is an expression of His own eternal nature, transcribed into principles for man who was made in His image, as a standard for human behaviour.

Yeshua's coming was to fulfill the Law, with all its requirement and it's prophesies and bring it to a fulfillment in Himself. But by so doing, He did not supersede it and make it void or redundant. He was the promised &quot;Seed&quot; and fulfilled the promises which had been made to Abraham of him being a &quot;father of many nations&quot; which opened up salvation through faith to the Gentiles. But in opening up the way of faith, it did not dis-annul the Law, as Paul the apostle to the Gentiles said, 

&quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.&quot; (Romans 3:31)

The validity of the law is established by His people being able to keep His commandments through the impartation of Christ's life, which Paul exhorts the believes to do,
&quot;For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.&quot; (Romans 2:13)

Yeshua specifically warned against anyone breaking these commandments or teaching men against keeping them, as even the insignificant jot and tittle have their significance in the fulfilment of His Word (Matthew 5:18).

===THE FULFILLMENT OF LAW===
If Yeshua fulfilled the law as it says He did in Matthew 5:17, then he observed it completely.  He even says in the next verse that nothing will pass from the law until heaven and earth vanish. Fulfill cannot mean abolish.

He fulfilled the moral aspects of the Law contained in the ten commands in His own perfect observance of them for the purpose they were ordained, as a pattern of righteousness living for man made in God's image. The law is fulfilled by being observant of it. To fulfill any obligation is to meet it's demands and/or perform one's duty. In Him all the Prophets and laws were fulfilled through His sinless life.

&quot;But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, He has fulfilled&quot; (Acts 3:18).  Christ fulfilled the things that the prophets said about Him suffering and dying at the Stake in His sacrificial death and later in High priestly ministry.  He also fulfilled all the types and shadows of the ceremonial portions of the Law spoken of by the Prophets. 

To fulfill something is to supply what was lacking and make it complete.
Strongs 4137 PLEROO from 4234  ' to replete' furnish, satisfy - execute an office, finish a period or task, accomplish.

By fulfilling every aspect of the Law, He didn't render it inoperative. On the contrary, rather than abolish or change the law, He took each aspect of the Law to it's fullest expression, in Himself.

===THE EXALTATION OF THE LAW===
The law has not been done away with, but there is a change.  His commandments are the Father's commandments brought to us through the power of His life.   (Romans 8:3-4)  
 
&quot;Yahweh is well pleased for His righteousness sake;  He will exalt (magnify KJ) the law and make it honourable&quot; (Isaiah 42:21). 

 
COMPARISON OF OLD TO NEW 
:&quot;You have heard it said  .... .... ..... 	but I say unto you&quot;  -  i.e. the Law  ... .... .... its fulfillment in Him!
:The Father's commandments    =   Yeshua's commandments
You shall not murder  ....  ....  ....  	 whoever is angry with his brother  v21-26
You shall not commit adultery .... .... whoever looks lustfully on a woman v29-30
You shall not swear falsely  .... ....  you shall not swear at all v33-37
Execute justice eye for eye .... .....  you shall not resist an evil person v38-42
Love/neighbour and hate/enemy ... ..... love your enemies and do them good v43-49

The Law is exalted and taken to the level of perfection, according to Yeshua's word. &quot;Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect&quot;   (Matthew 5:48)

Yeshua took the Law to a higher level, beyond the external performance of the commandments to an expectation of spiritual perfection in the motivations of the heart in doing them.

===THE ANNULMENT OF THE LAW'S PENALTY===
When He hung on the Stake, He put the body of flesh and it’s sins to death (&quot;For He who knew no sin, was made sin for us&quot;, that sin in the flesh might be judged). He therein blotted out the hand-written ordinances which were contrary to our fleshly nature, by the shedding of His precious sinless blood and condemned sin in the flesh. The Law exposes sin and therefore condemns the sinner with it's penalty, which is death (Romans 6:23). He paid the &quot;wages of sin&quot; which was the penalty of the broken Law, and it was nailed to the torture stake in His death. 

When we talk about &quot;nailing it to his cross&quot;, that is not the Law itself but the curse of the Law or the penalties for disobeying the Law. It was the penalty of the broken Law which He rendered inoperative, not the Law itself.

In that time period when a man was charged with a crime the charges against him were written down on papyrus. If he was found not guilty the papyrus was then washed down with water, removing or blotting out those charges against him, to confirm his acquittal. This abolished the written charges against the man. This is the what is referred to in &quot;blotting out of ordinances against us&quot; that were nailed to the Stake, not the Law itself.

The Law is still God's standard of righteousness and all the requirements for the broken law remain unchanged, apart from Him. But those who have been baptised into Christ, have been baptised into His death, &quot;that the body of sin might be destroyed&quot;  (Romans 6:6). And, as long as one abides in Him and walks in the Spirit of Christ, the curse of the Law is inoperative (Galatians 3:13) and we are able to keep the Law through the power of His enabling grace.

Therefore, in Him, we are no longer under the jurisdiction of the Law, but under grace. We live within the boundaries of the Law, by willing choice, as a result of the change of nature which He has given to us. His life which has been imparted unto us by the Spirit enables us to keep the just requirements of the law.  The Law has not changed, it can't change, it is eternal, but we have.  We now no longer serve sin -  see Romans 6:10-14.

Paul uses the expression of being &quot;under grace&quot; as compared to having been &quot;under law&quot;. The expression, &quot;under law&quot; means being under the bondage of the law, either through trying to keep the Law through fleshly efforts and/or, by the manner in which it controls us through the fleshly nature - see Romans 7:5-12. Now that we are under the jurisdiction of His grace, we are enabled to live in the Law. The two expressions are defined by two different prepositions in the Greek, &quot;under law&quot; [apo nomos], and &quot;in the law&quot; [en nomos]. We have come out from being in subjection to [apo] the Law, to live in [en] the Law, in subjection to His grace. From the bondage to sin to the glorious liberation of the sons of God. It is a choice though of whether we yield ourselves to the old nature and be &quot;under law&quot; or whether we yield to Christ and be &quot;under grace&quot; (Romans 6:13-14).

Paul also said that the law is not of faith, but if we abide in it, that is if we do it, we are living within it. &quot;And the law is not of faith: but, the man that does them shall live in them.&quot; (Galatians 3:12).

By living in His Law we live in His Love.

&quot;But whoso keeps his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  (1 John 2:5-6)

The difference between the Old and the New Covenants is the power given through the new nature to keep the Law (or standards). This has nothing to do with changing the righteous standard.

&quot;And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh: That they may walk in My statutes, and keep My ordinances, and do them: and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.&quot;  (Ezekiel 11:19-20)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LAW===
Paul tells us that the Law is just and holy and good and also that the law is spiritual, but the problem is with us that we are &quot;carnal&quot; under the bondage of sin.  (Romans 7:12,14),  As Paul explains, the human nature cannot keep the law of God in its fallen state  (Romans 7:15-24)

Only a sinless, perfect man can measure up to the standard of righteousness required by a holy, pure and just God. For that reason,  Yeshua became the second man (a second 'Adam') as the head of a new order of 'man' to fulfill the just requirements of the law on behalf of all who would offer Him, the perfect Lamb, as their sacrifice of atonement for their sin.  By His sacrifice, we have been set free from the power of sin and its resulting curse of spiritual death.

&quot;For the law of the Spirit of life in Yeshua the Messiah has made me free from the law of sin and death&quot;

It is not the Law (the Torah) that we are set free from, but the righteous retribution of the law upon us.  The 'law' of 'sin and death' is the principle, which operates as a result of the broken Law. (Romans 8: 2)

===THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE===
Now, the Law is written on our heart by the Spirit of Yahweh.
&quot;For this is the covenant that I will make with the House of Israel after those days, saith Yahweh; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a  people.&quot;  (Hebrews 8:10)  See also 2 Corinthians 3:2-3

The Law being engraved on our heart and our minds means that it comes forth from our hearts and our own minds. It is within us. It has changed from being a code of ethics engraved on tablets of stone to being engraved on our hearts, so that the knowledge of God is within through His Word which has been internalised, and we don't need to be taught to know Him, we know Him in our heart.  (Hebrews 8:11)
    
It is no longer the letter of the Law but the Spirit of the Law, for the &quot;letter kills&quot; but the &quot;Spirit gives life&quot;.   Therefore we live spontaneously out of the &quot;newness of the Spirit&quot; instead of the &quot;oldness of the letter&quot; and in that sense we are dead to the law.  We are dead to the external written law through the internal law written on our hearts.   Romans 7: 4-6;  2 Corinthians 3: 6

Living from the Spirit brings liberty. James referred to the Law in the new covenant as the 'law of liberty' which comes from obedience to the internalised Word.

&quot;But whoso looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.&quot;    (James 1:25)

We need to discern that we are new creations (beholding our reflection in Him - the mirror v.23) and live out from the internalised law within by the Spirit, and not from the old nature of knowing what is right and wrong from an intellectual knowledge of the Law. (James 1:22-24)

As Paul said,  &quot;But IF you are led of the SPIRIT, you are NOT under the LAW&quot;  (Galatians 5:18)

If we are led of the Spirit then we are living from the imparted life of Yeshua Who fulfilled the Law/Torah of the Father (His principles) in perfect love toward the Father firstly,  and secondly toward man.
IF we walk in this manner, we are not under the dominion of the Law and its retribution. We are walking as He walked, by the summation of the whole Law   --  &quot;You shall love Yahweh your God with all .. .. .. ..
and your neighbour as yourself&quot; 

This is living from the tree of Life and liberty as opposed to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The freedom of the Spirit, as compared to the bondage of the letter of the Law.

===WALKING IN THE LAW OF LOVE===
Being led of the Spirit of Yahweh will always be in harmony with the Law, it will never cause us to act lawlessly in a manner that is contrary to the principles of the written Law, His Word.  Galatians 5:18
&quot;You shall love Yahweh your God with all .. .. .. ..   and your neighbour as yourself&quot;
 
&quot;Owe no man any thing, but to LOVE one another:  for he that LOVES another has Fulfilled the LAW...  LOVE does no harm to his neighbour: therefore LOVE is the Fulfilment of the LAW.&quot;   Romans 13:8, 10 

(This is the 'Law'  of the ten commandments see verse 9)

&quot;For ALL THE LAW is fulfilled in one word. even in this;  
You shall LOVE your neighbour as yourself.&quot; (Galatians 5:14)

If you act in LOVE then you will never do anything to harm your neighbor!  There are 613 Laws in the Old Testament!   Yet if you offend ONE of them you are guilty of ALL!   We are FREE from the penalty of the law, yet that is not a license to sin (James 2:8-13).

Liberty is not freedom to abort Yahweh's principles for living - His Torah,  rather it is an incentive to take full advantage of the redemption that we have from the curse that comes from the broken law and as Paul continues to exhort the Roman believers,   &quot;But put on the Lord, (the nature of) Yeshua the Messiah and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.&quot;  (Romans 13:14)

The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us, as we obey it  (Romans 8:4-7). We fulfill the law by being observant to it, just as Yeshua Himself did. We need to 'put on' Yeshua who was the complete embodiment of the Law,  the fulfillment of it in mortal flesh, and by an act of faith, put to death all of our own desires that are of the natural man and make no provision to fulfill the lusts thereof  (Romans 14:13). Wherever we fall short of its righteous standards, we know that we have an Advocate with the Father who intercedes on our behalf   (1 John 2:1).

We are to live a 'crucified' life and not one where we need His grace to cover our sins.  We are to live a life in the resurrection power of Yeshua. The reason that it is not a reality in the lives of God's people is for the very reason that they are taught the erroneous 'not under law' doctrine, of God's 'grace' covering for their sinful state of falling short of His standard. All that falls short of His righteous standard is SIN (Romans 3:23).

God's people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.  They do not understand the power of the crucifixion to put to death the old nature and the power that is given us in Yeshua. Knowing the truth sets you free to live in the power of His life.

We can keep the righteous demands of the law by the power of His life if we have a healthy fear of Yahweh God and not a complacent presumption on His grace.

We are exhorted to &quot;Pursue peace with all, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord: looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God&quot;  (Hebrews 12:14)

To not walk in love and holiness is to be in danger of falling short of God's grace.Those who do fall short are not aware of it, as they are not in fellowship with Him.

Remember, Yeshua's words of warning to those who thought they were accepted and did many things in His name.  He said He would say unto them in that day, 

&quot;I never knew you&quot;   (Matthew 7:18-23)

&quot;If the righteous one is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?&quot;   (1 Peter 4:18)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE FUNCTION OF LAW &amp; GRACE===
It has been taught that Yahweh's law has been done away with, made obsolete, a veritable burden and of little practical use to the new-covenant believer. The doctrine that Yahweh's law is abolished and no longer of any practical use to the believer is a pervasive one based on Replacement Theology.  But, the moral, ethical, spiritual laws of God have never been annulled. suspended, cancelled or done away with.   It is an erroneous teaching that &quot;the Law has been done away with&quot; and that now we are &quot;under grace&quot;.

===THE BASIS OF THE NEW COVENANT===
The new covenant is &quot;BY FAITH - that it might be by grace&quot; as Paul teaches in Romans 4:16.  However it is taking what Paul said out of context to say we are &quot;not under Law but under grace&quot;.  This teaching amounts to a license to sin, to not having to attain to the standard of holiness of Yeshua's life.

&quot;What shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?   Certainly not!   How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?  (Romans 6: 1-2)

If the Law was done away and grace was extended to abound and cover all our shortfall, then Yeshua died in vain,  for Paul teaches that we were buried with Him in baptism to arise and walk in &quot;newness of life&quot;.
&quot;For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection.&quot;  (Romans 6:3- 5)

Our old man was crucified with Him, that  &quot;the body of sin might be done away with&quot; (Romans 6:6)

Because He died once for sin for all mankind, death now no longer has any dominion, because sin, which is the cause of death, has been atoned for - in Him.    Paul then says,  &quot;Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Yeshua the Messiah&quot;   (Romans 6:11)

Dead to sin  -  but alive to God!

&quot;Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.&quot; (v.12)

It is a question of what we yield to as to the quality of life which we live,  and not that we are functioning under a &quot;grace&quot; principle that covers all.    See verses 13, 16-19

&quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace&quot; (v.14)

This is the context of being &quot;under grace&quot;  --  sin not having dominion over us,  because we are under the covenant enacted through His grace.    We are not under the Law covenant which was made at Sinai which we could not keep.   It is the covenant that was established on the basis of grace.  His &quot;grace&quot; is His enabling power through the Holy Spirit and was extended toward us who were unrighteous,  and who did not qualify for righteousness by having obeyed the Law. By His grace He imparted righteousness to us.

It is the entrance into the covenant is based upon grace. We accepted the sacrifice of Yeshua by faith to atone for our sins.   Instead of taking an unblemished lamb to the priest, we now, in the new covenant,  take Yeshua as the Lamb of God and present His sacrifice to the Father, on the basis that He made atonement for us. So now IF we should sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, who officiates on our behalf, when we present His blood as a token of the covenant.    See 1 John 2:1; 1:7-9

===BEING DEAD TO THE LAW===
Paul goes on in his discussion in Romans 7 to say that we have become &quot;dead to the law through the body of Messiah&quot;  (v.4) and that we have been &quot;delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by,  so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter&quot;  (v.6)

We have been delivered from the law because we have died to that which held us bound in it. What did we die to that held us bound under the law?  It was the old nature!

We buried the 'old man' in baptism,  which was our fallen nature,  and we became dead to the Law through the body of Messiah.  By all that His body which was sacrificed for us represents,  we were set free from the Law's penalty.  The Law requires one to keep it entirely.   If you offend in one point you are guilty of all, so no one born after Adam could keep it in their fallen state except Yeshua. He kept the Law and then He paid the penalty for us breaking the Law,  and substituted both His death and His life for us.  His death paid the price for our default of the Law,  and His life is given to us at baptism to enable us now keep the Law.  e are now joined in union to Him by the Spirit and thereby have been delivered from the obligation to keep the &quot;letter&quot; of the Law. We fulfill it by the Spirit of Messiah living through us by our 'marriage' union to Him.  We are serving God now in the &quot;newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter&quot;  (Romans 7:6)  This is how we are delivered from the Law, by His body which was given for us.

This is verified in Paul's earlier statement, &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith?   Certainly not!   On the contrary, we establish the law.&quot; (Romans 3:31)

The law is established because we can keep it. It is not abolished or made useless or ineffective.
VOID  --  KATAGEO   usually translated 'abolish'.   Vines expository Dictionary says  &quot;to reduce to inactivity&quot; and Youngs Concordance gives &quot;to make thoroughly useless or idle&quot;   i.e. it is not abolished or inoperative.

&quot;For not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God,  but the doers of the law will be justified&quot;

&quot;in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Yeshua the Messiah according to my gospel.&quot; The gospel Paul was preaching was of doing  the Law in regard to which all shall be judged. Rom.2:13,16

We shall be judged by the Law (Romans 2:12). So our being dead to the Law is in regard to walking according to the letter of the Law and the retribution that it brings when broken. We died (the old nature), and now Messiah lives in us to enable us to keep the law by His Spirit.

===THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW===
A knowledge of the Law is necessary because Yahweh's law defines sin.  It tells us what is right and what is wrong.  The Bible says:
&quot;What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  Certainly not.   On the contrary, I would not have known sin, except through the law: for I would not have known covetousness, unless the law had said, You shalt not covet.&quot;   (Romans 7:7)

Paul is questioning  &quot;Is the Law sin?&quot;.    To sin is to fall short of the standard, in this case, does the Law fall short of God's standard?  Is it inferior?   The answer is &quot;No!&quot;

Paul says that the Law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good. (Romans 7:12)    He also says that the Law is spiritual  (Romans 7:14).    In no way does the Law itself fall short of being pure, holy, justified and also being spiritual in nature.   The problem is not with the Law, it is with us and our sinful nature which is not pure and holy and good - see Ch.7:8-20;   Psalm 19: 7-8

&quot;What purpose then does the law serve?   It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels in the hand of a mediator&quot; (Galatians 3:19)
The promise was made to Abraham and fulfilled in the Messiah, and until He came,  the law was given to reveal sin, as sin to us. 
   
&quot;But  before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed.  Therefore the law is our tutor to bring us to Messiah, that we might be justified by faith.   But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.&quot;  (Galatians 3:23-25)
TUTOR  -- PAIDAGOGOS   Youngs Concordance  - &quot;child conductor&quot;  Vines Expository gives - &quot;a guide, a guardian or trainer of boys, lit. a child-leader&quot; rendered sometimes as 'instructor'.   It was the role of a boy-servant who took children to school and taught them how to live.   

The Law was our instructor of God's principles, of how to live.  Without it we would not have the knowledge of sin, and without its revelation of sin we would not be conscious of the need of salvation.
&quot;For by the law is the knowledge of sin&quot;   (Romans 3:20)

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This is a '''sample game of chess''', recorded in standard algebraic chess notation, and accompanied by commentary.

White has the first move, and therefore a significant initiative.  White wins 10% more often than Black simply on the power of that initiative.  It is important not to squander the opening advantage with a move that does nothing.

=====1. [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4|e4]]=====

White chooses an excellent move, common among beginners and experts alike.
The move has several advantages.
#It stakes out territory in the center.  Whichever player controls the center with pawns will probably be able to find good squares for his pieces.
#It opens a diagonal for the king's bishop to move out and attack, which also facilitates king side castling
#It opens a diagonal for the queen to move out and attack.

This move accomplishes the two most important concepts of any opening move: 1. Develop a piece, or facilitate the development of a piece, and 2. Control the center.

=====1[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5|... e5]]=====

This move for Black is good for the same reasons listed above.
Note that the two e-file pawns are not threatening to capture each other, because pawns capture diagonally.
Instead they merely block each other until something breaks the logjam.
(However, a better choice would have been 1[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c5|... c5]], the Sicilian Defense, because it creates a less balanced game and denies White free rein.)

=====2. [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3|Nf3]]=====

White makes another fine move.
White is mobilizing forces by bringing a knight forward into attack position.
Because the white knight is attacking black's e pawn, white is maintaining the initiative by forcing black to react.  So now black's choice of moves are restricted to moves that defend the pawn or he might lose the pawn.  The initiative may appear to offer a slight edge but at the hands of a master it can be deadly.

White could have moved out the queen instead, but that would be dangerous.
The queen is too valuable to trade for any other piece (unless you can trade it for the enemy queen or at least the equivalent, such as two bishops and two pawns, three bishops, or a rook, a bishop, and a pawn, for instance,) so it can't do much by itself unless the opponent carelessly leaves pieces unprotected.  So your opponent can keep attacking your queen with different pieces.  And while you are simply moving your queen around, your opponent will be able to keep developing his pieces.
It is better to wait until there are other pieces in the fray which can serve as shock troops for her. 

White also could have moved out the king's side bishop.



That would not be a bad idea, but it isn't clear yet whether the bishop wants to be at c4, b5, or possibly even behind the pawns.
The knight, on the other hand, usually goes to f3 anyway, because the other squares it could move to are inferior.
On h3 it would not attack the center, and on e2 it would be temporarily in the way.

=====2[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...f6|... f6?]]=====

Black makes a worthless move, entering the infamous Damiano Defense.
Black needed to defend his pawn with either 2...[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...Nc6|Nc6]] (main line) or 2...[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...d6|d6]] (Philidor Defense), or counter-attack White's pawn with 2...[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...Nf6|Nf6]] (Petrov's Defense). If Black felt brave, he could also venture into the murky waters of 2...[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...f5|f5]] (Latvian Gambit) or 2...[[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...d5|d5]] (Elephant Gambit).
Either knight move would maintain the balance of the game by contesting the center.

The move 2...f6 appears to defend the threatened e-pawn, but this is an illusion, as the game shall demonstrate.
Black has weakened the kingside, allowing attacks on the f7 square, which is protected by nothing other than the king itself.  This is called &quot;opening the door,&quot; and this must be taken advantage of.

Black has failed to follow the principles here without any compensation.  He has affected the center, but the move 2. ...d6 would have done and gained some control in the queen side.  Also he has not developed a piece nor has he facilitated the development of a piece.  2. ...Nc6 develops and gains control in the center, 2. ...d6 gains some control on the c8-h3 diagonal and facilitates the development of the light-squared bishop.  Black has also weakened his kingside.  Any pawn moves in front of a castled king can be useful weaknesses for the opponent.  Since pawns cannot go backwards you should be very cautious of any pawn moves on the side you wish to castle on (usually the kingside).

The moves 2...f5 and 2...d5 seem to not adhere to the principles.  Why have these moves been brought up?  The fact is the best moves in a position will sometimes break principles, but they will offer compensation for whatever gains are lost by not following the principle.  So in a sense the principles tell us what questions to ask ourselves when making a move, such as &quot;Should I develop now?&quot;  So it is important to understand the principles in order to decide if you are getting enough compensation.  It is very bad to blindly do whatever the principles dictate.

=====3. Nxe5=====

White attacks immediately, ''sacrificing'' the white knight for two pawns, although generally White would need three pawns for the knight to have material equality. Before making this sacrifice, White has to calculate to make sure he is going to gain something that compensates for the lost material. In this case, as the following moves show, White knows that he will gain an attack on the enemy king, forcing Black to either surrender more material or allow checkmate.

=====3... fxe5?=====

Black makes the only move consistent with 2...f6, but it is not best.
The best try for an equal game was 3...Qe7, ''skewering'' White's knight, pawn, and king.
That is to say, the queen would indirectly be attacking everything in the e-file.
After the knight moved away, the queen could take on e4 with check, regaining the pawn. White would, however, have a large advantage because of his lead in development and Black's weakened kingside pawn structure, e.g. 4.Nf3 Qxe4+ 5.Be2, likely followed by 0-0 and Nc3 (attacking the queen).

Retaking the knight now merely invites White's queen to jump into the fray with check.
The fact that Black cannot afford to take the knight shows that 2...f6 did not really protect the pawn at all.

=====4. Qh5+=====

The game's first check!  There are three legal ways to respond to check:
#Capture the piece giving check.  Here this is impossible, as Black has nothing which can move to h5.
#Interpose a piece between the king and the piece giving check.  Black could play 4...g6.  But that would lose a rook to 5.Qxe5+ and 6.Qxh8.
#Move the king out of check.  Moving the king to f7 leaves it in check, and is thus illegal, so e7 is the only square for moving out of check.

Note that White has forked the king on e8 and the pawn on e5.
There is no time for Black to protect both, so no matter what Black does to get out of check, White's queen can take on e5.

=====4... Ke7=====

This move leaves Black in a dangerous position, because the black king is so exposed.
Furthermore, the black rooks, bishops, and queen still have no way to get out.
The Black position is no more developed than it was at the start of the game.

=====5. Qxe5+=====

Another check.
Black now has only one legal move.
Black can't interpose anything between the king and queen, and can't take the queen, so the black king must be moved out of check.
There is only one square next to Black's king which White's queen is not attacking.

=====5... Kf7=====

Black moves the King, it's the only available move to play. White's queen is a dangerous attacker.
However, because it is too valuable to trade for anything, it can only take undefended pieces.
Everything in Black's camp is defended by something, so the queen has done all it can do by itself.
It is time to bring in reinforcements.

=====6. Bc4+=====

This is an excellent move to keep the pressure on Black because it develops a piece and gives check while preventing Black from consolidating.

If White played less energetically with 6.Nc3, the advantage would evaporate instantly.
Black could answer with 6...Be7, giving the king room to retreat to f8.
Once Black gets his king to safety, Black might actually be winning.
White has only two pawns for the sacrificed knight, which leaves White at a material disadvantage.

=====6.... d5!=====

Black makes an excellent defensive move.
Never forget that moving the king isn't the only way to get out of check!

Admittedly, Black's d-pawn is a dead duck.
It is attacked by White's bishop, queen, and pawn, three times altogether, while it is defended only once, by Black's queen.
The sacrifice is worthwhile, though, to open up lines for the queen and bishop so they can help with the defense.
Now if White fails to find the best continuation, Black has some chance to counter-attack.

=====7. Bxd5+=====

White gives check yet again, which prevents Black from doing anything constructive.
Let's review the three ways to get out of check:
#Capture the piece giving check.  Black could play 7...Qxd5.  But White would simply take queen with 8.Qxd5+.  With such a huge material disadvantage and an exposed king, Black could resign without feeling like a quitter.
#Interpose a piece.  Black could play 7...Be6.  But that would be inadvisable, because the bishop would be defended only once (by Black's king) and attacked twice (by White's queen and bishop).  In fact, White could end the game at once with 8.Qxe6#
#Move the king.  Alas, the only square which is not under attack by White is g6, even further into the open.  It beats the alternatives, though.

 |pl|pl|pl|pl|  |pl|pl|pl|=
 |rl|nl|bl|  |kl|  |  |rl|=

|25}}&lt;/div&gt;

=====7... Kg6=====

Now White must think of a way to continue the attack.
White would like to play 8.Qf5+, driving Black's king to h6 where it can be cornered and checkmated, but Black's c8 bishop is guarding the square f5.
If Black hadn't interposed with 6...d5, Black would now be subject to a forced checkmate.
As it stands White has to be more creative to keep the initiative.

 |rl|nl|bl|  |kl|  |  |rl|=

|25}}&lt;/div&gt;
=====8. h4=====

Again White finds a strong continuation.
White is threatening to force the Black king to h6 after all with h5+.
Also the pawn protects the g5 square which is important in some mating combinations.
Finally, there is some chance the rook will be able to join the attack down the h-file.

|25}}&lt;/div&gt;
=====8... h5=====

Black plays a tenacious defense in a precarious situation.
White's pawn is blocked from further advances, and the king has a new escape square on h7.
Black's position is still precarious, but there is no immediate way for White to force checkmate.

Now let us take a step deeper into chess reasoning.
White knows Black is on the run for the moment, but if Black has a chance to regroup, the game is far from over.
Three pawns for the sacrificed knight is roughly material equality.

If White brings additional forces forward with 9.Nc3 or 9.d4, the obvious developing moves, Black will harass White's queen with 9...Bd6.  That would force White to lose time protecting the queen.  Black would gain time to get the black pieces out and get the black king to safety.

White desperately wants a quick kill, but can't see how to get it.
White is annoyed that Black's bishop on c8 prevents White from playing 9.Qf5+ and administering the coup de grace.
Therefore White asks the question, &quot;What if Black's bishop were not on c8?
If only that annoyance were removed, I could do great things.&quot;

=====9. Bxb7=====

White finds a forceful continuation that puts Black in dire straits.
Black's best bet now is to ignore White's bishop and harass White's queen with 9...Bd6, but then White calmly plays 10.Qa5, maintaining the threat on f5 and forcing Black to lose material.  One possible line of play is 9...Bd6, 10.Qa5 Nc6, 11.Bxc6 Rb8.  The checkmate has been avoided, but now White has a large material advantage (four extra pawns) and can win slowly and surely with patient developing moves like 12.Nc3.

(Note that after 9...Bd6, 10.Qa5 Black cannot play Bxb7 because of 11.Qf5+, with the same play as in the main variation below.)

As it happens, Black does not understand the danger.  Black grabs the bishop for a material advantage of Black's (bishop plus knight versus four pawns) and suffers the consequences.

=====9... Bxb7?=====

A weak move, allowing White's attack to break through. (A stronger alternative, although still bad for Black, is 9...Bd6 attacking the Queen and developing the Bishop, but White can reply 10.Qa5 as discussed in the note to White's prior move.) This is Black's critical error. From here on, White has a forced mate.

=====10... Kh6=====

=====11. d4+=====

White continues the attack with a special kind of check, a ''discovered check''.
White moves a pawn, but it isn't the pawn which gives check.
It is White's bishop, attacking from its home square, which delivers the blow.

Note that Black's king has no legal moves, and White's bishop is safe from capture, so interposition is the only option.  But because it ''is'' an option, this is not, yet, checkmate.

=====11... g5=====

At this point White has an easy win with 12.Bxg5+ Kg7 13.Bxd8.
The material advantage of a queen and five pawns for a bishop and a knight is overwhelming.
However, weak players have been known to play on in completely hopeless positions rather than resign.
In order to forestall a long, boring mop-up operation, White looks for a direct kill.

=====12... Qe7=====

Nothing can save Black now short of White forgetting the plan, but there is some logic to Black's move.
Where can White's queen go?
Any of Black's pieces it could take are protected.
If White trades queens, then the attack is over, and Black is winning.
Finally, if White's queen simply retreats, Black will strike back with check: 13...Qxe4+!

But White must have foreseen this possibility, or White would never have played 12.Qf7 instead of 12.Bxg5+.

=====13. hxg5+=====

White plays a Zwischenzug, checking Black's king and destroying Black's pawn majority.
Black can't get out of this check by interposition or by moving the king away.
All retreat is cut off by White's well-placed queen.
The only option is to capture the checking piece.

=====14. Rxh5#=====

Checkmate.  Black can't interpose anything, because the rook is giving check from an adjacent square.
Black's king can't move away, because White's queen covers all retreat squares.
Black's king can't capture the rook, because then it would be in check from White's queen.
Finally, Black's queen can't capture White's rook because it is pinned. If it moved away, White's bishop on c1 would be giving check to Black's king.

Notice that, although material considerations are very important in chess thinking, one doesn't win by having the most pieces.
One wins by delivering checkmate.
White was behind in material almost the entire game, including in the final position, but came away with the victory nonetheless.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to validate a document using an XML Schema.

== Method ==

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note: Validation is a very complex topic.  eXist come with default setting that may prevent files from being added that are associated with a namespace once a schema is saved in the registry.  Please be aware of these factors that are documented [http://www.exist-db.org/validation.html here].
&lt;/font&gt;

eXist support a validation module that includes a '''validate()''' function to validate an XML file against a grammer file such as an XML Schema.

&lt;code&gt;
   validation:validate($input-doc as item(), $schema-uri as xs:anyURI) as xs:boolean
&lt;/code&gt;

where:
'''$input-doc''' is the document you want to validate
'''$schema-uri''' is a URI to the XML Schema you want to use to validate the document.  Note that this must be of type xs:anyURI.

This function return a single true/fales value which is true if the document is valid according to the XML Schema.

== Sample Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $doc :=
&lt;root&gt;
   &lt;element&gt;test&lt;/element&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;

let $schema := '/db/test/validate/schema.xsd'

(: you must run this every time the XML Schema file changes! :)
let $clear := validation:clear-grammar-cache()

let $result :=
if (validation:validate($doc, $schema))
  then &quot;PASS&quot;
  else &quot;FAIL&quot;
  
return
&lt;results&gt;
   {$result}
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XML Schema ==

Here is a sample XML Schema to validate a very small XML file.  In eXist 1.3 only XML files with a namespace are supported.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xs:schema 
   xmlns=&quot;http://example.com&quot; 
   xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
   targetNamespace=&quot;http://example.com&quot; 
   elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:element name=&quot;root&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
                &lt;xs:element name=&quot;my-data&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
    &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are two important points about this XML Schema.

The '''targetNamespace=&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;''' attribute indicates that this XML Schema is targeting the &lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; namespace.


The '''elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;''' attribute indicates that as the XML parser reads the root of the file, the target namespace should be used.

Without these two attributes the validation will not work.

== Sample XML file to be Validated ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root xmlns=&quot;http://example.com&quot;&gt;
    &lt;my-data&gt;test&lt;/my-data&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Getting Error Messages ==
The validate() function only returns a simple boolean true/false value.  If there is an error in your XML file this function is not very useful at finding the errors.  To assist with this process their is another function called '''validate-report()'''.  It has the same arguments:

validation:validate-report($input-doc, $schema-uri)

The result can be modified to be the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $result :=
 if ( validation:validate($input-doc, $schema-uri) )
   then &quot;The XML File is Valid&quot;
   else (
      &quot;The XML File is Not Valid&quot;,
      validation:validate-report($input-doc, $schema-uri)
   )
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a library of XML Schemas that you want to associate with namespaces.

== Method ==
An XML Catalog file contains a list of URIs and the files use to validate them.

For example the following is a catalog file that describes how DocBook files should be validated:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;catalog xmlns=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog&quot;&gt;
   &lt;public publicId=&quot;-//OASIS//DTD XML DocBook V4.1.2//EN&quot;
   uri=&quot;/db/grammar/docbook.dtd&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;uri name=&quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/docbook/&quot;
   uri=&quot;/db/grammar/docbook.dtd /&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

I removed the warning (not realizing I wasn't logged in).  Per the notes from the person who copied from wp-&gt;ws, the page you think this infringes is just a copy of this page.  That all checked out at the time, and I don't see any evidence of copyright. -[[User:Sanbeg|Sanbeg]] ([[User talk:Sanbeg|talk]]) 15:44, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:The Wikipedia page was created after the modification date of the Geocities page.  Therefore, the Wikipedia page copied from Geocities, not the other way around.  There is no licensing information on the Geocities page and so the placement of the content on a site that is GFDL/CC licensed is assigning a license to content without a statement from the original author authorizing such action. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:49, 29 July 2009 (UTC)
:: OK, it looks weirder than I thought.  So your author does claim to have scanned it himself as part of a PD documentation project [http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/5865/qldoc.html] So it looks like the osnews had that backwards, but I wouldn't call it a copyvio of the PD pagescan.  But I'm not sure how a pagescan would end up in PD, since the publication is apparently defunct, and I don't know anything about it. -[[User:Sanbeg|Sanbeg]] ([[User talk:Sanbeg|talk]]) 20:49, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

\multiply &lt;register&gt;  by &lt;integer&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
The form &lt;register&gt; must be a register that contains either a number, dimension, or glue; and &lt;integer&gt; is any integer. The value in &lt;register&gt; is multiplied by &lt;integer&gt; and the result is stored in &lt;register&gt; overwriting the original value. In the case of glue, all three parts are multiplied by &lt;integer&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
\divide &lt;register&gt;  by &lt;nonzero-integer&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
The form &lt;register&gt; must be a register that contains either a number, dimension, or glue; and &lt;nonzero-integer&gt; is any integer except zero. The value in &lt;register&gt; is divided by &lt;nonzero-integer&gt; and the result is stored in &lt;register&gt; overwriting the original value. When both numerator and denominator are integer valued, the division is modular. In the case of glue, all three parts are divided by &lt;nonzero-integer&gt;.

==Content from Wikipedia==
If you want to use a page from Wikipedia as a basis for a page in a book on Wikibooks, please request that it be imported at [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]] in order to preserve the edit history.  This way attribution is given to the original authors and you don't give the appearance that you're trying to claim the content as your own work.  I merged [[w:Messier object]] into [[Messier Index]] for you, but please leave requests on the above page in the future. Thanks.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:36, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

Thanks. Did you also add that template requesting expansion? If so, is there a template that states that the book is being currently worked on? Just wondering, I figure it would be more correct. (:Smile:) [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 15:50, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

== [[Messier Index]] ==

I've finished importing the pages you requested for this book.  I am curious as to what you're planning to do with them all.  What will this be a textbook on?  How will you differentiate the pages from those already on Wikipedia?  Those are certain questions you have to ask yourself when thinking about the future of that book.  Happy editing. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:45, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I am going to summerize them into a guide on Deep Sky Objects. As you can see on the intro, they were found without a telescope (I think). I won't import any more till I see how this one turns out. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 11:16, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

== Authorship ==
Hi, I reverted one change you made, since you added yourself to the author's list of a book was inappropriate, please read [[Wikibooks:Ownership]]. Any edits you do are kept on the history logs of pages so any work you do on any given project is preserved. Authors (or licensors) must be preserved on that page since they are the ones altering the rights over that work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:30, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

:This has backfired on you, read [[Wikibooks:Ownership]] [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 10:50, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

::How did you get that idea?
::Content contributions (you haven't made none to that particular book), aren't all copyrightable. A phrase, a format edit a correction of spelling, deletions, moving around of content don't constitutes relevant creative input. Even if they are nevertheless important contributions they don't provide ownership.
::As an example, you can grab complete phrases from other works were you don't own any rights and add them to another work, in this case you also aren't creating nothing by yourself, but you added real content... (This can be done but with extreme moderation, morally you should also include a reference from where you did your coping)
::The next thing of relevance is than only those that own the rights can grant them under a license (and defend their own rights), for instance if someone would copy the book and relicense it (or remove the license) only the copyright holder could initiate the necessary legal action.
::See also [[US Copyright Law]]...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:55, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

:::You have no ownership above anyone else. &quot;By saving, you agree to irrevocably release your contribution under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL. You agree to be credited by re-users, at minimum, through a hyperlink or URL to the page you are contributing to. See the Terms of Use for details.&quot; (taken from under the edit box). &quot;If you do not want your writing to be edited and redistributed at will, then do not submit it here. If you did not write this yourself, it must be available under terms consistent with the Terms of Use, and you agree to follow any relevant licensing requirements.&quot; (this is under the save button) You cannot copyright it if you put it on wikibooks. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 20:16, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

::::Ownership does not equate as strict editorial control over the work (at least not as yet in the US, authors have some more control on the rest of the world). More a majority of the work was contributed under only the GFDL even some of the other works used with license were only under the GFDL. &lt;s&gt;Wikimedia hasn't as yet clarified the position&lt;/s&gt; on this regard, only authors or Wikimedia as the published (and due the addendum to the last version of the GFDL can change the licenses and not to a dual licenses version). The GFDL and the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 aren't compatible.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:10, 8 August 2009 (UTC)
::::&quot;You cannot copyright it if you put it on wikibooks.&quot; this is wrong. As I stated above owners of content are only granting a license over their work, not giving away ownership of it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:17, 8 August 2009 (UTC)
::::But you did have a point (not particularly on the dual licensing). Wikimedia has a statement now included on the bottom of every Wikibook page. The GFDL has been dropped (even if contributions can continue to be dual licensed) with no real advantage since works under only the GFDL can't be used, so supporting the GFDL has no advantage. Prior to this new alteration. (I had started a discussion on the subject on the general discussion area.)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:31, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I think you are redifining &quot;By saving, you agree to irrevocably release your contribution under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0&quot; Works like this '''are not copyrighted''' (repeat 50 times). They are free content. They are copylefted. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 01:36, 9 August 2009 (UTC)
:No. All creative works are copyrighted, by international agreement, unless either they fall into the public domain or their copyright is explicitly disclaimed. The GFDL and the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License are only distribution licenses, the owner grands the rights to use and destribute (under certain circumstances). Ownership of content is preserved, hence the clauses each license has to list authors (or copyright owners) as granting that right away (irrevocably) means once given the author can't remove the right for that content but can still sell or distribute the content under other licenses. The owner can do whatever he likes with his material and he is the only one that can defend his rights over it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:50, 9 August 2009 (UTC)
:Free content (Public domain or similar) is not the same as copyleft, GFDL or CC-ASAL. The last 3 licenses even if similar in spirit aren't even compatible among themselves due to the requirements the owner makes to the user...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:06, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

Copyleft is a way of using of the copyright on the program. It doesn't mean abandoning the copyright; in fact, doing so would make copyleft impossible. (From http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/ ).&lt;br&gt;
This is why the GPL (not GFDL) requests that if possible you put the rights in the hand of the Free Software Foundation since only the owner of the right can defend that the work stays free.&lt;br&gt;
Anyway your understanding or viewpoint is not something new or unexpected most people only think about such things when they have made some effort that they wish to be recognized or compensated for. But lets reverse the situation consider that you just have added a huge number of your own creative work lets simplify this as images, ok now if you really did put it on the public domain or similar how would you defend your right to get attribution for those same images (I could just take them and say I had created them, even going to the limits that if no historial existed that you had released it into the public domain, I could even prevent you and others from using it), this has happen...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:20, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

PS: The click-through is just a protection scheme for Wikimedia the publisher (since most of the users are anonymous), it doesn't go much beyond that, it just protects them from legal attacks (contributors and content owners can still get into trouble).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:26, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

In the last several responses, you were right. But, there is no need of an authorship page, since everyone that makes a spelling correction could have copyrighted the page if he didn't release it to CC-by-SA. You're whole concept of wikibooks is wrong. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 11:22, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

:It is up to the author to decide if he wants to establish his ownership and clearly state the terms of his contributions. This is supported by the license (GFDL or CC-ASAL) and by the publisher (Wikimedia). This is a requirement if a need arises to defend the execution of the licenses.
:The notion that the history logs can serve to determine who contributed content is flawed, it can help but extracting any useful information from them would be very hard.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:38, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

::I have decided to establish my ownership. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 21:24, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

:::It is your right to claim your work as your own, it enables you to protect it (as discussed above), gives you recognition for what you have done and is a requirement if a need arises to change or add to a previous license. As you contribute significative content to a work you should do it. One other aspect is that by making such claim and depending on the rights you then invoke on the work, or because of the content added, an author (or any one that claims ownership of a work) is also liable to legal actions if the claims are false or other rights are infringed. 
:::The problem of the history logs is that not every edit made to a page can be copyrighted, spell checking, reformatting (moving text, deleting or even merging other peoples content isn't adding you own work), it can even become lost as text is moved into other pages and pages are deleted over time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:39, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

::::The admins can always see all the logs, even before the page was deleted. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 14:17, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

:::::There is no way to automate all the processing needed to gather useful information from them. Even if the last updates that provide an idea on what was done on that edit action it is mostly useless. Consider reversal, vandalism, moving large bits of text from page to page, spelling and other maintenance edits.
:::::Consider Darklama's edits, I can assure you that on all his edits on the book, his own content shouldn't be above a phrase or two, yet if you examine the book's history logs (especially in pages created around the time he was contributing would give you another idea), doing a similar work from the start in all pages to all contributors would be futile.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:37, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

The '''Crab Nebula''' (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The nebula was first observed by John Bevis in 1731, and corresponds to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese and Arab astronomers in 1054. It is said that it was visible during the day for months, and remained visible at night for several years.

At X-ray and gamma-ray energies above 30 KeV, the Crab is generally the strongest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; eV.  
Located at a distance of about 6,500 light-years (2 kpc) from Earth, the nebula has a diameter of 11 light-years  (3.4 pc) and expands at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second.

At the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a rotating neutron star, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma-rays to radio waves with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.

The nebula acts as a source of radiation for studying celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's corona was mapped from observations of the Crab's radio waves passing through it, and more recently, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.

'''Messier 2''' or '''M2''' (also designated '''NGC 7089''') is a globular cluster in the constellation Aquarius, five degrees north of the star Beta Aquarii. It contains about 150,000 stars, including 21 known variable stars. Its brightest stars are red and yellow giants. The overall spectral type is F4.

Under extremely good conditions, it is just visible to the naked eye. Binoculars or small telescopes will identify this cluster as non-stellar, while larger telescopes will resolve individual stars, of which the brightest are of apparent magnitude 13.1. It is about 37,500 light-years away from Earth. At 175 light-years in diameter, it is one of the larger globular clusters known. The cluster is rich and compact. 

M2 was discovered by the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Maraldi in 1746 while observing a comet with Jacques Cassini. Charles Messier rediscovered it in 1760 but thought it a nebula without any stars associated with it. William Herschel was the first to resolve individual stars in the cluster, in 1794.

'''Messier 3''' (also known as ''M3''  or ''NGC 5272'') is a globular cluster in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, and resolved into stars by William Herschel around 1784.  This cluster is one of the largest and brightest, and is made up of around 500,000 stars. It is located at a distance of about 33,900 light-years away from Earth.  M3 has an apparent magnitude of 6.2, making it visible to the naked eye under dark conditions. From a moderate-sized telescope, the cluster is fully defined.

'''Messier 4''' or '''M4''' (also designated '''NGC 6121''') is a globular cluster in the constellation of Scorpius.  It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1746 and catalogued by Charles Messier in 1764. It was the first globular cluster in which individual stars were resolved.

[[Image:M4HunterWilsonNew.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Globular Cluster '''Messier 4''' - Courtesy Hunter Wilson]]

==Visibility==
M4 is conspicuous in even the smallest of telescopes as a fuzzy ball of light. It appears about the same size as the Moon in the sky. It is one of the easiest globular clusters to find, being located only 1.3 degrees west of the bright star Antares, with both objects being visible in a wide field telescope. Modestly sized telescopes will begin to resolve individual stars of which the brightest in M4 are of apparent magnitude 10.8.

==Characteristics==
M4 is a rather loosely concentrated cluster of class IX and measures 75 light years across. It features a characteristic &quot;bar&quot; structure across its core, visible to moderate sized telescopes.  The structure consists of 11th magnitude stars and is approximately 2.5' long and was first noted by William Herschel in 1783. At least 43 variable stars have been observed within M4.

M4 is approximately 7,200 light years away, the same distance as NGC 6397, making these the two closest globular clusters to our Solar System.

==Notable stars==
[[File:M4.jpg|thumb|left|White dwarf stars in M4]]

Photographs taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 have revealed white dwarf stars in M4 that are among the oldest known stars in the Milky Way Galaxy at an age of 13 billion years. One such white dwarf has been found to be a binary star with a pulsar companion, PSR B1620-26 and a planet orbiting it with a mass of 2.5 times that of Jupiter.

In 1987 a millisecond pulsar was discovered in M4 with a period of 3.0 milliseconds or about ten times faster than the Crab Pulsar.

'''Messier 5''' or '''M5''' (also designated '''NGC 5904''') is a [[globular cluster]] in the [[constellation]] [[Serpens]]. It was discovered by [[Gottfried Kirch]] in [[1702]]. It should not be confused with the much fainter and more distant globular cluster [[Palomar 5]], which is situated nearby in the sky.

__NOTOC__
==Discovery and visibility==
M5 is, under extremely good conditions, just visible to the naked eye as a faint &quot;star&quot; near the [[star]] 5 Serpentis. [[Binoculars]] or small [[telescope]]s will identify the object as non-stellar while larger telescopes will show some individual stars, of which the brightest are of [[apparent magnitude]] 12.2.

M5 was discovered by the [[Germany|German]] astronomer Gottfried Kirch in [[1702]] when he was observing a [[comet]]. [[Charles Messier]] also noted it in [[1764]], but thought it a nebula without any stars associated with it. [[William Herschel]] was the first to resolve individual stars in the cluster in [[1791]], counting roughly 200.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:m5--LRGB2 898x688.jpg|thumb|right|250px|M5 wide angle by Robert J. Vanderbei]]


Spanning 165 light-years in diameter, M5 is one of the larger globular clusters known. The [[gravity|gravitational]] sphere of influence of M5, (ie. the volume of space in which stars are gravitationally bound to it rather than being torn away by the [[Milky Way]]'s gravitational pull) has a radius of some 200 light-years.

At 13 billion [[year]]s old it, M5 is also one of the older globulars associated with the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. Its distance is about 24,500 light-years from [[Earth]] and the cluster contains more than 100,000 stars, as many as 500,000 according to some estimates.

==Notable stars==

kalpak stars in M5 are known to be [[variable star|variable]] in brightness, 97 of them belonging to the [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae]] type. RR Lyrae stars, sometimes referred to as ''&quot;Cluster Variables&quot;'', are somewhat similar to [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid type variables]] and as such can be used as a tool to measure distances in outer space since the relation between their luminosities and periods are well known. The brightest and most easily observed variable in M5 varies from magnitude 10.6 to 12.1 in a period of just under 26.5 days.

A [[dwarf nova]] has also been observed in this cluster.

The '''Butterfly Cluster''' (cataloged as '''Messier 6''' or '''M6''', and as '''NGC 6405''') is an [[w:open cluster]] of [[w:star]]s in the constellation of [[w:Scorpius]]. Its name derives from the vague resemblance of its shape to a [[w:butterfly]].

The first astronomer to record the Butterfly Cluster's existence was [[w:Giovanni Battista Hodierna]] in 1654. However, [[w:Robert Burnham, Jr]] has proposed that the 1st century astronomer [[w:Ptolemy]] may have seen it with the naked eye while observing its neighbor the [[w:Ptolemy Cluster]] (M7). [[w:Charles Messier]] catalogued the cluster as M6 in 1764.  It was not till the 20th century that star counts, distance, and other properties were measured.

==Characteristics==
Most of the bright stars in this cluster are hot, blue [[w:spectral type|B type]] stars but the brightest member is a [[w:K type]] orange [[w:giant star]], BM Scorpii, which contrasts sharply with its blue neighbours in photographs. BM Scorpii, is classed as a [[w:semiregular variable|semiregular]] [[w:variable star]], its brightness varying from [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] +5.5 to magnitude +7.0.  

Estimates of the Butterfly Cluster's distance have varied over the years, with a mean value of around 1,600 [[w:light year]]s, giving it a spatial dimension of some 12 light years.  Modern measurements show its total visual brightness to be magnitude 4.2.

'''Messier 7''' or '''M7''', also designated '''NGC 6475''' and sometimes known as known as the '''Ptolemy Cluster''', is an [[w:open cluster]] of [[w:star]]s in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Scorpius]]. 

The cluster is easily detectable with the [[w:naked eye]], close to the &quot;stinger&quot; of Scorpius. It has been known since [[w:antiquity]]; it was first recorded by the 1st century astronomer [[w:Ptolemy]], who described it as a [[w:nebula]] in 130 AD. [[w:Giovanni Batista Hodierna]] observed it before 1654 and counted 30 [[w:star]]s in it. [[w:Charles Messier]] catalogued the cluster in 1764 and subsequently included it in his list of [[w:comet]]-like objects as 'M7'. 

[[w:Telescope|Telescopic]] observations of the cluster reveal about 80 stars within a field of view of 1.3° across. At the cluster's estimated distance of 800-1000 [[w:light year]]s this corresponds to an actual diameter of 18-25 light years. The age of the cluster is around 220 million years while the brightest star is of [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 5.6.

The '''Lagoon Nebula''' (catalogued as '''[[w:Messier Object|Messier]] 8''' or '''M8''', and as '''NGC 6523''') is a giant [[w:interstellar cloud]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It is classified as an [[w:emission nebula]] and as an [[w:H II region]].

The Lagoon Nebula was discovered by [[w:Guillaume Le Gentil]] in 1747 and is one of only two star-forming [[w:nebula]]e faintly visible to the naked eye from mid-northern latitudes. Seen with [[w:binocular]]s, it appears as a distinct [[w:oval]] cloudlike patch with a definite core. A fragile [[w:star cluster]] appears superimposed on it.

==Characteristics==
The Lagoon Nebula is estimated to be 4,100 [[w:light-year]]s from the Earth. In the sky of Earth, it spans 90' by 40', translates to an actual dimension of 110 by 50 light years. Like many nebulas, it appears [[w:pink]] in time-exposure color photos but is gray to the eye peering through [[w:binoculars]] or a [[w:telescope]], [[w:human]] [[w:Visual perception|vision]] having poor color sensitivity at low light levels.

The nebula contains a number of [[w:Bok globule]]s - dark, collapsing clouds of protostellar material - the most prominent of which have been catalogued by [[w:Edward Emerson Barnard|E. E. Barnard]] as B88, B89 and B296. It also includes a funnel-like or [[w:tornado]]-like structure caused by a hot O-type star that pours out [[w:ultraviolet light]], heating and ionizing gases on the surface of the nebula. 

[[w:Image:Lagoon nebula SALT.jpg|left|thumb|Central region of the Lagoon Nebula, showing the Hourglass Nebula to the right]]

The Lagoon Nebula also contains at its centre a structure known as the &quot;Hourglass Nebula&quot; (so named by [[w:John Herschel]]), which should not be confused with the better known [[w:Hourglass Nebula]] in the constellation of [[w:Musca]]. In 2006 the first four [[w:Herbig-Haro object]]s were detected within the Hourglass, also including [[w:HH 870]]. This provides the first direct evidence of active star formation by accretion within it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariasetal2006&quot; /&gt;

'''Messier 9''' or '''M9''' (also designated '''NGC 6333''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Ophiuchus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1764]].

M9 is one of the nearer globular clusters to the center of the [[w:Milky Way Galaxy]] with a distance of around 5,500 [[w:light-year]]s. Its distance from [[w:Earth]] is 25,800 light-years.

The total [[w:luminosity]] of this cluster is around 120,000 times that of the [[w:Sun]], the [[w:absolute magnitude]] being -8.04. The brightest individual [[w:star]]s in M9 are of [[w:apparent magnitude]] 13.5, making them visible in moderately sized [[w:telescope]]s. There have been 13 [[w:variable star]]s found in M9.

Nearby, at about 80' to the northeast of M9 is the dimmer globular cluster [[w:NGC 6356]], while at about 80' to the southeast is the globular [[w:NGC 6342]].

{{commonscat|Messier 10}}

'''Messier 10''' or '''M10''' (also designated '''NGC 6254''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Ophiuchus]]. 

The object was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] on [[w:May 29]] [[w:1764]], who cataloged it as number 10 in [[w:Messier object|his list]]. He described it as a &quot;[[w:nebula]] without stars&quot;, but later study revealed it as a globular cluster of thousands of stars.

M10 has an apparent diameter of some 20 [[w:arcminutes]], about two-thirds of the [[w:apparent diameter]] of the [[w:Moon]]. Viewed through medium-sized [[w:telescope]]s it appears about half that size (8' to 9'), as its bright core is only 35 light-years across. M10 has a spatial [[w:diameter]] of 83 [[w:light-year]]s and is estimated to be 14,300 light-years away from Earth. Four [[w:variable star]]s have been discovered in this cluster.

The '''Wild Duck Cluster''' (also known as '''Messier 11''', or '''NGC 6705''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Scutum]]. It was discovered by [[w:Gottfried Kirch]] in 1681. [[w:Charles Messier]] included it in his catalogue in 1764.

The Wild Duck Cluster is one of the richest and most compact of the known open clusters, containing about 2900 [[w:star]]s. Its age has been estimated to about 220 million years.  Its name derives from the brighter stars forming a triangle which could represent a flying flock of [[w:duck]]s.

I liked the article and it was full of good information. Early intervention is great and has has much success in programs like Headstart. Preschools now focus on having the students ready for Kindergarten and public pre-k programs would be wonderful for those who cannot afford preschool. The problem is that we are panicking because students are not graduating high school. Somewhere after elementary school many students are not accounted for on graduation day.  What happened? Is the solution earlier education? I don't think so. So much emphasis is put on pre-k and kindergarten but if you spend some time in an elementary school you'll see that ther is a lot of parental involvement. Interaction between the parent, student, and teacher. Parents like to brag that their child is the best reader etc... but what happens in middle school is that parents are not encouraged to be involved and I think that is where many students either sink or swim. Same problem in High School.  I think we need to focus more on Middle and High schools because that is where they are dropping out whether they attended pre-k is irrelevant by then.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 04:55, 9 August 2009 (UTC) 

I work with preschoolers on a daily basis and I definately believe that it is a great early intervention.  I dissagreed with the article when it spoke about preschool as a problem area.  Preschool prepares young children for learning at an early age which can better prepare children for future learning.  If all children were enrolled in preschool at an early age it could make a teachers job easier in so many ways.  It is difficult teaching one lesson to a children while the rest of the children are ahead.  O agree that preschool is an important stage in a young child's life. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 23:10, 2 August 2009 (UTC) 

I really believe after reading this article that pre-k is a great way for early intervention. It allows students to be exposed to academics at a younger age, and also enables them to begin learning the different types of knowledge that are critical for future academic studies. I believe that pre-k is also a great way to cognitively stimulate children's minds, and to get them accustomed to the school structure and system at a younger age. I believe that pre-k is great early intervention for reducing the amount of chidren who are unprepared for school and academic knowledge. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 01:11, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I was surprised by the results reported within the article. I was previously unaware of the goverments focus on &quot;pre-k&quot; as a problem area within the education system. I believe that these programs are essential to the success of students by acclimating them to school at an early age and ensuring some measure of parental inovlvement. I was also impressed by the long term focus of the program, and its acknowledgement of educational problems as the root cause of criminal and economic problems. Not to mention I was entirely ignorant concerning this administrations viewpoints on pre-k education. Overall I agree with the &quot;education&quot; presidents, pre-k is probably one of the most important developmental stages in a student's life and should be a major area of concern and reform. The plan's goal of implementing cheap, quality childcare is also another wonderful move by helping both students and working parents in one stroke.

I believe that both direct instruction and discovery learning should be used in the classroom. Direct instruction allows for the teacher to teach to the students the elements of the class, and allows the students to understand unfamiliar information from someone who is familiar with the information. Discovery learning allows the students more autonomy. They are able to learn through different interactions and games, and are able to learn new things on their own. I do believe though after reading this article, that both direct instruction and discovery learning should be used together so students can experience a sense of autonomy and structure with their learning. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 01:17, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree with the author's viewpoint that both direct instruction and discovery learning have a place in the classroom.  Both techniques are appropriate for different situations and each has its strengths and weaknesses.  Direct instruction was basically the only instruction technique that used to be used with the exception of discovery learning in the science lab.  It is good to see discovery learning used more in the classroom where students can become more engaged in the learning process.

Making the eggplant &quot;sweat&quot; seems kind of weird, but it is reasonable. It helps bitter flavors come out of the eggplant.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 medium eggplants, sliced 1/2 inch thick
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Olive oil
* 1 tbs minced garlic
* 1 (1/2 cup) stick of butter

== Procedure ==
#Fold garlic into butter. Shape into a narrow log using parchment or wax paper and refrigerate until needed.
#Sprinkle all sides of eggplant with salt. Let sit 15 minutes or until it &quot;sweats&quot;. Just leave it, no touching. Crack a beer, I don't care. Just don't touch.
#Rinse eggplant. Pat dry with paper towels and brush with olive oil. Season liberally on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
#Preheat grill to medium high.
#Add eggplant and cook until marked and slightly charred on both sides. Place a pat of butter mixture on top of each piece and wait until butter is melted before serving.

== Notes ==

Save the extra butter. Use it instead of regular butter for things like chicken, fish, and steak.

'''Messier 12''' or '''M 12''' (also designated '''NGC 6218''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Ophiuchus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] on [[w:May 30]], [[w:1764]].

Located roughly 3° in the sky from the cluster [[w:Messier 10|M10]], M12 is about 16,000 [[w:light-year]]s from Earth and has a spatial diameter of about 75 light-years. The brightest stars of M12 are of 12th [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]]. It is rather loosely packed for a globular and was once thought to be a tightly concentrated [[w:open cluster]]. Thirteen [[w:variable star]]s have been recorded in this cluster.

A study published in [[w:2006]] concluded that this cluster has an unusually low number of low mass stars. The authors surmise that they were stripped from the cluster by the gravitational influence of the [[w:Milky Way]].[http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2006/pr-04-06.html]

'''Messier 13''' or '''M13''' (also designated '''NGC 6205''' and sometimes called the '''Great Globular Cluster in Hercules''' or the '''Hercules Globular Cluster''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]]. 

==Discovery and visibility==
M13 was discovered by [[w:Edmond Halley]] in 1714, and catalogued by [[w:Charles Messier]] on June 1, 1764.

It is located at [[w:right ascension]] 16&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; 41.7&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and [[w:declination]] +36° 28'. With an [[w:apparent magnitude]] of 5.8, it is barely visible with the [[w:naked eye]] on a very clear night. Its diameter is about 23 arc minutes and it is readily viewable in small telescopes.  Nearby is [[w:NGC 6207]], a 12th magnitude edge-on galaxy that lies 28 arc minutes directly north east.  A small galaxy, IC 4617, lies halfway between NGC 6207 and M13, north-northeast of the large globular's center.

==Characteristics==

M13 is about 145 light-years in [[w:diameter]], and it is composed of several hundred thousand [[w:star]]s, the brightest of which is the [[w:variable star]] V11 with an apparent magnitude of 11.95. M13 is 25,100 light-years away from [[w:Earth]].

==Arecibo message==
The [[w:Arecibo message]] of 1974, designed to communicate the existence of human life to hypothetical [[w:extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s, was transmitted toward M13. The reason was that with a higher star density, the chances of a life harboring planet with intelligent life forms, were higher.

==Literary references==
* The [[w:science fiction]] novellas &quot;[[w:Sucker Bait]]&quot; by [[w:Isaac Asimov]] and &quot;[[w:Question and Answer]]&quot; by [[w:Poul Anderson]] take place on Troas, a world within M13.
* In the science fiction series ''[[w:Perry Rhodan]]'', M13 is the location of Arkon, the home world of the race of Arkonides.
* In author Dan Simmon's [[w:Hyperion Cantos]] the Hercules cluster is where Earth was secretly moved to after it was supposedly destroyed.
*In [[w:The Sirens of Titan]], [[w:Kurt Vonnegut]] writes &quot;Every passing hour brings the Solar System forty-three thousand miles closer to Globular Cluster M13 in Hercules -- and still there are some misfits who insist that there is no such thing as progress.&quot;

==1. Create a list of equipment used for gold panning. Describe each item and tell what it is used for. The list should include at least the following.==
;a. Gold Pan
:A gold pan is typically a round pan with a flat bottom and conical sides. Modern gold pans are made from plastic and have riffles formed into one side. Gold panning is the simplest way to prospect for placer or flood gold. 
:A plastic gold pan with built in riffles is your best choice since it is lighter and won’t rust. Green or blue pans are somewhat easier to use than black pans since it is easier to see the black sands against green or blue than it is to see them against a black pan. A pan with a wide bottom will be easier to use when separating the gold from the black sands than a pan with a narrow bottom. For beginners stick with a basic pan and leave the pans with multiple sets of riffles, or non-round shapes alone. A pan full of material is heavy so for pathfinders an 8-10 inch pan is probably best. For adults start out with a 12-14 inch pan. Pans are available in sizes up to 17 inches but a 17 inch pan is very heavy when it is full.
;b. Classifier
:A classifier is a screen that is used to classify material to be panned. Classifying material is the process of separating different sizes of material. Usually a classifier is used to remove large rocks prior to panning. Classifiers are available with screens having holes from 1/2 inch down to 1/100th of an inch in size and are identified by the size of the holes in fractions of an inch. So a number 2 classifier would have 1/2 inch holes while a number 100 would have holes that were 1/100th of an inch in size. For panning the usual sizes of classifier used are 2, 4, and 8. 
:A cheap classifier that is very useful for classifying wet or damp material can be made using a roll of 1/2 or 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Take the hardware cloth and cut out a section large enough to make a cylinder that just fits inside your bucket with about an inch of overlap at the seam. Using the wire that held the roll of hardware cloth together, sew up the seam. Cut a number of 2-3 inch slits spaced evenly along one edge of the cylinder. Cut out a piece of hardware cloth that will just fit inside of the cylinder and secure it to the bottom of the cylinder by bending the flaps formed by cutting the slits under the bottom. Sew the bottom piece to the flaps using more of the wire from the hardware cloth. You should now have a basket that fits inside your bucket. You will want to wrap the top edge with something like cotton rope to protect your hands. To use the classifier fill the bucket with water and then swish the classifier full of material in the water. The small material will be rinsed out into the bucket and the remaining material can be discarded.

;c. Snuffer Bottle
:A snuffer or sucker bottle is a plastic squeezable bottle used to suck up gold or black sands from the bottom of the gold pan. The snuffer bottle has a straw through the opening. This straw lets you squeeze the bottle without worrying about the gold inside squirting out through the opening. If you have a large enough snuffer bottle or if you have more than one, consider just sucking up all the black sands and taking them home to cleanup later. You will be able to pan much more material if you don’t stop to clean out just the gold from each pan.
:For cleaning out the gold from the black sands a small plastic eyedropper is useful to suck up just the gold and drop it in a vial. 
:Glass vials are very nice for displaying gold, but they will break if dropped on a rock, use plastic vials when in the field.
;d. Shovel
:A shovel is used to dig up the material to be panned.
;e. Pick
:A pick is used to breakup hard packed material.
;f. Bucket
:A bucket is used to haul material from the location it is being dug out of the ground, to a location where it can be panned. 5 gallon buckets are popular because they are readily available and most classifiers are designed to fit on top of them. However 5 gallon buckets have one big disadvantage, when they are full they are very heavy, and they are almost always filled too full. 3 gallon buckets with the same size opening as a 5 gallon bucket are a much better choice.
;g. Trowel
:A trowel is used to dig material from locations where a large shovel will not fit.
;h. Pry bar
:A pry bar is used to move large rocks to allow you to get to the material underneath them. Other items that might be used for this are pulleys, winches, or come alongs.
;i. Rock hammer
:A rock hammer can be used to break up rocks so that they can be more easily moved.
;j. Crevice tool
:A crevice tool is a thin piece of metal with a narrow scoop on one end. It is used to dig material out of very narrow crevices between rocks. Purpose made crevice tools can be purchased, but you may have something around the house that will work just as well. Likely candidates are old flat screw drivers, hub cap removal tools from cars you no longer own, or just a piece of metal rod with one end pounded flat.
;k. Drinking water
:Prospecting is usually hard work, often in the hot sun. Staying hydrated is very important, and you almost certainly shouldn't drink the water from the river or stream you are panning in, so you should always have drinking water available.
;l. Other possible items.
:Other items you might want with you include
:*Sun screen
:*Food
:*A canoe yoke and short straps. (This makes a wonderful bucket carrier.)
:*Dry change of clothes.
:*Small towel
:*Water shoes or waders
:*Backpack, to carry all your stuff in.
:*Knee pad
:*Etc, etc, etc...

==2. Define the following:==
;a. Pay dirt
:Pay dirt is material containing high concentrations of gold.
;b. Quartz
:Quartz is the second most common mineral on earth. It is a crystal made of silicon dioxide and is often found near with gold. Finding quartz does not mean that you will also find gold, but if you find gold there will almost always be quartz nearby. Lode gold is usually found mixed in or around quartz veins. 
[[Image:Pyrite Fools Gold Macro 1.JPG|thumb|Pyrite]]
;c. Pyrite
:Pyrite is often referred to as fool’s gold, there are other minerals that are also mistaken for gold but pyrite is by far the most common. Pyrite is composed of iron sulfide, and can easily be distinguished from gold because it is much less dense and it leaves a black streak if rubbed across the bottom of a gold pan.
;d. Blond sands
:Any of the light colored material washed out of the pan while panning. Blond sands usually have a specific gravity of 2 – 2.5, that is they are about twice as heavy as water.
;e. Black sands
:Black sands are mostly made of magnetite and hematite. Black sands have a specific gravity of about 5. 
;f. Placer
:Placer gold is the gold that has been eroded from the mother lode and washed down into the streams and rivers.
;g. Lode
:Lode gold is gold that is still in the rock before it has been eroded and washed into a stream or river. A group of lodes or veins of gold is often referred to as a mother lode. One of the best-known mother lodes is the California Mother Lode. This is a zone one to four miles wide and 120 miles long in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The individual gold deposits within the mother lode are gold bearing quartz veins up to 50 feet thick and a few thousand feet long.
;h. Nugget
:A nugget is a naturally occurring chunk of gold. Nuggets can be picked up with your fingers and are usually at least a gram or more in weight. The largest nugget ever found was the “Welcome Stranger” and weighed 2316 troy ounces, it was found in Moliagul, Victoria, Australia on February 5, 1869. Smaller pieces of gold that can still be picked up with your fingers are called pickers.
;i. Flake
:A flake is a piece of gold that is flat and cannot be easily picked up with your fingers.
;j. Dust
:Dust or flour gold, are tiny pieces of gold too small to be called flakes.
;k. specific gravity
:specific gravity is the ratio of the density a given material to the density of water. So a material with a specific gravity of 2 is twice as dense as water.
;l. Wet and Dry panning
:Panning is using a gold pan to separate gold from the surrounding material. This is accomplished by suspending the material in the pan in a fluid. Once the material is suspended in the fluid the denser material settles to the bottom of the pan. The fluid can be anything but the most common is water or air. Wet panning is panning using water as the fluid, dry panning is using air as the fluid. Wet panning is much more efficient that dry panning because gold is much denser than the surrounding material compared to water, but compared to air all the material is relatively dense.
;m. Mercury (historical use) '''DO NOT USE TODAY'''
:Mercury is a toxic metal that is liquid at room temperature. Since it is toxic it should be avoided, however it has often been used to pull fine gold out of black sands. When mixed with black sands containing gold, the mercury will amalgamate with the gold and you will end up with a lump of mercury containing all of the gold. 
;n. Troy pound
:One troy pound equals .82 regular or “avoirdupois” pounds, and is made up of 12 troy ounces.
;o. Troy ounce
:The troy ounce is the standard measure of gold and other precious metals. One troy ounce equals 1.1 regular or “avoirdupois” ounces.
;p. Pennyweight (dwt)
:A pennyweight is 1/20th of a troy ounce.
;q. Grain
:A grain is 1/24th of a pennyweight.
;r. Gold fever
:What people get that causes them to keep hunting for gold. Extreme cases of &quot;Gold Fever&quot; have been known to cause people to do seemingly insane things such as hauling a ton of equipment over the 33 mile Chilkoot Trail during the Klondike Gold Rush. Leaving  good well-paying employment when rumour of a strike is heard to go across the world to live in a hard climate searching for gold. Some may be found but usually not enough value to keep you in food and clothing to survive. Check out major gold rushes around the world. Central Otago in New Zealand, Bendigo in Australia.

==3. What are the following identifying characteristics of Gold.==
===a. Specific gravity===
The specific gravity of gold is 19.3. This is almost twice the specific gravity of lead, which is 11.3 and almost 4 times the specific gravity of black sands at around 5.
===b. Color of streak===
When rubbed against the bottom of a gold pan a piece of gold will leave a yellow streak.
===c. Color===
Gold is one of only two metals that in their raw state are not silver colored. Gold in its natural state is a yellow color. The other non-silver colored metal is copper.

==4. Where are some good places on a river or stream to look for gold.==
:Gold is heavy so it is only moved by large amounts of fast water, like in the winter when a river is high or flooding. The gold will drop out of the stream wherever the water slows down, or where there is something to cause an area of low pressure in the stream. So look for gold on the downstream side of large rocks or boulders or in cracks that the gold may have dropped into and been wedged in place. Look on the inside part of bends in the stream. Imagine what the river would be like when it is full and look for gold where the water would have a chance to slow down.

==5. Make a timeline containing at least 15 items about the history of gold prospecting from 1600 until the present day, including the following rushes: California Gold Rush, Klondike/Yukon Gold Rush, Witwatersrand Gold Rush, and the Victorian Gold Rush.==
The timeline should also include any local gold rushes. For each gold rush mentioned the time line should specify when it started and how long it lasted, as well as how many people were involved and the amount of gold recovered. Other items in the time line should include things like major technological developments in prospecting. Examples of this include the development and subsequent ban on hydraulic mining in California, the development of square set timbers in the Comstock silver mine, or the development of gold dredges.

===California Gold Rush===
The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was discovered by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill, in Coloma, California.  News of the discovery soon spread, resulting in some 300,000 men, women, and children coming to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.

On August 19, 1848, the New York Herald was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report that there was a gold rush in California; on December 5, President James Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress.

===Klondike/Yukon Gold Rush===
[[Image:Klondike Routes Map.png|thumb|300px|right|Routes to the Klondike.]]
The '''Klondike Gold Rush''', sometimes referred to as the '''Yukon Gold Rush''' or '''Alaska Gold Rush''', was a frenzy of gold rush immigration to and for gold prospecting, along the Klondike River near Dawson City, Yukon, Canada after gold was discovered there in the late 19th century. In total, about 12.5 million ounces of gold (about 20.12m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) have been taken from the Klondike area in the century since its discovery.

==== Discovery ====
[[Image:Skookum Jim Mason.png|thumb|left|upright|Keish (Skookum Jim Mason)]]
In August 1896, three people led by Keish (Skookum Jim Mason), a member of the Tagish First Nations, headed north, down the Yukon River from the Carcross area, looking for his sister Kate and her husband George Carmack. The party included Skookum Jim, his cousin, known as Dawson Charlie (or sometimes Tagish Charlie), and his nephew Patsy Henderson. After meeting up with George and Kate, who were fishing for salmon at the mouth of the Klondike River, they ran into Nova Scotian Robert Henderson who had been mining gold on the Indian River, just south of the Klondike. Henderson told George Carmack about where he was mining and that he did not want any &quot;Siwashes&quot; (meaning Indians) near him.
On August 16, 1896, the Skookum party discovered rich placer gold deposits in Bonanza (Rabbit) Creek, Yukon. It is not clear who made the actual discovery, with some accounts saying that it was Kate Carmack, while others credit Skookum Jim. George Carmack was officially credited for the gold discovery because the actual claim was staked in his name. The group agreed to this because they felt that other miners would be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indian, given the strong racist attitudes of the time.

====The Rush Begins====
[[Image:Miners register claims.jpg|thumb|right|Miners wait to register their claims.
The news spread to other mining camps in the Yukon River valley. Gold was first discovered in Rabbit Creek, which was later named Bonanza Creek because so many people came to the creek for gold. The Bonanza, Eldorado, and Hunker Creeks were rapidly staked by miners who had been previously working creeks and shoal|sandbars on the Fortymile and Stewart Rivers.

News reached the United States in July 1897 at the height of a significant series of financial recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The American economy had been hard hit by the Panic of 1893 and the Panic of 1896 which caused widespread unemployment. Many who were adversely impacted by the financial crises were motivated to try their luck in the gold fields. The first successful prospectors arrived in San Francisco, California on July 15 and in Seattle, Washington on July 17, setting off the Klondike stampede. In 1898, the population in the Klondike may have reached 40,000, which threatened to cause a famine.
[[Image:Klondike mining camp.jpg|thumb|left|A typical gold mining operation, on Bonanza Creek.
Men from all walks of life headed for the Yukon from as far away as New York, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Surprisingly, a large proportion were professionals, such as teachers and doctors, even a mayor or two, who gave up respectable careers to make the journey. Most were perfectly aware of their chance of finding significant amounts of gold were slim to none, and went for the adventure. As many as half of those who reached Dawson City kept right on going without doing any prospecting at all. Thus, by bringing large numbers of entrepreneurial adventurers to the region, the Gold Rush significantly contributed to the economic development of Western Canada, Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.

Most prospectors landed at the Alaskan towns of Skagway, or Dyea, both located at the head of the Lynn Canal. From these towns they traveled the Chilkoot Trail and crossed the Chilkoot Pass, or they hiked up to the White Pass into and proceeded thence to Lake Lindeman or Bennett Lake, the headwaters of the Yukon River. Here, some {{units|25 to 35 miles|40 to 56 km}} grueling miles from where they landed, prospectors built rafts and boats that would take them the final 500-plus miles (800-plus km) down the Yukon to Dawson City, near the gold fields. Stampeders had to carry a year's supply of goods &amp;mdash; about a ton, more than half of it food &amp;mdash; over the passes to be allowed to enter Canada. At the top of the passes, the stampeders encountered Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police (NWMP and now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) post that enforced that regulation, as well as customs and duties. It was put in place to avert shortages like those that had occurred in the previous two winters in Dawson City, and also to restrict the entry of guns, particularly handguns, into British territory.  Another reason was to keep out of Canadian territory the criminal element which had established itself in Skagway and the other Yukon Ports (then still claimed as British territory), as well as the fears by British and Canadian authorities about a possible armed takeover of the goldfields as an American territory.

Once the bulk of the prospectors arrived at Dawson City, most of the major mining claims of the region were already established. However, any major potential unrest with the idle population was averted with the firm authority of the NWMP under the command of Sam Steele. People would eat beans and bread, but rarely a lucky prospector could get his hands on some fresh meat.

===Witwatersrand Gold Rush===
The '''Witwatersrand Gold Rush''' was a gold rush in 1886 that led to the establishment of Johannesburg, South Africa.

There had always been rumours of a modern-day &quot;El Dorado&quot; in the folklore of the native tribes that roamed the plains of the South African highveld, and the gold miners that had come from all over the world to seek out their fortunes on the alluvial mines of Barberton and Pilgrim's Rest, in what is now known as the province of Mpumalanga.

But it was not until 1886 that the massive wealth of the Witwatersrand would be uncovered. Scientific studies have pointed to the fact that the &quot;Golden Arc&quot; which stretches from Johannesburg to Welkom was once a massive inland lake, and that silt and gold deposits from alluvial gold settled in the area to form the gold-rich deposits that South Africa is famous for.

====Discovery====

[[Image:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The farm where gold was first discovered in 1886.]]

It is believed that it was a Sunday in March 1886 that an Australian gold miner, George Harrison, stumbled across a rocky outcrop of the main gold-bearing reef. He declared his claim with the then-government of the Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR), and the area was pronounced open diggings. His discovery is recorded in history with a monument where the original gold outcrop is believed to be located, and a park named in his honour. Ironically, Harrison is believed to have sold his claim for less than 10 Pounds before leaving the area, and he was never heard from again.

====Founding of Johannesburg====

It did not take long for fortune-seekers from all over the world to flock to the area, and soon what was a dusty mining village known as Ferreira's Camp was formalised into a settlement. Initially, the ZAR did not believe that the gold would last for long, and mapped out a small triangular piece of land to cram as many plots onto as possible. This is the reason why Johannesburg's central business district streets are so narrow. 

Within 10 years, the town was already the largest in South Africa, outstripping the growth of Cape Town, which was more than 200 years older. The gold rush saw massive development of Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand, and the area remains the prime metropolitan area of South Africa.

====Second Boer War====

The Witwatersrand Gold Rush was a major contributing factor of the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 to 1896, and of the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. Boer resentment over the large number of foreigners (Uitlanders) in the Witwatersrand led to heavy taxes and the denial of voting rights for the gold miners, and in response the uitlanders and the British owners of the mines began to pressure the overthrow of the Boer government.

===Victorian Gold Rush===
The '''Victorian gold rush''' was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s. In 10 years the Australian population nearly tripled. 

==== Overview ====
During this era Victoria dominated the world's gold output. Ballarat for a while ranked number one in terms of gold production. 

Gold discoveries in Beechworth, Ballarat and Bendigo sparked gold rushes similar to the California Gold Rush.  At its peak some two tonnes of gold per week flowed into the Treasury Building in Melbourne. 

The gold era evolved Victoria from a sheep grazing economy based around squatters, into an emerging industrial base and small (yeoman) farming community. The social impact of gold was that Victoria's population boomed and the lack of available land for small farming generated massive social tensions. Those on-going tensions around land and selection (small farming) culminated in the Kelly Outbreak of 1878.  

Melbourne was a major Boomtown during the gold rush.  The city became the centre of the colony with rail networks radiating to the regional towns and ports. Politically, Victoria's goldminers introduced male franchise and secret ballots, based on Chartist principles. As gold dwindled, pressures for land reform, protectionism and political reform grew and generated social struggles.  A Land Convention in Melbourne during 1857 demanded land reform. Melbourne, or &quot;Smellbourne&quot; (due to the stench of the tanneries along the river), became one of the great cities of the British Empire and the world. Following the huge gold rushes were the Chinese in 1854. Their presence on the goldfields of Bendigo, Beechworth and the Bright district resulted in riots, entry taxes, killings and segregation in the short term and became the foundations of the White Australia policy.  In short, the gold rush was a revolutionary event and reshaped Victoria, its society and politics.

==== Backfiring Guns ====
[[Image:Walhalla 1910 Goldmine 4000ft.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Underground mining at Walhalla, Victoria]]
By 1840 the city of Melbourne, in the south of Victoria, was nearly five years old. Population growth in Melbourne and the surrounding countryside had been steady, and the population was around 10,000.  

In July 1851, Melbourne's 29,000 residents celebrated as they broke away from New South Wales and the Colony of Victoria was born. Weeks later gold was found in Victoria.  The discovery by Louis Michel, and William McKay Aberdeen at Anderson's Creek, near Warrandyte 30 kilometers north-east of Melbourne was awarded a prize by the new Victorian Government, with other discoveries by James Esmond at Clunes in July 1851, and Thomas Hiscock at Buninyong, near Ballarat, on 2 August 1851.

On 20 July 1851 Thomas Peters, a hut-keeper on William Barker’s ''Mount Alexander'' station, found specks of gold at what is now known as Specimen Gully.  This find was published in the Melbourne ''Argus'' on 8 September 1851, leading to a rush to the Mount Alexander or Forest Creek diggings, centered on present-day Castlemaine, claimed as the richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world.

These discoveries were soon surpassed by Ballarat and Bendigo. Further discoveries including Beechworth in 1852, Bright, Omeo, Chiltern, Victoria (1858–59) and Walhalla followed.

The population of Melbourne grew swiftly as the gold fever took hold. The total number of people in Victoria also rose. By 1851 it was 75,000 people. Ten years later this rose to over 500,000. 

First obtained was the alluvial gold found on the surface. It is reported that miners when first arrived on the Mount Tarrengower fields nuggets were picked up without digging. This was followed by exploitation of alluvial gold usually in creeks and rivers. The seekers used gold pans, puddling boxes and cradles to separate this gold from the dirt and water.                                   

As alluvial gold ran out, underground or deep lead mining began. This was harder and dangerous. Locales such as Bendigo and Ballarat saw great concentrations of miners as teams and syndicates sank shafts. Coupled with erratic and vexatious policing and license checks, tensions flared around Beechworth Bendigo and Ballarat. These tensions culminated in the Eureka Rebellion of 1854. Following the rebellion, a range of reforms gave miners a greater democratic say in  resolving disputes via Mining Courts and an extended electoral franchise. 

At Walhalla alone, Cohens Reef produced over 50 tonnes (1.6 million tr oz) of gold in 40 years of mining.

==== Major and long lasting impact ====
Australia's population changed dramatically as a result of the rushes.  In 1851 the Australian population was 437,655, of which 77,345, or just under 18%, were Victorians.  A decade later the Australian population had grown to 1,151,947 and the Victorian population had increased to 538,628; just under 47% of the Australian total and a sevenfold increase. In some small country towns where gold was found abundant, the population could grow of over 1000% in a decade (e.g. Rutherglen had a population of ~2'000. Ten years later, it had ~60'000 which is a 3000% increase). The rapid growth was predominantly a result of the gold rushes.

The gold rush is reflected in the architecture of Victorian gold-boom cities like Melbourne, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Bendigo and Ararat.  Ballarat has Sovereign Hill &amp;mdash; a 60 acre (240,000&amp;nbsp;m²) recreation of a gold rush town &amp;mdash; as well as the Gold Museum, while Bendigo has a large operating gold mine system which also functions as a tourist attraction.

The rushes left the legacy of quaint Victorian towns in the Goldfields tourist region like Maldon, Beechworth, Clunes, Heathcote, Victoria, Maryborough, Daylesford, Stawell, Beaufort, Creswick, St Arnaud, Dunolly, Inglewood and Buninyong.   With the exception of Ballarat and Bendigo, many of these towns were substantially larger than they are today. Most populations moved to other districts when gold played out in a given locality. 

At the other end of the spectrum ghost towns, such as Walhalla, Mafeking and Steiglitz still exist.

[[Image:Cassilis historical area.jpg|thumb|right|As with many gold towns, after deposits of gold had been exploited, the town of Cassilis ceased to exist. This picture shows the remains of part of King Cassilis Mine]]
The last major gold rush in Victoria was at Berringa, south of Ballarat, in the first decade of the 20th century. Gold mining ceased in Victoria, not because there was no more gold but in part because of the depth and cost of pumping.  The First World War also drained Australia of the labour needed to work the mines, but worse the prohibition on the export of gold from Australia in 1915, the abolition of the gold standard throughout the Empire, saw many goldtowns in Victoria die. The slump in gold production never recovered. However, as of 2005 the recent increase in the gold price has seen a resurgence in commercial mining activity; mining has yet to be resumed in Bendigo, while some is occurring in Ballarat, and exploration proceeds elsewhere, for example, in Glen Wills, an isolated mountain area near Mitta Mitta in north-eastern Victoria.

==6. Learn about gold panning by doing one of the following:==
===a. Do some gold panning. (preferred)===
Most states in the U.S. have areas where gold can be located. The best way to meet this requirement is to go to an area and actually dig up the material and pan it there. It would be best for the instructor to scout the area first and find a location where there is at least some gold available, ideally there should be at least a few flakes or specs of gold in each pan. 

Another way to meet this requirement is for the instructor to get some gold bearing material and then have the students pan it in some type of trough, the plastic pans available at your local hardware store for mixing mortar work well. You can also build a panning trough out of 2x10 lumber with a thin plywood bottom and line it with plastic.

You can also purchase black sand concentrates from various locations on the Internet. These can be mixed with sand and gravel from a local river or stream bank and then used for panning.  When panning don’t fill the pan completely full. It is easier, especially for beginners to start with a pan that is 1/2 to 3/4 full. You may also want to drop a small lead weight like a fishing weight into the pan. If the lead is still in the pan when the pan is down to just black sands then you can be sure that the gold is still there also.
===b. Practice panning using flattened lead or tungsten shot mixed with sand (preferably from a river bank).===
Get some sand and gravel, from a river or stream bank if possible, and mix in a specific number of flattened lead or tungsten shot. Tungsten shot would be the best choice for two reasons if you can find it. First unlike lead, tungsten is non toxic, and second, while lead at 11.3 is only about half the specific gravity of gold, tungsten is almost identical at 19.62.

==7. Look up the following verses in the Bible and discuss them in relation to prospecting for gold.==

===a. Matthew 13:44-46===
{{Bible verse
| book = Matthew
| chapter = 13
| verse = 44-46
| text =
&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
}}

===b. Matthew 6:19-21===
{{Bible verse
| book = Matthew
| chapter = 6
| verse = 19-21
| text =
&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
}}

{{commonscat|Messier 14}}
'''Messier 14''' (also known as '''M14''' or '''NGC 6402''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ophiuchus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1764]].

At a distance of about 30,000 light-years, M14 contains several hundreds of thousands of [[w:star]]s. At an [[w:apparent magnitude]] +7.6 it can be easily observed with [[w:binoculars]]. Medium-sized [[w:telescope]]s will show some hint of the individual stars of which the brightest is of magnitude +14.

The total [[w:luminosity]] of M14 is in the order of 400,000 times that of the [[w:Sun]] corresponding to an [[w:absolute magnitude]] of -9.12. The shape of the cluster is decidedly elongated. M14 is about 100 light-years across.

A respectable total of 70 [[w:variable star]]s is known in M14, many of the W Virginis variety common in globular clusters. In [[w:1938]], a [[w:nova]] appeared although this was not discovered until [[w:photographic plates]] from that time were studied in [[w:1964]]. It is estimated that the nova reached a maximum brightness of magnitude +9.2, over five times brighter than the brightest 'normal' star in the cluster.

Slightly over 3° southwest of M14 lies the faint globular cluster NGC 6366.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The initial book outline and work was done on a wiki, and some of that may be useful here -- whatever ended up on the cutting room floor but may be fodder for future revisions or improvements.  It might be useful to have a 'scraps' page for books in progress, as was found to be the case for a short period at least on the drafting wiki.  

It was mentioned last weekend at the NYC Wikiconference that the authors are going to discuss relicensing the book under CC-SA 3 for wikibooks compatibility.  Until then, I am simply adding some of the outline structure and metadata here.  Whiteknight has a copy of the html of the online book, and hopefully we can get that converted and posted at some point -- then we'll just have to clean it up and perhaps organize the sections and sub-chapters into their own pages.

Appendix E will be particularly fun- it lists in detail every page-revision referenced for the book and the 5 active authors of that page; this could be very effectively linked by a script to the original revisions and authors. [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|talk]]) 03:38, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

: Awesome.   [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 21:01, 21 June 2013 (UTC)

==Text== 
The full text can be found [http://www.howwikipediaworks.net/?page_id=42 here], but it needs to be reformatted into wikibooks. I will work on this slowly; help is welcome! -- [[User:Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[User talk:Phoebe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Phoebe|contribs]]) 02:13, 11 June 2013 (UTC)
: It seems those pages still link to the Internet Archive's copy at [http://web.archive.org/web/20090611044008/http://howwikipediaworks.com/pt01.html] - is that the right place to draw from?  I don't see a source that has the images yet.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] ([[User talk:Sj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sj|contribs]]) 21:01, 21 June 2013 (UTC)
:: Yeah, the images aren't archived; I'm going to have to get them out of my files. I'm getting the text from the IA, yes. I linked to the individual IA chapters from howwikipediaworks.net, which is handy; they're a little hard to find otherwise. -- [[User:Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[User talk:Phoebe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Phoebe|contribs]]) 06:41, 3 July 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Teachers and technology==
===Introduction===
The learning environment is constantly changing and the tools and methods incorporated continue to grow and change. Technology is an interesting term in that viewed from a contemporary context it seems somewhat easily defined. But if we think carefully we find that amount of change that takes place is extraordinary and the speed at which this change takes place is accelerating rapidly.

If we think of the not so distant past, technology in the classroom could refer simply to the use of books. A few decades ago the technology for document preparation moved to electric typewriters from manual machines. In a short time span we have seen the advent of personal computers, which quickly moved from professional environment to the educational environment. While we have seen initial domination of Apple computers in educational environments, a multiplicity of vendors and technologies can now be found and the conceptualization of ?computer? as technology is quickly disappearing. So, how do we define technology today?

===A view of technology===
As we move through the year 2009 we find that not only is it difficult to define a single hardware and software environment, it is also difficult to pin down location. The physical devices being used still incorporate a familiar computer framework. PC?s using familiar operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X are commonplace. Network technologies allow not only for the interconnection within the educational environment, but also to the rest of the world through the Internet. This system of interconnected networks allows communication through its most popular form: The World Wide Web. This communications protocol allows text, graphics, audio and video to be exchanged between multiple platforms and for many years has been an environment that students could benefit from being on the receiving end of information. As new tools emerge, this is rapidly changing.

===Web 2.0===
It is difficult to exactly define what web 2.0 means because the definition is hotly debated. What can be said about this environment is that, in general, it represents an environment on the World Wide Web that changes how we interact with data and with each other. A few examples of these tools include video sharing and audio/video interactivity such as Skype, social networking (Facebook), Google products including maps/streetview, docs, and soon Wave. It remains to be seen how some of these new changes will effect how we interact with this technological environment. While we are used to having access to our working environment locally there is a growing move toward ?cloud? computing. Google is pushing this and hopes to push this technology with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_wave Wave] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS Chrome OS]. The changes that we see in the Web 2.0 environment do not necessary represent change in hardware infrastructure, rather the software systems running on these hardware systems.

===Smart devices and more===
Other means of technology that are becoming commonplace include smart devices or smart phones. At this point in time it makes no sense to refer to a smart device simply as a cell phone. These devices are capable of making phone calls certainly, but they also have the capacity to navigate the Web, run calculators, maintain multiple clocks with alarm notices, play music and send text messages. Not only can you take photos and video, but you can then post them directly to social networking sites instantly as well as send and receive email. Many new devices can make their way into the learning environment such as iPods, digital cameras, video, podcasting, and Skype. Blogging is a platform where individuals can not only create an online journal or log, but it also creates opportunities for others to respond. This can be its own form of educational interaction and provide feedback to ideas such as using technology by teachers in an academic setting.These should be consider freeing to the development of the learning environment not frightening or overwhelming.
===Professional development===
One of the keys to the successful implementation of technology in the classroom is a careful plan for professional development. Installation of new equipment and leaving the teacher to figure out how it works and how it applies pedagogically is a recipe for disaster.

In order to make any technology implementation a successful experience there are five critical element that must be considered. Time, training and development, teacher involvement, access to the equipment, and ongoing support (Brown, 2004).
====Time====
Teachers must be afforded the time to actively experiment with the technology they are going to be working with in the classroom. This time allows them to play with their curriculum and see how the new tools work. It provides for opportunities to make mistakes and work their way out of them. It gives them the confidence to understand the tools so that they can concentrate on best classroom practice with the support of the technology rather than focusing on hoping to make the technology work under pressure.
====Training and development====
Training and development should be designed to support the specific needs of the teachers. The tools they are going to use in the classroom should be specifically addressed and the timing of the training and development should coincide with actual practice. Providing professional development in for a teacher in June for programs that will be installed the following September does no good at all.
====Teacher involvement====
In order to make the professional development a meaningful experience it is imperative that the design comes from a collaboration between the technology coordinator and the teachers. Professional development must directly relate to the technologies that teacher will use and in the form necessary that will support the educative process. It cannot be designed isolation and cannot be a ?canned? system intended for a ?one size fits all? environment. All too often professional development is designed around large groups with basic step-by-step delivery systems that provide little more to the teachers that when they first entered the session. In some instance, teachers are not even place in front to the technology they are expected to use but are instead give presentation hand outs and expected to translate this into a meaningful learning experience.
====Access to equipment====
When teachers have participated in some form of professional development it is necessary to get them directly involved with the new technology immediately. This required that careful planning has been taking place with the technology coordinators so that equipment isn?t lying around waiting for professional development to take place, or that teachers are left for months without the new technology following professional development. They will need immediate access so they can begin the process of active experimentation and implementation in their classes.
====Ongoing support====
It is through the process of active use and experimentation that the teacher will encounter problems and is the role of the technology coordinator to ensure that support systems are in place. There are two possibilities that may occur when difficulties arise. One may come from the mistakes performed by the teacher when attempt to incorporate the use of the new technology within their learning environment. Put simply, they don?t know fully how to use the new technology. A very simple example might be that they want to incorporate multiple columns in a word processing document so their students can create brochures, and they themselves don?t know how to create multiple column. As issues such as this come up, support systems must be in place so that the teacher does not have a large delay in implementing this process. Another situation they may encounter is specific component failure. If a printer or scanner doesn?t work, if classroom computers lock up, or if access to the World Wide Web is interrupted during a critical period it will be necessary to have available technical support available to resolve these issues on a timely basis.
===Technology coordinator===
With the flood of available technology coming into the classrooms the responsibility of planning and implementation becomes ever more difficult. The role of the technology coordinator is much more complex than just an individual who can work with teachers to support the existing technology systems. The technology coordinator should be an individual who is familiar with the learning environment and cognizant of the challenges of integrating technology with curriculum. Simply placing new technology in a classroom is no assurance that it will be used. The use of technology in a classroom is no different from any other instrumentality. It must have a defining purpose and support the learning process as it is used. Technology is not external to the learning environment even though it is often used not as a tool to enhance learning but instead as a reward system for behavior in the classroom. By working closely with teachers, technology coordinators can help determine the technological needs of teachers, plan to support the use of the technology through effective professional development, and determine appropriate support when difficulties arise.

An additional role of the technology coordinator should be a forward looking scout. As myriad new tools surface in is likely that teachers simply do not have the time to scour what is out there. Simple informational overviews may provide a wealth of ideas that teachers could then incorporate into their learning environments. It may make a tremendous difference if teachers could transition from students doing group work by typing their own individual papers and to then consolidate them later as a single group report, to the use of Google docs to work together in a shared environment. In continuation, they them may create a group presentation using the presentation feature for the teacher to review or for presentation in a class. For the teacher it might be a wonderful transformation to create a presentation with photos and video in the presentation of Google docs where it is centrally stored. There is no need to move files, worry about forgotten flash drives, and provides the ability to involve other academics to review and collaborate.

But they need to be aware of these tools before they can consider their use. Creating a simple tutorial to reinforce skills directly from the computer screen using Screen Toaster and greatly simplify not only classroom experiences but enhance distance learning activities. Many textbooks provide long tutorials with occasional screen shots, which can be helpful but also confusing. Short movies of computer techniques can prove to be beneficial for all and greatly aid those who are very visual in nature.
===Working with teachers===
Using technology is not a process that is imposed on teachers. It should be an opportunity where teachers are provided with an opportunity to enhance their practice and focus on who student learning will be affected. Jamie McKenziev emphasizes the need to differentiate between training and technology professional development. Professional development is a long term process which engages teachers within a context of adult learning, addressing needs of immediacy of application, problem-based, and engaging which will lead to their own knowledge construction found within constructivist theory (. Ultimately, teachers are the only individuals who directly add value to the learning process. They are the ones who directly work with students and are involved in the learning process. All other people serve to support this activity. They must all working the teachers for a successful learning environment.
===Plan for instructional support===
As teachers learn to use and incorporate new technology into their instructional environment they are going to need support. The support can come from a variety of areas and all of them must be understood and taken advantage of.
===Help Desk===
Officially there should be a technology support number that teachers can call to receive assistance. The assistance can come in the form of hardware and software support from the perspective that they are unsure how to use this. This other situation is that the equipment or software in not functioning properly and they require assistance. In both situations they should have a number to call and there should be a documented action plan with specific response guidelines. In is not unprecedented to have teachers call tech support and have not idea when and if they may ever hear back again.
===Peers===
As teachers work with technology they discover new and interesting strategies to incorporate this into their curriculum. Some experiment more than others and it is here that teachers can share their experiences (and frustrations) and collectively solve problems. They are their own wealth of information and should be encouraged. Administrative support for technology exchanges should be considered.
===Students===
Yes, students. It is very difficult-and potentially fearful-for some teachers to admit that their young students may know more than they do when it comes to technology. For those who are open and relaxed, admitting that they don?t know all of the answers when it comes to using computers, it can be a transformational environment. They can learn from each other and giving up some power to the students can enrich the learning environment.
Be open and don?t be afraid to experiment, to engage others, to admit that there is much you may not know and above all, to have fun. It is a process of learning and learning is something that all teachers should revel in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to have a high-level overview of XML Search terms and technologies.

== Search Terms ==
* '''Structured Search''' - retaining an using the structure of a document to aid in search result ranking
* '''Search Document''' - a document or document fragment that is returned as the result of a search.  Note that in the search examples the word &quot;document&quot; may imply an entire XML document or a fragment or item in such a document.
* '''Search Query''' - a word or phrase to find
* '''Boolean Search''' - a search for an XML document that is either true or false with no ordering of search results
* '''Search Hit''' - a match of a query to a document or document fragment
* '''Hit Scoring''' - a method of assigning a weight to a search result for sorting.  For example if a term occurs more frequently in a document it might receive a higher score
* '''Search Ranking''' - an order list of search results
* '''Global Search''' - searching one or more item types in a database
* '''Item Viewer''' - a program used to view a specific item type in a collection

      <comment>/* XML Query Syntax vs. Default Lucene Syntax */ slop value too low to give results</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to perform a full text keyword search on one or more XML documents.  This is done using the Lucene index extensions to eXist.

== Background ==
The Apache Lucene full text search framework was added to eXist 1.4 as a full text index, replacing the previous native full text index. The new Lucene full text search framework is faster, more configurable, and more feature-rich than eXist's legacy full text index.  It will also be the basis for an implementation of the W3C's full text extensions for XQuery. 

eXist associates a distinct node-id with each node in an XML document.  This node-id is used as the Lucene document ID in the Lucene index files, that is, each XML node becomes a Lucene document.  This means that you can customize to a very high degree the search weight of keyword matches to every node in your document.  So, for example, a match of a keyword within a title can have a higher score than a match in the body of a document.  This means that a search hit retrieving a document title in a large number of documents will have a higher probability of being ranked first in your search results.  This means your searches will have higher [[w:Precision_and_recall|Precision and Recall]] than search systems that do not retain document structure.

== eXist and Lucene Documentation ==

The following is the eXist documentation on how to use Lucene:

[http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml eXist-db Lucene Documentation]

eXist supports the full Lucene Query Parser Syntax (with the exception of &quot;fielded search&quot;):

[http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/2_9_1/queryparsersyntax.html Lucene Query Parser Syntax]

== Sample XML File ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;test&gt;
    &lt;p n=&quot;1&quot;&gt;this paragraph tests the things made up by
      &lt;name&gt;ron&lt;/name&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p n=&quot;2&quot;&gt;this paragraph tests the other issues made up by
      &lt;name&gt;edward&lt;/name&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/test&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Setting up a Lucene Index ==

In order to perform Lucene-indexed, full text searching of this document, we need to create an index configuration file, '''collection.xconf''', describing which elements and attributes should be indexed, and the various details of that indexing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;collection xmlns=&quot;http://exist-db.org/collection-config/1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;index&gt;
      &lt;!-- Enable the legacy full text index for comparison with Lucene --&gt;
      &lt;fulltext default=&quot;all&quot; attributes=&quot;no&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;!-- Lucene index is configured below --&gt;
      &lt;lucene&gt;
        &lt;analyzer class=&quot;org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;analyzer id=&quot;ws&quot; class=&quot;org.apache.lucene.analysis.WhitespaceAnalyzer&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;text match=&quot;//test&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/lucene&gt;
    &lt;/index&gt;
&lt;/collection&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Notes:
* If your test data are saved in db/test, you should save collection.xconf in db/system/config/db/test. Index configuration files are always saved in a directory structure inside system/config/db which is isomorphic to the directory structure of db.
* After you create or update this index configuration file, you will need to reindex the data. You can do this either by using the eXist Java-based admin client, selecting the test collection and choosing &quot;Reindex collection&quot;, or by using the [http://demo.exist-db.org/exist/functions/xmldb/reindex xmldb:reindex()] function, supplying xmldb:reindex('/db/test') in eXide or in the XQuery Sandbox.
* Although the legacy full text index is not needed for Lucene-based search, we have explicitly enabled it here for this example configuration in order to point out the expressive similarities between the Lucene and legacy search functions/operators (i.e. Lucene's ft:query() vs. the legacy full text index's &amp;=, |=, near(), text:match-all(), text:match-any()).

== Indexing Strategies ==

You can either define a Lucene index on a single element or attribute name (qname=&quot;...&quot;) or on a node path (match=&quot;...&quot;). 

If you define an index on a qname, such as &lt;text qname=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;, an index is created on &lt;test&gt; alone. What is passed to Lucene is the string value of &lt;test&gt;, which includes the text of all its descendant text nodes. With such an index, one cannot search for the nodes below &lt;test&gt;, e.g. for &amp;lt;p&gt; or &lt;name&gt;, since such nodes have all been collapsed. If you want to be able to query descendant nodes, you should set up additional indexes on these, such as &lt;text qname=&quot;p&quot;/&gt; or &lt;text qname=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;.

If you define an index on a node path, as above with &lt;text match=&quot;//test&quot;/&gt;, the node structure below &lt;test&gt; is maintained in the index and you can still query descendant nodes, such as &amp;lt;p&gt; or &lt;name&gt;. This can be seen as a shortcut to establishing an index on all elements below &lt;test&gt;. Be aware that, according to the documentation, this feature is &quot;subject to change&quot; [http://exist-db.org/lucene.html#N1018D]. 

When deciding which approach to use, you should consider which parts of your document will be of interest as context for full text query. How narrow or broad to make it is best decided when considering concrete search scenarios. 

== Standard Lucene query syntax == 

eXist can process Lucene searches expressed in two kinds of query syntax, Lucene's standard query syntax and an XML syntax specific to eXist. In this section the standard query syntax is presented. This is the syntax one can expect a user to input in a search field.

A search for &quot;Ron&quot; in the current context will be expressed as [ft:query(., 'ron')]. The first argument holds the nodes to be searched, here &quot;.&quot;, the current context node. The second argument supplies the query string, here simply the word &quot;ron&quot;.

The ft:query() function allows the use of Lucene wildcards.  &lt;!--These are similar to those used by the legacy full text index's '''&amp;=''' and '''|=''' operators, but different from the full regular expressions supported by the legacy full text search functions text:match-all(), text:match-any(), and the standard XQuery function matches().--&gt;

&quot;?&quot; can be used for a single character and &quot;*&quot; for zero, one or more characters: &quot;edward&quot; is found with &quot;ed?ard&quot; and &quot;e*d&quot;. Lucene standard query syntax does not allow &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; to occur in the beginning of a word.  In eXist, however, it is possible to add an option to the query to allow leading wildcards in searches; see http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml#D2.2.5.10

Fuzzy searches, with &quot;~&quot; at the end of a word, make it possible to retrieve &quot;ron&quot; through &quot;don~&quot;. One can quantify the fuzziness, by appending a number between 0.0f and 1.0f, making it possible to retrieve &quot;ron&quot; by [ft:query(., 'don~0.6')], but not by [ft:query(., 'don~0.7')]. The amount of fuzziness is based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance]. The default is 0.5.

The boolean operators &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot; can be used, with the expected semantics.  There is a variant notation for this: [ft:query(., 'edward AND ron')] can also be written [ft:query(., '+edward +ron')]. [ft:query(., '+edward ron')] would require &quot;edward&quot;, but not &quot;ron&quot;, to be present. &quot;NOT&quot; can also be used: [ft:query(., 'edward NOT ron')] finds &quot;edward&quot; without &quot;ron&quot;. &quot;NOT&quot; can also be represented with &quot;-&quot;: [ft:query(., '+edward -ron')]. Operators can be grouped with parentheses, as in [ft:query(., '(edward OR ron) NOT things')].

Phrases can be searched for by putting them in quotation marks: [ft:query(., '&quot;other issues&quot;')].

Fields, proximity searches, range searches, boosting, and escaped reserved characters are not supported in eXist with queries using Lucene's standard query syntax. Boosting can be effected during indexing: [http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene.xml#D2.2.4.26 eXist Lucene Documentation].

See [http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/2_9_1/queryparsersyntax.html#Boosting%20a%20Term Lucene Query Parser Syntax]

== Indexing ==

Since we have indexed the &lt;test&gt; element as a path, the index includes descendant nodes, and queries for nested elements therefore also return hits:

     collection('/db/test')/test/p/name[ft:query(., 'edward')]
     collection('/db/test')/test/p[ft:query(name, 'edward')]

If we had indexed the qname test with &lt;text qname=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;, we would not be able to do so.
&lt;!--
This is contrary to what the documentation says. Additionally, there is no difference between &lt;text match=&quot;//test&quot;/&gt;, &lt;text
match=&quot;//test/*&quot;/&gt;, or &lt;text match=&quot;//test//*&quot;/&gt; in the
collections.xconf file, contrary to what I understood from the
documentation at &lt;http://demo.exist-db.org/lucene.xml#N10183&gt;. Is this a
discrepancy between docs and behaviour, and if so, which one is correct?
--&gt;

=== Stopwords ===
The standard Lucene analyser, activated in the above collection.conf file with ''&lt;analyzer class=&quot;org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer&quot;/&gt;'', applies the Lucene default list of English stop words and removes the following words from the index: a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is, it, no, not, of, on, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these, they, this, to, was, will, with.

If you wish to customize the list of stopwords, specify an analyzer with the absolute location on your file system of a text file in which the stopwords you wish to apply are listed separated by newlines, and reindex the collection.

&lt;analyzer class=&quot;org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer&quot;&gt;
	&lt;param name=&quot;stopwords&quot; type=&quot;java.io.File&quot; value=&quot;/tmp/stop.txt&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/analyzer&gt;

If you wish to make all words searchable, you can leave the stop.txt empty or omit the reference to stop.txt:

&lt;analyzer class=&quot;org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer&quot;&gt;
	&lt;param name=&quot;stopwords&quot; type=&quot;java.io.File&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/analyzer&gt;

After making these changes, restart eXist and reindex.

&lt;!--
One thing I do not understand was why it is that changing the contents of stop.txt and reindexing does not have any effect until a restart ….
Adam Retter:
eXist-db only reloads the Analyzer when its collection.xconf file is
changed. It has no idea that you have modified the external file
stops.txt. You could just do a 'touch' on the collection.xconf, before
you call reindex. There is probably a better solution...
--&gt;
&lt;!--
The [http://exist-db.org/lucene.html#N102F8 eXist Lucene Documentation] says that the whitespace
analyser does not apply a stopword filter, but this is not the case: ft:query() calls that query for
words like 'this', 'the' or 'by' return no hits at all:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
     collection('/db/test')//p[ft:query(., 'the OR this OR by')]
&lt;/source&gt;

In fact, the Lucene default list of English stop words are applied during indexing: a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is, it, no, not, of, on, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these, they, this, to, was, will, with. 
--&gt;

== Ranking ==

Lucene assigns a relevance score or rank to each match.   The more frequently a word occurs in a document, the higher the score.  This score is preserved by eXist and can be accessed through the score function, which returns a decimal value.

 for $m in collection('/db/test')//p[ft:query(., 'tests ron')]
   let $score := ft:score($m)
   order by $score descending
   return 
   &lt;hit score=&quot;{$score}&quot;&gt;{$m}&lt;/hit&gt;

The higher the score, the more relevant is the hit.


== Boosting Values ==
The configuration file can be set up to apply higher search weights to specific elements within your document.  So for example a match of a keyword in the title of a book will rank that search higher than matches in the body of the book.

== Legacy Full Text Search Vs. Lucene XML Search ==
The following queries are equivalent (apart from the index used):

=== Matching any terms === 
To express the &quot;match any&quot; (|=) legacy style full text query using the new Lucene query function:

 collection('/db/test')//p[. |= 'tests edward']

you would use the following:
 
 collection('/db/test')//p[ft:query(.,
   &lt;query&gt;
     &lt;bool&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;should&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/term&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;should&quot;&gt;edward&lt;/term&gt;
     &lt;/bool&gt;
   &lt;/query&gt;)]

=== matching all terms === 
To express the &quot;match all&quot; (&amp;=) legacy full text query using the new Lucene query function:

 collection('/db/test')//p[. &amp;= 'tests edward']

you would use the following:

 collection('/db/test')//p[ft:query(., 
   &lt;query&gt;
     &lt;bool&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;must&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/term&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;must&quot;&gt;edward&lt;/term&gt;
     &lt;/bool&gt;
   &lt;/query&gt;)]

=== matching no terms ===
To express the &quot;match none&quot; (not + |=) legacy full text query using the new Lucene query function:

 collection('/db/test')//p[not(. |= 'issues edward')]

you would use the following:

 collection('/db/test')//p[not(ft:query(., 
   &lt;query&gt;
     &lt;bool&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;should&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/term&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;should&quot;&gt;edward&lt;/term&gt;
     &lt;/bool&gt;
   &lt;/query&gt;))]

Note that the last one could '''&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;''' be expressed as:

 collection('/db/test')//p[ft:query(., 
   &lt;query&gt;
     &lt;bool&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;not&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/term&gt;
       &lt;term occur=&quot;not&quot;&gt;edward&lt;/term&gt;
     &lt;/bool&gt;
   &lt;/query&gt;)]

because Lucene's NOT operator can't be used on its own, without the presence of a 'positive' search term. 
&lt;!--Maybe that's
something to point out in the documentation of the XML query syntax
[http://demo.exist-db.org/lucene.xml#N102F9 Lucene Docs]--&gt;

== XML Query Syntax vs. Default Lucene Syntax==
Following queries are equivalent, and can be tested against the Shakespeare examples shipped with eXist, by supplying them as value for $query in this XQuery snippet:
&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;highlight-matches=both&quot;;
let $query := 'query'
return //SPEECH[ft:query(., $query)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background-color:silver&quot;&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;search type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;Lucene syntax&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;XML syntax&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/th&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;fuzzy search, no similarity parameter&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;snake~&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;query&gt;
  &lt;fuzzy&gt;snake&lt;/fuzzy&gt;
&lt;/query&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;fuzzy search, with similarity parameter&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;snake~0.3&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;query&gt;
  &lt;fuzzy min-similarity=&quot;0.3&quot;&gt;snake&lt;/fuzzy&gt;
&lt;/query&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Mind the gaps in the table above! In standard Lucene syntax you can't express:

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regular expressions: this is a unique feature of eXist's XML query syntax, by means of the &lt;regex&gt; element&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ordering of proximity search terms: this is a unique feature of eXist's XML query syntax, by means of the @ordered attribute on &lt;near&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


Finally, a more complex case, in which boolean operator are grouped to override default priority rules:

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;background-color:silver&quot;&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;search type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;Lucene syntax&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;XML syntax&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;groups of boolean search operators&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(fillet OR malice) AND snake&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;query&gt;
  &lt;bool&gt;
    &lt;bool occur=&quot;must&quot;&gt;
      &lt;term occur=&quot;should&quot;&gt;fillet&lt;/term&gt;
      &lt;term occur=&quot;should&quot;&gt;malice&lt;/term&gt;
    &lt;/bool&gt;
    &lt;term occur=&quot;must&quot;&gt;snake&lt;/term&gt;
  &lt;/bool&gt;
&lt;/query&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Note how:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grouping in standard Lucene syntax can be expressed with nesting in XML syntax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for nested &lt;bool&gt; operators, the @occur attribute can be specified as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Notes on Using Wildcards ==

Note that if you include a wildcard in your string the &lt;wildcard&gt; element must be used to enclose the string:

The following:

   //SPEECH[ft:query(., 'fennny sna*')]

is equivlant to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $query :=
&lt;query&gt;
  &lt;term&gt;fen&lt;/term&gt;
  &lt;wildcard&gt;sna*&lt;/wildcard&gt;
&lt;/query&gt;
return
   //SPEECH[ft:query(., $query)]
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The example in section &quot;Example of cascaded primary keys and mixed OneToOne and ManyToOne mapping annotations using PrimaryKeyJoinColumn&quot; seems all wrong. PrimaryKeyJoinColumn is used on classes only (cf. ejb3 spec 9.1.32: PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation.)

:Nope, this is correct.  Although one of the less understood parts of the spec, PrimaryKeyJoinColumn can be used on OneToOne mapping.  The annotations is not restricted to class, and allows field/method.  The class comment also define usage in a OneToOne mapping.
:See, https://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/PrimaryKeyJoinColumn.html.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Blindspot three cars illus.svg|thumb|The blue car's driver sees the green car through his mirrors but cannot see the red car without turning to check his '''blind spot'''.]]



'''Blind spots''' are the areas of the that cannot be seen while looking forward or through either the [[w:rear-view mirror|rear-view]] or side mirrors. Blind spots can be eliminated by careful adjustment of side and rear-view mirrors or by adding another mirror with a larger [[w:field of view|field of view]].

== Disadvantages of blind spots ==
Blind spots, as the name suggests, completely hide any object completely positioned within them from the driver's normal field of vision.  While looking forward, a driver can check his side and rear areas via mirrors and peripheral vision; any area outside the scope of the mirrors becomes effectively invisible to the driver without dangerously distracting actions such as turning the head to check them.

Because blind spots hide objects, the driver must divert his vision from the road to verify them before making such maneuvers as turns and lane changes.  This places the driver in a risky situation:  unchecked forward road hazards, such as pedestrians rushing out from behind a parked car, can present themselves in the fraction of time devoted to checking the blind spot; pedestrians, animals, parked cars pulling out without properly checking the road, and other hazards quickly result in collisions.  In the case of a parked car pulling out improperly, the force can skew the vehicle's path into the next lane, causing a larger accident or a head-on collision with other traffic.

A large enough blind spot can completely hide a small pedestrian, small motorcycle, or even a full vehicle.  Larger vehicles, raised vehicles, and different shaped vehicles such as hatch backs and SUVs have larger blind spots; while a small Sedan may hide little more than a compact motorcycle in its blind spot, a large SUV can hide an entire mid-sized Sedan, and a tractor-trailer can lose entire groups of vehicles behind it and near the right side.  Tractors are so high up that any normal sized vehicle immediately to the right sits well below the driver's field of vision.  Because of this, you must be aware of both the contents of your own blind spots and other vehicles' blind spots, and stay out of them.

== Dealing with blind spots ==
Because blind spots present such a large road hazard, you must remain completely aware of yours and others' blind spots, and deal with them properly.  In many cases, your own blind spots can be effectively eliminated by reducing them to such a size that nothing likely to be there while moving will fit in them.  In the case of other vehicles, you must be wary of where you sit with the vehicle, and validate that the driver can indeed see you.

=== Eliminating your own blind spots ===
You can effectively eliminate your own blind spots by adjusting your mirrors such that a small vehicle or motorcycle doesn't completely fit in the blind spot; that is, before the rear of the vehicle disappears into your blind spot, the front should become visible elsewhere.  As the vehicle leaves view of your side mirrors, it should come into your direct peripheral vision.  In this way, although you still have a substantial blind spot, you remain completely aware of anything currently in it, regardless of whether you were paying attention when it entered your blind spot or not.

==== Mirror adjustment ====
[[Image:Car mirror diagram no blindspot.png|thumb|200px|Mirrors adjusted to eliminate blind spots.  Notice that the cars don't fit in the blind spots; and peripheral vision or a quick glance to the left will reveal smaller things like motorcycles without a full check over the shoulder.]]

At the very least, and possibly most effective, a driver can and should adjust his mirrors to eliminate any blind spots around his car.  One study&lt;ref&gt;University of Michican.  [http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/49416?mode=full Field of view in passenger car mirrors].&lt;/ref&gt; found a disturbing trend for side-view mirrors, with 84% of them showing part of the vehicle's side in the left mirror, with the vehicle taking up an average of 21% of the mirror's viewing area.  Similarly, 78% of drivers placed their vehicle's side in the right mirror.  The average horizontal viewing angles were 12.9 for the left, 25.3 for the rear-view, and 22.5 for the right; for comparison, the diagrams to the right use 15, 30, and 30.

To properly adjust the side- and rear-view mirrors, a driver should make sure the viewing angles don't overlap.  There should be enough of a gap that a smaller blind spot is formed, much too small to squeeze a vehicle into; when a vehicle exits the viewing area of the rear-view mirror, it will then inevitably enter the viewing area of a side-view mirror.  In this way, all objects in a driver's blind spots will be partially visible in some area visible to the driver, and thus known rather than hidden.

A driver can follow a simple method&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Guodong.  [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gdguo/driving/BlindSpot.htm How To Eliminate The Dreaded &quot;Blind Spot.&quot;]  University of Wisconson-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; for eliminating blind spots:

#Adjust the rear view mirror to give a direct rear view.
#Lean to the left, towards the driver's side window.  From this position, adjust the mirror to just barely show the side of the car.
#Lean to the right, centering your head inside the vehicle.  From this position, adjust the right mirror such that you can again just barely see the side of the car.
#Verify visibility when in comfortable driving position.  Also verify the vertical alignment of your mirrors; you want to watch down the road, not at the street or sky.

Once the driver has set up his mirrors, he must make sure they don't create large blind spots near the rear corners or passenger doors.  If a small motorcycle or bicycle rider can't hide there, then a small car certainly can't.  Bicycle riders, by the way, provide a huge pedestrian hazard on city roads; they can pace 30mph with your vehicle, and hide in a wide enough blind spot, so that area definitely needs a small enough blind spot to expose cyclists!

It may take some time for a driver to get used to not having a proper frame of reference with their car.  The mirror no longer contains the vehicle, and thus objects in the mirror seem disconnected and abstract; eventually, though, the spatial reference will become inherent to the driver, and driving will become much easier and safer.

==== Wider field-of-view mirrors ====
A mirror with a wider field-of-view allows for more of the road to show in the mirrors, greatly increasing the visual information available from your mirrors.  This allows for greater blind spot elimination using the techniques above, since your mirrors can see more and possibly even overlap.

==== Blind spot mirrors ====
So-called &quot;blind spot mirrors&quot; add a high-distortion, very wide field-of-view mirror to the corner of your normal mirror.  These come in many shapes and sizes, some even with separate ball joint adjustment; they all perform in different manners, too.  Some simply cover the same viewing center as your mirror, but much wider, giving a wide-view picture-in-picture; others give a hugely magnified view of your blind spot, basically showing just a vehicle with no context when something's there.  In any case, they do remove some normal viewing area from the side mirrors, with the exception of a few models that stack a wide-view mirror on top of your existing mirror assembly.

In general, blind spot mirrors take time to get used to.  A driver must train himself to understand what the blind spot mirror relays, and how it fits into the geometry of the vehicle.  Oftentimes a quick glance at a blind spot mirror provides a discontinuous, confusing piece of visual information to an untrained driver; of course, given the complex decision making and the wealth of other readily available information, said driver will simply ignore the additional information.  Until properly trained to use it, the blind spot mirror provides no advantage, and slight disadvantage due to reduced area of side view mirrors.

*Inspect tires for damage and visible signs of deflation
*Listen for brake squeal; any such strange noises from brakes require immediate service
*Inspect brake fluid level; top off if needed; have brake system inspected immediately if brake fluid level doesn't hold

Each fill-up:

*Completely fill the fuel tank; do not top off
*Check the brake fluid level
*Check the coolant level and hoses
*Check the oil level
*Check the tire pressure with a pressure gauge
*Check the tire tread with a tread depth gauge
*Visually inspect all belts and hoses for disturbing cracks or missing materials
*Top off the wiper fluid

      <comment>/* Tire selection */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cleanup}}

'''Brake and tire selection''' plays a large role in vehicle handling, stability, stopping power, and safety.  High-friction brake pads, functional brake fluid, and enhanced brake parts can bring the wheels to a faster stop; poor tires however will not provide enough traction for the car to stop under load, or make tight and complex maneuvers.  Because of the involvement of both brakes and tires in accelerating, maneuvering, and braking, both must be of high quality for the operating conditions the vehicle will experience.

== Brake selection ==
The entire brake system must support braking for the operating conditions the vehicle will experience.  High-performance brakes for street driving, for example, will overheat and fail on the race track; while rally brakes intended for extreme conditions need to warm up before providing any significant braking force, and won't stop a vehicle as well as the lowest quality street brakes if not heated to temperatures experienced while racing.

=== Brake pads ===
Brake pads, for disc brakes, come in a variety of materials for varied applications.  They mainly generate heat through friction, siphoning momentum to do this, slowing the car down.  Because of this, hot brake pads do not function very well, and the brake system must get adequate cooling to remove the energy completely from the system, thus slowing the vehicle down.

Brake pads must always match their intended use.  High-performance pads for the proper application must be fitted to the car; pads for alternate applications do not function as well, and sometimes outright fail under stress.  For example, metallic race brakes will provide little stopping power when pulling out of a driveway in the morning; ceramic street brakes will outright explode under the stress generated at 160mph on the race track.

Brake pads commonly use a few specific material types, although others exist.  These mainly tune towards one application; however, specialized race brakes that still supply excellent grab in standard driving conditions do exist, and are a viable option for a weekend-racer daily driver.  Some common material types are listed here.

*'''Organic''' - Street-ready brakes that supply decent grab in standard driving conditions.
*'''Ceramic''' - Street-ready brakes that supply excellent grab in standard driving conditions.  Often mixed with copper filings, ceramic brakes provide low-noise, low-dust, high-performance operation.
*'''Semi-metallic''' - Typical material for racing brakes.
*'''Metallic''' - Another typical material for racing brakes, used in high-temperature, high-stress applications.

When considering brake pads, don't forget to consider the fluid.  Brakes remove heat through rotors, calipers, and brake fluid lines; if the brakes get hot, they'll boil brake fluid, and then the vehicle won't stop.  In general, you can always use a similar brake fluid of a higher rating, for example synthetic DOT5 hydraulic fluid in a DOT3 system, regardless of application.  You should avoid using different fluids, for example silicon DOT5 in a mineral oil hydraulic fluid DOT5 system.  A higher DOT rating means the fluid will boil at a higher temperature, allowing the brakes to get hotter before failure.

==Tire selection==
The selection of tires used on a vehicle controls its traction with the road in various conditions, which has a primary effect on its handling, braking ability, and general safety.  Poor quality tires or tires designed for the wrong season will supply little traction, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle under sever or even moderate handling stress and increasing braking distance.  In some conditions, steering and braking can become entirely impossible.  Because of this, tire selection is one of the most important decisions a driver must make; even with failed brakes, a driver can steer a vehicle off the road.

Sites such as ''Tire Rack''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tirerack.com/ Tire Rack]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tire Monkey''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiremonkey.com/ Tire Monkey]&lt;/ref&gt;provide reviews and traction ratings for various tires.  This allows the driver to research the wet, dry, snow, and ice traction of tires; as well as hydroplaning resistance, ride comfort, general handling, and tread wear.

=== Driving conditions ===
Various driving conditions pose various stresses on tires.  In general, there are two major driving conditions a driver must consider:  ''Summer'' and ''Winter''.  These conditions correspond to weather conditions in moderate-climate environments.  In some cases, a driver may have to drive ''Off-road'', or on ''Unpaved roads'' such as dirt or gravel roads, both requiring specialized tires and vehicles.

In ''Summer'' driving conditions, the weather stays relatively warm.  At times the road will be quite dry and smooth; at other times, very wet.  Summer tires must have a number of traction features to cope with these variations.  They must have excellent wet and dry traction to cope with both rain and dry land well.  They must also ''resist hydroplaning'':  Many tires will handle on wet road excellently, but ride up onto the surface of the water under enough force; tires which resist hydroplaning will do this briefly or not at all, quickly plowing down through the water's surface to reach solid road.

In ''Winter'' driving conditions, the weather stays cold.  Winter tires must meet much more demanding performance specifications because of the varied conditions cold weather causes.  For example, dry road may have a layer of salt, powdered snow, or even patches of ice on it.  The road may have a thin or thick layer of dry, soft snow; it may have a coating of hard, compacted snow; it may have a mixture of snow and water, creating slushy and icy situations.  Wet-traction tires won't deal with any of these; and tires that can deal with watery slush may not channel water away in the rain, but in the winter season they won't need to very often.

In ''Off-road'' conditions, the tires will encounter mud, dirt, gravel, rocks, grassy wooded areas, and the like.  Off-road vehicles have greatly upgraded suspension systems to handle this sort of stress; they require special tires that can bite through mud and into dirt.  Such tires likely won't resist hydroplaning or get as much traction in the rain or snow as Summer or Winter tires.

''Unpaved roads'' demand completely different considerations.  Dirt roads require more of an off-road tire with bite on dirt and mud.  Gravel roads are dirt roads covered in loose rocks, requiring more driver care and tires that can shift most of the loose rocks out of the way for decent bite against something solid.  Unpaved roads do not allow for great acceleration, sharp handling, or fast braking; tire consideration is less significant, but still important.

=== Summer, Winter, and All-Season ===
In typical conditions, drivers will see either ''Summer'' or ''Winter'' conditions; other driving conditions are more specialized and localized either to sport driving or small, undeveloped localities.  This leaves the driver with the task of selecting between not only ''Summer'' or ''Winter'' tires, but also ''All-Season'' tires which supply good handling in all conditions.

''All-Season'' tires compare favorably with ''Summer'' and ''Winter'' tires in all conditions; however, specialized tires may perform better.  For example, [http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Goodyear&amp;tireModel=Assurance+TripleTred Goodyear Assurance TripleTred all-season tires] supply better summer handling than [http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Michelin&amp;tireModel=X-Ice+Xi2 Michelin X-Ice Xi2 studless winter tires], but not as good snow and ice handling.  [http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Bridgestone&amp;tireModel=Potenza+RE050A+Pole+Position Bridgestone Potenza RE050A Pole Position tires] supply excellent dry traction and almost as good wet traction as the TripleTred tires, but virtually no traction on snow and ice.

Another consideration for specialized tire selection is tire performance over wear cycle.  The Michelin X-Ice Xi2 tires, and other similar studless winter tires, loses its snow handling capabilities as the tread wears.  Using these tires as All-Season tires would cripple them for winter conditions.  Other snow tires may simply not have decent hydroplane resistance, or barely decent dry handling, rather being designed to give some traction in the snow; these such tires cannot safely be used in the summer.

In general, for areas which have a mild Winter season and experience mostly dry, non-icy conditions, decent dry-traction All-Season tires provide the greatest balance.  All-Season tires will provide viable traction for the five days a year it actually snows, if driven with care.  By contrast, for drivers in a hotter climate area such as California, Florida, or New Mexico, summer tires provide the best performance year-round; and in a snowy climate such as Alaska or Siberia, winter tires are basically essential.

Many areas experience both a mild summer and an active winter season.  New York, Connecticut, and various parts of Europe all experience a warm summer season and a winter season with plenty of light or deep snow, ice, and slush.  For these, the advantage of proper Winter tires definitely justifies having them; but proper Summer tires are necessary as well.  Drivers in these areas should get a second set of wheels and equip them with proper Winter tires.  During the Summer season, vehicles should use good Summer or All-Season tires; when it begins to snow, the driver should jack the car up and change all the tires for Winter tires.  A cheap impact wrench will make this a half-hour job.

*Never buy retreaded tires or bargain-brand cheap tires.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This a a great article that praises the relationships between schools and communities.  The author's first hand account of his high school experience is a wonderful addition.  In my teaching exeriences, I have had my class adopted by a local business through the &quot;Adopt-A-Class&quot; program.  The business provided school supplies, classroom materials, monetary support, and more importantly, served as role models for the students.  Business leaders were present for grade level programs, seasonal celebrations &amp; parties, and even the last day of school.  Each class in our school also has a &quot;lunch buddy&quot; who eats lunch with them once a week.  The children are always excited to see their lunch buddies and talk their ears off.  I believe that community support is a necessity if you want to build a strong, successful school.  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 18:31, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Community-school partnerships are very important and helpful for student learning.  Another kind of community-school partnership that is not mentioned in this article is a program to help students get a better understanding of the different kinds of careers out there and how they work.  Community businesses and other organizations could volunteer to have students come shadow certain people in certain professions.  This would give students a better understanding of what certain careers are like, and it would help them to make decisions further in advance about what kind of career they would like to pursue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Caution|Please refer to documentation provided by the vehicle manufacturer before carrying out maintenance. In particular, you may invalidate any warranty by performing maintenance yourself. Engines contain dangerous fluids and may be hot. Environmental protection laws may restrict the maintenance you can perform and the disposal of fluids}}


Many factors go into determining the maintenance period.  In the absence of specific guidance from the manufacturer, a perform minor service should be performed no less than once every 10,000 miles or once per year, whichever occurs first, regardless of any and all conditions. With good conventional oils in modern engines, service intervals of 15,000 miles or more are viable.

==Minor Service ==

=== Oil change ===
At each minor service interval, an oil change must be performed.  Oil lubricates and cleans the engine, and transfers heat to the oil pan and crank case; dirty oil becomes less effective at all of these things, and may fail to flow through smaller channels, starving small moving parts for oil and leading to engine damage.

Cheap motor oils such as gas station and auto parts store brands should be avoided.  Higher end brands like Valvoline and Mobil 5000 supply much better quality oil than these; but other common brands such as Prestone and Castrol do provide superior quality motor oils as well.  The major difference between $1.50 gas station oil and $4 name-brand oil is the additives in the oil:  the viscosity stabilizers and anti-wear additives in Valvoline are selected, tested, balanced, and adjusted to compete with Mobil, Prestone, and Castrol GTX for engine protection and oil life; the viscosity stabilizers and anti-wear additives in cheap motor oil are there to get it an SAE 5W30 rating, and nothing more.

When it comes to conventional and synthetic blends, there's little price difference; this is because synthetic blends can contain 5% synthetic oil and still be marketed as synthetic blends.  Full synthetic will outperform synthetic blend in all cases, with a higher price tag; however, full synthetic should not be used in an engine with oil leaks, or on the first 3000 miles of a new engine.  An engine that performs well and doesn't leak or burn oil can safely accept full synthetic oil.  Rotary engines, such as those in the Mazda RX-8, must use conventional oil.

All manner of heavier oils, lighter oils, and oil additives should be avoided, except perhaps for anti-wear agents in special circumstances; older engines require zinc additives to prevent major wear, and newer oil does not contain this.  Beyond this, oil additives serve little purpose except to cover up problems such as worn pistons and valves.  Some additives help muffle engine knocking, but the pre-ignition causing it continues to damage the engine.  Oil stabilizers such as Lucas can cause the oil to maintain gas bubbles, reducing lubrication and cooling; they can also thicken the oil, reducing flow to small engine parts.

Heavier oils and oil additives that thicken oils both cause reduced oil flow.  A heavier oil will help prevent blow-by, improving power output from the engine; however, it will also impede flow through smaller oil channels, starving small moving parts for oil and causing engine damage.  Lighter oils will help improve gas mileage by flowing easier; however, heavier oils provide more lubrication, so lighter oils than manufacturer specified will cause increased engine wear.  The manufacturer specification is the heaviest oil safe to use in the engine, and should be followed whenever possible.

Finally, the oil filter must be changed at every service.  A high-quality oil filter should be used; such filters often use a greater surface area inside, multiple layers of filter material, metal structural parts, and superior bypass mechanisms.  Because of this, they are able to provide more fine-particle filtration, better flow, better durability, longer operational life, and more reliable recovery from oil filter failure.  Most low-end store brand filters are FRAM; high-end filters like K&amp;N Gold and Mobil 1 tend to cost $10 instead of $5.  FRAM makes high-end filters for use by NASCAR, which operate on a completely different design than the commonly rebranded FRAM filters.

=== Tire rotation and inspection ===
On most vehicles, tires wear unevenly.  Imbalanced suspension systems, asymmetric weight distribution, driving conditions, and two-wheel-drive layouts cause some tires to experience more stress than others.  Even a proper all-wheel drive vehicle supplies power to the rear wheels, and uses a fluid coupling to distribute power to the front wheels when the rear wheels slip; this means that all-wheel drive and two-wheel drive vehicles wear the rear wheels faster, while front-wheel drive vehicles wear the front wheels faster.

At each service, the tires should be rotated to even out wear distribution.  For directional tires, the rear tires should switch with the front on the same side; for non-directional tires, the set not getting power should swap.  So, rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles would move the front-left tire to the back-right, and the front-right to the back-left; the back-left would move to the front-left, and the back-right to the front-right.  Front-wheel drive tires would cross the rear tires instead.  This greatly improves tread life, allowing the tires to last much longer than if they just stay at the same positions.

A tire inspection should be performed while rotating the tires.  Any excessive tread wear requires replacement of the tires; any uneven tread wear requires repair to the suspension system, possibly something as simple as a front-end alignment.  Such a tire inspection can reveal minor but serious problems that a mechanic can correct before the stress on the suspension system or other components creates a much more serious and more expensive to repair problem.  Fixing such issues also tends to allow the wheels to turn more freely, improving handling, power, and fuel economy.

The tire pressure should be checked at each service as well.  Any mechanic can easily fill tires to the proper pressure, reducing wear and improving handling, traction, and fuel economy.  Many mechanics perform a tire inspection and inflation as part of any service involving the wheels or tires, such as a tire rotation.

=== Brake inspection ===
When the tires come off the car for rotation, the brakes are exposed.  At this point, the brake system can be inspected, cleaned, and bled; at the very minimum, a brake inspection should be performed.  Oftentimes brake calipers will become unbalanced, or brake fluid will leak, or brake pads will be worn enough that a visible inspection will reveal the need for repair well before the driver feels any trouble with the brake system.  A skilled mechanic can detect all of these problems just by briefly examining the braking mechanism during a tire change or rotation; many mechanics inspect the brakes as part of any service that requires removal of the tires.

Brake parts can also be gently serviced while the wheels are off.  This includes cleaning with brake parts cleaner, as well as a more labor intensive bleeding of the brake system to remove any trapped air, if required.  Excess trapped air may indicate a brake system leak, a low brake pad needing replacement, a replaced part such as a brake caliper, or old brake fluid requiring a brake system flush.  Excess trapped air ''will'' decrease braking force, and eventually lead to brake system failure.  Brake bleeding usually isn't required unless some other problem exists or was recently corrected by a parts change.

=== Body and chassis lubrication ===
The vehicle body requires regular lubrication for all hinges and joints to prevent wear and rusting.  This is typically as simple as using a small oil can to inject motor oil into the hinges and latches of the doors, hood, and trunk.  The locking mechanisms can also be lubricated through the key hole with the proper lubrication.

In some vehicles, the CV joints and other suspension components need grease injected into the boots occasionally; in others, the boots seal well enough that the same lubricant lasts for the service interval of the joint itself.  A mechanic can perform this service in the course of a normal oil change, for additional cost; this greatly improves performance and lifetime of the vehicle.  Many vehicles only require this at longer intervals, such as 30,000 miles.

=== Fluid and belt inspections ===
All minor inspections should occur during a minor service.  This includes the inspection and topping off of all fluid levels including coolant, transmission fluid, brake fluid, clutch fluid, battery water, and wiper fluid; as well as all hoses and belts in the vehicle.  A mechanic may notice problems with these systems that the driver had not noticed during minor inspections at fueling, such as dry-rotted hoses or belts.

Some co-ed schools are moving to single-sex classrooms. What do you think: would our schools be more effective if students were separated by gender?

== Keep the boys/girls out! I can't concentrate with all those hotties around. ==

It might be better in high school where the opposite sex can distract students but I think there are benefits of co-ed education in elementary school.Boys and girls do learn differently but they can also learn from each other how to process information differently. Some experiments with all boy classrooms have been moderately successful. It is definitely a subject that needs more testing done before we can conclude that separation is a good move.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 04:43, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I'm for this if I can be the exception to the rule. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:09, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Boys and girls learn differently.  They literally see differently.  Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way.  The male eye is attuned to motion and directions.  Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space.  Teachers should move around the classroom constantly and be that object for male students.  

The male eye is also drawn to cooler colors like silver, blue, black, grey, and brown. It’s no accident boys tend to create pictures of moving objects like spaceships, cars, and trucks in dark colors instead of drawing the happy colorful family, like girls in their class.

The female eye, on the other hand, is drawn to textures and colors. It’s also oriented toward warmer colors—reds, yellow, oranges—and visuals with more details, like faces. To engage girls, teachers don’t need to move as much, if at all. Girls work well in circles, facing each other. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color in overhead presentations or on the chalkboard gets their attention.

Boys and girls also hear differently. When someone speaks in a loud tone, girls interpret it as yelling.  They think you’re mad and can shut down. Girls have a more finely tuned aural structure; they can hear higher frequencies than boys and are more sensitive to sounds. Girls’ teachers should watch the tone of their voices. Boys’ teachers should sound matter of fact, even excited. 

A boy’s nervous system causes them to be more alert when they’re standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 69 degrees. Stress in boys tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. This won’t work for girls, who are more focused seated in a warmer room around 75 degrees. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and confrontation, blood goes to their guts, leaving them feeling nervous or anxious.

Boys rise to risks and tend to overestimate their abilities. Teachers can help them by getting them to be more realistic about results. Girls at this age shy away from risk.  Teachers can help them learn to take risks in an atmosphere where they feel confident about doing so.

These differences can be accommodated in the classroom.  Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 14:20, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== Forget it! We don't separate the genders in real life. Students are going to have to get used to operating in the real world. ==


I do not agree that students should be put in single sex classrooms.  I believe that children at any age are going to socialize and are going to be distracted at times during the schoolsday regardless if a boy or girl is sitting next to each other.  I have many guy friends and I feel I would have performed the same whether I was in a coed class or a class with only girls. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 23:13, 2 August 2009 (UTC) 

I wouldn't like the idea of separating boys and girls in classrooms.  The only class that I know where boys and girls are separated in is PE at the middle school level.  A man has the boys and a woman has the girls. No other time are the boys separated from the girls or vice versa. It makes no sense to separate the genders.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:49, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I think separating boys and girls in class is crazy. Most of my best friends are boys and I would have felt completely out of my element in an all girl classroom setting. Students need to interact with the opposite sex starting when they are younger in order to make healthy relationships and learn from each other. If this was a one sex world then, sure, but males and females must interact everyday on a continuous basis in the &quot;real&quot; world, so separating kids when they are younger does not make any sense. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:05, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


I think that single-sex classrooms are taking a step back, and not a step forward.  Seriously, the real world isn't separated into male/female so our schools shouldn't be either, especially not publically funded ones.  I think that some people who argue FOR single-sex argue that students can concentrate better without the opposite sex around...but children should learn how to do this while going to mixed classes.  How else would they learn?  There is evidence that children do better in classes that are separated because girls and boys learn differently, but how are these kids going to do compared to their peers years later?[[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:17, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I do not think that separating the genders is a beneficial thing at all! Although boys and girls are different in many ways (and at certain ages can be very distracting to one another) I think that we have a lot to learn from the other sex. If we are going to encourage diversity in many other ways, we must also incorporate both girls and boys in the same classroom. I don't think that it does the children any good to learn this way (separately). I think that if we wish to share true learning experiences, things that can carry through to their adult lives, we must make things realistic and teach to both sexes together!

Separating genders is entirely counter productive to the public school system. A lot of what you learn when you attend public schools (outside of how to give swirlies, awful waffles (Salute Your Shorts reference, anyone?), and how to hate your own acne grease encrusted face) is social skills. How to work well and get You know, when it comes to education and competing to be the best, one has to wonder if this concept might actually have some merrit. Studies have shown that boys and girls learn differently and at a different pace. As for classroom management, I think this may be a good idea to try out. I cannot tell you how many times I have witnessed boys acting out to impress the girls in the classroom and vice versa. Yes, school should have some type of socialization...but academics should be the main focus. I think it may prove beneficial for the student, as well as, the teacher. I think if we separated the genders in main academic classes, as well as, require school/parent approved uniforms we might see an increase in academic achievement as long as the teacher gears their lesson plans towards gender specific lessons. Just my thoughts...[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:50, 1 August 2009 (UTC)along with others. You establish academic relationships, you build your little clicks, and you make some good friends in the process. As I type this, I'm laying out clothes for a wedding I'm going to over the weekend– a best friend of the opposite sex that I met in high school and have maintained that friendship for almost a decade. One has to not be so single-minded in terms of gender, and you get this way by conversing with and befriending the opposite sex. Hormones and nifty bits aside, we are essentially similar, but yet oh-so different. To deprive a working knowledge of gender-relations to someone all throughout their development into adults seems like a severe crime. What's the danger? Something natural occurring? [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:20, 31 July 2009 (UTC) 

I not sure that separating schools by gender will have any more of an effect than making students wear uniforms. I am not for either of those ideas. Are teachers separated by sex also? If so, wouldn’t the boys be over crowded? Do they all have separate lunch and recess times?    [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 22:01, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

No, I do not think there would be any benefit to separating the genders in school.  I really do not think it makes a difference at all whether they are separated or not.  The only time I can think it is done in schools now is when we are talkin about family life and I would say yes, there is one reason as to why we would separate the class by gender.  I believe that it is beneficial for boys and girls to work together in one environment.  I think by separating them there would not be that comfort and could possibly cause problems for individuals. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 18:36, 31 July 2009 (UTC)  

I think separating boys/girls is a bad idea.  Having both genders in the classroom adds variety different beliefs and perspectives.  In school I believe that it is very beneficial for students to work with peers of both genders to learn to value individual differences.  It is important for students to learn to work together effectively while encouraging each other.  You can learn a lot from your peers.  In society or when you enter the workforce you will definitely be working with both genders so why separate in schools.  That idea makes me think of years ago when schools were segregated.  I am a mom of 2 young children, a boy and girl.  I would not want them to be separated with just boys or girls in school.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 00:38, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I don't believe that classrooms would be more effective by separating genders. Having different genders in the classroom allows for differing perspectives on issues and topics. It also allows for a sense of relief so students can work in groups with members of the opposite gender, and be exposed to different personality types according to gender. I feel that restricting the genders in the classroom would not be beneficial for learning. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 20:29, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I do not believe that our schools would be better if separated by gender. Students need to know and understand the different perspectives of both genders. The personalities of males and females differ and these differences need to be celebrated in the classroom. Working in groups and teams of both genders will help prepare students for the real world. If genders were restricted in the classroom, I do not think that students would get the most of out of the classroom learning experience. I know from my school years, I enjoyed working with both genders in groups and teams and I feel that most students would find this beneficial. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 21:05, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I think separating students by gender is a terrible idea. I'm sure whoever came up with the idea has some good reasons, but all in all, it is a faulty idea. In the adult world, there are hardly any situations where males and females are separated, so it is not a good idea to have students used to this. Also, males and females have different views on the same topic, so having the genders together provides for better learning. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 22:26, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Separating students by gender only seems to cause further difficulties down the road. In real life gender issues abound, if school skills are intended to transfer over to career skills most students will be working with or at least around members of the opposite sex. Removing this experience from their education would be more harmful than helpful to their &quot;social&quot; education. Much like how students who attend home school tend to have weaker social skills, and social cue recognition, separating the genders may cause students to lose, or at least, stint their ability to interact normally with the opposite sex. In a world where not only qualifications but also demeanor and connections are what get you gainfully employed, social education is as important as academic education.[[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 14:55, 31 July 2009 (UTC)


I think that separating genders would do more harm than good. When we start our careers we will have to collabrate with the opposite gender to achieve a task or goal. If we separate the genders in school then they will be less likely to work together later on in life. This might also cause a superiority complex with one gender  thinking that they are better than the other. Secondly, how many times have kids studied harder and excelled in a certain class just to show out for the opposite gender? More times than you think. Especially when the hottie is extremly smart. I just don't think it is a good idea. The social scence would be awkward and could have negative effects later on in life. Emotions and hormones in the teenage years run wild and these could cause the same genders to butt heads so to speak. I think that is called male-male competition or female-female competition. I think it is better to leave them together to learn. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:05, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Separating students by gender is a joke.  I agree, in high school, students are often distracted by the opposite sex.  When did that become so though?  Outside of the classroom, both genders will have to interact with one another.  Men and women, boys and girls, need to have a solid understanding of how to work together as teams.  These partnerships are something natural that will go on for the rest of students’ lives.  If we separated them, how would they learn about the opposite sex?  How would they come to respect each other for their differences?  I say, no way to this type of segregation.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 18:59, 31 July 2009 (UTC)


I believe that having classes separated by gender is unnecessary.  If a parent wishes to send their child to a single-sex school that is their choice.  Life is not separated by gender.  Why should schools be separated by gender?  A child's school experience prepares them for real life.  As educators, we encourage our students to work together in order to discover new ideas, formulate solutions, and grow socially.  Classes based on gender would not provide these expereiences.  Teachers are tasked with preparing students for the &quot;real world,&quot; not supporting gender segregation.  In my opinion, the classroom is one of the most important environments in which boys and girls can learn about their differences.  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 19:17, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I do not think that classrooms should be separated by gender.  Although as time goes on it would solve many issues as the students approach middle school and high school, but in the real world this is not practical.  How do we teach children how to interact and respect children of the opposite sex if they do not have the chance to be around them on a continual basis?  I know that they do separate students when they are covering sex ed in schools, which is logical.  Aside from that specific conversation there is no reason that sexes should not be integrated.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 02:13, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

After all the movements, laws and social changes affected by gender, it would actually be extremely harmful to students if classroom were based on gender. Both sides would begin to think that they are better or worse in one subject than the opposite gender, leading to a generation of misconceptions. Single-sex classrooms would also lead to sexism among peers; at an impressionable period through elementary and even middle school, the county would be back at least 50 years. Although I am not a teacher yet, I see gender as another aspect of the diversity in the classroom. For example, some teachers may have difficulty teaching minorities. It is not because they are racist, but because they do not understand the culture behind each student. The same concept applies to boys and girls. Some teachers may feel that they can teacher girls better than boys or boys better than girls. This could be based on research showing how boys tend to learn math better while girls tend to learn language arts better. The solution to this? Educators could find strategies that are appropriate for both genders; a good example would be simulations with generic roles.  [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 02:41, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I do not really see the benefit of separating the sexes in different classrooms. Yes, males and females have differences among them, but there are also a lot of similarities also. They will be expected to work collaboratively later in life, so why should we isolate them now and not prepare them for the future? I also don't think that public schools should be able to have this option themselves. This is not a matter of just wearing a school uniform (which I also disagree with) but much more complicated. Separating the sexes will completely restructure social groups and I don't see any benefit. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 13:07, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that the idea to separate students by gender is useless, and unnecessary. Not to count the fact that it will be a more expensive procedure  on a already tight educational budget. I think that students (an to form an inclusive atmosphere) should work together just like they would in the real world. It enhances communication and social skills and also it makes students better team workers. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 16:49, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


Separating the students by gender is unrealistic. Not only would this practice be inconsistent with the real world, but it would also be a logistical nightmare for public schools, especially in more advanced classes that already have a hard time getting enough student interest. This would stretch our already limited qualified teaching staff twice as far as they are currently asked to be. If students do not learn the appropriate social skills in a co-ed setting now, when if not in school will they have such an opportunity. [[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:31, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


I would never ever consider separating the sexes in attempts to improve the educational environment. Personally, I don't believe gender relations has anything to do with a child's learning.  While it is understandable that lack of concentration may occur, both genders should learn to coexist in order to effectively interact in the future.  I think this form of separation would ultimately inhibit a child's social behavior and should in no way be considered for implementation. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 02:14, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


I think that the title for this section is the perfect way to think about it. The real world isn't separated by sex so the classroom shouldn't be either. I will admit it will decrease on somethings that are unnecessary in the classroom, but it is the interaction between the sexes that makes high school what it is. Another thing that would change would be that men and women look at things in different ways. This is a problem because it will be harder for the other view point to be expressed.

== Well, maybe we should separate the students part of the time. ==

I think that when it comes to high school, there can be benefits to separating students by gender. At that age, both sexes are easily distracted by the opposite sex.  In a same sex school, boys and girls aren't trying to impress each another and are more free to concentrate on schoolwork and build social relationships.  Stereotypes based on gender are reduced (boys are smarter in math, girls do better in the arts).  My husband attended an all boys high school and wore a coat and tie to school everyday.  Dances were organized for his school so there was co gender socialization.  I am the Mom of a pre-teen daughter and if there was an all girls middle or high school in this area, I'd be first in line to enroll her.

You know, when it comes to education and competing to be the best, one has to wonder if this concept might actually have some merrit. Studies have shown that boys and girls learn differently and at a different pace. As for classroom management, I think this may be a good idea to try out. I cannot tell you how many times I have witnessed boys acting out to impress the girls in the classroom and vice versa. Yes, school should have some type of socialization...but academics should be the main focus. I think it may prove beneficial for the student, as well as, the teacher. I think if we separated the genders in main academic classes, as well as, require school/parent approved uniforms we might see an increase in academic achievement as long as the teacher gears their lesson plans towards gender specific lessons. Just my thoughts...[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:50, 1 August 2009 (UTC)


I think that the idea of separating the boys from the girls might be a good idea if done part time. Maybe if boys and girls were separated during elementary and middle school it would be beneficial. Girls and boys learn different, they may be better off without having the distraction of the other sex. Middle school is the most complicated and aquared years of life. Girls might develop a better sense of self esteem not having to compete with boys and not having to worry about their physical appearance at the moment, and I think boys would be less distracted by the physical of the female gender and focus more on scholastic achievement.

I think it would be a good idea to separate students part of the time.  I think creating single sex classrooms would in a lot of ways help the students to focus better.  On the other hand, homosexuality is growing in influence these days, and creating same sex classes would not solve the problem of having anxious and flirty homosexuals in the classroom.  Yet, in total, the amount of distractions would decline with the establishment of same sex classes.  Students could be given time to bond with opposite sex friends in certain courses such as PE during the school day.

== Absolutely, it gets the students actively involved and gives them more ownership of their own learning. ==

At first, i was curious about writing my own textbook, but I feel I have learned a lot from this experience.  I think that students can benefit from writing a textbook or working on a hands on project in the classroom.  I love writing so this experience for me was a positive one and I feel even if a student does not enjoy writing I think a project like this would make them feel good they contributed to something important. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 23:30, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I have to agree that when I found out that we were creating our own textbook I almost wanted to drop the class.  I am not big on writing so much, just give me some questions to answer from the textbook or better yet let me read the chapters and then give a summary of the chapters, but this lets me know what I can do and where I need improvement.  I have learned a lot by writing this textbook and it has given me a hindsight on the kind of  teacher I want to become.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:59, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I must admit that I was skeptical when I found out we were creating our own textbook.  Being a physical education teacher, I am not comfortable with my writing or editing skills.  Having this class really boosted my confidence in both areas.  I feel that I can give quality feedback to written assignments as well as editing them for both content and grammar.  It is also a plus for a college student to save money on a text book.  Some classes are asking students to spend up to have the cost of the class in books.  I find that a little outrageous.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 15:40, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Before taking this class, I would have said absolutely not. I will even admit that early on in the semester I would have said no; however, I think now my opinion has changed and I really can see the benefits in allowing the student to be actively involved in the learning and writing process. I think that it requires a lot of work from the teacher in preparing the learning material so that the students can do the work. The students must also be motivated to help out with their own learning peocess, otherwise it will be wasted time and effort. I think that with the right class and subject material, the students really can benefit from the hands on learning approach! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 15:44, 1 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I think that student created learning materials are a wonderful way to stimulate and encourage learners.  It becomes essential for a student to become involved with the learning process.  Performing research on a topic and sharing your individual findings and opinions with peers provides an effective method of learning from a student point of view.  Contributing to the class textbook, which is available for lots of people to read, made me focus on my material and strive to produce quality academic material. I paid special attention to citations &amp; references as well as writing from a neutral point of view. It also made me appreciate the hard work of all of my classmates after reading their material.  I am very proud of our class textbook and would not hesitate to share it with others.  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 19:34, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Yes, I would agree that it is.  I think that as they are creating their material or their book it is causing them to learn all of the material inside the book.  Whether using a resource such as wikibook is as effective, I am not sure.  I do believe, however, that the best way to learn is to do and research ideas and topics on your own.  I have always believed that to be the best so if that means that students are responsible for writing their own text book, then that will work.  I would also say that as we make our own book there is much mornin learnin then just the material.  Such as learnin the wikibook websitg and properly citing information. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 18:40, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Honestly, at the beginning of class when I heard what we would be doing I was very scared.  I was worried about being able to complete the assignment well.  But, after I got started I enjoyed the process.  It was hard and challenging but a very effective teaching strategy.  It was a different way for us to learn and by researching the topics ourselves, I believe it was very beneficial.  Being able to contribute to our own textbook was a challenge, but really made me think about my beliefs.  The entire process was student centered and the material was easy to remember.  Also, being able to read my peers work showed different perspectives on topics.  Now that it is almost over, I can say that I believe that it was a good learning experience.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 00:54, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I feel that it is a great learning strategy. It enables the students to take a more active role in the learning, and also allows for greater involvement in coming up with the resources necessary for the learning. I feel that by allowing students to create their own textbooks they have a say in their learning process, and what they learn. They get to decipher what is important and what is not in their learning process. I feel that for this class, creating my own textbook was a great learning strategy. I felt a sense of involement more than I have in other classes as well. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 20:32, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree working and learning together is always beneficial. This is good practice for teaching later. All the planning and grading, gave us all an opportunity to learn from each other.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 22:12, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I do believe that having students write their own textbooks is a very effective strategy. It gives the students ownership of their own learning and greatly reinforces the learned material. If a student takes the time to write a section of their textbook, there is a higher percentage that they will remember the material. I also like the fact that students writing their own textbooks is a collaborative effort. Students feel a sense of accomplishment when each section is put together and the textbook is completed. Also, the words are written on a level that all students will most likely understand. Students are able to decipher what the important lessons are and they are able to control what they learn and what are the most important components to take from the lesson. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 21:09, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Having students write their own textbooks is an excellent idea. It aids in their thinking ability and enforces the critical steps in Bloom's taxonomy. I think that student written textbooks are generally easier to read and understand. They allow the students to say and write what is important and how they feel toward subjects they write about. It is challenging to write a textbook but after it is done it is very rewarding. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:33, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Having students create their own learning materials is a benefit for some classes.  It gets students more involved, which in the long run will broaden their perspectives.  It provides an opportunity for classmates to contribute to what was originally left for experts to create.  Sure, let’s have students create their own learning materials.  Those learning materials will certainly be diverse.  I am not sure it could work for classic math and science disciplines, but it would be an interesting experiment nonetheless.  I suppose it just depends on the subject matter.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 19:04, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I do not think you have to be an expert to write a textbook. I think it is a great idea to have students create their own learning material. Not only does it enhance their knowledge on different aspects of each topic, but it gives them a sense of ownership for being a part of the process to put together an instructional masterpiece. Writing a textbook is not something that most people wake up one day and start. Learning continues on after the completion, because you can always go back and read over things you might have missed. Another point is not only are students having to think about what they are going to write about, they have to write it down and post it. Then, in our case, the student must read through the other posts and write blurbs about what they have read. I think this is a great way to help students retain information. Everyone has their own opinion about topics and collaborating on a textbook is an interesting way for students to see what is important to other students and how they interpret the research information.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:04, 1 August 2009 (UTC)


I was very skeptical when i first heard that we would be writing our own textbook. I think that it is a different experience. It shouldn't necessarily be done for every class. It has definitely been a learning process. It also allows you to see more of the opinions of your class mates. Where as with a normal text it is harder to do because you are forced to remember it from the class discussion. When the text is online it makes it easier to do communicate with our classmates. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 04:31, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== No. Students should not have to worry about creating learning materials. That's a job for experts. Students are not experts. ==

I started out thinking that it was a good idea for students to be able to create their own textbooks, but I think now my opinion on the subject has changed.  First of all, I don't feel confident reading and learning information some other college student has created.  I think most everyone has worked hard in this class, but there are different levels of writing ability and are all these articles checked for accuracy?  There are still plenty of spelling errors...etc. in the articles.  Secondly, I miss picking up a textbook and knowing exactly what I need to read and miss the book itself.  I would like to just be able to take my book where I want to and read it.  Like on a road trip.  Another reason is that I am more used to studying the old way.  It's hard to switch gears after 30 years of my old study skills.  OH and one more thing...I've spent more time trying to figure out Wikibooks instead of studying the material.  So, unfortunately I would love to say this is an awesome way to learn but studying another students work, but I haven't really enjoyed it as much as I was hoping to.  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:25, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


I wish I could say it's a great idea however, I would've rather learned through lecture or reading a textbook. Though some would argue you learn by doing, I just feel as though I've been DOING from the beginning.  I haven't had time to leisurely read and delve into a topic because I've been to worried about spell checking someone else's work! I've been so caught up in the technical details, that I haven't been able to enjoy the process. I'm glad to read that everyone has had a positive experience and has learned a lot, I just don't think this teaching method applies to everyone...including myself.[[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 02:24, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

No, having students create their own textbook is not the best option.  It is better to let the experts to create a textbook for a course, because they have a broader and deeper understanding of the topics and can present important material more efficiently than those who are not experts.  Students miss out on a lot of important and helpful information and concepts when reading a student made textbook instead of an expert-made textbook.  While it is interesting to see work by one's peers, the disavantages of having a student-made textbook outweigh the advantages. [[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 18:38, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

== It depends. ==

I really think this is a grey area for me. I think it is a good idea in concept but I personally would prefer a textbook written by an expert or a collection of expert articles. It is possible that my difficulty with wikibooks is that it is all computer reading which is hard on the eyes and has caused me migraines. I have had to print many articles which is not very eco-friendly. I feel that I have learned more from the assessment expert-written articles than the foundations articles.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 05:39, 10 August 2009 (UTC) 

Some material is good for students to get more involved in their learning. I'm not sure how effect writing a textbook would be, especially for elementary or middle school aged children. They are not experts in subjects at that age and need to learn from others, including others text material. Also, it depends on the subject or the material being learned. Art, for example, is very hands on so having students do hands on activities to learn about artists or types of art would work very well. On the other hand, I had to do my fair share of debates in history classes, and they only worked well if the students already understood the material so they could put what they had learned from the teacher to action. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:17, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

If it's guided correctly and there's enough enthusiasm from the student's part– it's probably a worth-while endeavor to partake. I'm pretty sure that's the downfall for any method though? If the students are going to do the bare-bones essential work, they're going to learn that much. Of course there's more room to make the course completely worthless with putting everything in their hands, so it would depend entirely on the group of individuals and the subject at hand. I cannot imagine doing this with Stocastic Calculus or Quantum Physics. But zombie survival or horror theory on the other hand? A vehement affirmation on my part. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:41, 31 July 2009 (UTC)
  
It really does depend on the situation, the assignment, and the age of the students involved. I think that this class and the textbook idea works very well and is a great learning tool. Having students revise each others' work is beneficial too. The idea of having students create or revise things like a syllabus and/or a grading rubric can be helpful as well. On the other hand, there can be downsides to assignments that are left entirely up to the students. In my experience as a student, I have encountered some times when having students create their own materials did not work. When I was in 8th grade, our World History teacher decided to try letting us come up with our own questions for a test. It seemed like a really good idea, and one that we were all excited about. But, the maturity level of 8th graders did not lend itself to the assignment, and our teacher was unable to use most of our questions. I think that student-created learning materials should happen once the students are mature enough to accept the full responsibility of the assignment.[[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 22:49, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I too believe that students creating their own learning materials is good sometimes but not always.  I had a bad experience in junior high when my social studies teacher assigned each student to be one of the Nazi war criminals (like Himmler etc.) and wanted us to put on a Nuremberg trial and come up with our own defense.  It was just too difficult for us and turned out to be a fiasco.  The teacher had a great idea but just picked the wrong task.  On the other hand, cooperative learning projects where student groups teach each other can be a great engaged way for students to learn.  It really depends on the type of learning material to be created.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 00:56, 31 July 2009 (UTC)


I think student generated learning materials are highly dependent upon not only the learning goals of the class, but also the general ability and motivation of the students within the classroom.  A prime example of this would be any workshop based writing class. The learning target of the class is perfect, specifically tailored to be most effective by analyzing fellow burgeoning writers and contrasting them with successful authors, but the nature of the students themselves is what truly creates the experience and effectiveness of the class. If the writers within the class only do the bare minimum, share no insights, and insist upon bland critiques of others’ work the experience  of some students will undoubtedly be hurt by those who do not put fourth the required effort. However, in a classroom of dedicated students, this same exact teaching method is by far the most effective at improving a receptive student’s performance. In the end it is a risk vs. reward situation, with a greater chance for failure but also a greater reward for success by providing a learning experience that has practical applications. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 15:17, 31 July 2009 (UTC)


I think that if given clear direction and constant participation from all class members this is a successful tool.  I have like the creation of the textbook in this class. I appreciated the many roles that each of us has to play to create this textbook.  I could see that if there was not the careful planning of the creation of this book that integral pieces may have been overlooked in the finished product.  I hope that other classes realize that their students have the potential to really contribute to their own learning.  That is definitely something that I will utilize when I am in the classroom.  [[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 02:45, 1 August 2009 (UTC)


I think the idea of contributing as a student to a book is really cool and a great learning experience. I also think that doing research and having to read about information related to certain topics is great, but I also think that sometimes not everyone puts in the same effort. I think that if this were to be done with students probably interested in editing  actually writing a book it would be a total success. Not eveyone likes having the responsibility of writing a text for other students. I also fear that all the information that should be there is not leaving key details out and the final producat not fully complete.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 01:14, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Having students create their own learning materials is a very effective strategy in the classroom, as long as the teacher considers important factors. These can include the involvement of students, how engaging it will be, how some students may respond to it better than others, and so on. For one class, I had to create a reading activity booklet about weather, where students would create their own classroom weather station. They created many of the things on their own, such as actual weather instruments, and recording data on charts. Overall, it is a very engaging activity, however, it required much effort on my part because I had to find videos about weather, find websites where they could build their instruments, create the chart and a means of assessment. Students can learn many concepts, including difficult concepts, by creating their own learning materials. However, I strongly believe that it has to be appropriate to their readiness, motivation, and participation. Many students may enjoy building something to measure weather, but there will be that select few that do not want anything to do with it. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 03:09, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I agree with the previous postings. While having students create their own learning materials sounds like a wonderful idea, there can also be a lot of problems as well. The teacher must be able to effectively determine what task the students are capable of. If it is too hard and unattainable, the students will be even more confused and much more frustrated with the subject. However, if the assignment is on their level and they are able to get excited about the idea of teaching and learning from others, then it will be a success. The different roles must be clear and there must be a good understanding of what is expected. To ensure quality work, there also needs to be a process of proofreading and review with several chances to make changes, etc., such as what we did in this class. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 13:45, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I think it depends on what the class is about. For example, when we were told we would create our own text for this class, I was shocked and a little thrown off. I was always used to one pre-written book that contained every detail of information I needed. In this situation I have had a lot of fun of creating an article and finding out information I could post, but as a general class how accurate are we? For this class is great, but for classes like chemistry where a lot of people find themselves confused, it might be a bad idea. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 17:00, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe that it definitely depends on the class and the level of the students being asked to create the learning material. For instance I teach inclusion geometry, and so how I think acting those special needs children to write a geometry textbook might not go so well. However, in an advanced calculus class, where the students are more independent and academically mature, they maybe more than up for the task.[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:37, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Some experts suggest that praise can be detrimental rather than beneficial to a child's development. They contend that instead of teaching children to regulate their own behavior and decide for themselves when they have done well, it teaches them to look to external sources (e.g. teachers, parents) for validation.

What do you think? Does praising a child teach him/her to focus and rely on the opinions of others? Does it create children who get addicted to praise and cannot function without external recognition.


&lt;/span&gt;

== They may be on to something. Kids should decide for themselves when they are successful. It is our job to help them learn to do that. ==

I think that praise is a positive reaction to a job well done.  When I was growing up in school i always felt better when I was told I did a great job.  School is not always fun or easy for children and I think rewarding them when they do something good is a great way to let them know they are doing well in the subject area but also boosts their self esteem.  As a future teacher I am not going to priase a child for every single thing they do with presents and other prizes but I will let them know I know they were working hard and did a good job at whatever they were completing.  [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 23:35, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Ok, so I had this teaching throughout high school who no matter how hard I worked on an assignment would always say: &quot;good, but could be better&quot;. Honestly this irked me, but at the same time really helped me create a self diagnosis of my own work. Him saying this pushed me to want to be better and work harder on my assignments. When I got praise from other teachers on projects and assignments that I really did not put in much effort I had the tendency to not give importance to the class because I knew that I could coast through it. I do think that children need some praise when they do really do a good job, but our role as teachers is to push them to be better and go beyond the limit. As people would say: think outside the box! Life is hard and when a child is given everything in a silver platter and later gone to wonder the world they fall harder than someone who is ready for the challenge. I am not saying that teachers need to be hard asses, but that they need to challenge their students and teach them how to be self aware of what is trully great and not settle.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 01:26, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I agree with this statement more than I agree with the second statement.  Let me say first that SOME praise is good, when it is appropriate and praises the efforts and actions of the student and not the final outcome.  &quot;You really worked hard on that report Susie and you wrote an extremely persuasive paragraph.  You must be really proud of yourself.  Good job.&quot;  I DON'T believe praise should be given to every student just for making an effort and I feel there is too much insincere praise being given out.  What ever happened to working hard and doing your best because it's the right thing to do?  That's the job of every student.  The real world does NOT praise you for doing your job every day.  That's what you're supposed to do.  When we praise students for anything and everything, they come to expect it when it's not deserved and when they don't get it often, they stop trying because their reward has become extrinsic instead of intrinsic.  Praise is good in small doses when it's used appropriately.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 15:23, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


When kids are five, they need praise. However once they have a sense of basic practices, like throwing your poop is bad, and saying please is good, then praise is less necessary. Friedrich Nietzsche claims that we as human assert our own meaning. This is what it seem we are getting at. We want our kids to make their own decisions and be able to function without someone hovering  over them telling them how wonderfully they did. So we should praise them when they are in critical development, but not exceed the necessary amount, and wean them from the need of praise by asking them to determine if their actions and accomplishments are in fact good. [[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:45, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


I can see how this behavior could be detrimental to a child's future.  I was homeschooled and my mother praised every school endeavor that was successfully completed.  She complimented me when I was well behaved and did what I was told.  As an adult I find that I'm motivated by praise, I'll work doubly hard not for a raise or a promotion but for my boss to say &quot;good job.&quot;  I seek the approval of friends and expect people to notice when I go above and beyond.  I know this is from all the positive reinforcement I received as a child, and though it's required it should only be done in moderation. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 02:36, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe that it is appropriate to have an &quot;inbetween&quot; view.  I think it is good to give praise to students to do well.  I think that it is okay for students to be motivated some to receive praise from teachers and parents.  At the same time, students need to understand the importance of being committed to doing what is right.  Students need to realize that doing right is important even in times when one may not receive praise from one's peers or surrounding community.
[[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 00:02, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

== Whatever. Sounds like liberal hocus pocus to me. Kids need praise. ==
Another way to look at giving students praise is that in school might be the only time they hear how good or great they are at something.  Not all students get praise or being told what a good job they are doing, so when they get it at school it does boost their confidence, so I say keep praising them.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 22:08, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I have a very fond memory of receiving happy grams when I was in elementary school. I personally think I turned out okay! :-) and learned from my teachers what they expected of me. This is just one example of how my teachers helped me become who I am. More importantly, my families positive praises and reinforcement made me who I am, without their positive reinforcement I would not have known what I am to expect of myself. As a teacher praising my students when they have succeeded can help students who do not receive praise from their parents, but negative reinforcement. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:28, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Kids do need praise and positive reinforcement.  However, the key is to transition the motivation from extrinsic to intrinsic.  For example, my parents started out rewarding me for good grades.  They also helped me realize the importance of good grades which led to the development of my own internal motivation for good grades.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 14:50, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I definitely think everyone needs to hear some praise!  Positive encouragement does way more good than it does harm.  Children (and adults!) thrive on praise and positive words.  My son thrives on me telling him he was good during the day and likes to hear me tell him that I appreciate something good he did during the day.  I notice when all I do is criticize, he responds negatively.  Of course, I don't tell him he was good when he wasn't!  I let him know a good thing or two that I noticed.  I think this works for adults too.  For example...when my husband complains about a messy house, the last thing I want to do is clean it!  BUT when he comes home and says the house looks great, I make more of an effort to keep it nice.  

I think that all children, students, adults, parents, etc. need some amount of external praise in order to feel a sense of accomplishment. If children are praised for doing the right thing, working hard, and behaving correctly they will begin to understand that these things are required of them and can earn them success. I do understand that some children (in some cases) may begin to behave that way only to get a reward/ prize; however, in most cases the children who receive praise in a healthy way can see the importance of their actions. Each and every one of us needs some outside praise/ applause every now and then, its in our human nature. In my opinion: keep the positive reinforcement coming and children will continue to learn and grow in a healthy way!

You are not born with a self appraisal system of worth embedded in you, just like you are not born with an intrinsic sense of morals. It is proper parenting and society in general that injects these things into you, sometimes against your will. That said– too much of anything is never a good thing. I'm a firm believer in this. Divvy out your praise like they are delicious chocolate covered cookies (with almonds and coconut inside)– but beware in overindulging that one kid that looks like he's had a few too many. You know the type: the kinda chubby one frothing at the mouth, pupils dilated, little whimpering reports of excitement trailing any mention of his name. Just skip over him a few times. Let the boy balance out. The last thing you need on your back is a sugar-coated praise junkie. In short: Kids need praise, yes. Kids need to be subjected to subliminal praise while they're sleeping, need you to slip some refined praise powder into their food &amp; drink, need you to hide some GOOD JOB! pictures (preferably wide-angle shots of various animals giving thumbs up or making silly faces) in between their favorite books and under their pillows, NO. Do not do this. That is just downright crazy talk. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 23:20, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

All students need praise.  I do believe that students should get praise for both intellect (within reason) and effort.  Children use praise as motivation which leads to individual success.  Oftentimes the only praise a child receives is from a teacher.  We need to encourage all children to try their best regardless of their learning abilities.  A kind word or a pat on the back will brighten a child's day and push a child to forge ahead when the going gets tough.  So yes, kids definitely need praise (and so do teachers!).  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 19:41, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Everyone likes to hear praise.  It lets you know when you are doing things right.  It helps you to feel good about yourself and to be motivated.  As teachers we need to have high expectations for all students and create opportunities for their success.  We need to let the students know that we appreciate their dedication and hard work and acknowledge it.  I believe in the whole scheme of things praise is definitely a good thing.

I don’t know who these expert are, but as a parent of a child diagnosed as oppositional defiant.  Praise and recognition for something done well or just done right, make a world of difference in everybody’s day. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 22:33, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I would absolutely say that all childrne need praise and the more of it the better.  I find that it is one of the greatest tools for students to judge their progress.  Also words that o alon with praise can help a student with a problem or just for motivation to keep tryin.  I would not necessarily agree that a student could have too much praise.  Attention seekers I find is different the praising a child for doing a great job or keep up the good work.  Praising is probably one of the most used feedback a child receives in a classroom. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 18:43, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I feel that kids need praise. Without encouraging support and praise, kids will be unable to recognize when they are exhibiting a desired behavior and when they are not. Kids also need praise to get through their academic studies. Knowing that someone else has acknowledged your efforts is very beneficial for kids. They will have a greater sense of motivation to go on and complete future and present activities. I do feel that there should be a combination of praise and consequence so that students do not become too dependent on praise alone. But I do not feel that praise will teach students to rely merely on external means of academic achievemnet. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 20:35, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I understand what certain individuals are saying about being skeptical of teacher praise, but I believe that students are in need of praise. Without praise, students may be unsure of when they are doing something positive or not. Also, it elevates their self-esteem and helps to give them a positive attitude through their academic career. They will be better motivated to complete further tasks. I remember through my academic career, I greatly appreciated praise from my teachers. It really made my day when a teacher would acknowledge my hard work. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 21:17, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Why wouldn't we praise students? Everyone likes receiving praise; it brightens your day and reminds you that you're special. Removing praise from school and home leads us in the direction of a hands-off, Big Brother type of world where no one is acknowledged for a job-well-done. Without praise, many students would stop performing well. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 23:39, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


Kids need encouragement in school. Some children do not receive praise at home so when they are at school and get rewarded they are stimulated to do better and achieve more. I see it as vital to the child to praise them. If not they could get depressed and more emotional issues could arise. I know when I was a student I loved it when teachers praised me. It made me feel good and I sought out to do better. Hard work should always be appreciated.[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:47, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Right…praise is detrimental.  NO WAY!  I understand the point you are trying to contend.  However, there are correct ways to give feedback to students without being detrimental to the rest of their lives.  For example, effort should be praised versus ability.  Everyone is able.  Younger students especially need this type of praise.  They need the confidence and self-esteem support.  It is critical to their development, while they are still learning appropriate emotional responses and self-regulation.  I will never find anything wrong with telling a child they have done a good job, when they have done a good job.  Anyone who has a different opinion should consider stopping that extra psychoanalytic nonsense! [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 19:14, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Everyone needs some kind of feedback. The more positive, the better. Giving children praise and watching their eyes light up and their smile, gives me a positive feeling that I have connected with them in someway. As a parent, there is nothing greater than watching your child when they are happy. After praising them for something they did that was impressive, encourages them to go above and beyond to receive more praise. In saying all of this, I have witnessed some children who thrive on the praise and let it go to their heads (in a manner of speaking)...for that, I blame the adult(s) in their life, who have not corrected them to accept the praise with a simple thank you and helped them to understand that we are all human beings without race, gender and economic station in life to cloud their views.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:15, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

Children need praise. It provides a guideline for their future decisions and creates at least some sense of direction within the classroom. Without praise children are left to interpret for themselves what constitutes good behavior and performance. While this may be a valuable lesson, such experiments can very easily go awry.  Some children may think that giving their teacher an apple is proper behavior, while others may think that stabbing their teacher in the throat with scissors is an equally favorable action. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 15:26, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

Having too much of a one thing is always detrimental, especially with a thing like praise because it can go to a lot of people’s head and make things worse. However, having too little praise can seriously damage a child’s self-esteem and confidence in almost everything he or she does. My approach, as far as praise in the classroom, is that you demonstrate how hard work can give your praise, but give you success as well. My dad would always encourage me, and still does. I remember when I was in elementary and middle school, he would give me money for each A I brought home. He helped realize at an early age that if I did well in school, then I would do well in the real world. I know some people would not recommend it, because they might see it as “bad”, but I always thought it was a good strategy. Because it taught me that working hard did have a purpose and a reward. At some point, it became more about doing well for me instead of others so perhaps it is more beneficial to do external praise. With moderation, of course. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 03:23, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

There's nothing worse than doing a great job and not being recognized for it, not even in a minimum way. I am all for recognizing and praising my students if they do greatly in a subject matter. I believe that recognizing students is a way to keep them grounded and working harder. It helps develop the idea of reaching and achieving something. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 17:10, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that students need feedback in general. Whether it is praise to make it well known that they were doing a good job or whether it is a hand on the shoulder to suggest &quot;calm down&quot; or eye contact that lets the student know they need to refocus. I think that too much of anything is not always good. There needs to be a balance in feedback. Give praise when praise is due, but over doing it may also be detrimental. As for a children deciding for themselves when they are successful, I think that sounds a little odd. Kids should not have to give themselves their own praise. We live in a world where we are always rewarded for a job well done. Whether it is recognition by a boss, a raise in salary, or simply your sister telling you that your dinner was delicious. It is not necessary to over-praise but I believe that a job well done should be recognized. Then kids will learn to be proud of themselves and strive to make good grades and be successful students. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 01:03, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I am sure that there are people that would take something way to far and I have seen first hand parents that praise too much but a good job never hurt someone if they earn it!  The issue I have is the teachers or parents who are robotic in their praises.  Great Job, Way to Go should mean that the child has done a great job or worked hard for that accomplishment.  There is sucha  trend now to not hurt a child's feelings when it comes to sports or recognition.  I understandf that no one wants to see a child upset but we are missing the point that when they get to the real world they will be disappointed, they will not get everything they way they would like to have it.  Preparing our students for the future is what teaching is all about.  Parents have to do it and so do teachers.  By all means, Give praise when they have earned it by showing that whatever they are doing they are giving it their all but don't placate a kid by giving them false praise if they have done nothing to earn it![[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 18:52, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

== I really don't know. ==

I think every child is different and there will be those that crave constant praise and attention. Then there will be those who try to escape constant praise and attention. I think by the time they start school their personalities are pretty well developed and that any praising damage may have already taken place. They are only in school 30 hours a week, although this is a lot of time they still spend more time with their parents. I am not 100% sure that you can't over praise but if its possible I don't think the teachers are doing the damage.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 05:24, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

I'm not sure. This is a good question. I chose to answer this way because I'm sure that there are students that need the external praise while there are students in the same class that have learned to figure it out on their own. I thin that it should be judged on a case by case basis. Especially while the child is young and learning it helps them to learn when they are doing something right and when they are not. and one day they will be able to do it on their own.

'''Messier 15''' or '''M15''' (also designated '''NGC 7078''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Jean-Dominique Maraldi]] in [[w:1746]] and included in [[w:Charles Messier]]'s catalogue of [[w:comet]]-like objects in [[w:1764]].  At an estimated 13.2 billion years old, it is one of the oldest known globular clusters.

M15 is about 33,600 [[w:light-year]]s from [[w:Earth]]. It has an [[w:absolute magnitude]] of -9.2 which translates to a total [[w:luminosity]] of 360,000 times that of the [[w:Sun]]. Messier 15 is one of the most densely packed globulars known in the [[w:Milky Way galaxy]]. Its core has undergone a contraction known as '[[w:core collapse]]' and it has a central density cusp with an enormous number of stars surrounding what may be a central black hole.

Messier 15 contains 112 [[w:variable star]]s, a rather high number. It also contains at least 8 [[w:pulsar]]s, including one double [[w:neutron star]] system, M15 C. Moreover, M15 houses [[w:Pease 1]], one of only four [[w:planetary nebula]]e known to reside within a globular cluster, which was discovered in [[w:1928]].[http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m015_h2.html]

To the [[w:amateur astronomy|amateur]] [[w:astronomer]] Messier 15 appears as a fuzzy star in the smallest of [[w:telescope]]s. Mid to large size telescopes (at least 6 in./150 mm diameter) will start to reveal individual stars, the brightest of which are of [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] +12.6.

The '''Eagle Nebula''' (catalogued as '''[[w:Messier object|Messier]] 16''' or '''M16''', and as '''NGC 6611''') is a young [[w:open cluster]] of [[w:star]]s in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Serpens]], discovered by [[w:Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux]] in 1745-46.  Its name derives from its shape which is reminiscent of an [[w:eagle]]. It is the subject of a famous photograph by the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]], which shows pillars of [[w:star formation|star-forming]] [[w:interstellar medium|gas and dust]] within the nebula.

==Characteristics==

The Eagle Nebula is part of a diffuse [[w:emission nebula]], or H II region, which is catalogued as [[w:IC 4703]]. This region of active current star formation is about 6,500 [[w:light-year]]s distant. The tower of gas that can be seen coming off the nebula is approximately 57 trillion miles (97 trillion km) high.

The brightest star in the nebula has an [[w:apparent magnitude]] of +8.24, easily visible with good binoculars.

=='Pillars of Creation' region==
[[image:Eagle nebula pillars.jpg|thumb|left|The &quot;Pillars of Creation&quot; within the Eagle Nebula. Courtesy of [[w:NASA]]/[[w:ESA]]]]

Images made in 1995 by Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen using the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] greatly improved scientific understanding of processes inside the nebula. One of these, a famous photograph known as the &quot;[[w:Pillars of Creation]]&quot;, depicts a large region of star formation. Its small dark areas are believed to be [[w:protostar]]s. The pillar structure of the region resembles that of a much larger star formation region, imaged with the [[w:Spitzer Space Telescope]] in 2005, in [[w:Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], which is designated [[w:Soul Nebula|W5]] and has been dubbed the &quot;Mountains of Creation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Spitzer_Captures_Cosmic_Mountains_Of_Creation.html Spitzer Captures Cosmic &quot;Mountains Of Creation&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Combinations of [[w:X-ray]] images from the [[w:Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra observatory]] with Hubble's &quot;Pillars&quot; image have shown that X-ray sources (from young stars) do not coincide with the pillars, but instead randomly dot the area.&lt;sup&gt;[http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/m16/]&lt;/sup&gt; This suggests that star formation may have peaked approximately one million years ago in the Eagle Nebula and any protostars in the pillar's [[w:List of astronomy acronyms#E|EGG]]s are not yet hot enough to emit X-rays.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

In early 2007, scientists using the Spitzer discovered evidence that potentially indicates the Pillars were destroyed by a nearby [[w:supernova]] explosion about 6,000 years ago, but the light showing the new shape of the nebula will not reach [[w:Earth]] for another millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-01/release.shtml ''Famous Space Pillars Feel the Heat of Star's Explosion''] - Jet Propulsion Laboratory &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think one of the most important qualities that a teacher can have is a positive attitude. The student/teacher relationship is a very sensitive one because the student is opening their self up to whatever the teacher has to pass on. A positive teacher makes this relationship work. If a teacher is negative, his or her attitude will either rub off on the students or make the students unwilling to learn; both are things that create a bad learning environment. This article was very good a providing reasons that teachers must stay positive and strategies how to keep that attitude. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 23:56, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I enjoyed the color choices before I knew why you used them. Now that I have read your reason for using them I like them better then I originally did. Great topic a positive attitude is always a good thing even when not in the classroom. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 21:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I'll be semi-honest... sometimes I hate that faux persona of bubbly enthusiasm that I've had teachers put on. Give me some good old gritty sarcasm and angry learning a try, darn it!

I do think fake serenity is plastered on a bit too thick with some people, but generally you should be happy teaching because you should want to teach. We're all humans, we have some crappy days, but it's important not to let that seep consistently into your professional life. Maintaining a positive attitude is pretty important, but I'd personally shoot for a lovable level of friendly antagonism. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:08, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading this article; one of the most important things to have in a classroom is a positive attitude, especially among elementary students. With the exception of the child’s parents and/or guardians, the teacher is adult that spends the most time with a child. Their years in school will have a large impact on their lives, so why not make it positive. A positive attitude from the teacher will also lead to a positive learning environment, where students learn quicker and better. Another thing I really liked in this article was the quote at the end: Teaching is not a profession. It’s a calling. This is very true and you can always tell which teachers do, or do not follow this. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 03:01, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

It is very important for teachers to maintain a positive attitude towards teaching. However, I can also remember when I was a kid and my Mom went to parent's night, or something of the sort, at my school. I remember saying to my mom &quot;She seemed so nice tonight when you were around, she never acts like that.&quot; Thinking back on this teacher, I think that she did probably what many teachers do, put on the fake smile and enthusiasm and became a teacher very different from the one I knew in the classroom. So I guess when I say that teachers should keep a positive attitude, I don't necessarily mean a fake one. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 01:10, 3 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

This is a very interesting article about something that I feel many teachers forget about and many students take for granted. Everyone has had that older teacher who has no clue about current politics, culture, and technology. All they know is what they're teaching. Students tend to see this teacher as &quot;dumb&quot;. This is incorrect. This teacher only needs to continue to learn about what is going on in the world around her. One of the most important things for a teacher to stay involved in is technology. Nothing is worse than having the teacher who can't figure out how to print tests from her computer. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 00:11, 31 July 2009 (UTC)


Being a life long learner is vital to both a student and a teacher. Each day a teacher must study her student. This keeps her up to date with the student and learns their likes and dislikes. Studying students and the technology they use will enable the teacher to keep current. Technology is vital for both the teacher and the student. I think that teachers should learn how to use new technology and then introduce it to her students. The students would then see the teacher in a different light and believe they are so much more intelligent than just what they teach.[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:41, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Lifelong learning is not just for teachers. Life its self can be a learning experience. Keep your brain working, keep learning.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 22:27, 1 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

The '''Omega Nebula''', also known as the '''Swan Nebula''' (catalogued as '''Messier 17''' or '''M17''' and as '''NGC 6618''') is an [[w:H II region]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Philippe Loys de Chéseaux]] in 1745. [[w:Charles Messier]] catalogued it in 1764. It is located in the rich [[w:starfield]]s of the Sagittarius area of the [[w:Milky Way]].

The Omega Nebula is between 5,000 and 6,000 [[w:light-year]]s from [[w:Earth]] and it spans some 15 light-years in diameter. The cloud of [[w:interstellar medium|interstellar matter]] of which this [[w:nebula]] is a part is roughly 40 light-years in diameter. The total [[w:mass]] of the Omega Nebula is an estimated 800 [[w:solar mass]]es.

A [[w:Open cluster|cluster]] of 35 stars lies embedded in the nebulosity and causes the [[w:gas]]es of the nebula to shine due to radiation from these hot, young stars.

'''Messier 19''' or '''M19''' (also designated '''NGC 6273''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ophiuchus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1764]] and added to his catalogue of [[w:comet]]-like objects that same year.

M19 is the most [[w:oblate]] of the known globular clusters. It is at a distance of about 28,000 [[w:light-year]]s from the [[w:Solar System]], and is quite near to the [[w:Galactic Center]], at only about 5,200 light-years away.

The '''Trifid Nebula''' (catalogued as '''Messier 20''' or '''M20''' and as '''NGC 6514''') is an [[w:H II region]] located in [[w:Sagittarius constellation|Sagittarius]]. Its name means 'divided into three lobes'.  The object is an unusual combination of an [[w:open cluster]] of [[w:star]]s, an [[w:emission nebula]] (the lower, red portion), a [[w:reflection nebula]] (the upper, blue portion) and a [[w:dark nebula]] (the apparent 'gaps' within the emission nebula that cause the trifid appearance; these are also designated '''Barnard 85'''). Viewed through a small [[w:telescope]], the Trifid Nebula is a bright and colorful object, and is thus a perennial favorite of amateur astronomers. 

==Characteristics==
The Trifid Nebula was the subject of an investigation by astronomers using the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] in [[w:1997]], using filters that isolate emission from [[w:hydrogen]] [[w:atom]]s, [[w:ion]]ized [[w:sulfur]] atoms, and doubly ionized [[w:oxygen]] atoms. The images were combined into a false-color composite picture to suggest how the nebula might look to the eye.

The close-up images show a dense cloud of dust and gas, which is a [[w:stellar nursery]] full of embryonic stars. This cloud is about 
8 [[w:light year]]s away from the nebula's central star. A [[w:stellar jet]] protrudes from the head of the cloud and is about 0.75 [[w:light-year]]s long. The jet's source is a young stellar object deep within the cloud. Jets are the exhaust gasses of star formation. Radiation from the nebula's central star makes the jet glow.

The images also showed a finger-like stalk to the right of the jet. It points from the head of the dense cloud directly toward the star that powers the Trifid nebula. This stalk is a prominent example of an [[w:evaporating gaseous globule]]s, or 'EGGs'. The stalk has survived because its tip is a knot of gas that is dense enough to resist being eaten away by the powerful radiation from the star.

In January, 2005, [[w:NASA]]'s [[w:Spitzer Space Telescope]] discovered 30 embryonic stars and 120 newborn stars not seen in [[w:visible light]] images.

M21 is a relatively young cluster of a mere 4.6 million [[w:year]]s of age. It is tightly packed but contains about 57 [[w:star]]s. A few blue giant stars have been identified in the cluster, but Messier 21 is composed mainly of small dim stars. With a magnitude of 6.5, M21 is not visible to the naked eye; however, with the smallest binoculars it can be easily spotted on a dark night.

'''Messier 22''' (also known as '''M22''' or '''NGC 6656''') is an elliptical [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] near the [[w:Galactic bulge]] region.  It is one of the brightest globulars that is visible in the night sky.

==History==
M22 was one of the first globulars to be discovered in [[w:1665]] by [[w:Abraham Ihle]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Monacoetal2004&quot; /&gt; and it was included in [[w:Charles Messier|Charles Messier's]] catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects on June 5, [[w:1764]].

It was one of the first globular clusters to be carefully studied first by [[w:Harlow Shapley]] in [[w:1930]]. He discovered roughly 70,000 stars and found it had a dense core. &lt;ref name=&quot;Shapley1930&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Then [[w:Halton Arp]] and [[w:William G. Melbourne]] continued studies in [[w:1959]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arpetal1959&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi=10.1086/107848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the large color spread of its [[w:red giant branch]] (RGB) sequence, which is similar to that observed in [[w:Omega Centauri]], it became the object of intense scrutiny starting in [[w:1977]] with [[w:James E. Hesser]] et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesseretal1977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Characteristics==

M22 is one of the nearer globular clusters to [[w:Earth]] at a distance of about 10,600 [[w:light-year]]s away. It spans 32' on the sky which translates to a spatial diameter of 99 ± 9 light-years. 32 [[w:variable star]]s have been recorded in M22.  It is projected in front of the galactic bulge and is therefore useful for its [[w:microlensing]] effect on the background stars in the bulge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaudi2002&quot; /&gt;

Despite its relative proximity to us, this [[w:metal-poor]] cluster's light is limited by [[w:dust extinction]], giving it an apparent magnitude of 5.5 making it the brightest globular cluster in the norther hemisphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;ivansetal2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Planetary Nebula===
M22 is very unusual in that it is one of only four globulars (the others being [[w:Messier 15|M15]], [[w:NGC 6441]] and [[w:Palomar 6]]) that are known to contain a [[w:planetary nebula]] (PN).  It was discovered using the [[w:IRAS]] satellite by [[w:Fred Gillett]] et al.,in 1986 as a pointlike source ([[w:IRAS 18333-2357]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillettetal1986&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''Messier 23''' (also known as '''NGC 6494''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] on [[w:June 20]], [[w:1764]].

M23 is at a distance of about 2,150 [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]], its radius is around 15-20 [[w:light years]]. There are some 150 identified members in this cluster, the brightest being of [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 9.2. M23 can be found with a modestly sized [[w:telescope]] in the rich starfields of the Sagittarius [[w:Milky Way]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Caustiche.jpg|thumb|M24, Delle Caustiche or Sagittarius Star Cloud]]The '''Sagittarius Star Cloud''' (also known as '''Delle Caustiche''', '''Messier 24''', '''IC 4715''') is a [[w:star cloud]] in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], approximately 600 [[w:light year]]s wide, which was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in 1764.

The stars, clusters and other objects comprising M24 are part of the [[w:Sagittarius Arm|Sagittarius]] or [[w:Sagittarius-Carina Arm|Sagittarius-Carina]] [[w:Spiral arm|arms]] of the [[w:Milky Way]] galaxy. Messier described M24 as a &quot;large nebulosity containing many stars&quot; and gave its dimensions as being some 1.5° across, a description that fits the star cloud rather well. Some sources, improperly, identify M24 as the faint [[w:open cluster|cluster]] [[w:NGC 6603]].

M24 fills a space of significant volume to a depth of 10,000 to 16,000 [[w:light-year]]s. This is the most dense concentration of individual stars visible using [[w:binocular]]s, with around 1,000 stars visible within a single [[w:field of view]].

'''Open Cluster M26''' (also known as '''Messier Object 26''' or '''NGC 6694''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Scutum]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1764]].

M26 spans about 22 [[w:light year]]s across and is at a distance of 5,000 light years from the [[w:Earth]]. The brightest star is of [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 11.9 and the age of this cluster has been calculated to be 89 million years. An interesting feature of M26 is a region of low [[w:star]] density near the nucleus, most likely caused by an obscuring cloud of [[w:interstellar matter]] between us and the cluster.

The '''Dumbbell Nebula''' (also known as '''Messier 27''', '''M 27''', or '''NGC 6853''') is a [[w:planetary nebula]] (PN) in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Vulpecula]], at a distance of about 1,360 [[w:light year]]s.

This object was the first [[w:planetary nebula]] to be discovered; by [[w:Charles Messier]] in 1764. At its brightness of [[w:visual magnitude]] 7.5 and its diameter of about 8 [[w:arcminute]]s, it is easily visible in binoculars, and a popular observing target in [[w:amateur astronomy|amateur telescopes]].

==Structure==
[[image:M27 - Dumbbell Nebula.jpg|thumb|left|[[w:ESO]] image showing extended structure and central star&lt;br /&gt;Credit: ESO]]
This PN appears to be shaped like an [[w:prolate spheroid]] and is viewed from our perspective along the plane of its [[w:equator]]. In 1992, Moreno-Corral et al. computed that the rate of expansion in the plane of the sky of this PN was no more than 2&amp;Prime;.3 per century.  From this, an upper limit to the age of 14,600 yr may be determined. In 1970, Bohuski, Smith, and Weedman found an expansion velocity of 31&amp;nbsp;km/s.  Given its [[w:semi-minor axis]] [[w:radius]] of 1.01 ly, this implies that the kinematic age of the nebula is some 9,800 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODelletal2002&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODelletal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

[[image:M27 Knots.jpg|thumb|left|[[w:Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] closeup of knots in M&amp;nbsp;27&lt;br /&gt;Credit: C.R. O'Dell (Vanderbilt University)]]

Like many nearby planetary nebulae, the Dumbbell contains knots. Its central region is marked by a pattern of dark and bright cusped knots and their associated dark tails (see picture).  The knots vary in appearance from symmetric objects with tails to rather irregular tail-less objects. Similarly to the [[w:Helix Nebula]] and the [[w:Eskimo Nebula]], the heads of the knots have bright cusps which are local [[w:photoionization]] fronts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODelletal2003&quot; /&gt;

===Central star===
The central star, a [[w:white dwarf]], is estimated to have a radius which is 0.055 ± 0.02 [[w:Solar radius|R&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] which gives it a size larger than any other known white dwarf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedictetal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''Messier 28''' (also known as '''M28''' or '''NGC 6626''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1764]].

M28 is at a distance of about 18,000 to 19,000 [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]]. 18 [[w:RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae]] type [[w:variable star]]s have been observed in this cluster. In [[w:1986]], M28 became the first globular cluster where a [[w:pulsar|millisecond pulsar]] was discovered (by the [[w:Lovell Telescope]] at [[w:Jodrell Bank Observatory]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;jbo_stars&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/lovell/aunstar.html | title=JBO - Stars | publisher=[[w:Jodrell Bank Observatory]] | accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andromeda Galaxy''' (also known as '''Messier 31''', '''M31''', or '''NGC 224'''; often referred to as the ''Great'' ''Andromeda'' ''Nebula'' in older texts) is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;million light-years away&lt;ref name=&quot;Ribas2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the  constellation Andromeda. It is the nearest spiral galaxy to our own, the Milky Way. As it is visible as a faint smudge on a moonless night, it is one of the farthest objects visible to the naked eye, and can be seen even from urban areas with binoculars. It is named after the princess Andromeda (Greek: Ανδρομέδη - Andromédē) in Greek mythology. Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the [[w:Local Group]], which consists of the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 30 other smaller galaxies.  Although the largest, it may not be the most massive, as recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the grouping.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarkMatter&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full moon when photographed through a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible with the naked eye.

==Observation history==
The earliest recorded observation of the Andromeda Galaxy was in 964 CE by the Persian astronomer, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (Azophi),&lt;ref name=&quot;NSOG&quot;&gt;{{cite book 
 |last= Kepple
 |first= George Robert
 |coauthors= Glen W. Sanner

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described it as a &quot;small cloud&quot; in his ''Book of Fixed Stars''. Other star charts of that period have it labeled as the ''Little Cloud''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSOG&quot; /&gt;
The first description of the object based on telescopic observation was given by Simon Marius&lt;ref name=&quot;NSOG&quot; /&gt; in 1612. Charles Messier catalogued it as object M31 in 1764 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer, unaware of Al Sufi's earlier work. In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of the M31. He believed it to be the nearest of all the &quot;great nebulae&quot; and, based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly estimated that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[w:Sirius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=W. Herschel | authorlink=William Herschel | title=On the Construction of the Heavens | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume=75 | year=1785| pages=213–266 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:William Huggins]] in 1864 observed the [[w:spectrum]] of M31 and noted that it differed from a gaseous nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=William Huggins | authorlink=William Huggins | title=On the Spectra of Some of the Nebulae| journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume=154 | year=1864| pages=437–444 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1864.0013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectra of M31 displayed a [[w:continuum]] of [[w:frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the chemical composition of an object. The Andromeda nebula was very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this it was deduced that M31 had a stellar nature. In 1885, a supernova (known as &quot;S Andromedae&quot;) was seen in M31, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time M31 was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a nova, and was named accordingly &quot;Nova 1885&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Great Andromeda Nebula by [[w:Isaac Roberts]].]]
The first photographs of M31 were taken in 1887 by [[w:Isaac Roberts]] from his private observatory in [[w:Sussex, England]]. The long-duration exposure allowed the spiral structure of the galaxy to be seen for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Isaac| last=Roberts| title=A Selection of Photographs of Stars, Star-clusters and Nebulae, Vol. II | publisher=The Universal Press| location=London | year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time this object was commonly believed to be a nebula within our galaxy, and Roberts mistakenly believed that M31 and similar spiral nebulae were actually solar systems being formed, with the satellites nascent planets. The [[w:radial velocity]] of this object with respect to our [[w:solar system]] was measured in 1912 by [[w:Vesto Slipher]] at the [[w:Lowell Observatory]],  using [[w:spectroscopy]]. The result was the largest velocity recorded at that time, at 300&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (186&amp;nbsp;miles/s.), moving in the direction of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Island universe===
In 1917, [[w:Heber Curtis]] observed a nova within M31. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[w:Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred within our Galaxy. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 500,000 light-years. He became a proponent of the so-called &quot;island universes&quot; hypothesis, which held that [[w:spiral galaxy|spiral nebulae]] were actually independent galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1920 the [[w:Great Debate]] between [[w:Harlow Shapley]] and [[w:Heber Curtis]] took place, concerning the nature of the [[w:Milky Way]], spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the [[w:universe]]. To support his claim that Great Andromeda Nebula (M31) was an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own Galaxy, as well as the significant [[w:Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[w:Ernst Öpik]] presented a very elegant and simple astrophysical method to estimate the distance of M31, his result (450 kpc) put Andromeda Nebula far outside our Galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Öpik | first=Ernst

[[w:Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[w:Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of M31. These were made using the 2.5&amp;nbsp;metre (100&amp;nbsp;in) [[w:Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our Galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This galaxy plays an important role in galactic studies, since it is the nearest giant spiral (although not the [[w:List of nearest galaxies|nearest galaxy]]). In 1943, [[w:Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Based on his observations of this galaxy, he was able to discern two distinct populations of stars based on their [[w:metallicity]], naming the young, high velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[w:Jan Oort]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==General==
The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the [[w:Sun]] at about 300 kilometers per second (186&amp;nbsp;miles/s.), so it is one of the few [[w:blue shift]]ed galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are approaching one another at a speed of 100 to 140&amp;nbsp;kilometers per second (62&amp;ndash;87&amp;nbsp;miles/s.; 223,200&amp;ndash;313,200mph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Malik | first = Tariq | date = 2002-05-07 | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/galaxy_collides_020507-1.html | title = Crash Course: Simulating the Fate of Our Milky Way | publisher = SPACE.com  | accessdate = 2006-09-18

===Recent distance estimates===
At least four distinct techniques have been used to measure distances to the Andromeda Galaxy.

In 2003, using the infrared [[w:surface brightness fluctuation]]s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value of Freedman et al. 2001 and using a metallicity correction of -0.2 mag dex&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in (O/H), an estimate of 2.57 ± 0.06 [[w:light-year|Mly]] (787 ± 18 [[w:parsec|kpc]]) was derived.

Using the Cepheid variable method, an estimate of 2.51 ± 0.13 Mly (770 ± 40 kpc) was achieved in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;karachentsevetal2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In 2005, a group of astronomers consisting of [[w:Ignasi Ribas]] ([[w:Spanish Research Council|CSIC]], [[w:Institute for Space Studies of Catalonia|IEEC]]) and his colleagues announced the discovery of an [[w:eclipsing binary|eclipsing binary star]] in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary star, designated M31VJ00443799+4129236,{{Ref|C|c}} has two luminous and hot blue stars of [[w:stellar classification|types]] O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, which occur every 3.54969&amp;nbsp;days, the astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars they were able to measure the [[w:absolute magnitude]] of the stars. When the [[w:apparent magnitude|visual]] and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be measured. The stars lie at the distance of 2.52 ± 0.14 Mly (770 ± 40 kpc) and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about 2.5 Mly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ribas2005&quot; /&gt; This new value is in excellent agreement with the previous, independent Cepheid-based distance value.

Andromeda is close enough that the [[w:Tip of the Red Giant Branch]] (TRGB) method may also be used to estimate its distance.  The estimated distance to M31 using this technique in 2005 yielded 2.56 ± 0.08 Mly (785 ± 25 kpc).&lt;ref name=&quot;McConnachieetal2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Averaged together, all these distance measurements give a combined distance estimate of 2.54 ± 0.06 Mly (778 ± 17 kpc).{{Ref|A|a}} Based upon the above distance, the diameter of M31 at the widest point is estimated to be 141 ± 3 kly.{{Ref|D|d}}

===Mass and luminosity estimates===
Mass estimates for the Andromeda halo (including [[w:dark matter]]) give a value of approximately 1.23{{e|12}}&amp;nbsp;[[w:Solar mass|''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Thus M31 may be less massive than our own galaxy, although the error range is still too large to say for certain. Even so, the masses of the Milky Way and M31 are comparable, and M31's [[w:Spiral galaxy#galactic spheroid|spheroid]] actually has a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In particular, M31 appears to have significantly more common stars than the Milky Way, and the estimated [[w:luminosity]] of M31, ~2.6{{e|10}}&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;, is about 25% higher than that of our own galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;vdb&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher, with M31 only producing about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of [[w:supernova]]e in the Milky Way is also double that of M31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Structure==

This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than 220,000 light-years in diameter. Previously, estimates of Andromeda's size ranged from 70,000 to 120,000 light-years across.

The galaxy is inclined an estimated 77° relative to the Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=UC Santa Cruz | date=January 9, 2001 | title=Astronomers Find Evidence of an Extreme Warp in the Stellar Disk of the Andromeda Galaxy | url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/archive/00-01/01-01/andromeda.html | accessdate=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near M31. The galaxy [[w:Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in M31's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.

Spectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[w:Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of M31]] at various radii from the core. In the vicinity of the core, the rotational velocity climbs to a peak of 225&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (140&amp;nbsp;miles/s.) at a radius of 1,300 [[w:light-year]]s, then descends to a minimum at 7,000 light-years where the rotation velocity may be as low as 50&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (31&amp;nbsp;miles/s.). Thereafter the velocity steadily climbs again out to a radius of 33,000 light-years, where it reaches a peak of 250&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (155&amp;nbsp;miles/s.). The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around 200&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second (124&amp;nbsp;miles/s.) at 80,000 light-years. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about 6{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;[[w:Solar mass|M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the [[w:Galaxy nucleus|nucleus]]. The total mass of the galaxy increases [[w:linear]]ly out to 45,000 light-years, then more slowly beyond that radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=V. C. Rubin, W. K. J.

The [[w:spiral arm]]s of Andromeda are outlined by a series of [[w:H II region]]s that Baade described as resembling &quot;beads on a string&quot;. They appear to be tightly wound, although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=H.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rectified images of the galaxy show a fairly normal spiral galaxy with the arms wound up in a clockwise direction. There are two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about 13,000 light-years. These can be followed outward from a distance of roughly 1,600 light-years from the core. The most likely cause of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with [[w:Messier 32|M32]]. This can be seen by the displacement of the [[w:H I region|neutral hydrogen clouds]] from the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=R.

In 1998, images from the [[w:European Space Agency]]'s [[w:Infrared Space Observatory]] demonstrated that the overall form of the Andromeda galaxy may be transitioning into a [[w:ring galaxy]]. The gas and dust within Andromeda is generally formed into several overlapping rings, with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of 32,000 light-years from the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Esa Science News | date=October 14, 1998 | title=ISO unveils the hidden rings of Andromeda | url=http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/outreach/esa_pr/andromed.htm | accessdate=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust.

Close examination of the inner region of Andromeda showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of Andromeda along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Busted!

[[w:Scott Tremaine]] has proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an [[w:orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] around the central black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;tremaine&quot;&gt;

P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[w:stellar classification|spectral class]] A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

While at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus was the remnant of a small galaxy &quot;cannibalized&quot; by Andromeda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate=2009-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this is no longer considered to be a viable explanation. The primary reason is that such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to [[w:tidal force|tidal disruption]] by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.&lt;ref name=&quot;tremaine&quot;/&gt;

==Discrete sources==
Multiple X-ray sources have been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the [[w:European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[w:XMM-Newton]] orbiting observatory. [[w:Robin Barnard]] ''et al.'' hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or [[w:neutron stars]], which are heating incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. The spectrum of the neutron stars is the same as the hypothesized black holes, but can be distinguished by their masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in M31. The new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Satellites==
{{Main|Andromeda's satellite galaxies}}
Like the Milky Way, Andromeda Galaxy has [[w:satellite galaxy|satellite galaxies]], consisting of 14 known [[w:Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are [[w:Elliptical Galaxy M32|M32]] and [[w:Elliptical Galaxy M110|M110]]. Based on current evidence, it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with M31 (Andromeda) in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of [[w:star formation]] in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M110 also appears to be interacting with M31, and astronomers have found a stream of metal-rich stars in the halo of M31 that appears to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2006 it was discovered that nine of these galaxies lay along a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy, rather than being randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Messier 32''' (also known as ''NGC 221'' and [[w:Le Gentil]]) is a [[w:dwarf elliptical galaxy]] about [[w:1 E22 m|2.65 million]] [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. M32 is a [[w:satellite galaxy]] of the famous [[w:Andromeda Galaxy]] (M31) and was discovered by [[w:Le Gentil]] in [[w:1749]]. M32 measures only 6.5 ± 0.2 kly&lt;ref&gt;Diameter = distance &amp;times; sin(diameter_angle) = 6.5 ± 0.2 kly. diameter&lt;/ref&gt; in diameter at the widest point. Like most [[w:elliptical galaxies]], M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current [[w:star formation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NSOG&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past. 

The structure and stellar content of M32 is difficult to explain by traditional [[w:galaxy formation]] models. Recent simulations suggest a new scenario in which the strong [[w:Galactic tide|tidal field]] of M31 can transform a [[w:spiral galaxy]] into a compact elliptical. As a small spiral galaxy falls into the central parts of M31, most of the outer layers of the smaller spiral are stripped away. The central bulge of the galaxy is much less affected and retains its morphology. Tidal effects trigger a massive star burst in the core, resulting in the high density of M32 we observe today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bekkietal2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Distance measurements==
At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to M32. The infrared [[w:surface brightness fluctuation]]s distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to M32 using this technique is 2.46 ± 0.09 [[w:light-year|Mly]] (755 ± 28 [[w:parsec|kpc]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;jensenetal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, M32 is close enough that the [[w:tip of the red giant branch]] (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to M32 using this technique is 2.51 ± 0.13 Mly (770 ± 40 kpc).&lt;ref name=&quot;karachentsevetal2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Averaged together, these distance measurements give a distance estimate of 2.49 ± 0.08 Mly (763 ± 24 kpc).{{Ref|B|b}}

A recent paper argues that M32 may actually be a normal (non-dwarf) galaxy that is actually three times farther away, outside the [[w:Local Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, K. S. et al. (2008), [http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1327| A critical review of the evidence for M32 being a compact dwarf satellite of M31 rather than a more distant normal galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Triangulum Galaxy''' (also known as '''[[w:Messier object|Messier]] 33''' or '''[[w:New General Catalogue|NGC]] 598''') is a [[w:spiral galaxy]] approximately 3 million light-years away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Triangulum]]. The galaxy is also sometimes informally referred to as the '''Pinwheel Galaxy''' by some amateur astronomy references&lt;ref name=&quot;omeara1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book

It is the third largest galaxy in the [[w:Local Group]], a [[w:group of galaxies]] that also contains the [[w:Milky Way Galaxy]] and the [[w:Andromeda Galaxy]], and it may be a gravitationally bound companion of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The [[w:Pisces Dwarf]] (LGS 3), one of the small Local Group member galaxies, is possibly a [[w:satellite]] of Triangulum.

==General information==
[[image:Andromeda constellation map.png|left|thumb|170px|Triangulum (M33) and Andromeda (M31)]]
The Triangulum Galaxy can be seen with the naked eye under exceptionally good conditions. While the fainter and more distant galaxy [[w:Messier 81]] has also been seen with the naked eye by very experienced observers. However, some [[w:amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] may confuse the object with the nearby [[w:NGC 752]], an [[w:open cluster]] that is brighter than the Triangulum Galaxy. {{Fact|date=October 2007}} No known pre-telescopic observer notes it, which is not surprising: given its indistinctness, it is not likely to be noticed as an object unless one already knows of its existence.

The Triangulum Galaxy was probably discovered by [[w:Giovanni Batista Hodierna]] before 1654, who may have grouped it together with [[w:open cluster]] [[w:NGC 752|NGC 752]]. It was independently discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in 1764, who catalogued it as [[w:Messier object|M33]] on August 25. M33 was also catalogued independently by [[w:William Herschel]] on September 11, 1784 number H V.17. It was among the first &quot;[[w:spiral nebulae]]&quot; identified as such by [[w:William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]].

[[image:Nursery_of_New_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000972.jpg|left|thumb|170px|[[w:NGC 604]] in the Triangulum Galaxy]]
Herschel also cataloged The Triangulum Galaxy's brightest and largest [[w:H II region]] (diffuse [[w:emission nebula]] containing [[w:ion]]ized [[w:hydrogen]]) as H III.150 separately from the galaxy itself, which eventually obtained [[w:NGC 604|NGC number 604]]. As seen from Earth NGC 604 is located northeast of the galaxy's central core, and is one of the largest H II regions known with a diameter of nearly 1500 [[w:light-year]]s and a [[w:electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] similar to the [[w:Orion Nebula]]. Herschel also noted 3 other smaller H II regions (NGC 588, 592 and 595).

In 2005, using observations of two [[w:Astrophysical maser|water masers]] on opposite sides of Triangulum via the [[w:VLBA]], researchers were, for the first time, able to estimate the angular rotation and proper motion of Triangulum.  A velocity of 190 ± 60 [[w:kilometre|km]]/[[w:second|s]] relative to the Milky Way is computed which means Triangulum is moving towards [[w:Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2007, a black hole about 15.7 times the mass of the Sun was detected in the galaxy using data from the [[w:Chandra X-ray Observatory]].  The black hole, named M33 X-7, orbits a companion star which it eclipses every 3.5 days.&lt;ref&gt;Morcone, Jennifer, [http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/07_releases/press_101707.html Heaviest Stellar Black Hole Discovered in Nearby Galaxy], [[w:Chandra X-ray Observatory]] press release, {{date|2007-10-17|mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distance==
At least three techniques have been used to measure distances to M 33.  Using the [[w:Cepheid variable]] method, an estimate of 2.77 ± 0.13 [[w:light-year|Mly]] (850 ± 40 [[w:parsec|kpc]]) was achieved in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;karachentsevetal2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In 2006, a group of astronomers announced the discovery of an [[w:eclipsing binary|eclipsing binary star]] in the Triangulum Galaxy.  By studying the eclipses of the stars, the astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars they were able to measure the [[w:absolute magnitude]] of the stars. When the [[w:apparent magnitude|visual]] and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be measured. The stars lie at the distance of 3.1 ± 0.2 Mly (940 ± 70 kpc).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonanosetal2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Averaged together, all these distance measurements give a combined distance estimate of 2.81 ± 0.09 Mly (861 ± 28 kpc).&lt;ref name=&quot;averageCalc&quot; /&gt;

In the episode &quot;[[w:Where No One Has Gone Before]]&quot; of the first season of ''[[w:Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the Enterprise is hurled into the far side of M33 by an alien visitor known only as &quot;The Traveler&quot;. 

In the TV series ''[[w:Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', Triangulum Galaxy is one of the three galaxies forming the Systems Commonwealth, along with The Milky Way and Andromeda.

In the 2007 computer game ''[[w:Crysis]]'', the alien antagonists of the game are said to have originated from the galaxy M33.

In the comic-book series [[w:Yoko Tsuno]], the Vineans originated from M33, with the first mention of it being in the sixth album [[w:Les Trois soleils de Vinéa]] (The Three Suns of Vinea).

'''Messier 34''' (also known as '''M 34''' or '''NGC 1039''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Giovanni Batista Hodierna]] before [[w:1654]] and included by [[w:Charles Messier]] in his catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects in [[w:1764]].

M34 is at a distance of about 1,400 [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and consists of some 100 [[w:star]]s. It spans about 35' on the sky which translates to a true radius of 7 [[w:light year]]s. The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions, well away from city lights. It is well seen in [[w:binoculars]].

'''Open Cluster M36''' (also known as '''Messier Object 36''', '''Messier 36''', '''M36''', or '''NGC 1960''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:Auriga constellation]]. It was discovered by [[w:Giovanni Batista Hodierna]] before [[w:1654]]. M36 is at a distance of about 4,100 [[w:light year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and is about 14 light years across. There are at least sixty members in the cluster. The cluster is very similar to the [[w:Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] cluster (M45), and if it were the same distance from Earth it would be of similar magnitude.

'''Messier 37''' (also known as ''M37'' or ''[[w:New General Catalogue|NGC]] 2099'') is the richest [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]. It was discovered by [[w:Giovanni Batista Hodierna]] before [[w:1654]].

[[w:Messier object|Messier]] 37 is the brightest of the three open clusters in Auriga. M37 was missed by [[w:Le Gentil]] when he rediscovered M36 and M38 in 1749.  [[w:Charles Messier]] independently rediscovered M37 in September of [[w:1764]] but all three clusters were recorded by Hodierna before 1654. All three clusters were generally unknown until [[w:1984]].

M37 is roughly 300 million years old and contains over 500 stars with roughly 150 stars brighter than [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 12.5.  M37 also contains at least a dozen [[w:red giants]] with the hottest [[w:main sequence]] star of [[w:spectral type]] B9V.  Its distance is between 3,600 to 4,700 [[w:light years]] and the apparent diameter of 24' corresponds to a [[w:linear extension]] of about 20 to 25 light years. It is classified as [[w:Robert Julius Trumpler|Trumpler]] type I,1,r or I,2,r.

'''Messier 38''' (also known as '''M38''' or '''NGC 1912''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:Auriga constellation]].

It was discovered by [[w:Giovanni Batista Hodierna]] before [[w:1654]] and independently found by [[w:Le Gentil]] in [[w:1749]].  [[w:M36]] and [[w:M37]], also discovered by Hodierna, are grouped together with [[w:M38]] at a distance of about 3,420 [[w:light year]]s away from [[w:Earth]].&lt;ref name=majaess2007&gt;Majaess D. J., Turner D.,  Lane D. (2007).  
[http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/0710.2900 ''In Search of Possible Associations between Planetary Nebulae and Open Clusters''], PASP, 119, 1349&lt;/ref&gt;

The cluster's brightest stars form a pattern resembling the Greek letter [[w:Pi (letter)|Pi]] or, according to Webb, an &quot;oblique cross.&quot; At its distance of 4,200 light years, its angular diameter of about 20' corresponds to about 25 light years, similar to that of its more distant neighbor M37. It is of intermediate age (about 220 million years, according to ''Sky Catalog 2000'') and features a yellow giant of [[w:apparent magnitude]] +7.9 and [[w:spectral type]] G0 as its brightest member. This corresponds to an [[w:absolute magnitude]] of -1.5, or a luminosity of 900 suns. For comparison, the [[w:Sun]] would appear as a faint magnitude +15.3 star from the distance of M38.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Winnecke 4''' (also known as '''Messier 40''' or '''WNC 4''') is a [[w:double star]] in the constellation [[w:Ursa Major]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1764]] while he was searching for a nebula that had been reported in the area by [[w:Hevelius|Johann Hevelius]]. Not seeing any nebulae, Messier catalogued this double star instead. It was subsequently rediscovered by [[w:Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke]] in 1863.

In 1991 the separation between the components was measured at 51&quot;.7, an increase since Messier's time. The general consensus is that this is merely an [[w:optical double|optical double star]] rather than a physically connected system.

Older texts frequently referred to the Orion Nebula as the '''Great Nebula''' in Orion or the '''Great Orion Nebula'''. Yet older, astrological texts refer to it as '''''Ensis''''' ([[w:Latin]] for &quot;sword&quot;), which was also the name given to the star [[w:Eta Orionis]], which can be seen close to the nebula from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Richard Hinchley; [http://users.winshop.com.au/annew/Ensis.html ''Starnames, Their Lore and Meaning''], 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Nebula is one of the most scrutinized and photographed objects in the night sky, and is among the most intensely studied celestial features.&lt;ref name=&quot;successor&quot;&gt;Press release, &quot;[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/press/pr0605.html Astronomers Spot The Great Orion Nebula's Successor]&quot;, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The nebula has revealed much about the process of how [[w:star]]s and [[w:planet]]ary systems are formed from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. Astronomers have directly observed [[w:protoplanetary disk]]s, [[w:brown dwarf]]s, intense and turbulent motions of the gas, and the [[w:Photoionisation|photo-ionizing]] effects of massive nearby stars in the nebula. There are also [[w:supersonic]] &quot;bullets&quot; of gas piercing the dense hydrogen clouds of the Orion Nebula. Each bullet is ten times the diameter of [[w:Pluto]]'s orbit and tipped with iron atoms glowing bright blue. They were probably formed one thousand years ago from an unknown violent event.

==General information==
The  Nebula is in fact part of a much larger nebula that is known as the [[w:Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]]. The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex extends throughout the [[w:constellation]] of Orion and includes [[w:Barnard's Loop]], the [[w:Horsehead Nebula]], [[w:Messier 43|M43]], [[w:M78]] and the [[w:Flame Nebula]]. Stars are forming throughout the Orion Nebula, and due to this heat-intensive process the region is particularly prominent in the [[w:infrared]].

The nebula is visible with the naked eye even from areas affected by some [[w:light pollution]]. It is seen as the middle &quot;star&quot; in the sword of Orion, which are the three stars located south of Orion's Belt. The star appears fuzzy to sharp-eyed observers, and the nebulosity is obvious through [[w:binoculars]] or a small [[w:telescope]].

The Orion Nebula contains a very young [[w:open cluster]], known as the [[w:Trapezium (astronomy)|Trapezium]] due to the [[w:Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of its primary four stars. Two of these can be resolved into their component binary systems on nights with good [[w:astronomical seeing|seeing]], giving a total of six stars. The stars of the Trapezium, along with many other stars, are still in their [[w:star formation|early years]]. The Trapezium may be a component of the much-larger ''Orion Nebula Cluster'', an association of about 2,000 stars within a diameter of 20 light years.

Observers have long noted a distinctive greenish tint to the nebula, in addition to regions of red and areas of blue-violet. The red hue is well-understood to be caused by [[w:H-alpha|H&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;]] recombination line [[w:radiation]] at a [[w:wavelength]] of 656.3 [[w:nanometer|nm]]. The blue-violet coloration is the reflected radiation from the massive [[w:Stellar classification|O-class]] stars at the core of the nebula.

The green hue was a puzzle for astronomers in the early part of the 20th century because none of the known [[w:spectral line]]s at that time could explain it. There was some speculation that the lines were caused by a new element, and the name &quot;nebulium&quot; was coined for this mysterious material. With better understanding of atomic physics, however, it was later determined that the green spectra was caused by a low-probability [[w:electron]] transition in doubly [[w:ion]]ized [[w:oxygen]], a so-called &quot;[[w:Forbidden line|forbidden transition]]&quot;. This radiation was all but impossible to reproduce in the laboratory because it depended on the quiescent and nearly collision-free environment found in deep space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[image:M42m.jpg|thumb|left|Messier's drawing of the Orion Nebula in his 1771 memoir, ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale''.]]

This nebula is currently visible to the unaided eye, yet oddly there is no mention of the nebulosity in the written astronomical records prior to the 17th century. In particular, neither [[w:Ptolemy]] in the ''[[w:Almagest]]'' nor [[w:Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi|Al Sufi]] in his ''[[w:Book of Fixed Stars]]'' noted this nebula, even though they both listed patches of nebulosity elsewhere in the night sky. Curiously this nebula was also not mentioned by [[w:Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], even though he made telescope observations of this part of the constellation in 1610 and 1617.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = James | first = Andrew | date = October 29, 2005 | url = http://homepage.mac.com/andjames/Page204.htm | title = The Great Orion Nebula: M42 and M43 | publisher = Southern Astronomical Delights | accessdate = 2006-10-27 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/s133|archivedate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to some speculation that a flare-up of the illuminating stars may have increased the brightness of the nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tibor Herczeg | first = Norman | date = January 22, 1999 | url = http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/aa/acta/vol03/acta03_246.html | title = The Orion Nebula: A chapter of early nebular studies | publisher = History of Astronomy | accessdate = 2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Nebula is generally credited as being first discovered in [[w:1610]] by [[w:Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] as noted in Peiresc's own records. [[w:Johann Baptist Cysat|Cysatus]] of [[w:Lucerne]], a [[w:Jesuit]] astronomer, was the first to publish note of it (albeit somewhat ambiguously) in a book about a bright [[w:comet]] in 1618. It was independently discovered by several prominent astronomers in the following years, including [[w:Christiaan Huygens]] in 1656 (whose sketch was the first published in 1659). [[w:Charles Messier]] first noted the nebula on March 4, [[w:1769]], and he also noted three of the stars in Trapezium. (The first detection of these three stars is now credited to Galileo in 1617, but he did not notice the surrounding nebula&amp;mdash;possibly due to the narrow field of vision of his early [[w:telescope]].) Charles Messier published the first edition of his catalog of deep sky objects in 1774 (completed in 1771).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Orion Nebula was the 42&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; object in his list, it became identified as M42.

[[w:Spectroscopy]] done by [[w:William Huggins]] showed the gaseous nature of the nebula in 1865. [[w:Henry Draper]] took the first [[w:astrophotography|astrophoto]] of the Orion Nebula on [[w:September 30]], [[w:1880]], which is credited with being the first instance of deep-sky astrophotography in history.

In 1902, [[w:Hermann Carl Vogel|Vogel]] and Eberhard discovered differing velocities within the nebula and by 1914 astronomers at [[w:Marseilles]] had used the interferometer to detect rotation and irregular motions. Campbell and Moore confirmed these results using the spectrograph, demonstrating turbulence within the nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation

In 1931, [[w:Robert Julius Trumpler|Robert J. Trumpler]] noted that the fainter stars near the [[w:Trapezium (astronomy)|Trapezium]] formed a cluster, and he was the first to name them the Trapezium cluster. Based on their magnitudes and spectral types, he derived a distance estimate of 1,800 light years. This was three times further than the commonly accepted distance estimate of the period but was much closer to the modern value. &lt;ref&gt;{{ citation

In 1993, the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] first observed the Orion Nebula. Since then, the nebula has been a frequent target for HST studies. The images have been used to build a detailed model of the nebula in three dimensions. [[w:Protoplanetary disk]]s have been observed around most of the newly formed stars in the nebula, and the destructive effects of high levels of [[w:ultraviolet]] energy from the most massive stars have been studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;salisbury&quot;&gt;David F. Salisbury, 2001, &quot;[http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_orion.htm Latest investigations of Orion Nebula reduce odds of planet formation]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the ''Advanced Camera for Surveys'' instrument of the Hubble Space Telescope finished capturing the most detailed image of the nebula yet taken. The image was taken through 104 orbits of the telescope, capturing over 3,000 stars down to the 23rd magnitude, including infant [[w:brown dwarf]]s and possible brown dwarf [[w:binary star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, scientists working with the HST announced the first ever masses of a pair of eclipsing binary brown dwarfs, 2MASS J05352184–0546085. The pair are located in the Orion Nebula and have approximate masses of 0.054 [[w:Solar mass|M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;]] and 0.034 M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, with an orbital period of 9.8 days. Surprisingly, the more massive of the two also turned out to be the less luminous.&lt;ref&gt;K.G. Stassun, R.D. Mathieu and J.A. Valenti, &quot;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7082/abs/nature04570.html Discovery of two young brown dwarfs in an eclipsing binary system]&quot;, ''Nature'', 440, 311-314, 16 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[image:Trapezium cluster optical and infrared comparison.jpg|thumb|right|Optical images reveal clouds of gas and dust in the Orion Nebula; an infrared image (right) reveals the new stars shining within. ''Credit: C. R. O'Dell-Vanderbilt University, NASA, and ESA''.]]
The entirety of the Orion Nebula extends across a 10° region of the sky, and includes [[w:Interstellar cloud|neutral clouds of gas and dust]], [[w:Star cluster|associations of stars]], [[w:H II region|ionized volumes of gas]] and [[w:reflection nebula]]e.

The nebula forms a roughly spherical cloud that peaks in density near the core.&lt;ref&gt;B. Balick ''et al.'', 1974, &quot;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1974PASP...86..616B The structure of the Orion nebula]&quot;, 1974, ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific'', Vol. 86, Oct., p. 616. &lt;/ref&gt; The cloud has a temperature ranging up to 10,000 K, but this temperature falls dramatically near the edge of the nebula.&lt;ref&gt; ''ibid'', Balick, pg. 621.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the density distribution, the cloud displays a range of velocities and turbulence, particularly around the core region. Relative movements are up to 10&amp;nbsp;km/s (22,000 mi/h), with local variations of up to 50&amp;nbsp;km/s and possibly higher.

The current astronomical model for the nebula consists of an ionized region roughly centered on [[w:Theta1 Orionis C|Theta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Orionis C]], the star responsible for most of the [[w:ultraviolet]] ionizing radiation. (It emits 3-4 times as much photoionizing light as the next brightest star, Theta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Orionis A.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. O'Dell, 2000, &quot;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/PASP/journal/issues/v113n779/201019/201019.html Structure of the Orion Nebula]&quot;, ''Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific'', 113:29-40.&lt;/ref&gt;) This is surrounded by an irregular, concave bay of more neutral, high-density cloud, with clumps of neutral gas lying outside the bay area. This in turn lies on the perimeter of the Orion Molecular Cloud.

Observers have given names to various features in the Orion Nebula. The dark lane that extends from the north toward the bright region is called the &quot;Fish's Mouth&quot;. The illuminated regions to both sides are called the &quot;Wings&quot;. Other features include &quot;The Sword&quot;, &quot;The Thrust&quot; and &quot;The Sail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m042.html M-42]&quot;, Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, April 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stellar formation==
[[image:M42proplyds.jpg|left|thumb|View of several [[w:proplyd]]s within the Orion Nebula taken by the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]]. ''Credit:NASA''.]]
The Orion Nebula is an example of a [[w:stellar nursery]] where new stars are being born. Observations of the nebula have revealed approximately 700 stars in various stages of formation within the nebula.

Recent observations with the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] have yielded the major discovery of [[w:protoplanetary disk]]s within the Orion Nebula, which have been dubbed ''proplyds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; HST has revealed more than 150 of these within the nebula, and they are considered to be systems in the earliest stages of [[w:solar system formation]]. The sheer numbers of them have been used as evidence that the formation of star systems is fairly common in our [[w:universe]].

[[w:Stellar evolution|Stars form]] when clumps of [[w:hydrogen]] and other gases in an [[w:H II region]] contract under their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme temperatures by converting [[w:gravitational potential energy]] to [[w:thermal energy]]. If the temperature gets high enough, [[w:nuclear fusion]] will ignite and form a [[w:protostar]]. The protostar is 'born' when it begins to emit enough radiative energy to balance out its gravity and halt [[w:gravitational collapse]].

Typically, a cloud of material remains a substantial distance from the star before the fusion reaction ignites. This remnant cloud is the protostar's protoplanetary disk, where planets may form. Recent [[w:infrared]] observations show that dust grains in these protoplanetary disks are growing, beginning on the path towards forming [[w:planetesimal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Once the protostar enters into its [[w:main sequence]] phase, it is classified as a star. Even though most planetary disks can form planets, observations show that intense stellar radiation should have destroyed any proplyds that formed near the Trapezium group, if the group is as old as the low mass stars in the cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;salisbury&quot; /&gt; Since proplyds are found very close to the Trapezium group, it can be argued that those stars are much younger than the rest of the cluster members.{{Ref|C|c}}

===Stellar wind and effects===
Once formed, the stars within the nebula emit a stream of charged particles known as a [[w:stellar wind]]. [[w:OB star|Massive stars]] and [[w:T Tauri star|young stars]] have much stronger stellar winds than the [[w:Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Ker Than, 11 January 2006, &quot;[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060111_orion_news.html The Splendor of Orion: A Star Factory Unveiled]&quot;, Space.com&lt;/ref&gt; The wind forms shock waves when it encounters the gas in the nebula, which then shapes the gas clouds. The shock waves from stellar wind also play a large part in stellar formation by compacting the gas clouds, creating density inhomogeneities that lead to gravitational collapse of the cloud.

[[image:HH47 animation.gif|thumb|right|[[w:Herbig-Haro object|Herbig-Haro]] 47 seen with a [[w:bow shock]] and a series of jet-driven shocks &lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hartigan. [http://sparky.rice.edu/~hartigan/movies.html Herbig-Haro Jet Movies from HST], Physics and Astronomy Dept., [[w:Rice University]]&lt;/ref&gt;.]]

There are three different kinds of shocks in the Orion Nebula. Many are featured in [[w:Herbig-Haro objects]]:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/news/releases?id=23966 Mapping Orion's Winds]&quot;, January 16, 2006, ''Vanderbilt News Service''&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[w:Bow shock]]s are stationary and are formed when two particle streams collide with each other. They are present near the hottest stars in the nebula where the stellar wind speed is estimated to be thousands of kilometers per second and in the outer parts of the nebula where the speeds are tens of kilometers per second. Bow shocks can also form at the front end of stellar jets when the jet hits [[w:interstellar medium|interstellar particles]].

* Jet-driven shocks are formed from jets of material sprouting off newborn [[w:T Tauri stars]]. These narrow streams are traveling at hundreds of kilometers per second, and become shocks when they encounter relatively stationary gases.

* Warped shocks appear bow-like to an observer. They are produced when a jet-driven shock encounters gas moving in a cross-current.

The dynamic gas motions in M42 are complex, but are trending out through the opening in the bay and toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', Balick, pp. 623 624.&lt;/ref&gt; The large neutral area behind the ionized region is currently contracting under its own gravity.

==Evolution==
[[image:Orion.nebula.arp.750pix.jpg|left|thumb|Panoramic image of the center of the nebula, taken by the Hubble Telescope. This view is about 2.5 light years across. The Trapezium is at center left. ''Credit:NASA/ESA''.]]
[[w:Interstellar cloud]]s like the Orion Nebula are found throughout [[w:galaxy|galaxies]] such as the [[w:Milky Way]]. They begin as gravitationally bound blobs of cold, neutral hydrogen, intermixed with traces of other elements. The cloud can contain hundreds of thousands of [[w:solar mass]]es and extend for hundreds of light years. The tiny force of gravity that could compel the cloud to collapse is counter-balanced by the very faint pressure of the gas in the cloud.

Whether due to collisions with a spiral arm, or through the shock wave emitted from [[w:supernova]]e, the atoms are precipitated into heavier molecules and the result is a molecular cloud. This presages the formation of stars within the cloud, usually thought to be within a period of 10-30 million years, as regions pass the [[w:Jeans mass]] and the destabilized volumes collapse into disks. The disk concentrates at the core to form a star, which may be surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. This is the current stage of evolution of the nebula, with additional stars still forming from the collapsing molecular cloud. The youngest and brightest stars we now see in the Orion Nebula are thought to be less than 300,000 years old,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.seds.org/hst/OrionFull.html Detail of the Orion Nebula]&quot;, HST image and text.&lt;/ref&gt; and the brightest may be only 10,000 years in age.

Some of these collapsing stars can be particularly massive, and can emit large quantities of ionizing [[w:ultraviolet]] radiation. An example of this is seen with the Trapezium cluster. Over time the ultraviolet light from the massive stars at the center of the nebula will push away the surrounding gas and dust in a process called [[w:photo evaporation]]. This process is responsible for creating the interior cavity of the nebula, allowing the stars at the core to be viewed from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;successor&quot; /&gt; The largest of these stars have short life spans and will evolve to become supernovae.

Within about 100,000 years, most of the gas and dust will be ejected. The remains will form a young open cluster, a cluster of bright, young stars surrounded by wispy filaments from the former cloud. The [[w:Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] is a famous example of such a cluster.

The '''Beehive Cluster''' (also known as '''Praesepe''' (Latin for
&quot;manger&quot;), '''M44''', '''NGC 2632''', or '''Cr 189''') is an [[w:open cluster]] in the
constellation [[w:Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]].  It is one of the nearest open clusters to the [[w:Solar System]], and it contains a larger star population than most other nearby clusters.   Under dark skies the Beehive Cluster looks like a nebulous object to the
naked eye; thus it has been known since ancient
times.  The classical astronomer [[w:Ptolemy]] called it &quot;the nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer,&quot; and it was among the first objects that [[w:Galileo]] studied with his
telescope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messier44&quot;&gt;Messier 44: Observations and Descriptions, at http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/Mdes/dm044.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cluster's age and proper motion coincide with those of the [[w:Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] open cluster, suggesting that both share a similar origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein-Wassink1927&quot;&gt;Klein-Wassink WJ.

Currently there is no consensus on the cluster's distance, with recent sources suggesting 160 to 187 [[w:parsecs]] (520-610 [[w:light years]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinfield2003&quot;&gt;Pinfield DJ, Dobbie PD, Jameson F, Steele IA, Jones HRA, Katsiyannis AC.

Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, 331: 81-120.&lt;/ref&gt; The bright central core of the cluster has a diameter of about 7 parsecs (22.8 light years).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2002&quot;/&gt;

The Beehive is most easily observed when Cancer is high in the sky; in northern latitudes this occurs during the evening from February to May. At 95 arcminutes across, the cluster fits well in the field of view of a pair of binoculars or a telescope of low power.

== History ==
Galileo was the first to observe the Beehive in a telescope, in 1609, and was able to resolve it into 40 stars.  [[w:Charles Messier]] added it to [[w:Messier object|his famous catalog]] in 1769 after precisely measuring its position in the sky.  Along with the [[w:Orion Nebula]] and the [[w:Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Beehive has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets.  One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalog than his scientific rival [[w:Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]], whose 1755 catalog contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.&lt;ref&gt;Frommert, Hartmut (1998). [http://www.seds.org/messier/m-q&amp;a.html#why_M42-45 &quot;Messier Questions &amp; Answers&quot;]. Retrieved March 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greeks and Romans saw this object as a manger from which two donkeys, the adjacent stars [[w:Gamma Cancri|Asellus Borealis]] and [[w:Delta Cancri|Asellus Australis]], are eating; these are the donkeys that [[w:Dionysos]] and [[w:Silenus]] rode into battle against the [[w:Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m044.html M44], Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, February 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This perceived nebulous object is the main celestial object in the 23rd  [[w:Chinese_constellation#The Twenty-Eight Mansions|lunar mansion]] (Hsiu Kuei or Xiu Gui) of ancient Chinese astrology.  Ancient Chinese skywatchers saw this as a ghost or demon riding in a carriage and likened its appearance to a &quot;cloud of pollen blown from willow catkins.&quot;

== Morphology and Composition ==
Like many [[w:star clusters]] of all kinds, Praesepe has experienced [[w:mass segregation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Portegies2001&quot;&gt;Portegies Zwart SF, McMillan SL, Hut P, Makino J. (2001) Star cluster ecology IV. Dissection of an open star cluster:  Photometry.  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 321: 199-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus2007&quot;/&gt;  This means that bright, massive stars are concentrated in the cluster's core, while dimmer, less massive stars populate its halo (sometimes called the &quot;corona&quot;).  The cluster's core radius is estimated at 3.5 parsecs (11.4 light years); its half-mass radius is about 3.9 parsecs (12.7 light years); and its tidal radius is about 12 parsecs (39 light years).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus2007&quot;/&gt;  However, the tidal radius also includes many stars that are merely &quot;passing through&quot; and not bona fide cluster members.   

Altogether, the Praesepe cluster contains at least 1000 gravitationally bound stars, for a total mass of about 500-600 Solar masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus2007&quot;/&gt;  A recent survey counts 1010 high-probability members, of which 68% are [[w:red dwarf|M dwarfs]], 30% are Sun-like stars of spectral classes F, G, and K, and about 2% are bright stars of spectral class A.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus2007&quot;/&gt; Also present are five giant stars, four of which have spectral class K0 III and the fifth G0 III.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein-Wassink1927&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abt1999&quot;&gt;Abt HA, Willmarth DW. (1999) Binaries in the Praesepe and Coma star clusters and their implications for binary evolution.  Astrophysical Journal, 521: 682-690.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus2007&quot;/&gt;  

So far, eleven [[w:white dwarfs]] have been identified, representing the final evolutionary phase of the cluster's most massive stars, which originally belonged to spectral type B.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobbie2006&quot;/&gt;  [[w:Brown dwarfs]], however, are extremely rare in this cluster,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez-Garcia2006&quot;&gt;Gonzalez-Garcia BM, Zapatero Osorio MR, Bejar VJS, Bihain G, Barrado y Navascues D, Caballero JA, Morales-Calderon M.  (2006)  A search for substellar members in the Praesepe and Sigma Orionis clusters.  Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, 460: 799-810.&lt;/ref&gt; probably because they have been lost by tidal stripping from the halo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus2007&quot;/&gt;
 
The cluster has a visual brightness of magnitude 3.1. Its brightest stars are blue-white and of magnitude 6 to 6.5. [[w:42 Cancri]] is a confirmed member.

In astronomy, the '''Pleiades''', or seven sisters, ([[w:Messier objects|Messier object 45]]) are an [[w:open star cluster]] in the constellation of Taurus. It is among the nearest star clusters to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the [[w:naked eye]] in the [[w:night sky]]. Pleiades has several meanings in different cultures and traditions.

The cluster is dominated by hot [[w:stellar classification|blue stars]] that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint [[w:reflection nebula|reflection nebulosity]] around the brightest stars was thought at first to be left over from the formation of the cluster (hence the alternate name '''Maia Nebula''' after the star [[w:Maia (star)|Maia]]), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the [[w:interstellar medium]] that the stars are currently passing through. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.

Other notable names of Pleiades include:
*الثريا (al-Thurayya) in [[w:Arabic]]
*כִּימָה in [[w:Biblical Hebrew]]
*ثريا (Sorayya) in [[w:Persian language|Persian]] and [[w:Urdu language|Urdu]]
*좀생이 (Jomsaeng-i) in [[w:Korean language|Korean]] (usually suffixed with 별 ''byeol'' &quot;star&quot; or 성단 ''seongdan'' &quot;star cluster&quot;)

==Observational history==
[[File:Pleiades-comet-Machholz.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|[[w:Comet Machholz]] appears to pass near the Pleiades in early 2005]]
The Pleiades are a prominent sight in winter in the [[w:Northern Hemisphere]] and in summer in the [[w:Southern Hemisphere]], and have been known since antiquity to cultures all around the world, including the [[w:Māori]] (who call them [[w:Matariki]]) and [[w:Indigenous Australians|Australian Aborigines]], the [[w:Persian Empire|Persians]] (who called them ''Parveen/parvin and Sorayya''), the [[w:China|Chinese]], the [[w:Maya civilization|Maya]] (who called them ''Tzab-ek''), the [[w:Aztec]] (''[[w:Tianquiztli]]''), and the [[w:Sioux]] of [[w:North America]].

The [[w:Babylonian star catalogues]] name them MUL.MUL or &quot;star of stars&quot;, and they head the list of stars along the ecliptic, reflecting the fact that they were close to the point of [[w:vernal equinox]] around the 23rd century BC.
Some [[w:Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomers considered them to be a distinct [[w:constellation]], and they are mentioned by [[w:Hesiod]], and in [[w:Homer]]'s ''[[w:Iliad]]'' and ''[[w:Odyssey]]''. They are also mentioned three times in the [[w:Bible]] ([[w:Book of Job|Job]] 9:9 and 38:31, as well as [[w:Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:8). The Pleiades ([[w:Krittika]]) are particularly revered in [[w:Hindu mythology]] as the six mothers of the war god [[w:Skanda]], who developed six faces, one for each of them. Some scholars of [[w:Islam]] suggested that the Pleiades (Al thuraiya) are the Star in [[w:Najm]] which is mentioned in the [[w:Quran]].
[[File:Pleiades Spitzer big.jpg|right|thumb|A [[w:Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]] image of the Pleiades in [[w:infrared]] light, showing the associated dust.  Credit: [[w:NASA]]/[[w:JPL]]-[[w:Caltech]]]]
They have long been known to be a physically related group of stars rather than any chance alignment. The Reverend [[w:John Michell]] calculated in 1767 that the probability of a chance alignment of so many bright stars was only 1 in 500,000, and so correctly surmised that the Pleiades and many other clusters of stars must be physically related.&lt;ref&gt;Michell J. (1767), ''An Inquiry into the probable Parallax, and Magnitude, of the Fixed Stars, from the Quantity of Light which they afford us, and the particular Circumstances of their Situation'', Philosophical Transactions, v. 57, p. 234-264&lt;/ref&gt; When studies were first made of the stars' [[w:proper motion]]s, it was found that they are all moving in the same direction across the sky, at the same rate, further demonstrating that they were related.

[[w:Charles Messier]] measured the position of the cluster and included it as M45 in his [[w:Messier objects|catalogue]] of [[w:comet]]-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the [[w:Orion Nebula]] and the [[w:Beehive Cluster|Praesepe]] cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets&amp;mdash;something which seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival [[w:Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]], whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.&lt;ref&gt;Frommert, Hartmut (1998) [http://www.seds.org/messier/m-q&amp;a.html#why_M42-45 &quot;Messier Questions &amp; Answers&quot;]. Retrieved March 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distance==
The distance to the Pleiades is an important first step in the so-called [[w:cosmic distance ladder]], a sequence of distance scales for the whole universe. The size of this first step calibrates the whole ladder, and the scale of this first step has been estimated by many methods. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a [[w:Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] for the cluster which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the distance to the Pleiades.

Results prior to the launch of the [[w:Hipparcos]] satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 [[w:parsec]]s away from Earth. Hipparcos caused consternation among astronomers by finding a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the [[w:parallax]] of stars in the cluster&amp;mdash;a technique which should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work has consistently found that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was in error, but it is not yet known why the error occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Soderblom D.R., Nelan E., Benedict G.F., McArthur B., Ramirez I., Spiesman W., Jones B.F. (2005), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AJ....129.1616S ''Confirmation of Errors in Hipparcos Parallaxes from Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor Astrometry of the Pleiades''], The Astronomical Journal, v. 129, pp. 1616-1624.&lt;/ref&gt; The distance to the Pleiades is currently thought to be the higher value of about 135 parsecs (roughly 440 light years).&lt;ref name=&quot;Percival&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwahlen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, D. G. (1979),[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1979PASP...91..642T&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf], Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, v. 91, pp. 642-647.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:X-ray image of the Pleiades.gif|thumb|right|[[w:X-ray]] images of the Pleiades reveal the stars with the hottest atmospheres. Green squares indicate the seven optically brightest stars.]]
The cluster core radius is about eight [[w:light-year]]s and tidal radius is about 43 light years. The cluster contains over 1,000 statistically confirmed members, although this figure excludes unresolved [[w:binary star]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Joseph D. 2053&quot;&gt;Adams, Joseph D.; Stauffer, John R.; Monet, David G.; Skrutskie, Michael F.; Beichman, Charles A. (2001), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....121.2053A ''The Mass and Structure of the Pleiades Star Cluster from 2MASS''], The Astronomical Journal, v.121, p.2053.&lt;/ref&gt; It is dominated by young, hot [[w:stellar classification|blue stars]], up to 14 of which can be seen with the naked eye depending on local observing conditions. The arrangement of the brightest stars is somewhat similar to [[w:Ursa Major]] and [[w:Ursa Minor]]. The total mass contained in the cluster is estimated to be about 800 [[w:solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Joseph D. 2053&quot;/&gt;

The cluster contains many [[w:brown dwarf]]s, which are objects with less than about 8% of the [[w:Sun]]'s mass, not heavy enough for [[w:nuclear fusion]] reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% of the total population of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass.&lt;ref&gt;Moraux, E.; Bouvier, J.; Stauffer, J. R.; Cuillandre, J.-C. (2003), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...400..891M ''Brown
 in the Pleiades cluster: Clues to the substellar mass function''], Astronomy and Astrophysics, v.400, p.891.&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.

==Age and future evolution==
Ages for star clusters can be estimated by comparing the [[w:Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] for the cluster with theoretical models of [[w:stellar evolution]], and using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The spread in estimated ages is a result of uncertainties in stellar evolution models. In particular, models including a phenomenon known as ''[[w:convective overshoot]]'', in which a [[w:convection|convective]] zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, result in higher apparent ages.

Another way of estimating the age of the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal [[w:main sequence]] stars, [[w:lithium]] is rapidly destroyed in [[w:nuclear fusion]] reactions, but brown dwarfs can retain their lithium. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 million [[w:kelvin]]s, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.&lt;ref&gt;Basri G., Marcy G. W., Graham J. R. (1996), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...458..600B ''Lithium in Brown Dwarf Candidates: The Mass and Age of the Faintest Pleiades Stars''], Astrophysical Journal v.458, p.600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ushomirsky, G., Matzner, C., Brown, E., Bildsten, L., Hilliard, V., Schroeder, P.

The cluster's [[w:relative motion]] will eventually lead it to be located, as seen from Earth many millennia in the future, passing below the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion.  Also, like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever, as some component stars will be ejected after close encounters and others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with [[w:giant molecular cloud]]s and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.

==Reflection nebulosity==
[[File:Reflection nebula IC 349 near Merope.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] image of reflection nebulosity near Merope]]
Under ideal observing conditions, some hint of nebulosity may be seen around the cluster, and this shows up in long-exposure photographs. It is a [[w:reflection nebula]], caused by dust reflecting the blue light of the hot, young stars.

It was formerly thought that the dust was left over from the [[w:star formation|formation]] of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by [[w:radiation pressure]]. Instead, it seems that the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the [[w:interstellar medium]].

Studies show that the dust responsible for the nebulosity is not uniformly distributed, but is concentrated mainly in two layers along the line of sight to the cluster. These layers may have been formed by deceleration due to radiation pressure as the dust has moved towards the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Steven J.; Nordsieck, Kenneth H. (2003), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...589..362G ''The Pleiades Reflection Nebula. II. Simple Model Constraints on Dust Properties and Scattering Geometry''], The Astrophysical Journal, v.589, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brightest stars in Pleiades==
[[File:M45map.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A map of the Pleiades]]
The nine brightest stars of the Pleiades are named for the [[w:Pleiades (mythology)|Seven Sisters]] of [[w:Greek mythology]]: [[w:Sterope (Pleiad)|Sterope]], [[w:Merope]], [[w:Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]], [[w:Maia (mythology)|Maia]], [[w:Taygete]], [[w:Celaeno]], and [[w:Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], along with their parents [[w:Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[w:Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]]. As daughters of Atlas, the [[w:Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] were sisters of the Pleiades. The English name of the cluster itself is of [[w:Greek language|Greek]] origin, though of uncertain etymology.&lt;!-- Traditionally, it has simply meant &quot;daughters of Pleione,&quot; but the name may predate the myth of seven sisters. --&gt; Suggested derivations include: from πλεîν ''plein'', to sail, making the Pleiades the &quot;sailing ones&quot;; from ''pleos'', full or many; or from ''[[w:peleiades]]'', flock of doves. The following table gives details of the brightest stars in the cluster:

'''Messier 46''' (also known as '''M 46''' or '''NGC 2437''') is an 
[[w:open cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Puppis]]. It was discovered by 
[[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1771]].  Dreyer described it as &quot;very bright,
very rich, very large.&quot; M46 is about 5,500 [[w:light-year]]s away with an estimated age on the order of several 100 million years.&lt;ref name=majaess2007&gt;Majaess D. J., Turner D.,  Lane D. (2007). [http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/0710.2900 ''In Search of Possible Associations between Planetary Nebulae and Open Clusters''], PASP, 119, 1349&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[w:planetary nebula]] [[w:Planetary Nebula NGC 2438|NGC 2438]] appears to lie within the cluster near its northern edge (the faint smudge at the top center of the image), but it is most likely unrelated since it does not share the cluster's radial velocity.&lt;ref name=majaess2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=kiss2008&gt;Kiss, L. L., Szabó, Gy. M., Balog, Z., Parker, Q. A., Frew, D. J. (2008). [http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0327 ''AAOmega radial velocities rule out current membership of the planetary nebula NGC 2438 in the open cluster M46''], MNRAS&lt;/ref&gt;  The case is yet another example of a superposed pair, joining the famed case of [[w:NGC 2818]].
&lt;ref name=mermilliod2001&gt;Mermilliod, J.-C., Clariá, J. J., Andersen, J., Piatti, A. E., Mayor, M. (2001). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001A%26A...375...30M ''Red giants in open clusters. IX. NGC 2324, 2818, 3960 and 6259''], A&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=majaess2007/&gt; 

M46 is about a degree east of [[w:Messier 47|M47]] in the sky, so the
two fit well in a binocular or wide-angle telescope field.

==Discovery==
[[image:M51Sketch.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Sketch of M51 by Lord Rosse (William Parsons) in 1845]]

What was later known as the Whirlpool Galaxy, was discovered&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Catalogue des Nébuleuses &amp; des amas d'Étoiles.''&quot; by Charles Messier, '''Connoissance des Temps for 1784''' (published 1781), pp. 227-267 (page 246) [Bibcode: 1781CdT..1784..227M]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1774 by [[w:Charles Messier]], and is designated as [[w:Messier object|M51]].  Its companion galaxy, [[w:NGC 5195]], was discovered in 1781 by [[w:Pierre Méchain]]. It was however not until 1845 that the Whirlpool became the first to be recognized as a spiral. This was achieved by [[w:William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] employing a 72-inch (~1.83 m) [[w:reflector telescope|reflecting telescope]] which he constructed at [[w:Birr Castle]], Ireland. Sometimes M51 is used to refer to the pair of galaxies, in which case the individual galaxies may be referred to as M51A (NGC 5194) and M51B (NGC 5195). 

In 2005 a [[w:supernova]] ([[w:SN 2005cs]]) was observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy, peaking at [[w:apparent magnitude]] 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = MacRobert | first = Alan M. | date = [[w:August 24]] [[w:2005]] | url = http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1544_1.asp | title = Supernova in M51 | work = Sky Tonight | publisher =Sky and Telescope  | accessdate = August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bishop | first = David | url = http://www.supernovae.net/sn2005/sn2005cs.html | title = Supernova 2005cs in M51 | work = supernovae.net | accessdate = August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
With the recent SN 2008cs derived estimate of 23 Mly distance, and an angular diameter of roughly 11.2&amp;prime;, it can be inferred that M51's bright circular disk has a radius of about ~38,000 light-years. Its [[w:mass]] is estimated to be 160 billion solar masses.

[[w:File:M51 whirlpool galaxy black hole.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cross within the nucleus of M51 indicating two dust rings around the black hole at the center of the nebula]]A [[w:black hole]], surrounded by a ring of dust, is thought to exist at the heart of the spiral. The dust ring stands almost perpendicular to the relatively flat spiral nebula. A secondary ring crosses the primary ring on a different axis, a phenomenon that is contrary to expectations. A pair of [[w:ionization cone]]s extend from the axis of the main dust ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = [[w:June 8]] [[w:1992]] | url = http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1992/17/text/ | title = NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Resolves a Dark &quot;x&quot; Across the Nucleus of M51 | work = News Center | publisher = HubbleSite | accessdate = August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual appearance==
Located within the constellation [[w:Canes Venatici]], M51 is found by following the easternmost star of the [[w:Big Dipper]], [[w:Eta Ursae Majoris]], and going 3.5° southeast. Its declination is +47°, making it a [[w:Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] for observers located above 43°N latitude; it reaches high altitudes throughout the northern hemisphere making it an accessible object from the early hours in winter through the end of spring season, after which observation is hindered in lower lattitudes.

M51 is visible through binoculars under [[w:Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|dark sky conditions]] and can be resolved in detail with modern amateur telescopes. When seen through a 100&amp;nbsp;mm telescope the basic outlines of M51 and its companion are visible. Under dark skies, and with a moderate eyepiece through a 150&amp;nbsp;mm telescope, M51's intrinsic spiral structure can be detected. With larger (&gt;300&amp;nbsp;mm) instruments under dark sky conditions, the various spiral bands are apparent with [[w:HII regions]] visible, and M51 can be seen to be attached to [[w:M51B]].

As is usual for galaxies, the true extent of its structure can only be gathered from inspecting photographs; long exposures reveal a large nebula extending beyond the visible circular appearance.    

In January 2005 the Hubble Heritage Team constructed a 11477x7965 pixel composite image (shown in the info box above) of M51 using Hubble's ACS instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = [[w:April 25]] [[w:2005]] | url = http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/12/image/a | title = Out of This Whirl: the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and Companion Galaxy | work = News Center | publisher = HubbleSite | accessdate = August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiral structure==
The very pronounced spiral structure of the Whirlpool Galaxy is believed to be the result of the close interaction between it and its companion galaxy [[w:NGC 5195]].

==Star formation==
Induced spiral structure in the larger galaxy isn't the only effect of the interaction. Significant compression of hydrogen gas occurs that leads to the development of starbirth regions. In pictures of M51 these show up as the bright blue 'knots' throughout the spiral arms. 

Generally speaking, hydrogen gas is the most common component of the [[w:interstellar medium]] (the vast space between stars and planetary systems in galaxies). It exists primarily in its atomic and molecular form, and forms huge clouds throughout the entire galaxy. When large sources of gravitational pull pass nearby, such as other galaxies, gravitational interactions produce compression (density) waves that sweep through these hydrogen clouds. This causes some regions of the previously diffuse gas to compress into tight pockets of opaque and dense gas, these are dust lanes one so often sees in the spiral arms. In regions where the concentration and density of gas reaches a critical value, further collapse under its own gravitational pull occurs, and stars are born at the center of the collapse, where the gas is compressed so strongly that [[w:Nuclear fusion|fusion]] initiates. 

When this happens, these new-born stars gobble up huge amounts of gas causing them to expand, shine even hotter, and finally sweep away the surrounding layers of dust and gas by increasing efflux of the stellar wind. The gigantic proportions of the clouds out of which they are born means stars seldom, if ever, are created in isolation. Thus regions of several hot young stars emit sufficient light energy that they can be seen in the high resolution pictures of M51 across millions of lightyears distance.

For an example of such a formation in our own galaxy, see M16, the [[w:Eagle Nebula]].

==Companion==
Decades ago, it was not known with certainty whether the companion galaxy NGC 5195 was a true companion, or another galaxy passing at a distance. The advent of radio astronomy and subsequent radio images of M51 unequivocally demonstrated the reality of the interaction. 

Recent simulations bear out that M51's spiral structure was caused by NGC 5195 passing through the main disk of M51 about 500 to 600 million years ago. In this model,&lt;ref name=&quot;Salo &amp; Laurikainen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi=10.1023/A:1017002909665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
NGC 5195 came from behind M51 through the disk towards the observer and made another disk crossing as recently as 50 to 100 Myrs ago until it is where we observe it to be now, slightly behind M51.

'''Messier 53''' (also known as ''M53'', or ''NGC 5024'') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:Coma Berenices constellation]]. It was discovered by [[w:Johann Elert Bode]] in [[w:1775]]. M53 is one of the more outlying globular clusters, being about 60,000 [[w:light-year]]s away from the [[w:Galactic Center]], and almost the same distance (about 58,000 light-years) from the [[w:Solar system]].

Displays the Bandwidth of the Interfaces. They can be excluded at [[#Bandwidth_Monitoring|Administration&amp;rarr;Bandwidth Monitoring]]

The Real-Time and Last 24 Hours charts are rendered with [[w:SVG|Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)]], and require an SVG-enabled web browser. Mozilla Firefox, Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari 3 and Opera have SVG built-in. Microsoft Internet Explorer requires the SVG plugin from the [http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html Adobe SVG Viewer download area].  The charts display an Interface Tab for each available router interface. Persistence of Interface Tab selection requires browser cookies to be enabled.

Charts share these controls:
*''Avg:  Off, 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x'' :  Number of samples to average, or no averaging.
*''Max:  Uniform, Per IF  '':  Graphs are scaled ''Uniformly'' to the max traffic value of all interfaces, or individually ''Per IF''.
*''Display:  Solid, Line  '':  Selects a solid-filled &quot;mountain&quot; display or line only.
*''Color:  Blue &amp; Orange »'':  Selects trace pair color scheme
*''[reverse]              '':  Toggles trace color order

*Mouse-click readout : Click anywhere on the graph to place a static readout. 
:Note: Does '''not''' update with graph movement or scaling.

; Real-Time : The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/bwm-realtime.htm Real-Time Bandwidth] section displays a chart, updated every two seconds, of the last 10 minutes of bandwidth used.  Tabs at the top allow selection of the various interfaces for detail on the bandwidth for that interface. 

; Last 24 Hours : The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/bwm-24.htm Last 24 Hours] section displays a chart, updated every two minutes, of the last 4/6/12/18/24 hours of bandwidth usage and the total data during the period. Tabs at the top allow selection of the various interfaces for detail on the bandwidth for that interface.

; Daily : The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/bwm-daily.htm Daily] section displays a table with a row for each day showing download, upload and total bandwidth consumption.  The default unit is GB (actually [[Wikipedia:Gibibyte|gigabinary bytes]]), but can be changed to MB or KB.

; Weekly : The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/bwm-weekly.htm Weekly] section displays a table with a row for each week showing download, upload and total bandwidth consumption.  The default unit is GB (Gigabytes), but can be changed to MB or KB.  The default week starting day is Sun (Sunday), but can be changed.  An option to show Summary or Full data is available.

; Monthly : The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/bwm-monthly.htm Monthly] section displays a table with a row for each month showing total bandwidth consumption and the difference in bandwidth usage compared to the previous month. The start date of the month can be changed at &quot;Administration-&gt;Bandwidth Monitoring-&gt;First Day Of The Month&quot; to match the start date of data counter of any particular Internet plan.

== Tools ==

A collection of useful network tools to analyze and troubleshoot the LAN, WAN and/or Wireless networks connected to the router.

=== Ping ===

The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/tools-ping.htm Ping] tool allows sending 'ping' packets to computers on the Internet to verify connectivity.  Enter the domain (e.g. example.com) or IPV4 address (e.g. 192.0.32.10) &lt;!-- (Internet only) eh? --&gt; to ping, adjust the Ping Count or Packet Size as desired, and click [Ping].  Results are displayed after all pings complete. The default timeout is 2 seconds, with a 1 second delay between attempts.

; Address : ''the desired IP address or domain''
; Ping Count : ''total number of pings to attempt''
; Packet Size : ''length of data to send.  56 is the default. 1500 is a typical maximum.''

'''&lt;u&gt;Results Table&lt;/u&gt;'''
; Seq : ''sequence number of ping attempt''
; Address : ''(domain) (IP address)''
; RX Bytes : ''number of received bytes. 8 bytes more than 'Packet Size' is typical.''
; TTL : ''Time to Live - number of hops this packet is permitted to take before expiring.''
; RTT (ms) : ''Round Trip Time in milliseconds.''
; +/- (ms) : ''Jitter: difference in RTT from prior measurement.''
'''&lt;u&gt;Totals&lt;/u&gt;'''
; Round-Trip: ''&lt;minimum time&gt;'' min, ''&lt;average time&gt;'' avg, ''&lt;maximum time&gt;'' max (ms)
;   Packets: ''&lt;Ping Count&gt;'' transmitted, ''&lt;Seq - 1&gt;'' received, ''&lt;percentage&gt;''% lost

=== Trace ===

The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/tools-trace.htm Trace] tool allows you to perform a TRACERT (Trace Route) from your router to any Internet server.  Enter the domain or IP address to trace to, and optionally the maximum hops and/or wait times, and click [TRACE].  Results are displayed when the trace is complete. ''This may take hops*wait-times before being displayed.''  

; Address : ''the desired IP address or domain''
; Maximum Hops : ''total number of nodes to attempt''
; Maximum Wait Time (per hop): ''number of seconds to wait for each hop''

'''&lt;u&gt;Results Table&lt;/u&gt;'''
; Hop : ''sequence number of this hop''
; Address : ''domain (IP address)''
; Min (ms) : ''shortest ping time found for this hop''
; Max (ms) : ''longest ping time found for this hop''
; Avg (ms) : ''Five traces are performed to produce the average time displayed.''
; +/- (ms) : ''Jitter: average differences in RTT from prior measurements.''

=== Wireless Site Survey ===
The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/tools-survey.htm Wireless Site Survey] tool scans the wireless frequencies accessible to eth1 and reports a table of wireless devices.  The Last Seen time stamp, SSID, BSSID (MAC address), RSSI, Noise, Quality rating (1-100), Channel, Capabilities and Rates are displayed.

'''Table Content'''
; Last Seen : ''Time stamp of most recent network detection.''
; SSID : ''Service Set Identifier – remote-assigned network name.''
; BSSID : ''MAC address of remote network device.''
; RSSI : ''Relative Signal Strength (dBm).''
; Noise : ''Detected noise floor (dBm).''
; Quality : ''Derived channel signal quality estimate (1-100, 100=best).''
; Ch : ''Operating channel of remote network device.''
; Capabilities : ''List of protocol modifiers available.''
; Rates : ''List of available bit rates.''

=== WOL (Wake on LAN) ===
The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/tools-wol.htm WOL] tool allows you to send [[w:Wake-on-lan|Wake-on-LAN (WOL)]] packets to computers on your network.  A table of known MAC addresses is displayed so that individual WOL targets can be quickly selected, or user-defined MAC addresses can be entered in a data field.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Table Content'''
; MAC Address : ''???''
; IP Address : ''???''
; Status : ''???''
; Name : ''???''

; Refresh : ''???''

; MAC Address List : ''Enter any MAC address you want in this box and click Wake Up to attempt to wake that machine.''
; Wake up : ''Wake up the computer(s) with the MAC address(es) you have entered in the above box.''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, you can add a static DHCP entry for &lt;code&gt;ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.254&lt;/code&gt; (the ip can be anything you want). And forward udp port 9 (the port can also be anything you want) to &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.254&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, make sure .254 isn't in the range of your DHCP. (Note, this trick will work on any router which you can get shell access to via &lt;code&gt;arp -s 192.168.1.254 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through ssh/telnet interface you can also issue ether-wake command.
Remote SSH enables wakeup via
&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh root@yourwrt 'ether-wake mac-address'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
as it can be difficult to get a WOL packet through the NAT.

== Basic ==
Controls the most basic settings for the router.

=== Network ===

The [http://lampiweb.com/tomato/basic-network.htm Network] section allows you to set up the [[w:Internet|Internet]] / [[w:Wide_Area_Network|Wide Area Network (WAN)]] connection that the router uses, the basic parameters of the Local Area Network (LAN) the basic Wireless radio parameters.

==== WAN / Internet ====

Specifies how your router should connect to the Internet.  Normally, this is done via an Ethernet cable connected from the WAN/Internet port to a Cable or DSL Modem.

; ''Type'':  Specifies the type of connection used. The rest of the parameters in this section are dependent on this connection type.
{| border=1
  |+ WAN Connection Types
|-
  ! Common Name
  ! Description
|-
  | [[w:DHCP|DHCP]]
  | Get WAN IP assignment from DHCP server. The default for most Cable modems is &quot;DHCP&quot;, meaning that the router simply talks to your cable modem and is automatically assigned an IP address and other connection data.
; [[w:Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] :
|-
  | [[w:PPPoE|PPPoE]]
  | DSL connections generally use PPPoE, which usually requires a username and password (provided by your DSL provider). Leave &quot;Service Name&quot; blank unless your provider requires one otherwise you won't be able to connect.
|-
  | Static
  | Manually set a static IP address.
|-
  | [[w:PPTP|PPTP]]
  | Connect to VPN server via PPTP
|-
  | [[w:L2TP|L2TP]]
  | Connect VPN server via L2TP (e.g., Cisco)
|-
  | Disabled
  | No connection to an Internet stream is handled. 
|}

==== LAN ====

Controls setup of the [[w:Local_Area_Network|Local area Network (LAN)]], which includes settings for wired and wireless clients connected to the router.

; ''Router IP Address'':  The IP address assigned to the router on the LAN.  Default is 192.168.1.1.
; ''Subnet Mask'': The default of 255.255.255.0 means that anything starting in the first three numbers as the router (default 192.168.1.x) is assumed to be on the Local Network.  Making this too broad means that some Internet servers may be inaccessible.
; ''Static DNS'':  Allows you to list a series of DNS servers manually (as opposed to getting them from your Internet Service Provider).  Useful if your ISP's DNS servers are slow or unreliable, or if you prefer a different one.

==== DHCP Server ====
[[w:Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)]] is a protocol used by networked computers (clients) to obtain IP addresses. 
Use this to control the IP addresses that your router hands out to computers connected to the Wired or Wireless Local Network.   If checked, the router will hand out addresses within the range specified.  You may also customize the amount of time before computers on the LAN will renew their IP addresses (the ''Lease Time'') and specify a [[w:Windows_Internet_Name_Service|Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)]] server if you use WINS.

==== Wireless ====

Controls the connection over the Wireless Local Area Network.

; ''Enable Wireless'': If checked, Wireless access will be allowed.
; ''MAC Address'': Displays the MAC address assigned to the Wireless radio on the router.
; ''Wireless Mode'': 
{| border=1
  |+ Wireless Mode Selections
|-
  ! Selection
  ! Description
|-
  | Access Point
  | The normal setting which allows clients to connect to this router wirelessly.
|-
  | Access Point + WDS
  | Sets the router in &quot;repeater mode,&quot; allowing clients to connect wirelessly while simultaneously acting as a [[w:Wireless_Distribution_System|Wireless Distribution System (WDS)]] base station.
|-
  | Wireless Client
  | 
|-
  | Wireless Ethernet Bridge
  | This allows it to connect to another gateway router while still keeping all computers connected to both routers in the same subnet. Note: As of version 1.19 - Wireless Bridge must be set to WPA
|-
  | WDS
  | Serve as a [[w:Wireless_Distribution_System|Wireless Distribution System (WDS)]] base station only.
|}
Note:  If the router is used as a wireless client or Wireless Ethernet Bridge, it cannot be used as an access point at the same time.

; ''B/G Mode'': This may be Mixed (B+G), B-Only (restricted to 802.11b), or G-Only (restricted to 802.11g).  If you set this to B-Only or G-Only, connection attempts from the other protocol may be seen as interference.  Recommend leaving this set to &quot;Mixed&quot;.
; ''SSID'': Wireless router identifier.  Allows you to uniquely identify your router and differentiate it from other routers in range.
:;'''Broadcast''': If checked, the SSID will be broadcast, allowing the router to be found more easily.  Disabling this is a very limited security measure.  Casual scans will not be able to find the router, but anyone running sniffing software can easily find it.

; ''Channel'': The 2.4xxGhz range channel used by the router, from channel 1-14 (2.412 - 2.484 GHz). It's interesting to know that most routers default at 6 or 11 and surprisingly few people change them. It's noted that channel 14 is forbidden in most countries. Channels above 11 are not licensed to use in North America. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels List of WLAN channels at Wikipedia] for details. 
: The '''&quot;scan&quot; button''' on that page (simple result) or '''Tools -&gt; Wireless Survey''' (detailed result) will detect any other access points in range, completing in about 10 seconds.  Choose the frequency that is the furthest from any other frequency in use.
: The &quot;scan&quot; button fills out a table like [http://i37.tinypic.com/esqiza.jpg this example], in the format of &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;(''n'' AP / strongest &quot;''xxx''&quot; -n dBm)&lt;/font&gt;. n = number. xxx = SSID. 
:* &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;''n'' AP&lt;/font&gt; means how many other wireless networks are found in your surroundings. 
:* &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;strongest &quot;'''xxx'''&quot; -n dBm&lt;/font&gt; means the wireless network which has the strongest signal around you (the lower the dBm, the weaker. Note that dBm is indicated as a negative value). Normally -80dBm and below is considered 'unacceptable' signal level and is too weak for most radio equipment.

; ''Security'': Allows you to secure your wireless connections.
:* '''Disabled''' means all connections are unencrypted and anyone can read traffic.
:* '''WEP''' (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is the oldest Wi-Fi security framework which some older devices only support it. While better than nothing, it is very easily broken (a few minutes to crack it). 
:** Tip: If you must use '''WEP''' because a device doesn't support WPA/WPA2, go to '''Basic -&gt; Wireless Filter'''. Click on &quot;'''Permit Only the Following Clients'''&quot; - only clients which match the MAC address can access to your wireless network. It isn't really safe, but better than nothing.
:* '''WPA personal/enterprise''' (WPA = '''W'''i-Fi '''P'''rotected '''A'''ccess) is more secure than WEP but only newer devices support it. Choose '''personal''' if you are a home user. Choose '''AES''' for encryption algorithm. TKIP has exploits and is crackable. Use very long (20-63 characters) and an unguessably random passphrase. Don't be worried about forgetting your passphrase since you only need to enter once per device.
:* '''WPA2 personal/enterprise''' improves upon WPA and is currently the most secure encryption protocol but only newer devices support it. See WPA for other details.
:* '''Radius''' [[w:RADIUS|Remote Authentication Dial In User Service]]
: Notes: Security can be increased slightly by limiting the number of wireless clients which can connect to your router. It's located at '''Advanced --&gt; Wireless -&gt; &quot;Maximum Clients&quot; option'''.

=== Identification ===

; ''Router Name'':  Allows the router name to be changed. This appears on login and administration screens.
; ''Hostname'':  Use if your ISP or connection requires it.
; ''Domain Name'':  Use if your ISP or connection requires it.

=== Time ===

; ''Router Time'':  Displays current router time.
; ''Time Zone'':   Tell the router which time zone you are in so it can adjust to local time.  If you set this to ''Custom'', you can enter a string that allows you to customize a time zone.
:*''Auto Daylight Saving Time'':  If checked, the router will compensate for Daylight Saving Time.  If not, it will always use Standard Time.
; ''Auto Update Time'':  How often the router connects to a [[w:Network Time Protocol|Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) server to update its internal clock. If the router time is not updated automatically, make sure you have a working DNS in Basic:Network, otherwise the router will not be able to resolve the NTP address.
:*''Trigger Connect On Demand'':  If checked, the router will force a connection as needed to update time.  If not checked, the router will only check time if a connection to the Internet is already established.
:*''NTP Time Servers'':  List of [http://www.pool.ntp.org/ NTP servers] to use to update the time.
NTP Time Servers may request that Tomato block them from being used in the future. If this happens, Tomato will display the following message: &quot;The following NTP servers have been automatically blocked by request from the server: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.&quot;

=== DDNS ===

[[w:Dynamic DNS|Dynamic DNS]], a special DNS registry/server that can be updated on frequent IP address shuffles.  Instead of having to know your IP address each time it changes, a computer on your network can run a special network program that submits your updated IP address, which you can then refer to via a standard URL issued by your DDNS provider.  Most DDNS providers offer a free personal account for you to use.

As an alternative to running an application on one of your PCs, Tomato provides a built-in DDNS  client right in the firmware that supports a number of DDNS providers.  From the main menu, select &quot;Basic&quot; then &quot;DDNS&quot;.

For most DDNS providers, you simply select the provider from the pull-down list, and enter your username, password, and hostname.  Detailed instructions on operating each DDNS provider's account can be found at their web site.

DDNS can be used to permit web access to the router for system administration purposes.

; Auto Refresh Every (number) Days (0 = disable) : Sends a WAN IP Update report by default every chosen number of days.  In the event that your WAN IP address is infrequently changed, this acts as a &quot;keep alive&quot; for some Dynamic DNS services, to avoid suspension of service due to disuse. A value of 0 disables Auto Refresh.
==== Dynamic DNS 1 ====

; Password : your password for the selected DDNS provider.
; Force next update [ ] : checkbox to force the next WAN IP update to the selected DDNS provider. Too-frequent forced updates may result in suspension of service.
; Last IP Address : most recent IP address uploaded to the DDNS provider.
; Last result : status of last DDNS update.
==== Dynamic DNS 2 ====
See above.

'''''Note:''''' for each Dynamic DNS provider, refresh or touch the IP Address selection to fill out the form.

=== Static DHCP ===

This is a simple way to ensure that each of the client hardware devices that connects to your Tomato router gets the same IP address and hostname each time.  Simply enter the MAC address for your device (which you can find on the &quot;Device List&quot;), and enter your preferred IP address.

Generally, it's best to use an IP address that is within the subnet range for your Tomato router, but outside the normal DHCP assignment range.  In other words, use an address that starts with the same three numbers (default 192.168.1.''x'') as your router, but has a fourth number that is not likely to be assigned to any clients by the normal DHCP settings.

For multiple hostnames for the same IP address (e.g., the server 192.168.1.12 should be known as both &quot;galaxy&quot; and &quot;mail&quot;), separate them in the hostname field with a space. Use a hyphen for a single, multi-word hostname like &quot;My-PC&quot;.

If a computer has multiple network devices (wired vs Wi-Fi, for instance) with different MAC addresses, there is no way to assign the same hostname to both devices, as would be the case if Tomato respected the computer's own hostname.  You will get a &quot;Duplicate name&quot; error.

If you have the DHCP server set to assign IP addresses in the range of 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.150, for example, good choices for Static DHCP assignments would be either in the 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.99 range, or 192.168.1.151 - 192.168.1.254.

An easy way to add an IP address to the Static DHCP list, is to go to the &quot;Device List&quot; and click on the IP address of the device you want to make Static.  This will take you to the Static DHCP function and all you need to do is edit the device name (optional) and click &quot;Add&quot;. (don't forget to click &quot;Save&quot; to commit). 

Tomato originally supported 50 entries, this has been increased to 100.

=== Wireless Filter ===

The Wireless Filter allows you to configure which wireless equipped computers may or may not communicate with the router depending on their MAC addresses. If it is set up as an AP, bear in mind that all AP's need the same setup. This may be inconvenient. You may want to use &quot;Access restriction&quot; on the main router which will apply to all users on all AP's.

100 rules are presently supported.

While a decent basic security measure, understand that all MAC addresses are transmitted in cleartext, and may be intercepted.  This should not be used as a primary means of security.

==== Usage notes ====
This is mostly relevant for people who use P2P or other connection-intensive applications on their Internet connections.  The connection table has a finite number of entries, and if the entries are all used up, the router cannot make new connections.  The only way to free up an entry is to gracefully terminate a connection (normal), or to have one time out.  Since P2P applications rarely drop connections gracefully, they need to depend on the router to time out their connections for them.

The most important settings are:
* '''Maximum Connections'''
** Increasing this may slow down the router slightly.  4,096 is probably a good maximum value.
** Keeping this too low may eventually result in running out of entries.  The default of 2,048 is probably a good minimum value.
** Clicking on ''count current'' next to the input field will tell you how many entries you are currently using.
** Before increasing this field, consider using the TCP Timeout (below) to recycle existing connections faster, rather than increasing the number of connections.

* '''TCP Timeout:  Established'''
** This is the amount of time that an established connection will be maintained after its last activity.
** Setting this too low will cause active TELNET / FTP connections to be dropped unless you have a keepalive to keep data flowing over the connection.
** Setting this too high will cause old connections to be retained, wasting entries in the NAT table.
** Four Hours (14,400 seconds) is a decent compromise, but you have to choose a value that balances retaining valid connections versus killing old ones.  In a non-P2P environment, you can set this to several days without any problems (the Linksys default for this is FIVE DAYS, which is why many Linksys routers don't do well for P2P).

Most of the remaining settings would generally be used pretty rarely, and are probably present for adjustment by advanced users who might need to tweak their network settings.

Many sites recommend adjusting these values using a script such as this one:

&lt;code&gt;
echo 4096 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/'''ip_conntrack_max'''&lt;br&gt;
echo 2048 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_thresh2&lt;br&gt;
echo 4096 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_thresh3&lt;br&gt;
echo &quot;600 '''1800''' 120 60 120 120 10 60 30 120&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_tcp_timeouts&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

However, the two settings in the GUI listed above will accomplish everything the oft-published scripts claim to do, with less effort.  Specifically, the ''Established TCP Timeout'' setting replaces the &quot;1800&quot; in the last line of the script, and the ip_conntrack_max number is controlled by the ''Maximum Connections'' setting.  The gc_thresh settings are not really useful, it's better to let Tomato use its defaults for thresholds.

=== DHCP / DNS ===

&quot;Use Internal Caching DNS Forwarder&quot; will allow dnsmasq to be your DNS server at the Router IP Address (typically 192.168.1.1).  DHCP clients will receive the router IP address as the DNS server.

If you have static DNS entries, &quot;Use Received DNS With Static DNS&quot; will add any name servers received from your service provider. You can view these changes in the resolve file at &quot;/etc/resolv.dnsmasq&quot;.

You may also consider adding &quot;strict-order&quot; (without quotes) in the &quot;Dnsmasq Custom Configuration&quot; box.  This forces Dnsmasq to send DNS queries to servers strictly in the order that they appear in the resolve file.  This is useful if you are using services such as OpenDNS but still want to use your ISP's server(s) as a backup.  Without this setting your ISP's DNS server(s) will tend to be favored.

The &quot;Intercept DNS Port&quot; option may be helpful when used with OpenDNS for parental control. When enabled, anything going out to UDP port 53 is redirected to Dnsmasq. This prevents bypassing parental controls.  Another use of this intercept is with VPN client software in combination with the 'use internal caching DNS forwarder'.  Typically, VPN client software will 'tunnel' non-routable IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 which will bypass the router and cause DNS failure.  Instead, you can change the client's DNS address to any bogus routable IP address to prevent the VPN client from tunneling DNS requests and let the router intercept them.  This works whether or not the VPN client software is active.

Adding &quot;stop-dns-rebind&quot; (without quotes) into the &quot;Dnsmasq Custom Configuration&quot; box will prevent DNS Rebinding attacks. This does not negate the need for a strong password however. 

&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;

=== Firewall ===
Settings to configure some basic aspects of the router's firewall.

*'''Respond To Inbound Ping''': If checked the router will respond to ping requests from on the WAN interface. If unchecked, the router will not respond to pings from the WAN. Default value is ''unchecked''.
*'''Allow Multicast''': If checked, the router will allow multicast packets to reach the LAN. Otherwise it will block multicast packets from reaching the LAN. Default value is ''unchecked''.
*'''Enable NAT Loopback''': If checked, the router allows LAN devices to reach other LAN devices via the router's WAN IP address and a properly configured port forward. If unchecked, LAN devices can only contact other LAN devices via their local IP addresses. Default value is '''Forwarded only'''. Edit: Tomato Firmware v1.21.1515 - There is no option to check to enable NAT loopback. You may only choose between 'all, 'forward only' and 'disable', 
*'''SYN Cookies''': Activates SYN cookies. Default value is ''unchecked''.

=== MAC Address ===
This sets the hardware address that is seen from the ISP. Some ISPs are set up to only accept the original network card you had when you first started service. Others simply have the modem set to only allow one HW address per boot, so try resetting your modem after changing this. For some cable internet service providers, changing the MAC address seen by the cable modem is a good way to request a new IP address if required.

=== Miscellaneous ===
*'''Boot wait time''' specifies the length of time the router will pause during startup, before attempting to load the firmware. This pause represents a period where a new firmware can be flashed to the router via TFTP, if the firmware on the flash chip has been corrupted. Default value is '''5 seconds'''.
*'''WAN Port Speed''' specifies the speed and duplex setting for the WAN interface port. Default value is '''Auto'''.

=== Routing ===
* '''Current Routing Table''': Shows your current routing table.
* '''Static Routing Table''': Allows you to add static routing entries if you have more than 1 router on your network. 
* '''Miscellaneous'''
** '''Mode''': Options available are '''Gateway''' and '''Router'''.  
**: '''Gateway'''  = Don't let WAN traffic access the LAN, except through port forwarding or DMZ. (Required mode for PPPoE connections connected through WAN port to a bridged ADSL modem.) 
**: '''Router''' (Default) = Turn off these features and NAT. (May be incorrect on details, but this is the idea)
** '''RIP v1 &amp; v2''': See [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1058.html RIP v1] and [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2453.html RIP v2] (It's not clear if this is for sending or receiving or both). Default value is ''disabled''.
** '''Efficient Multicast Forwarding''': Default is unchecked.
** '''DHCP Routes''': Default is checked.
** '''Spanning-Tree Protocol''': If checked, enables the IEEE 802.1d spanning tree protocol for detecting and resolving loops in your internal network.  (Switch A plugged into Switch B plugged into Switch C plugged into Switch A.). Default value is ''unchecked''.

=== Wireless ===
Controls advanced settings for the connection over the Wireless Local Area Network.

*'''Afterburner''': Broadcom Afterburner is a 802.11g Standards Enhancement to provide additional speed for home wireless networks while remaining compatible with all Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™ 802.11b/g Products. When enabled, it allows 125 Mbps mode.
*'''AP Isolation''': A prime example would be like in a hotspot (e.g. coffeeshop like Starbucks, hotels) wherein a lot of computers connect randomly to the network. Since all computers are connected to 1 single network there is a possibility that they could access each other which may result in unwanted hacking. AP isolation will help prevent this by making each and every single computer a separate entity on their own. When enabled, the router prevents wireless devices from communicating with each other. If disabled, the unit will switch traffic from one wireless client to another.
*'''Authentication Type''': Controls whether clients must use shared keys to authenticate. This setting is disabled (i.e. forced) in some security modes.
*'''Basic Rate''': Sets mandatory rate list transmitted by the AP which must be supported in order to connect. Some old 802.11b clients can only connect if this is set to 1-2Mbps.
*'''Beacon Interval''': Sets the amount of time between beacon transmissions in milliseconds. A longer interval can save power on sleeping clients.
*'''CTS Protection Mode''': When set to Auto, enables a mode which ensures 802.11b devices can connect when many 802.11g devices are present.
*'''Regulatory Mode''': ???
*'''Country / Region''': Select the current country where the access point is in. This ensures that local regulation regarding channel usage and maximum output power are observed.
*'''Bluetooth Coexistence''': Router will attempt to share airtime with Bluetooth devices to improve performance of both classes. May have no effect if Bluetooth devices are older and do not &quot;cooperate.&quot;
*'''Distance / ACK Timing''': Sets the approximate maximum distance in meters from which clients can connect. May be useful in preventing distant &quot;[[Wifi/Cantenna|cantenna]] leeches&quot; from connecting. It will not prevent snooping, however. Setting to 0 disables this function.
*'''DTIM Interval''': Sets the amount of time in milliseconds between Delivery Traffic Indication Messages, which tells a client in power-saving mode when to expect the next broadcast message.
*'''Fragmentation Threshold''':  Sets the maximum packet size in bytes before fragmenting it.
*'''Frame Burst''': Enables frame burst mode which increases throughput but does not work well with more than about three clients.
*'''Maximum Clients''': Sets the maximum number of wireless clients that can connect at once.
*'''Multicast Rate''': Sets the signalling rate used for multicasting.
*'''Preamble''': Selects long or short preamble for 802.11b. Short will increase throughput, but some older 802.11b devices require the long preamble.
*'''RTS Threshold''': Sets the minimum packet size in bytes which triggers Request to Send/Clear to Send signalling. A number higher than the Fragmentation Threshold serves to disable the function. It is normally not needed but may be useful in adverse conditions.
*'''Receive Antenna''': Selects which antenna is used for receiving. These settings are primarily useful for external antennas. Single antenna units should be set to Auto.
*'''Transmit Antenna''': Selects which antenna is used for transmitting.
*'''Transmit Power''':  Sets the transmit power in milliwatts. 
** Tomato default is 42mW.
** High settings may cause non-linearity in the transmitter causing loss of data, interference to other users and channels, and a high &quot;noise floor&quot;.  
** High setting may overheat and shorten the life of the transmitter. 
** Based on the results of testing reported on the dd-wrt.com forum[http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=120828], the maximum actual broadcast power is achieved with a setting around 64 mW in Tomato (or [[DD-WRT]]).
** Settings as high as 84 mW have reportedly been used without harm to the hardware.
*'''WMM''': Enables Wireless Multimedia extensions which provide automatic QoS and power saving. Primarily intended for wi-fi phones and the like.
*'''No ACK''': Controls whether WMM packets require acknowledgment. Enabled sets No Acknowledgment which allows higher throughput and lower latency when some packet loss is acceptable (i.e. for VoIP).

== Port Forwarding ==

Once you have set up your router you will have your own Local Area Network (LAN) managed by the router. You inevitably will have many devices connected to your LAN all using the same internet connection.  This causes a problem because different devices on your LAN will need specific data that is coming in from (or going out to) the internet.

Port Forwarding allows your router to control the flow of data to and from the internet, and make sure the router knows which device (ie computer, webcam, VoIP telephone etc) connected to your LAN sent/requested/needs each packet of data.  Usually packets coming in from the Internet will be in response to some request that one of your devices connected to your LAN has made (ie a VoIP phone making a request to connect a telephone call) .  In these cases, the router keeps track of which device made the request, and forwards the response back to that same device.

Sometimes however, as in the case of &quot;Server&quot; applications (such as you hosting your own website on a PC within your LAN) requests come in from random locations on the Internet, and you need to tell the router which computer is running the “server” so that these random requests can be routed to the correct computer.  This is generally done by telling the router that any &quot;unsolicited packets&quot; (packets that are not a response to a request from a local computer) on a specific port or list of ports should be forwarded to a specific computer on the network.

Finally, there are also &quot;thief jiggling the handle&quot; connections from random corners of the internet. Locking those out is another job of the router.

There are a few ways to set this up.

=== Basic ===

Allows you to specify simple port forwarding where all packets received on the specified ''External Ports'' will be routed to the specified ''Internal Address''.  e.g.,  you can forward all incoming data on ports 5060 and 5061 (used for SIP protocol to initiate a VoIP telephone call) to your VoIP telephone.

Optionally, you can change the local port by specifying ''Int Port''.  This is also known as ''Port Redirection''. This technique is handy, for example, if you have two web servers.  Both could be listening on the default port (80), but the router could be set to forward received packets on Internet Port 80 to Port 80 on the first web server, and packets on Internet Port 81 to Port 80 on the second web server.

The &quot;External Ports&quot; box can contain a single port (ie 8080) or a range of ports (5060:5061).
The &quot;Int Port&quot; can be left blank.
The &quot;Internal Address&quot; is the IP address of the device on your LAN (ie 192.168.1.2)

The Tomato Firmware GUI can take up to 50 entries for basic port forwarding.

=== DMZ ===

[[w:Demilitarized zone (computing)|DMZ]], or Demilitarized Zone, allows you to specify one device on your network that will receive all unsolicited packets from the Internet.  This can be handy for devices that need largely unrestricted access to the Internet, or for a Web/email server.  However, this bypasses all firewall functions of the router for this device, so be sure the device is very well secured.
The current firmware version implements source restrictions based on IP-addresses.

If you want to transparently access the DMZ computer from your internal network, then you will need to check ''Enable NAT Loopback'' and set it to to ''All'' in &quot;[[#Firewall|Firewall]]&quot; page under &quot;Advanced&quot;.  If this is not set, then you will not be able to reach the DMZ computer using the external IP address when using the internal network.  In this case, only the DMZ computer will only be reachable on its internal IP address from the internal network, meaning that the external IP address will point to the router on the internal network.

=== Triggered ===

Port Triggering is an on-demand port forward.  The router will look for an outbound connection on a specified port, and will forward all of the requested ports to whatever computer initiated the outbound connection.

Under the ''Trigger Ports'', you would enter a list of the ports that your computer will use to initiate the forwarding.  Then you specify the ports you want to forward to that computer under ''Forwarded Ports''.  Any computer that sends outbound packets on any of the ports listed in ''Trigger Ports'' will then have all unsolicited packets received from the Internet on the ''Forwarded Ports'' sent to it.

=== UPnP / NAT-PMP ===

[[w:Universal Plug and Play|Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) allows devices on your network to set their own port forwards.  A computer running a web server, for example, can tell the router to forward all communications on port 80 and/or 443 to it.  UPnP allows your local devices to add, delete, and update port forwards at will. Often this is the only way for applications on a client machine to obtain a connection to the remote server.

Only 25 UPnP connections are presently supported.

There are some security disadvantages to UPnP, such as a trojan horse or other &quot;bad&quot; software package being able to forward ports to a given machine so the malware can use your computer as an Internet server.  However, there are also security advantages to UPnP, since any well-behaved UPnP application will request cancellation of its forwarded ports when it shuts down or no longer needs them.  This reduces the number of unneeded forwarded ports. Currently, forwarded ports which have not been terminated by an application after it has closed are not automatically closed by Tomato.

== QoS — Quality of Service ==

QoS, or Quality of Service, allows you to prioritize data, slowing down less important data to allow more important data to get through first.

This is primarily useful for outbound data (data going from your computers to the Internet).  Inbound data cannot be prioritized effectively because it has already passed through the bottleneck (your Internet connection) by the time the router has a chance to evaluate it.

QoS in Tomato has ten levels of priority.  HIGHEST will always get the very highest priority (use sparingly) and CLASS-E (labeled as E) is the lowest-priority class.  If the upstream bandwidth becomes over-saturated (more packets want to go out than the connection can send), lower-priority packets will be delayed (and possibly eventually discarded) to make room for higher-priority packets.

If you like to go more into details of traffic shaping try the [http://www.hyperwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2002 WRT54 Script Generator] as an extension to the current QoS implementation (see [[../Installation_and_Configuration#Tools|Tools]] for details).

Note: QoS works by having fixed maximum inbound and outbound bandwidths, and then allocating that bandwidth based on packet priorities. This means that the firmware will NEVER allow more than the configured bandwidths. Even if your service provider allows more (either temporarily as a &quot;speed boost&quot; feature, or permanently as a service upgrade) you will still be restricted to the configured bandwidth. If you need the highest possible bandwidth at all times you may wish to leave QoS disabled.

=== Basic Settings ===

; ''Enable QoS'':  If checked, QoS will be enabled.  If not checked, QoS will be disabled.

; ''Prioritize ACK'':  Prioritizes the sending of ACK (Acknowledgment) packets.  Recommended:  Checked (on).

; ''Prioritize ICMP'':  Prioritizes Internet Control Message Protocol packets (PING replies, etc).

; ''Reset Classification when making changes'':  If checked, all connections will be reevaluated when a change is made to the QoS rules.  If not checked, you may need to restart each application on your PC to re-establish each connection before the rule is applied to that connection.

; ''Default Class'':  This is simply the &quot;catch-all&quot; classification when no rules are found for a connection.

:If a connection does not meet any of the QoS criteria, it will default to the specified class.  If you have a high-priority service (such as VoIP) and a low-priority one (such as P2P), your best bet is to set this to MEDIUM or LOW, then try to classify all of your high priority stuff above this classification, and your low priority stuff below it.  

:QOS is not easy to apply with P2P as even L7 filters do not work particularly well. An approach which generally works well with P2P is to set your default class to &quot;lowest&quot; and then address all other desired rules in classes above this. P2P will &quot;fall&quot; though all of the filters and end up in the default &quot;lowest&quot; class. This way, you don't have to use several different filters in an attempt to capture all of the possible P2P traffic.

; ''Max Bandwidth'':  One of the major limitations of QoS in most Linksys routers is their inability to determine the upstream speed of the Internet connection.  This is true of many router models.  The most effective way to tune QoS is to do an Internet speed test with QoS turned off. Then enter about 90% of the tested upstream (upload) bandwidth into the ''Max Bandwidth'' field. This will allow the router to properly determine how much bandwidth is available and prioritize packets accordingly.  A more detailed explanation of this (targeted for Vonage VoIP users) may be found at http://vonage.nmhoy.net/qos.html  {{dubious}}
; ''Highest'' - ''Class E'' (the percentages under Outbound Rate/Limit):  This specifies the minimum and maximum percentages of the connection each classification is allowed to consume.  This is allocating, rather than prioritizing, and is useful for cases where you want to specify that certain classes of connection should never receive more than a given percentage of your upload bandwidth.  Set each class to 1%-100% to allow each class unlimited access to the bandwidth (with higher priority classes receiving only higher priority, and not &quot;reserved&quot; amounts).

; ''Inbound Limit'':  This allows you to limit the overall amount of data coming in to your router, and allocate maximum percentages of that bandwidth for each QoS service.  Note that packets that exceed your limit are simply thrown away, not delayed as in the case of Upload/Outbound QoS.  Under certain circumstances, this setting is useful, but is a very inefficient way to control inbound data. Inbound traffic cannot be directly controlled with QOS as all rules operate on outbound traffic only.

; ''TCP Vegas'':  A congestion avoidance algorithm built into the Linux kernel, introduced in Tomato 1.23. 

:This may produce better results than QoS for some users. For example, users with connection speeds which vary considerably (cable users with &quot;speed boost,&quot; or speed slows in the evening when everyone in the neighborhood goes online) are required to set QoS &quot;Max Bandwidth&quot; conservatively, to the '''lowest''' max speed encountered. They would never take advantage of higher speeds when available. In this case, TCP Vegas may be effective at dynamically adjusting speed while avoiding dropped packets which would occur if QoS &quot;Max Bandwidth&quot; were set aggressively (to the '''highest''' max speed encountered during day-to-day use.).

:Some users have reported that a combination of TCP Vegas and QoS (with an aggressive &quot;Max Bandwidth&quot;) works well. (This section requires additional feedback.).

:TCP Vegas operates only on outbound traffic. However, some users have reported that changing its parameters affected inbound traffic. (This section requires expansion.).

:For more information about TCP Vegas, see:
:* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Vegas Wikipedia entry]
:* [http://www.cs.arizona.edu/projects/protocols/ TCP Vegas homepage]
:* [http://neal.nu/uw/linux-vegas/ History, and information on tuning parameters]

=== Classification ===

Allows you to specify which connections will get what levels of priority.  This will override the default priority set in the ''Basic Settings'' page.  Classification may be done by MAC address, TCP/IP port, or using more advanced filters like IPP2P or Layer 7 (L7) filtering.

All QoS rules are &quot;as seen by your LAN&quot;, so SOURCE always means your computer, and DESTINATION always means the Internet.

QoS can be classified in a number of ways:

* Address (first row in &quot;Match Rule&quot; Column):  Identify the packet based on the IP or MAC address that is making the request, or the IP address that is being contacted.  ''Example:  If you have a VoIP device on your network that needs very high priority, you would set &quot;Address&quot; to &quot;Src MAC&quot; (source MAC address) and key the MAC address of the device, then set the priority to HIGH or HIGHEST.''
* Protocol/Port (second row):  Identifies the packet based on the Protocol (TCP, UDP, etc) and/or Port Number (or list of numbers) that the connection is being made on.
* IPP2P (third row):  An attempt to identify P2P applications.  Easily fooled by P2P Encryption, this is still useful for identifying some P2P applications.
* L7 (Layer 7, third row):  A sophisticated filter that can classify a number of applications.  Again, for P2P, easily fooled by Encryption, but still useful.

: &lt;u&gt;Errata: Specific to version 1.23&lt;/u&gt;: The L7 filter &quot;rtp-2&quot; was added to Tomato 1.23 as a temporary solution. The official &quot;rtp&quot; filter does not catch some VOIP traffic. This new filter appears to work better. If the &quot;rtp&quot; filter doesn't work for you, try &quot;rtp-2.&quot;  Eventually &quot;rtp2&quot; may replace the &quot;rtp,&quot; or be renamed by the [http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/ L7 project] who graciously provided it. 

NOTE:  Address and Protocol/Port are the fastest and most efficient ways to match.  IPP2P is slow, and L7 is even slower.  If at all possible, use Address and Protocol/Port before resorting to IPP2P or L7. Too many L7 or IPP2P rules can cause your router to crash or restart. If you are experiencing frequent crashes and restarts under heavy load, these may be the cause.

: To improve IPP2P and L7 performance, provide additional qualifications when possible. For example, if you know the traffic is UDP, or a port range is involved, then specify this in the rule. These qualifications will be checked first, preventing unnecessary packet inspection of all packets. 

: Similarly, the order of rules can affect performance. For example, if an L7 rule is qualified as UDP this will help performance. But, if it is moved below the DNS rule (with a classification of &quot;Highest&quot;), it will prevent packet inspection of all DNS connections which are also UDP.


==== QoS Rule Example:  Setting Web Browsing to HIGH ====

Under ''Match Rule'' Column:
* First row = &quot;Any Address&quot;, field to its right is blank  ''Meaning this rule applies to any connection to the Internet on any server''
* Second row = &quot;TCP&quot;, &quot;Dst Port&quot;, &quot;80,443&quot;  ''Meaning that this rule applies to all TCP connections that are trying to connect to port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) on an Internet server''
* Third row = &quot;IPP2P (Disabled)&quot;, &quot;Layer7 (Disabled)&quot;  ''Meaning that we do not want to apply any IPP2P or L7 rules''
* Fourth row = &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; (kb transferred)  ''Meaning we do not want to match by amount transferred''

Under ''Class'' Column:
* &quot;High&quot; ''Meaning anything matching this rule will be assigned a HIGH priority in upstream''

Under ''Description'' Column:
* Assign any reasonable description.  &quot;WWW&quot; or &quot;Web Browsing&quot; would be good here.  ''This is not used except on this screen, to identify the connection for your future reference.

=== View Graphs ===

One of the most powerful features of Tomato, this allows you to view (in near-real-time) the current outbound connections and how the QoS engine is classifying them.  This allows you to view how effective your QoS settings are, and whether they are capturing the connections you want them to.  Simply click on any of the classes to view the list of specific connections for that class.

=== View Details ===

Lists each connection that has recently been made through the router, and what QoS class was assigned to that connection.  Clicking any entry will attempt to do a reverse lookup on the destination TCP/IP address, or you can click on the &quot;automatically resolve addresses&quot; checkbox at the bottom of the list to resolve all addresses in the list (this can take a while).

== Access Restriction ==
Set time, computer, site, and protocol based bans on Internet access.

This function works on all connections to the router and so can be used to control access to all users of a network.

Currently supports 50 entries.

Each entry supports 2048 characters for the entire entry, the practical limit is around 1900 characters.

== USB and NAS ==

== Administration ==

=== Admin Access ===

Controls the various means that can be used to access the router for administrative purposes.

All services use the same password, which is changed at the bottom of this page.

==== Web Admin ====

Controls access to the router via a web browser.  The web username may be &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;root&quot;.

*''Local Access'':  Determines whether and how the router may be accessed from a web browser on a local computer (a computer attached to the router, or attached to a switch or hub attached to the router).  Access can be via HTTP (regular web), HTTPS (SSL-encrypted web), both, or disabled.

*''HTTP Port'': default 80

*''Remote Access'':  Determines whether and how the router may be accessed from a web browser from the WAN (Internet) side of the router.  It is not recommended that this be enabled, and if it must be enabled, consider using the HTTPS method, which at least encrypts your session data.

*''Allow Wireless Access'':  If checked, wireless clients on your local network can access your router's administration screens using the same method as wired clients.  This has no effect on Remote Access.

*''Color Scheme'': choose color scheme skin

*''Show Browser Icon'': shows tomato icon on address bar

==== SSH Daemon ====

Controls the Secure SHell (SSH) server that is installed on the router, which allows secure (encrypted) command-line access to the router.  The SSH username is always &quot;root&quot;.

*''Enable at Startup'':  Specifies whether the SSH Daemon is started when the router starts up.

*''Remote Access'':  If checked, you will be able to access the router via SSH from the Internet and the Local Network.  If unchecked, only clients on the Local Network will have access.

*''Remote Forwarding'': If checked, the SSH server will be listening for new connections to be tunneled. A tunnel initiated on the server side will then go back through the client machine. [http://blog.dreamdevil.com/index.php/2008/09/06/remote-desktop-through-ssh-with-putty-and-tomato-firmware/ Example of usage].

*''Port'':  Specifies the TCP port used by the SSH daemon (default = Port 22). It is recommended to change the port to non-default because port 22 is being constantly scanned by the hackers on the Internet.

*''Allow Password Login'':  If checked, you can use the router username and password to enable a connection to the command line.  If not checked, key authentication will be required.

*''Authorized Keys'':  Enter authorized keys for key authentication (a more secure alternative to password-based logins). Each key must start on a new line. Dropbear SSH daemon supports a subset of ''authorized_keys'' options, as described in '''sshd(8)''': ''command, no-agent-forwarding, no-pty, no-port-forwarding''. It is not possible to limit the source address of connection or the port numbers and destinations of forwarded ports at this time. Use something like ''command=&quot;cat /dev/null&quot;'' to prevent command execution.

*''[Start Now] / [Stop Now]''  Starts or stops the SSH Daemon.

==== Telnet Daemon ====
Controls the Telnet command-line server built into the router.  Telnet access is only allowed on the Local Network.  The Telnet username is always &quot;root&quot;.

*''Enable at Startup'':  Specifies whether the Telnet daemon is enabled when the router starts up.

*''Port'':  Specifies the Ethernet port used by Telnet (default = Port 23). 

*''[Start Now] / [Stop Now]''  Starts or stops the Telnet Daemon.

==== Admin Restriction (for Remote Web/SSH) ====

*''Allowed IP Address'':  If you want to restrict access from the WAN to Remote Configuration of your router by IP address, enter the appropriate IP address string.

==== Password ====

Allows you to specify your password.  '''It is highly recommended you change this immediately after the installation.'''  Enter the same password into both fields, and click &quot;Save&quot;.  After changing your password, you will need to re-authenticate your session (you may need to shut down and restart your browser to clear the current authentication).

=== Bandwidth Monitoring ===

The bandwidth monitor history is just bandwidth data that can be viewed at the [[#Bandwidth|Bandwidth]] page of the Tomato UI, namely WAN port monthly history, WAN port daily history for the current month and intraday history (for vlan1, eth1, br0, eth0 &amp; vlan0) captured over the last 24 hours. For this reason the backup file does not grow in size once it has reached about 133 Bytes.

* '''Enable''': check to enable / uncheck to disable

* '''Save History Location''': Saving to RAM is not permanent. Saving to '''NVRAM''' or '''JFFS2''' is permanent but will cause the internal flash (rewritable) memory to be flashed more frequently than the router design intended. This may lead to a shortened useful lifetime for your router. Better permanent storage alternatives are '''CIFS1''' and '''CIFS2'''. Keep in mind that if the share that your '''CIFS1''' or '''CIFS2''' points to is offline, then it will save the Bandwidth History the next time the share is online. Refer to the [[#CIFS_Client|CIFS Client]] section for further detail.
** If you use '''CIFS''', you will have to wait until the first set of data is saved to see the 24 hour, weekly and monthly stats. You might see a message about 'rstat' not responding. A solution for this is to check &quot;Create new file&quot; if you do not want to wait the time until the first data is saved (from one hour, to days).

* '''Save Frequency''': Select an interval for periodic saving of bandwidth usage history. Useful if your router experiences power outages from time to time. The exact time that the save interval happens at is based on what time you save your settings. So if you set it to &quot;Every 2 Days&quot; at 10:35AM, it will save 48 hours from then, and every 48 hours thereafter.

* '''Save On Shutdown''': Cause a save before any reboot or shutdown event but obviously not before a power outage!

* '''Create New File / Reset Data''': Check this when setting up a new Save History Location. When checked a new file is created in the save location. '''If the file already exists in the save location all current data will be overwritten!'''

* '''First Day Of The Month''': Used to align the monthly data to the same accounting cycle that your ISP uses.

* '''Excluded Interfaces''': Comma separated list of Interfaces to exclude from the '''24 Hours''' and '''Real Time''' [[#Bandwidth|Bandwidth]] pages of the Tomato UI. ( Example: &lt;tt&gt;vlan0,vlan1,eth0&lt;/tt&gt; will leave focus on the wireless LAN interface.) This has no appreciable effect on ''size'' of the history backup file being saved.

Although the role of the five interfaces is configuration dependent ( ''examples: [http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/WRT54_sw1_internal_architecture.png WRT54G v2] and [http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/i/WRT54_sw2_internal_architecture.png WRT54G v4] acknowledge: '''voidmain''' &amp; [http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces#head-0ee4b2980d61e989dad32ffacc2e2ebff56fb784 WL-500gP] and [http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration#head-b62c144b9886b221e0c4b870edb0dd23a7b6acab Network Configuration] ack. '''OpenWRT''' '') the ''apparent'' convention is:&lt;/br&gt;
*'''vlan1''': wired WAN port&lt;/br&gt;
*'''vlan0''': wired LAN ports&lt;/br&gt;
*'''eth1''': Wireless LAN&lt;/br&gt;
*'''br0''': internal LAN bridge (configurable) for wired LAN and Wireless LAN&lt;/br&gt;
*'''eth0''': internal interface between CPU and the 6-port switch&lt;/br&gt;

Saved history may be viewed using the UI tools:
*http: //192.168.1.1/bwm-'''24'''.asp&lt;/br&gt;
*http: //192.168.1.1/bwm-'''daily'''.asp&lt;/br&gt;
*http: //192.168.1.1/bwm-'''weekly'''.asp&lt;/br&gt;
*http: //192.168.1.1/bwm-'''monthly'''.asp

==== Backup ====
Permits saving the entire contents of the current bandwidth history to a GZIP-compressed file on the client computer.  Useful for archiving evidence of bandwidth issues, for easy display later.

==== Restore ====
Permits restoring a previously saved bandwidth history file (GZIPped) from the client computer.  Useful for displaying the contents of a previously saved history file.

=== Buttons / LED ===

Change the action performed by the button. Different actions can be set for different lengths of time the button is held down (Count the DMZ blinks). The default actions are (1) tap to toggle wireless and (2) hold 20 seconds to start telnet on port 233.

The LED lights have some minor checkbox settings. For better effect, you can use the &quot;led&quot; command inside scripts elsewhere.
&lt;!-- comment moved to Talk ''I did not see light settings on the UI on Tomato/TeddyBear build 1.25 — [[User:Wrlee|Wrlee]] ([[User talk:Wrlee|talk]]) 08:56, 1 August 2009 (UTC)'' --&gt;

For unsupported router hardware, this text is displayed: ''This feature is not supported on this router.''
==== SES/AOSS Button ====
==== Startup LED ====
Amber SES: ???
White SES: ???

=== CIFS Client ===
The CIFS client in ''Tomato'' allows you to mount a Windows-share or a Samba-share, that you can use as a history location for the bandwidth monitoring.
&lt;br&gt;
In the configuration UNC (''Universal Naming Convention'') points to that share and has to look as follows:

&lt;tt&gt;\\192.168.1.99\share-name&lt;/tt&gt;

where 192.168.1.99 is the IP-address of the computer the share is located on and &quot;share-name&quot; is the shared folder-name.&lt;br&gt;
The rest of the settings (username, password) speak more or less for themselves. 

Give thought to the Shared Permissions for the specified Windows-share. The username/password pair specified here must be for an account that has permission to write to the shared folder, especially if you plan to use this network shared folder to save Bandwidth Monitor history. Also be sure to allow port 445 on any intermediate firewalls between the shared computer and the router.

It is advised to use &quot;security = user&quot; when using Samba, to avoid errors like these:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;smb signing is incompatible with share level security !&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Configuration ===

Allows you to back up all your settings to your PC, restore them, or reset the router to factory defaults.

When changing from one firmware to another, it is important to do a complete factory reset on your router. In Tomato, you go to this screen,  select ''Erase all data in NVRAM (thorough)'', and click ''OK''.  When the router reboots, you will need to rekey all of your configuration settings manually. Instability and unpredictable behavior can occur if you don't erase the NVRAM.

=== Debugging (Miscellaneous) ===
*''Avoid performing an NVRAM commit'': If checked, changes are not committed to NVRAM if possible. This means that changes are temporary, and will not persist beyond the next reboot of the router.
*''Do not erase some intermediate files'':
*''Enable cprintf output to console'':
*''Enable cprintf output to /tmp/cprintf''
*''Count cache memory as free memory'':
*''Avoid displaying LAN to router connections'': If checked, LAN to router connections are not displayed on the QOS pages. If not checked, LAN to router connections are displayed on the QOS pages as &quot;Unclassified&quot; connections.

*''Download CFE'':
*''Download NVRAM Dump'':
*''Download Iptables Dump'':
*''Download Logs'':

*''Console log level'': 
  0 (KERN_EMERG)		system is unusable&lt;/br&gt;
  1 (KERN_ALERT)		action must be taken immediately&lt;/br&gt;
  2 (KERN_CRIT)		critical conditions&lt;/br&gt;
  3 (KERN_ERR)		error conditions&lt;/br&gt;
  4 (KERN_WARNING)	warning conditions&lt;/br&gt;
  5 (KERN_NOTICE)	normal but significant condition&lt;/br&gt;
  6 (KERN_INFO)		informational&lt;/br&gt;
  7 (KERN_DEBUG)		debug-level messages&lt;/br&gt;

*''Clear Cookies'':
*''NVRAM Commit'': Commits all current settings to NVRAM, such that they survive rebooting.

=== JFFS2 ===
In a router with 4MB flash, there's still some space leftover from the firmware. JFFS2 is the compressed, writable filesystem for the extra space,  the /jffs folder gives 700KB after overhead but BEFORE compression. Turn this option on, and script some add-on executable to run from here.

=== Logging ===

Logging may be done internally or externally.  Internal logs save information to the router's local memory.  External logs send the log information to a remote computer.

; '''Log Internally''' : saves the connection logs to the internal memory of the router, where they may be extracted or viewed directly on the &quot;Logs&quot; page under &quot;Status&quot;.  These logs will consume router memory, but may be viewed directly on the router itself.
; '''Log to Remote System''' : sends the logs to a computer on your LAN.  That computer must be running a log capture program, like [http://www.wallwatcher.com/ WallWatcher].  The computer can then show you the connection logs and analyze the data.
:; '''IP Address / Port''' : 
; '''Generate Marker''' : At the specified time interval, a line of text &quot;------MARK-----&quot; is inserted into the log to make it easier to read. Options available: Disabled, Every 30 Minutes, Every 1 hour, Every 2 hours.
; '''Events Logged''': Allow you to specify what types of events you want logged.
:; '''Access Restriction''': 
:; '''Cron''': 
:; '''DHCP Client''': 
:; '''NTP''': 
:; '''PPPoE''': 
:; '''Scheduler''': 
; '''Connection Logging''': Allow you to specify what types of connections you want logged, and place a limit on the number of entries per minute to log. Unless logging externally, Disabled is recommended for both. Unless you need to detect all attempted connections, select to log only Allowed by Firewall. Note that most connections will be outbound, since the connections were initiated by a device inside the LAN. The only incoming connections (which are Allowed by Firewall) are things such as remote admin, FTP, SSH, or forwarded ports. 
:; '''Inbound (Connections)''': 
:; '''Outbound (Connections)''': 
:; '''Limit''': How many messages per minute at maximum can the system log. Enter '0' for unlimited.

=== Scheduler ===
Shows 5 dialogs permitting scheduled actions to be enabled, and their day and time of execution selected. '''Reboot''' performs a router cold start, as if power had been cycled. '''Reconnect''' performs a WAN Release and Renew sequence.  '''Custom 1,2,3''' allow execution of arbitrary commands, within those present in Tomato.  The dialogs differ slightly.
==== Reboot, Reconnect dialogs ====
:* ''' Enable ''' : Allows execution and editing.  Default: disabled. 
:* ''' Time ''': Drop-down menu to select Execution Time(24-hour format) in 15 minute increments, or to '''repeat''' every 1, 12, or 24 hours, or every user-selectable number of minutes.
:* ''' Days ''' : Week days of operation, selected individually. Default: Every Day.

==== Custom 1, Custom 2, Custom 3 dialogs ==== 
:* ''' Enable ''' : Allows execution and editing.  Default: disabled. 
:* ''' Time ''' : Drop-down menu to select Execution Time(24-hour format) in 15 minute increments, or to '''repeat''' every 1, 3, 5, 15, 30 minutes, 1, 12 or 24 hours, or every user-selectable number of minutes.
:* ''' Days ''' : Week days of operation, selected individually. Default: Every Day.
:* ''' Command ''' : Text field for user-defined command.  See BusyBox commands.

* '''Save''' : Save settings.  Must be performed for Enabled items to be scheduled.
* '''Cancel''' : Aborts any editing actions, exits without saving.
Note: During initial editing, the GUI (as of 1.27) prevents enabling Custom dialogs after enabling Reboot or Reconnect.  Enable any desired Custom dialog first before enabling Reboot or Reconnect.

The scheduler is actually the ''crond'' daemon. The scheduler GUI has some limitation, can not generate arbitrary crontabs. You can use ''cru'' command to manipulate crontabs. Remember to add them to init script, crontabs added by ''cru'' command will not survive reboot.

=== Scripts ===

Presents four text-entry tabs '''Init''', '''Shutdown''', '''Firewall''', and '''WAN Up'''.  You can enter commands in these tabs to be run at router ''Init'' (startup), ''Shutdown'', ''Firewall'' startup, or ''WAN Up'' (whenever the Internet connection comes up).

'''Example script 1'''

Access the web interface of the modem connected to the WAN port of the router. In this example, the modem has the IP address 10.0.0.138. Both IP addresses used in the script below begins with 10.0.0. The 1st address can end with anything other than 138 but the second address must end with 0. The IP of a modem must be from a different network than your local LAN.

In ''WAN Up'':
 ip addr add 10.0.0.10/24 dev eth1 brd +
 /usr/sbin/iptables -I POSTROUTING -t nat -o eth1 -d 10.0.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

'''Example Script 2''' 

Establish a limit of 125 TCP connections per user.

In Firewall
 iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --syn -m iprange --src-range 192.168.22.10-192.168.22.250 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 125 -j DROP

Note : 192.168.22.10 - 192.168.22.250 is the LAN address range to be controlled.

'''Example Script 3'''

Opens the SSH server on the WAN side, while giving a better protection against Brute Force password guessing attacks. After 3 connections attempts in under 90 secs, the source address will be locked out for 90 secs. This seems enough to convince the script kiddies to search for a new target. '''Needs v1.21 to work''' (or later), as it now comes with the ipt_recent module built inside.

In ''Init'':
 insmod `find /lib/modules/ -name ipt_recent.o`

In ''Firewall'':
 WANIP=$(nvram get wan_ipaddr)
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $WANIP --dport 22 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1:22
 iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH_LIMIT --rsource
 iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 90 --hitcount 4 --name SSH_LIMIT --rsource -j DROP
 iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

Note : Do not enable Remote SSH via the menu, this script will do it and apply the right rules

==== Upgrade ====

Allows you to load a new firmware image to the router (either a newer version of Tomato or an entirely different firmware).

Note: When changing from any firmware to any other firmware (stock Linksys -&gt; Tomato, for example), it is important to clear the NVRAM and restore the factory default settings.  Instructions on doing that will vary from firmware to firmware, but there is generally a factory reset option (in Tomato, this is located under ''Administration''/''Configuration''/''Restore Default Configuration''

== About ==
This page shows information about:
*Name and the version number of Tomato firmware
*Copyright statement
*A direct http-link to tomato homepage
*The build date of Tomato firmware
*A donation button for the project
*An acknowledgment message to all people

== Reboot... ==

Restarts the router (without erasing any settings).

== Shutdown... ==

Turns the router off (controlled shutdown)

== Logout ==

Logs you out of the firmware (clears your user session).  This will dump you back to the initial login, where you are asked to present your credentials again (which causes occasional confusion, with people reporting that they &quot;need to log in in order to log out&quot;).  Once you see the password prompt, you are logged out.  Just hit cancel and you will end up at the &quot;Unauthorized&quot; page.
This option is not supported on MS Internet Explorer (V7) and and the &quot;logoff&quot; item does not show in the menu. you will need to close the browser completely in order to log out.

'''Messier 54''' (also known as '''M54''' or '''NGC 6715''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1778]] and subsequently included in his catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects.

Previously thought to be at a distance from [[w:Earth]] of about 50,000 [[w:light-year]]s, it was discovered in [[w:1994]] that M54 was most likely not part of the [[w:Milky Way]], but actually part of the [[w:Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]], (''SagDEG''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Siegeletal2007&quot;&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first [[w:Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] globular cluster ever discovered, even if it wasn't recognized as such for nearly two and a quarter centuries.

Modern estimates now place M54 at a distance of some 87,000 light-years, translating into a true radius of 150 light-years across. It is one of the denser of the globulars, being of class ''III'' (I being densest and XII being the least dense). It shines with the [[w:luminosity]] of roughly 850,000 times that of the [[w:Sun]] and has an [[w:absolute magnitude]] of -10.0.

M54 is easily found on the sky, being close to the [[w:star]] [[w:Zeta Sagittarii|ζ Sagittarii]]. It is however, not resolvable into individual stars even with larger amateur [[w:telescope]]s.

In July of 2009, a team of astronomers reported that they had found evidence of an [[w:intermediate-mass black hole]] in the core of M54.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibata2009&quot;&gt;{{citation

The famously named &quot;'''Ring Nebula'''&quot; is located in the northern [[w:constellation]] of [[w:Lyra]], and also catalogued as '''Messier 57''', ''M57'' or ''NGC 6720''. It is one of the most prominent examples of the deep-sky objects called [[w:planetary nebula]]e (singular, ''planetary nebula''), often abbreviated by astronomers as simply ''planetaries'' or ''PN''. 

==Observation==
[[image:Vega in lyra.png|left|thumb|Location of M57 in the constellation Lyra.]]

M57 is located in [[w:Lyra]], south of its brightest star [[w:Vega]]. [[w:Vega]] is the northeastern vertex of the three stars of the [[w:Summer Triangle]]. M57 lies about 40% of the angular distance from [[w:Beta Lyrae|&amp;beta;&amp;nbsp;Lyrae]] to [[w:Gamma Lyrae|&amp;gamma;&amp;nbsp;Lyrae.]]&lt;ref name=crossen&gt;{{cite book

 | year=2004 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3211008519 
 | oclc=52424007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M57 is best seen through at least a 20 cm (8-inch) [[w:telescope]], but even a 7.5 cm (3-inch) telescope will show the ring.&lt;ref name=crossen/&gt; Larger instruments will show a few darker zones on the eastern and western edges of the ring, and some faint nebulosity inside the disk.

This nebula was discovered by [[w:Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix]] in January, 1779, who reported that it was &quot;''...as large as Jupiter and resembles a planet which is fading.''&quot; Later the same month, [[w:Charles Messier]] independently found the same nebula while searching for [[w:comet]]s. It was then entered into his catalogue as the 57th object. Messier and [[w:William Herschel]] also speculated that the nebula was formed by multiple faint stars that were unable to resolve with his telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1800, Count [[w:Friedrich von Hahn]] discovered the faint central star in the heart of the nebula. In 1864, [[w:William Huggins]] examined the spectra of multiple nebulae, discovering that some of these objects, including M57, displayed the spectra of bright [[w:emission line]]s characteristic of fluorescing glowing gases. Huggins concluded that most planetary nebulae were not composed of unresolved stars, as had been previously suspected, but were nebulosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Evolution of planetary nebulae==
Planetary nebulae are formed after medium or low mass stars, such as the Sun, exhaust their hydrogen fuel in the stellar core. At this point the structure of the star changes so it can achieve a new equilibrium condition in which it can continue to burn; the outer layers of the star expand and it becomes a [[w:red giant]]. Further internal temperature instabilities develop from the fusion reactions, causing the outer atmosphere to be expelled by hot superwinds either continuously or in several energetic pulses. This expanding gaseous shell forms the spherical nebula, brightly illuminated by [[w:ultraviolet]] energy from the central star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | first=C. W. H. | last=De Loore | coauthors=Doom, C. | year=1992 | title=Structure and Evolution of Single and Binary Stars | publisher=Springer | isbn=0792317688  | oclc=25711985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
[[image:M57RingNebula.jpg|250px|thumb|The Ring Nebula in infrared.]]

The nebula is located at 0.7 [[w:kiloparsec|kpc]] (2,300 [[w:light-year]]s) from [[w:Earth]]. It has a [[w:Apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] of 8.8v and [[w:photographic magnitude]] of 9.7p. Photographically, over a period of 50 years,&lt;ref name=karttunen/&gt; the rate of nebula expansion is roughly 1&amp;nbsp;[[w:arcsecond]] per [[w:century]], which corresponds from spectroscopic observations to 20–30 km&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). M57 is illuminated by a central [[w:white dwarf]] or planetary nebula nucleus (PNN) of 15.75v [[w:Apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]],&lt;ref name=apj134/&gt; whose mass is approximately 1.2 MΘ (in [[w:solar mass]]es.)

All the interior parts of this nebula have a blue-green tinge that is caused by the doubly-ionized [[w:oxygen]] [[w:emission line]]s at 495.7 and 500.7&amp;nbsp;[[w:nanometer|nm]]. These observed so-called &quot;[[w:forbidden line]]s&quot; occur only in conditions of very low density containing a few atoms per cubic [[w:centimeter]]. In the outer region of the ring, part of the reddish hue is caused by [[w:hydrogen]] emission at 656.3&amp;nbsp;nm, forming part of the [[w:Balmer series]] of lines. Forbidden lines of ionized [[w:nitrogen]] or [N II] contributes to the reddishness at 654.8 and 658.3&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=karttunen&gt;{{cite book 
 | first=Hannu | last=Karttunen | year=2003

===Nebula structure===
M57 is an example of the class of planetary nebulae known as [[w:Bipolar nebula|bipolar]] nebulae, whose thick equatorial rings visibly extend the structure through its main axis of symmetry. It appears to be a [[w:prolate spheroid]] with strong concentrations of material along its [[w:equator]]. From Earth, the symmetrical axis is viewed at about 30°. Overall, the observed nebulosity has been currently estimated to be expanding for approximately 1,610±240&amp;nbsp;years.

Structural studies find this planetary exhibits knots characterized by well developed symmetry. However, these are only silhouettes visible against the background emission of the nebula's equatorial ring. M57 may include internal [[w:N II]] emission lines located at the knots' tips that face the PNN; however, most of these knots are neutral and appear only in extinction lines. Their existence shows they are probably only located closer to the ionization front than those found in the [[w:Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]] planetary [[w:IC 4406]]. Some of the knots do exhibit well-developed tails which are often detectable in optical thickness from the visual spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODelletal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Planetary nebula nucleus (PNN)===
The central PNN was discovered by Hungarian astronomer Jenő Gothard on September 1, 1886 from images taken at his observatory in Herény, near Szombathely (now part of Szombathely).  Within the last two thousand years, the central star of the Ring Nebula has left the [[w:asymptotic giant branch]] after exhausting its supply of [[w:hydrogen]] fuel. Thus it no longer produces its energy through [[w:nuclear fusion]] and, in [[w:stellar evolution|evolutionary]] terms, it is now becomimg a compact [[w:white dwarf]] star. 

The PNN now consists primarily of [[w:carbon]] and [[w:oxygen]] with a thin outer envelope composed of lighter elements. Its mass is about 0.61&amp;ndash;0.62 [[w:solar mass]], with a surface temperature of 125,000±5,000&amp;nbsp;K. Currently it is 200 times more luminous than the [[w:Sun]], but its [[w:apparent magnitude]] is only +15.75.&lt;ref name=apj134&gt;{{cite journal

==Virgo Cluster membership==
M60 is the third-brightest giant elliptical galaxy of the [[w:Virgo cluster of galaxies]], and is the dominant member of a subcluster of four galaxies, which is the closest-known isolated compact group of galaxies.

==Supernovae==
A [[w:supernova]] (''[[w:SN 2004W]]'') was observed in Messier 60.

==Black Hole==
At the center of M60 is a [[w:black hole]] of 4.5 billion solar masses, one of the largest ever found.&lt;ref&gt;http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4168 The Supermassive Black Hole and Dark Matter Halo of NGC 4649 (M60)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messier 62''' (also known as '''M62''' or '''NGC 6266''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ophiuchus]]. It was discovered in [[w:1771]] by [[w:Charles Messier]].

M62 is at a distance of about 22,500 [[w:light-year]]s from [[w:Earth]] and measures some 100 light-years across. 
From studies conducted in the 1970s it is known that M62 contains the high number of 89 [[w:variable star]]s, many of them of the [[w:RR Lyrae]] type. The globular also contains a number of [[w:x-ray]] sources, thought to be close [[w:binary star]] systems, and millisecond [[w:pulsar]]s in binary systems.

The '''Black Eye Galaxy''' (also called '''Sleeping Beauty Galaxy'''; designated '''Messier 64''', '''M64''', or '''NGC 4826''') was discovered by [[w:Edward Pigott]] in March 1779, and independently by [[w:Johann Elert Bode]] in April of the same year, as well as by [[w:Charles Messier]] in 1780.  It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus, giving rise to its nicknames of the &quot;Black Eye&quot; or &quot;Evil Eye&quot; galaxy.  M64 is well known among [[w:amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]]s because of its appearance in small [[w:telescope]]s. It is a [[w:spiral galaxy]] in the [[w:Coma Berenices|Coma Berenices constellation]].

==General information==
At first glance, M64 seems to be a fairly normal spiral galaxy. As in the majority of galaxies, all of the stars in M64 are orbiting in the same direction, clockwise as seen in the Hubble image.

However, recent detailed studies have led to the remarkable discovery that the interstellar gas in the outer regions of M64 rotates in the opposite direction from the gas and stars in the inner regions.  The inner region has a radius of only approximately 3,000 light-years, while the outer section extends another 40,000 light-years.  This pattern is believed to trigger the creation of many new stars around the boundary separating the two regions.

A collision of two galaxies has left a merged star system with an unusual appearance as well as bizarre internal motions. Astronomers believe that the oppositely rotating gas arose when M64 absorbed a satellite galaxy that collided with it, perhaps more than one billion years ago. Active formation of new stars is occurring in the shear region where the oppositely rotating gases collide, are compressed, and contract. 

Particularly noticeable in the image are hot, blue young stars that have just formed, along with pink clouds of glowing hydrogen gas that fluoresce when exposed to [[w:ultraviolet]] light from newly formed stars. It is approximately 17 million light years from earth.

The small galaxy that impinged on its neighbour has now been almost completely destroyed, its stars either merged with the main galaxy or scattered into space, but signs of the collision persist in the backward motion of gas at the outer edge of M64.

'''Messier 65''' (also known as ''NGC 3623'') is an [[w:intermediate spiral galaxy]] about [[w:1 E22 m|22 million]] [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Leo (constellation)|Leo]].  It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1780]].  M65, [[w:Messier 66|M66]], and [[w:NGC 3628]] comprise the famous [[w:Leo Triplet]], a small [[w:group of galaxies]].

==Discovery==
M65 was discovered by Charles Messier and included in his [[w:Messier Objects]] list. However, [[w:William Henry Smyth]] accidentally attributed the discovery to [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in his popular 19th century astronomical work ''A Cycle of Celestial Objects'' (stating &quot;They [M65 and M66] were pointed out by Méchain to Messier in 1780&quot;). This error was in turn picked up by [[w:Kenneth Glyn Jones]] in ''[[w:Messier's Nebulae and Star Clusters]]''. This has since ramified into a number of other books by a variety of authors.

==Star Formation==
The galaxy is low in dust and gas, and there is little star formation in it, although there has been some relatively recently in the arms. The ratio of old stars to new stars is correspondingly quite high. In most wavelengths it is quite uninteresting, though there is a radio source visible in the [[w:NVSS]], offset from the core by about two arc-minutes. The identity of the source is uncertain, as it has not been identified visually, or formally studied in any published papers.

==Interaction with Other Galaxies==
To the eye, M65's disk appears slightly warped, and its relatively recent burst of star formation is also suggestive of some external disturbance. Rots (1978) suggests that the two other galaxies in the Leo Triplet interacted with each other about 800 million years ago. Recent research by [[w:Zhiyu Duan]] suggests that M65 may also have interacted, though much less strongly. He also notes that M65 may have a central bar -- it is difficult to tell because the galaxy is seen from an oblique angle -- a feature which is suggestive of tidal disruption. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

* A resolved noncorotating clump of [[w:H I]] material apparently removed from one of the [[w:spiral arm]]s.

'''[[w:Messier objects|Messier]] 67''' (also known as '''M67''' or '''[[w:New General Catalogue|NGC]] 2682''') is an [[w:open cluster]], or galactic cluster, in the constellation [[w:Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]].  M67's [[w:Trumpler class]] is variously given as II 2 r, II 2 m, or II 3 r. It was discovered by [[w:Johann Gottfried Koehler]] in [[w:1779]]. Its age is estimated at between 3.2 and 5 billion years.  The most recently estimated age of four billion years appears to be the most reliable{{Fact|date=April 2008}}; thus the stars of M67 are most likely slightly younger than the [[w:Sun]].

M67 is not the oldest known open cluster, but there are very few in the galaxy known to be older.  M67 is an important laboratory for studying [[w:stellar evolution]], since all its stars are at the same distance and age, except for approximately 30 anomalous [[w:blue straggler]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://chjaa.bao.ac.cn/2005/2005_5_6p579.ps.gz] S1280 and S1284: Two Oscillating Blue Stragglers in the Open Cluster M67, Xiao-Bin Zhang, Rong-Xian Zhang and Zhi-Ping Li, Chin. J. Astron. Astrophys. Vol. 5 (2005), No. 6, 579–586.&lt;/ref&gt;, whose origins are not fully understood.

M67 is one of the most-studied open clusters, yet estimates of its physical parameters such as age, mass, and number of stars of a given type, vary substantially.  Richer et al. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citebase.org/abstract?id=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/9806172] The White Dwarf Cooling Age of M67, Harvey B. Richer, [[w:Gregory Fahlman|Gregory G. Fahlman]], Joanne Rosvick, Rodrigo Ibata, Astrophysical Journal Letters v.504, p.L91  (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; estimate its age to be 4 Gyr, its mass to be 1080 solar masses, and the number of [[w:white dwarf]]s to be 150. Hurley et al. &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507239] A Complete N-body Model of the Old Open Cluster M67, Jarrod R. Hurley, Onno R. Pols, Sverre J. Aarseth, Christopher A. Tout, Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc. 363 (2005) 293-314&lt;/ref&gt; estimate its current mass to be 1400 solar masses and its initial mass to be approximately 10 times as great.

M67 has more than 100 stars similar to the Sun, and many [[w:red giant|red giants]].  The total star count has been estimated at over 500{{Fact|date=April 2008}}.  The cluster contains no [[w:main sequence]] stars bluer than [[w:stellar classification|spectral type F]], other than perhaps some of the blue stragglers, since the brighter stars of that age have already left the main sequence.  In fact, when the stars of the cluster are plotted on the [[w:Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], there is a distinct &quot;turn-off&quot; representing the stars which are just about to leave the main sequence and become red giants.  As the cluster ages, the turn-off will move down the main sequence.

It appears that M67 does not contain an unbiased sample of stars.  One cause of this is [[w:mass segregation]], the process by which lighter stars (actually, systems) gain speed at the expense of more massive stars during close encounters, which causes the lighter stars to be at a greater average distance from the center of the cluster or to escape altogether&lt;ref&gt;[ http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2003/26/aah4157.pdf] Mass segregation in M67 with 2MASS, Ch. Bonatto and E. Bica, (2003) Astron. Astrophys. 405, 525 &lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Messier 69''' (also known as '''M69''' or '''NGC 6637''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in August 31, [[w:1780]], the same night he discovered M70. At the time, he was searching for an object described by LaCaille in 1751-2 and thought he had rediscovered it, but it is unclear if LaCaille actually described M69.

M69 is at a distance of about 29,700 [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and has a spatial radius of 42 light-years. It is a close neighbor of [[w:Globular Cluster M70]], 1,800 light-years separating the two objects, and both these clusters lie close to the [[w:Milky Way|Galactic]] Center. It is one of the most metal-rich globular cluster known.

{{commonscat|Messier 71}}
'''Messier 71''' (also known as '''M71''' or '''NGC 6838''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagitta]]. It was discovered by [[w:Philippe Loys de Chéseaux]] in 1746 and included by [[w:Charles Messier]] in his catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects in 1780.  It was also noted by [[w:Johann Gottfried Koehler|Koehler]] at [[w:Dresden]] around 1775.

M71 is at a distance of about 12,000 [[w:light year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and spans some 27 light years across. The irregular [[w:variable star]] ''Z Sagittae'' is a member of this cluster.

M71 was long thought (until the 1970s) to be a densely packed [[w:open cluster]] and was classified as such by leading [[w:astronomer]]s in the field of star cluster research due to its lacking a dense central compression , its stars having more &quot;[[w:Metallicity|metals]]&quot; than is usual for an ancient globular cluster, and further its lacking the [[w:RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae]] &quot;cluster&quot; variable stars that are common in most globulars.  However, modern photometric [[w:Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] has detected a short &quot;[[w:horizontal branch]]&quot; in the [[w:Hertzsprung-Russell diagram|H-R diagram]] of M71, which is characteristic of a globular cluster.  The shortness of the branch explains the lacking of the RR Lyrae variables and is due to the globular's relatively young age of 9-10 billion years.  The relative youth of this globular also explains the abundance of &quot;metals&quot; in its stars.  Hence today, M71 is designated as a very loosely concentrated globular cluster, much like [[w:Messier 68|M68]] in [[w:Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].  M71 has a [[w:Luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]] of around 13,200 suns.

'''Messier 72''' (also known as '''M72''' or '''NGC 6981''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius constellation]] discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:August 29]] [[w:1780]]. [[w:Charles Messier]] looked for it on the following [[w:October 4]] and 5, and included it in his catalog. Both decided that it was a faint nebula not a cluster as is now believed. Using 10-inch (250 mm) telescopes, viewing the cluster is difficult resulting in only a view of a faint blurry picture, However using Kopernicks' 20-inch (510 mm)  telescope resolution is highly increased. M72 is located at about 53,000 [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and lies in a considerable distance beyond the [[w:Galactic Center]]. Another source states that the cluster is 62,000 light-years away, with a diameter of 42 light-years. Generally considered a young cluster, the cluster has several blue giants, yet star clusters generally contain the oldest stars.

== Before the Upgrade ==

* The GUI relies heavily on JavaScript to generate the content and XMLHTTP (AJAX) to update it. Be careful if you need to use this from an older/minimal browser since it was not designed to downgrade gracefully. This has been tested only on Firefox v1/2/3, Opera v9 and IE v6/7.

* Do all upgrades through a wired LAN cable (i.e. NOT wirelessly). (Although it's possible to upgrade the firmware wirelessly, the transmission may be corrupted by a running microwave oven or ringing cell phone, which will render your router useless, so just don't do it.)

* The GUI username is &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;root&quot; (username is required), ssh and telnet username is always &quot;root&quot;, and the default password is &quot;admin&quot;.

* By default, the SES/AOSS button is programmed to start a password-less telnet daemon at port 233 if held for 20+ seconds. If you run into a problem of not being able to login, you can use this to view (&quot;nvram get http_passwd&quot;) or reset (&quot;nvram set http_passwd=newpassword&quot;) the password. You can disable this behavior in Admin/Buttons. Remember to reboot the router after retrieving your password to close the backdoor.

* If you're upgrading from DD-WRT v23 SP2+, be aware that you may get locked-out because of a change in DD-WRT's use of the nvram password key. You have a few options:
** Push the reset button to reset all the configuration after installing Tomato.
** Use the SES/AOSS button as described above.
** Log in with telnet* and type &quot;nvram get http_passwd&quot; while running DD-WRT and write down the result - this will be your password after loading Tomato. (*the telnet login name is always 'root' even if you have changed the user name in the DD-WRT web interface). 

* If you still have problems with Tomato after upgrading from DD-WRT (WPA2 not working, wireless broadcast failing, settings not being remembered, other) do a complete wipe of the NVRAM by going to Administration-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Restore Default Configuration-&gt;Erase all data in NVRAM memory (thorough). Then as an extra step reinstall (upgrade) to the Tomato firmware. This should solve all issues when upgrading from DD-WRT

* G\code.bin is for WRT54G v1-4 and WRT54GL v1, GS\code.bin is for WRT54GS v1-3, GSv4\code.bin is for WRT54GS v4, and TRX\code.trx is for the WHR-G54S/ WHR-HP-G54S. If you're just upgrading an existing Tomato firmware from the GUI, any of these will work.

== Installing on a Linksys WRT54G, WRT54GL or WRT54GS ==

# Unarchive the 7z package you downloaded.  It's compressed using 7-Zip - tools to open this can be found at [http://www.7-zip.org/ www.7-zip.org].
# Open the Linksys GUI in your browser. The default URL is &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1&lt;/nowiki&gt;/.  The default credentials are username: {blank}, password: admin
# Click the Administration tab, then Firmware Upgrade.
# Select and upload the correct firmware for your router.
# Wait for about 2 minutes while the firmware is uploaded &amp; flashed.
# Log in to the router, and reset factory defaults (under ''Administration/Configuration/Restore Default Configuration'', select the ''Erase all data in NVRAM Memory (thorough)'' option and click OK.  Router will restart again, and the factory default login is &quot;root&quot; with a password of &quot;admin&quot;.  If you have a password set with the old Linksys firmware, try using that password before a manual reset if you encounter any problems logging into Tomato GUI.

[http://www.mandladventures.com/2008/12/03/how-to-change-your-wrt54gl-firmware-from-dd-wrt-to-tomato/ MandLadventures.com] has detailed instructions on how to upgrade from DD-WRT to Tomato.

== Installing on an ASUS WL-520gU ==
=== Installing from OEM firmware ===
Installing Tomato firmware from OEM firmware may need a little massaging to get it on the device.
# If the device has OEM firmware version 3.''x'' or later, then you need to revert it to a pre-3.''x'' version, first (download from [http://support.asus.com.tw/download/download.aspx?product=11&amp;model=WL-520GU support.asus.com.tw]). 
# Downloading and unpack the &quot;ND&quot; version of Tomato firmware, rename the file to &quot;WL520gu_2.0.0.9_EN.trx&quot;.
# Use the OEM menus to update the firmware with the renamed Tomato file.
Once installed, you can load any other firmware file without these machinations, using the config menu item to load new (or old) versions of firmware, including OEM versions. 

=== USB support for storage and printers ===
As noted above, the USB port is not supported by the standard Tomato firmware. There are alternative variations that add this support; see the forum posting [http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=60185 &quot;Tomato 1.''xx'' ND USB + FTP/Samba Mod&quot;] for the list of features. 
# Downloaded and unpack the desired Tomato variation from [http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=19f5a2ee1929229a91b20cc0d07ba4d2edfe124112ee1386 mediafire.com].
# Install (note OEM firmware installation instructions, above).
# Enable USB features in the web UI.

== Installing on a Buffalo WHR-G54S/WHR-HP-G54 ==
=== Via Windows 2000 and XP ===

''Warning:'' Be aware that Buffalo only has encrypted firmwares on their web site. You will not be able to revert back to Buffalo's firmware without an unencrypted version of their firmware. 

'''Vista note:''' Install the tftp client before continuing. Go to Control Panel--&gt;Programs and Features--&gt;Add/remove Windows Features--&gt;tftp client

The following is for an initial install on a Buffalo router. If you're already using a third-party firmware or just upgrading a Tomato firmware, try uploading any of the .bin files from the GUI.

* Plug your computer directly to the router's LAN port. This will not work over a wireless connection.

* Set your computer's ethernet card settings to: IP=192.168.11.2, mask=255.255.255.0, gateway=192.168.11.1 (Gateway and DNS settings are optional and not needed to flash Tomato). In Windows, you can set this by going to Control Panel, Network Connections, right-click your ethernet card, click properties, then TCP/IP.

*Plug in your router and quickly enter this in a DOS window. &quot;tftp -i 192.168.11.1 put tomato.trx&quot; It will return Timeout if it failed or Transferred if it was successful.

*Make sure you are unplugging/replugging the router's power cable (not ethernet cable). There's about a quick 3-5 second window when router is booting up where you can send a install a new firmware. If you miss that and the old firmware boots, you'll get a continuous &quot;ping ... tftp ... ping ... tftp&quot;. Unplug, wait a few seconds and try again. Might be tricky to get the timing right...

* After waiting for at least 2 minutes after the initial flash, with the power still on, push the reset button for one full minute to reset the configuration. Release the reset button and allow the unit to boot up before trying to access it.

* Your router is now at the address of 192.168.1.1 which you can access by manually changing the computer back to 192.168.1.2, subnet 255.255.255.0, Gateway 192.168.1.1 and DNS 192.168.1.1, or simply set your computer back to DHCP (Obtain Automatically in the TCP/IP properties).

* The tftp -i 192.168.11.1 put code.trx process involves the manual hit and miss timing of running a ping loop and hitting enter at just the right time during the power up sequence. The provided batch file eliminates this hectic method of flashing and has rendered it obsolete. Use the Tomato batch file that is included with the Tomato firmware to flash all compatible Buffalo routers.  If you get timeout errors copy the tftp.exe file from Windows/System32/ into the same directory as the .bat and .trx files so the system can find tftp.exe faster.

=== Migrating from DD-WRT Firmware via Windows ===

* You can use the DD-WRT web interface to flash to the Tomato firmware.
* First, obtain the password for the router: In the web interface, go to Administration -&gt; Commands.  Type &quot;nvram get http_passwd&quot; into the text box and click &quot;Run Commands&quot;.  When the page reloads, it will show the password below.  Make note of this password for later use.
** Alternatively, you can obtain the password via telnet. Assuming your router can be found at 192.168.1.1, you'd type &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot; at a command prompt to login to the router. Once logged in, type &quot;nvram get http_passwd&quot; and write down the result.
* Download the Tomato firmware and extract it. In the &quot;trx&quot; subfolder, rename the file code.trx to code.bin. (DD-WRT does not recognize the .trx file extension as firmware.)
* Update the firmware via the DD-WRT web interface. The Tomato firmware is now installed.
* Access the Tomato web interface.  Use the username &quot;root&quot; and the complete password provided by the &quot;nvram  get http_passwd&quot; response above.
* Browse to Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Restore Default Configuration. Then select &quot;Erase all data in NVRAM memory (thorough)&quot; and click OK.
* Please note that the instructions for flashing the firmware via the web interface will only work once you've installed DD-WRT (or perhaps another 3rd party firmware).

=== Via OS X, Linux, and Other Unix-based OS's ===

Warning: Be aware that Buffalo only has encrypted firmwares on their web site. You will not be able to revert back to Buffalo's firmware without an unencrypted version of their firmware.

The following is for an initial install on a Buffalo router. If you're already using a third-party firmware or just upgrading a Tomato firmware, try uploading any of the .bin files from the GUI.

# Plug your computer directly to the router. This will not work over a wireless connection.
# Push the reset button for at least 30 seconds to reset the configuration.
# Unplug power to the router and plug it back in after at least 10 seconds.
# Set your computer's ethernet card settings to: IP=192.168.11.2, mask=255.255.255.0, gateway=192.168.11.1.
# Open two terminal windows.
#* In the first one, type and execute this: ping 192.168.11.1 
#* You should now be continually pinging the router.
# Unplug power to the router. The pings should stop returning now.
# In the second window, cd to the directory in which your firmware is located. Then execute the following:
#: tftp
#: binary
#: rexmt 1
#: trace
#: connect 192.168.11.1 ''Even though the router is still powered down, tftp doesn't actually &quot;connect&quot; when you execute the connect command. Instead, it merely stores the address away until needed.''
# Still in the second terminal window, type the following but do not execute yet: 
#* put tomato.trx
# Plug the router back in. The moment you see pings coming across in the first terminal window, execute the put code.trx command you prepared in the second terminal window. If you see a successful transfer, leave the router alone for at least 2 minutes, then unplug the power, wait 10 seconds and plug it back in. 
# Reset your computer's ethernet card settings back to use DHCP. You can also manually enter the following settings: IP=192.168.1.2, mask=255.255.255.0, gateway=192.168.1.1.
# To login to the router, just go to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1&lt;/nowiki&gt;/ in your web browser. Login name is root, password is admin. 
# Configure your very fine router as desired.
# (Instructions adapted from DD-WRT Wiki and Chromite's &quot;Guide to install DD-WRT Firmware on a Linksys WRT54G router.&quot;)

== Upgrading the Firmware ==
# Open the GUI in your browser. The default URL is &lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# Click Administration&amp;rarr;Upgrade.
# Select any of the files and click the Upgrade button.
# Wait for about 2 minutes while the firmware is uploaded &amp; flashed.
# According to the author, it is not necessary to reset the configuration if you are upgrading from a previous version of Tomato Firmware. If you are upgrading from another firmware, however, a reset is recommended ([http://www.polarcloud.com/tomatofaq#should_i_reset_the_configurati Tomato's FAQ]). Log in to the router, and reset factory defaults (under Administration/Configuration/Restore Default Configuration, select the Erase all data in NVRAM (thorough) option and click OK. The router will restart. The factory default login is &quot;admin&quot; with a password of &quot;admin&quot;. 
# However, unpredictable behavior of the router is nevertheless often experienced, and can usually be cured by an NVRAM erase and reconfiguration. NVRAM can also become corrupted in use by brownouts, etc. causing the same unpredictable behavior.

== Known Problems ==

* There is no documentation other than a [http://www.polarcloud.com/tomatofaq Tomato FAQ] and this wiki. The best source of help and information is the linksysinfo tomato forum http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=160 

* In some cases, you may need to reboot the router manually before the changes go into effect. If the changes involve switching wireless settings, you may need to reboot both ends. (Hasn't been known to happen with 1.07 or later firmware)

* Not all wireless modes / security combinations work. For example, WET, Client and WDS will not work in WPA2.

* CIFS VFS timesout a lot. (or it might the server kicking the client off...)

* Graphs/SVG may not work with all browsers. Firefox: Use 1.5 or higher. Internet Explorer: Use [http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/ Adobe SVG]. Opera: Use 9.0 or higher. Safari: Use 3.0 or higher.

* Certain wireless clients cause the router to crash or reboot on while trying to associate. The &quot;ND&quot; drivers are an attempt to rectify this, but when used, Intel 2200B/G wireless clients cannot associate. The following script corrects the problem with the ND drivers - just run them once from the command line, once committed to NVRAM it doesn't need doing again. 

nvram set wl_reg_mode=off

nvram commit

[More recent versions of tomato such as TomatoUSB have a wl_reg_mode checkbox in the wireless setup menu].

== QoS / Access Restrictions Notes ==

=== General ===

* Tomato implements traffic shaping by user-settable rules that divide all connections into classes and allocate bandwidth to each class.

* Normal QoS classification and access restriction checking is performed on packets traveling out to the Internet (&lt;u&gt;outbound&lt;/u&gt;), i.e. the source is from your computer and the destination is outside on the Internet. This is the more important kind, because you can thus influence the behavior of packet queues in your router and DSL modem, avoid buffer overruns and let important packets jump the queue.

* You can additionally restrict &lt;u&gt;inbound&lt;/u&gt; traffic.   
Although there is an option to limit the download speed, it's often not recommended since what the router is really doing is dropping packets, which means they may need to be re-sent again over a slow Internet link. Some people erroneously believe that since you have no power over incoming traffic queues in routers out on the Internet, there is not much you can do to improve their behavior. However, this is a misconception, by understanding how TCP works it is most certainly possible to use QOS to manipulate and influence the incoming traffic. For more help on using QOS, visit the various forums.

Try the [http://web.archive.org/web/20070527052451/http://www.hyperwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2002 WRT54 Script Generator] as an extension to the current QoS implementation (see [[#Tools|Tools]] for details).

* Why L7/IPP2P doesn't work all the time:
** These work by matching known patterns in packets. Some protocols produce reliable uniquely identifiable signatures, but some do not. 
** A change in the protocol's design can sometimes break these.
** Some L7/IPP2P patterns may depend on which direction the data is going. For example, an HTTP request from a browser is different from an HTTP response from a server.

* Custom L7 patterns can be stored in /etc/l7-extra/ (you need to create the directory). It's up to you to actually populate it before the firewall starts. This can be tricky if you're using external storage, so consider just using JFFS2 or even simple &quot;echo&quot; statements in the startup script. To learn more about L7 patterns, go to l7-filter.sf.net.

* When testing changes to the QoS rules, restart the application on your computer to make sure it's connection is re-classified under the new rule. NOTE - You can now enable &quot;reset classification when making changes&quot; instead.

* KB transferred match:
** This is the OUTGOING (to-WAN) data transferred in kilobytes. Consider the amount an approximate value since it doesn't take into account protocol overhead and uses the [[wikipedia:kibibyte|1024-based definition]] instead of the 1000-based definition used more commonly in networking.
** Entering an upper limit of 1GB (1,048,576KB) or more is considered unlimited and will match anything above 1GB.
** IPP2P may not work properly with this since IPP2P doesn't keep track of its state.

* Sticky rules: IPP2P/L7 are &quot;sticky&quot; in that once they match, no other rules are processed. IP/MAC/port-only matches can also be sticky if there are no IPP2P/L7/KB matches above them. When coupled with a KB transferred match with an upper limit, they are not considered sticky. What this all means is you should watch out for rules like the following: &quot;#1: L7 ABC &amp; 1024KB+, #2: L7 ABC&quot;, the #1 rule may not match at all since #2 will lock-on if it sees L7 ABC within 0-1024KB. To get around this particular case: &quot;#1: L7 ABC &amp; 0-1024KB, #2: L7 ABC &amp; 1024KB+.&quot;

* Precedence: The rules are checked in the same order as they appear in the GUI, from top to bottom. The first rule that matches sets the class. If you disable &quot;strict ordering&quot;, rules (no longer applicable) with IPP2P, L7 and KB matches are grouped in one set and are checked first, the rest in another. In the latest versions of Tomato there is no checkbox to turn off &quot;strict ordering&quot;.

* If you're concerned about performance: IPP2P and especially L7 are slower than simple IP, MAC or port matches.

=== QoS Basic Settings ===

Recommendations (incomplete, because some settings are undocumented and their effect is not known):

The following recommendations assume that you have some traffic that is critical and cannot tolerate lag, such as online gaming, and at the same time some other traffic that saturates your outgoing (upload) channel and interferes unfavorably with the critical traffic. For example, every time one user uploads a file, another user experiences intolerable lag in an online game.

Open the QoS, Basic Settings page.

Enable QoS.

You can prioritize ACK packets for absolute best performance. Be aware that if this is checked, then P2P traffic (which is mostly ACKS) will be prioritized, which will wreck your QOS settings. Effectively, you have placed most P2P in the highest class!

Activate &quot;Reset class when changing settings&quot;, because this helps you to test the effect of your settings changes. It has no effect when you do not change any settings, so usually this can remain enabled.

The &quot;Default class&quot; is the one into which all connections go that are not caught by any of your rules. Use a setting that requires the least number of rules. If you don't know, try &quot;Medium&quot;. 

It is best to remove the rule for P2P, set your default class to e.g. lowest. In this way anything that is not specifically addressed by a rule will bypass the rules and end up in the default class. This is the best way to handle P2P.

Max Bandwidth is important, because it can avoid queues and the consequent lag in the DSL modem. Set it to a little less than the known and measured maximum throughput of your outgoing DSL channel. For example, if you have a 16000/1000 ADSL line, which you have '''measured''' to actually provide 1000 Kbit/s (125 KByte/s) outgoing, set it to 900 or less. Then tune this setting by saturating the outgoing channel (run a long file upload to a fast server or similar) and at the same time running ping tests and observing the turnaround times. If the setting is too high, you will observe too many unacceptably long turnaround times. Reduce the Max Bandwidth setting until you are happy with the results. You may have to set it to as much as 33% under the actually achievable maximum data rate to achieve uniformly low ping times.

The settings for the 10 classes from Highest to E have the following meaning.

* The left figure determines the guaranteed bandwidth (data throughput), which is distributed fairly to all connections in the class.

* If the 10 figures in the left column add up to more than 100%, the router still works well, but it is difficult to predict the bandwidth distribution, so this is not recommended. On the other hand, you can have the figures add up to less than 100% without any problems, if you want to guarantee only low throughputs. Don't worry, the router will still allocate all remaining bandwidth as well.

* The router determines the bandwidth for each class as follows.

# Each channel is allocated its guaranteed bandwidth (according to the left percentage figure).
# The router determines how much of the allocated bandwidth each channel actually uses and from that determines the remaining, unallocated bandwidth.
# After doing this for all channels, the remaining bandwidth, if any, is given to the class Highest.
# The router again determines how much bandwidth is actually used in the Highest class and how much still remains unused.
# This remaining bandwidth, if any, is given to the next lower class, High, and so on down through the classes, until all available bandwidth is allocated. All lower classes, for which no extra bandwidth remained, keep only their guaranteed bandwidth.
# The router regularly, in short intervals, repeats this procedure and reallocates the bandwidth according to changing demands.

* This means, by the way, that the guaranteed bandwidth for the class Highest has no effect, as long as the total of the left column stays below 100%, as the Highest class is anyway getting all of the remaining bandwidth it can use. You can actually set it to None, as long as you make sure the remaining figures add up to less than 100%, so the Highest class effectively gets some guaranteed bandwidth (100% minus the total of the left column).

* If you don't know which guaranteed bandwidths to set, simply distribute the 100% evenly. A good start is to set each of the first 5 classes to 20%, set Classes A to E to None and use only the first 5.

* Note that the name of the 5th class, Lowest, is actually wrong and misleading, as the classes A to E are all lower in priority than the &quot;Lowest&quot; class. In fact, the lowest class is E. Often, using all classes will help to provide you with more information as to what is going on via the pie charts and details.

* The right figure is an absolute bandwidth limit. Under no circumstances do the connections in this class get more data throughput than this. Unless you have a reason for absolute throttling of particular classes, leave this setting at 100% for all classes. You may use this to limit a class such as P2P, to prevent congestion, if it is taking an unreasonably large amount of bandwidth.

The Incoming settings are rather different. The Maximum bandwidth setting is not an overall limit. It is just a figure used for calculating the class percentages. There are only limits on individual classes. You should use these carefully to prevent congestion on your incoming link. Note that limits work by dropping packets, forcing the TCP retransmission timers at the far end to back off, thus stabilizing the connections. Hence UDP can't be limited. Be aware that because there is no overall limit, it is possible for the sum of the individual class limits to exceed 100%, so causing congestion. Therefore, it is often necessary to set incoming limits rather lower than we would like, making a tradeoff in throughput for low latency and better stability.

== DNS/DHCP Configuration ==
The tomato firmware runs [http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html Dnsmasq] 2.55, &quot;a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.&quot;  Most of the configuration is supported by the tomato web interface.  However, there may be situations where special configuration is required.  The [http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html Dnsmasq command syntax] applies to the configuration file - just remove the two dashes at the front.  To add additional lines to the tomato dnsmasq.conf file, use the '''Advanced -&gt; DHCP / DNS''' page of the tomato configuration, in the ''Dnsmasq Custom configuration'' section.  

There are some examples of using this technique in the [[Tomato_Firmware/Menu_Reference#Advanced|Menu Reference / Advanced]] section of this manual under the '''DHCP / DNS''' section as well as [http://trevorsullivan.net/2010/05/11/tomato-firmware-as-dns-server/ Tomato Firmware as DNS Server].  An interesting use of Dnsmasq Customer configuration allows support of a device that is configured via DHCP but needs to point to a unique gateway device such as a VPN appliance.  The instructions for accomplishing this are described in [http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2008q3/002279.html [Dnsmasq-discuss&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Setting different default gateway by mac address].  In my case, I wanted to assign a static IP as well.  Rather than doing this through the tomato web interface, I added the following lines to the '''Dnsmasq Custom configuration'''.  The first line defines the alternate gateway (the VPN appliance) while the second line associates the MAC address with the alternate gateway and the static IP.
  dhcp-option=net:altgateway,option:router,10.99.99.145
  dhcp-host=00:0E:08:EF:39:15,net:altgateway,10.99.99.30,9999m

== Setting Up WDS Repeating ==

Standard terminology for a two router setup:

* The ''client'' router is the router which does not have an internet connection.
* The ''host'' router is the router which does have the internet connection and is going to share it with other routers. 
* To make troubleshooting easier, you can set ''client'' router's '''SSID''' to something different.  Later you can set it to the same as the ''host'' router's '''SSID''' or leave it different.
* Also, it is a good idea to turn off any encryption while setting up WDS repeating as it is known that some encryption methods prevent WDS from working correctly.  You can re-enable it after you have things working properly.

Using WDS to extend your network will reduce throughput, as each unit has to first receive the data and then resend it over the wireless link.  Each added unit in the chain makes matters worse. For best throughput always wire extra AP's with CAT5 cable.

===Step-by-step Instructions===

# For the ''client'' router, on the '''Basic''' -&gt; '''Network''' page, in the '''LAN''' section:
## set the  '''Router IP Address''' to a static IP in the range of the ''host'' router (e.g. if your ''host'' router's IP is 192.168.1.1, set your ''client'' router's IP to 192.168.1.2).
## uncheck the '''DHCP Server''' to disable it (you can only have one DHCP server per network).
# For both the ''client'' router and the ''host'' router, on the '''Basic''' -&gt; '''Network''' page, in the '''Wireless''' section:
## set the '''Channel''' to the same channel on both routers
## set the ''host'' router's '''Wireless Mode''' to '''Access Point + WDS'''
## set the ''client'' router's '''Wireless Mode''' to '''WDS'''
## set the '''WDS''' to '''Link With...'''
## on the ''host'' router, add the ''client'' router's Wireless MAC address to the first '''MAC Address''' field
## on the ''client'' router, add the ''host'' router's Wireless MAC address to the first '''MAC Address''' field

The above example sets up the ''client'' as a WDS repeater, but does not enable Wireless access on the ''client''. To enable the ''client'' to serve as a WDS repeater and accept Wireless connections, set the ''client'' router's '''Wireless Mode''' to '''Access Point + WDS'''.

The [http://www.polarcloud.com/tomatofaq#how_do_i_use_wds Tomato FAQ on WDS] documents an example with IP and Mac address samples for clarity.

== Tools ==

* [http://web.archive.org/web/20070527052451/http://www.hyperwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2002 WRT54 Script Generator] ([http://www.robsonn.user.icpnet.pl/generator.zip download]): A little application that generates scripts for traffic shaping. This script generator's main purpose is to limit the bandwidth of users that are connected to WRT (for example, to share the connection in a fair way). The script shapes traffic on the LAN and the WLAN. QoS shapes outgoing traffic on the WAN (vlan1), so if you try to shape traffic on vlan1 you will destroy actual QoS.

== Tuning ==

Tomato is extremely efficient and will dynamically unload modules, stop services and shutdown processes if certain features are no longer enabled.  The following features, once disabled, will result in fewer running processes.  Less running processes results in more free memory, less CPU load and faster boot times.  In general, it is worth your time to disable unused features.  For example, just enable HTTP or HTTPS web access, it is not necessary to have both enabled.

Of course, Tomato runs well with the entire gamut of functionality enabled.

== Miscellaneous Notes ==

* Some NVRAM settings may not be compatible with other firmwares. It is ALWAYS recommended to erase NVRAM and reconfigure from scratch after flashing to or from this firmware. Failure to do so will often result in erratic behavior and instability.

* You can enter a custom DDNS URL like the following: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mycustomdns.com/update.cgi?username=scooby&amp;password=spooky&amp;ip=@IP&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. The ''&quot;@IP&quot;'' keyword is automatically replaced with the current IP address. Check with your DDNS provider for the exact format to use.

* The [[w:BusyBox|BusyBox]] &lt;tt&gt;crond&lt;/tt&gt; included in Tomato is a little different from the Vixie &lt;tt&gt;crond&lt;/tt&gt; found in HyperWRT, DD-WRT, etc. To make it easier and safer to schedule a job, use the helper script called &lt;tt&gt;cru&lt;/tt&gt; instead of manually changing the config file.

* Want to try changing things without permanently writing them to nvram? Go to [[../Menu Reference#Debugging (Miscellaneous)|Administration&amp;rarr;Debugging]] and enable &quot;[[../Menu Reference#Debugging (Miscellaneous)|Avoid performing an NVRAM commit]]&quot;. When you're done playing around, reboot to discard the changes or use the &quot;[[../Menu Reference#Debugging (Miscellaneous)|NVRAM commit]]&quot; link to save the changes.

* Some GUI settings, like refresh time, are saved as cookies by your web browser.

* Linksys' password protected TFTP upgrade will not work with Tomato. If you need to use TFTP to upgrade the firmware, use the bootloader's TFTP upgrade feature.

* If you're saving the bandwidth history, don't forget to backup the data to another location!

'''Messier 73''' (also known as '''M73''' and '''NGC 6994''') is an [[w:asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] of four [[w:star]]s in the constellation of [[w:Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]].  An asterism is comprised of physically unconnected stars that appear close to each other in the sky as seen from Earth.  M73 is one of the best-known asterisms in the sky, and it has been carefully studied scientifically. 

==History==
M73 was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] on [[w:October 4]], [[w:1780]], who originally described the object as a [[w:star cluster|cluster]] of four stars with some nebulosity.  Subsequent observations by [[w:John Herschel]], however, failed to reveal any nebulosity.  Moreover, Herschel noted that the designation of M73 as a cluster was questionable.  Nonetheless, Herschel included M73 in his [[w:General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters|General Catalogue]] of clusters, [[w:nebulae]], and [[w:galaxies]], and [[w:John Louis Emil Dreyer|John Dreyer]] included M73 when he compiled the [[w:New General Catalogue]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jonesbook1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Scientific Research: Asterism or Open Cluster?==
M73 was once treated as a potential sparsely populated [[w:open cluster]], which consists of stars that are physically associated in space as well as on the sky.  The question of whether the stars were an asterism or an open cluster generated a small, interesting debate.

In 2000, L. P. Bassino, S. Waldhausen, and R. E. Martinez published an analysis of the colors and luminosities of the stars in and around M73. They concluded that the four bright central stars and some other nearby stars followed the color-luminosity relation that is also followed by stars in open clusters (as seen in a [[w:Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]).  Their conclusion was that M73 was an old open cluster that was 9 [[w:arcminute|arcmin]] wide&lt;ref name=&quot;bassinoetal2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Carraro, however, published results in 2000 based on a similar analysis and concluded that the stars did not follow any color-luminosity relation.  Carraro's conclusion was that M73 was an asterism&lt;ref name=&quot;carraro2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A&amp;A...357..145C }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Adding to the controversy, E. Bica and collaborators concluded that the chance alignment of the four bright stars seen in the center of M73 as well as one other nearby star was highly unlikely, so M73 was probably a sparse open cluster&lt;ref name=&quot;bicaetal2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The controversy was solved in 2002, when M. Odenkirchen and C. Soubiran published an analysis of the high resolution [[w:spectra]] of the six brightest stars within 6 [[w:arcminute|arcmin]] of the central position of M73.  Odenkirchen and Soubiran demonstrated that the distances from the Earth to the six stars were very different from each other, and the stars were moving in different directions.  Therefore, they concluded that the stars were only an asterism&lt;ref name=&quot;odenkirchecnsoubiran2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Although M73 was determined to be only a chance alignment of stars, further analysis of asterisms is still important for the identification of sparsely populated open clusters.  Such clusters can be important for demonstrating how open clusters are ripped apart by the [[w:gravitation|gravitational forces]] in the [[w:Milky Way]].

==Location==

'''Messier 74''' (also known as NGC 628) is a face-on [[w:spiral galaxy]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]].

==Suspected black hole==
In [[w:March 22]], [[w:2005]], it was announced &lt;ref name=&quot;chandra2005&quot;&gt;[http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2005/m74/index.html Chandra :: Photo Album :: M74 :: 22 Mar 05&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[w:Chandra X-ray Observatory]] had observed an [[w:ultraluminous X-ray source]] (ULX) in M74, radiating more X-ray power than a [[w:neutron star]] in periodic intervals of around two hours. It has an estimated mass of around 10,000 [[w:Sun]]s. This is an indicator of an [[w:intermediate-mass black hole]]. This would be a rather uncommon class of black holes, somewhere in between in size of stellar black holes and the massive black holes theorized to reside in the center of many galaxies. Because of this, they are believed to form not from single supernovae, but possibly from a number of lesser stellar black holes in a star cluster. The X-ray source is identified as CXOU J013651.1+154547.

'''Messier 75''' (also known as '''M75''' or '''NGC 6864''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:1780]] and included in [[w:Charles Messier]]'s catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects that same year.

M75 is at a distance of about 67,500 [[w:light year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and its apparent size on the sky translates to a true radius of some 67 [[w:light year]]s. It is classified as class ''I'', meaning it is one of the more densely concentrated globular clusters known. The [[w:absolute magnitude]] of M75 is about -8.5 or some 180,000 more [[w:luminosity|luminous]] than the [[w:Sun]].

The '''Little Dumbbell Nebula''' (also known as ''Messier 76'', ''NGC 650/651'', the ''Barbell Nebula'', or the ''Cork Nebula'') is a [[w:planetary nebula]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in 1780 and included in [[w:Charles Messier]]'s catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects as number 76. It was recognized as a planetary nebula in 1918 by the [[w:astronomer]] [[w:Heber Doust Curtis]].

M76's distance is not well known, with estimates ranging from 1,700 to 15,000 [[w:light year|light years]], and consequently its dimensions are also not well known. The nebula shines at an [[w:apparent magnitude]] of +10.1 with a [[w:central star]] of magnitude +16.6. This star, whose expanding outer layers form the present nebula, has a surface temperature of 60,000 [[w:kelvin]]s.

The Little Dumbbell Nebula got its name from its resemblance to the [[w:Dumbbell Nebula]] (M27) in [[w:Vulpecula]]. It was originally thought to consist of two separate nebulae and was thus given two catalog numbers in the [[w:New General Catalogue|NGC]], 650 and 651. It is one of the faintest and hardest to see objects in Messier's list.

Messier 77 is an [[w:active galaxy]] with an [[w:Active Galactic Nucleus]] (AGN), which is obscured from view by astronomical dust at visible wavelengths. The diameter of the molecular disk and hot plasma associated with the obscuring material was first measured at radio wavelengths by the [[w:VLBA]] and [[w:VLA]]. The hot dust around the nucleus was subsequently measured in the mid-infrared by the [[w:Mid-IR Interferometric instrument|MIDI]] instrument at the [[w:VLT]]I.

The nebula '''Messier 78''' (also known as '''M 78''' or '''NGC 2068''') is a [[w:reflection nebula]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:1780]] and included by [[w:Charles Messier]] in his catalog of [[w:comet]]-like objects that same year.

M78 is the brightest diffuse reflection nebula of a group of nebulae that include NGC 2064, NGC 2067 and NGC 2071. This group belongs to the [[w:Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]] and is about 1,600 [[w:light year]]s distant from [[w:Earth]]. M78 is easily found in small [[w:telescope]]s as a hazy patch and involves two [[w:star]]s of 10th [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]]. These two stars, ''HD 38563A'' and ''HD 38563B'', are responsible for making the cloud of dust in M78 visible by reflecting their light.

About 45 [[w:variable star]]s of the ''T Tauri'' type, young stars still in the process of formation as well as some 17 [[w:Herbig-Haro object]]s are known in M78.

'''Messier 79''' (also known as '''M79''' or '''NGC 1904''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:Lepus constellation]]. It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:1780]]. M79 is at a distance of about 41,000 [[w:light year]]s away from [[w:Earth]] and 60,000 light years away from the [[w:Galactic Center]].

Like [[w:Messier 54]] (the other extragalactic globular on Messier's list), it is thought that M79 is not native to the [[w:Milky Way]] galaxy at all, but instead to the [[w:Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy]] which is currently experiencing a very close encounter with the Milky Way, one it is unlikely to survive intact. This is, however, a contentious subject as astronomers are still debating the nature of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy itself&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...472L..47L Re-affirming the connection between the Galactic stellar warp and the Canis Major over-density]&lt;/ref&gt;; care must therefore be taken when associating any object with the Canis Major dwarf.

'''Messier 80''' (also known as '''M80''' or '''NGC 6093''') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Scorpius]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1781]].

M80 is located midway between α Scorpii ([[w:Antares]]) and [[w:Beta Scorpii|β Scorpii]] in a field in the Milky Way that is rich in [[w:nebula]]e. It can be viewed with modest amateur [[w:telescope]]s as a mottled ball of light.  With an apparent diameter of about 10' and at an estimated distance of 32,600 [[w:light-year]]s, M80's spatial diameter is about 95 light-years and contains several hundred thousand [[w:star]]s. It is among the more densely populated globular clusters in the [[w:Milky Way Galaxy]]. M80 contains a relatively large amount of ''[[w:blue straggler]]s'', stars that appear to be much younger than the cluster itself. It is thought these stars have lost part of their outer layers due to close encounters with other cluster members or perhaps the result of collisions between stars in the dense cluster. Images from the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] have shown districts of very high blue straggler densities, suggesting that the center of the cluster is likely to have a very high capture and collision rate.

On [[w:May 21]], [[w:1860]], a [[w:nova]] was discovered in M80 that attained a [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of +7.0. The nova, [[w:variable star]] designation ''T Scorpii'', reached an [[w:absolute magnitude]] of -8.5, briefly outshining the entire cluster.

'''Messier 81''' (also known as '''NGC 3031''' or '''Bode's Galaxy''') is a [[w:spiral galaxy]] about [[w:1 E22 m|12 million]] [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ursa Major]].  M81 is one of the most striking examples of a [[w:grand design spiral galaxy]], with near perfect arms spiraling into the very center.  Because of its proximity to [[w:Earth]], its large size, and its [[w:active galactic nucleus]] (which harbors a [[w:supermassive black hole]]) Messier 81 is a popular galaxy to study in professional [[w:astronomy]] research.  The galaxy's large size and relatively low apparent magnitude (lower magnitude implies higher brightness) also make it a popular target for [[w:amateur astronomy]] observations.&lt;ref name=&quot;omeara1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Messier 81 triggering starburst==
[[image:M82(2).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the '''Cigar Galaxy''']]
Forming a striking pair in small [[w:telescope]]s with nearby [[w:spiral galaxy|spiral]] [[w:Messier 81|M81]], M82 is being physically affected by its larger neighbor.  Tidal forces caused by [[w:gravity]] have deformed this [[w:galaxy]], a process that started about 100 million years ago.  This interaction has caused star formation to increase 10 fold compared to &quot;normal&quot; galaxies.

Recently, M82 has undergone at least one tidal encounter with M81 resulting in a large amount of gas being funneled into the galaxy's core over the last 200 Myr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt;  The most recent such encounter is thought to have happened around 2&amp;ndash;5{{e|8}} years ago and resulted in a concentrated starburst together with a corresponding marked peak in the cluster age distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt;  This starburst ran for up to ~50 Myr at a rate of ~10 ''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt;  Two subsequent startbursts followed, the last (~4&amp;ndash;6 Myr ago) of which may have formed the core clusters, both super star clusters (SSCs) and their lighter counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt;

Ignoring any difference in their respective distances from us, the centers of M81 and M82 are visually separated by about 130,000 light-years.&lt;ref&gt;Declination separation of 36&amp;prime;.87 and Right Ascension separation of 9&amp;prime;.5 gives via [[w:Pythagorean theorem]] a visual separation of 38&amp;prime;.07; Average distance of 11.65 Mly &amp;times; sin(38&amp;prime;.07) = 130,000 ly visual separation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual separation is 300{{±|300|200}} kly.&lt;ref&gt;Separation = sqrt(D&lt;sub&gt;M81&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + D&lt;sub&gt;M82&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2 D&lt;sub&gt;M81&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;M82&lt;/sub&gt; Cos(38&amp;prime;.07)) assuming the error direction is about the same for both objects.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karachentsevetal2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Starburst region==
In the core of M82, the active starburst region spans a diameter of 500 pc. In optical, there are four high surface brightness regions or clumps (designated A, C, D, and E).&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt; These clumps correspond to known sources at [[w:X-ray]], [[w:infrared]], and [[w:astronomical radio source|radio]] frequencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt; Consequently, they are thought to be the least obscured starburst clusters from our vantage point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt; M82's unique bipolar outflow (or 'superwind') appears to be concentrated on clumps A and C and fueled by the energy injected by [[w:supernova]] that occur about once every ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt;

The [[w:Chandra X-ray Observatory]] detected fluctuating [[w:X-ray]] emissions from a location approximately 600 light-years away from the center of M82. Astronomers have postulated that this fluctuating emission comes from the first known [[w:intermediate-mass black hole]], of roughly 200 to 5000 [[w:solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrunoetal2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Structure==
[[image:M82s.jpg|thumb|150px|left|M82 in a small telescope.]]
M82 was previously believed to be an irregular galaxy.  However, in [[w:2005]], two symmetric [[w:spiral arm]]s were discovered in the [[w:near-infrared]] (NIR) images of M82.  The arms were detected by subtracting an [[w:axisymmetric]] exponential disk from the NIR images.  These arms emanate from the ends of the NIR [[w:Barred spiral galaxy|bar]] and can be followed for the length of 3 [[w:Disc (galaxy)|disc]] scales.  Even though the arms were detected in the NIR images, they are bluer than the disk. Assuming that the northern part of M82 is nearer to us, which most literature assumes, the observed sense of rotation implies trailing arms.  Due to M82's high disk [[w:surface brightness]], nearly edge-on orientation (~80°)&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkeretal2008&quot; /&gt; with respect to us, and the presence of a complex network of dusty filaments in optical images, the arms were not previously detected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayyaetal2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Here's a tip for making good omelets: Cook the things that you want cooked before you add it into the eggs, and have everything at room temperature.

== Ingredients ==
* 3 eggs, uncracked
* 2-3 pinches fine sea salt
* 1 habanero chile, finely minced and seeded if you like
* 1/2 cup salsa, room temperature
* 1 cup grated Monterrey Jack cheese, room temperature
* 2 tbs fresh cilantro/coriander, finely chopped
* Butter

== Procedure ==
#Cover eggs with warm but not scalding water. Let sit 5 minutes or until room temperature.
#Beat eggs with salt. Set aside.
#Combine chiles, salsa, cilantro, and cheese. Set aside. 
#Heat a large nonstick over medium high heat. Quickly swirl with butter and add eggs. Cook until egg is set and well browned on side facing pan.
#Sprinkle salsa mixture evenly on uncooked side of egg. Fold in half and cook raw side until set and well browned.
#Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve warm.</text>

'''Messier 83''' (also known as the ''Southern Pinwheel Galaxy'', ''M83'' or ''NGC 5236'') is an [[w:intermediate spiral galaxy]] approximately 15 million [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].  It is one of the closest and brightest [[w:Barred spiral galaxy|barred spiral galaxies]] in the sky, making it visible with [[w:binoculars]].  Six [[w:Supernova]]e ([[w:SN 1923A]], [[w:SN 1945B]], [[w:SN 1950B]], [[w:SN 1957D]], [[w:SN 1968L]] and [[w:SN 1983N]]) have been observed in M83.

==History==

On [[w:16 June]] [[w:2008]] NASA's [[w:Galaxy Evolution Explorer]] project reported finding large numbers of new stars in the outer reaches of the galaxy.   It had hitherto been thought that these areas lacked the materials necessary for star formation. [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/galex/galex-20080416.html]

'''Messier 85''' (also known as '''M85''' or '''NGC 4382''') is a [[w:lenticular galaxy]] (type S0) in the [[w:Coma Berenices constellation]]. It is 60 million light years away, making it the 94th most distant Messier object, and it estimated to be 125,000 light years across.

It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:1781]].  It is the northernmost outlier of the [[w:Virgo cluster]] discovered as of 2004.  

The type I [[w:supernova]], [[w:1960R]] was discovered in M85 on Dec 20, [[w:1960]] and reached an [[w:apparent magnitude]] of 11.7.

M85 is interacting with the nearby [[w:spiral galaxy]] [[w:NGC 4394]], and a small [[w:elliptical galaxy]] called [[w:MCG 3-32-38]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kopernik&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''Messier 86''' (also known as '''M86''' or '''NGC 4406''') is a [[w:lenticular galaxy]] in the constellation [[w:Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1781]]. M86 lies in the heart of the [[w:Virgo Cluster|Virgo Cluster of galaxies]] and forms a most conspicuous group with another giant, [[w:Lenticular Galaxy M84]].  It displays the highest [[w:blue shift]] of all Messier objects, as it is approaching the [[w:Milky Way]] at 244 km/s.  This is thought to be due to its falling towards the center of the Virgo cluster, which brings it closer to us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobyetal2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''Messier 87''' (also known as '''M87''', '''Virgo A''' or '''NGC 4486''') is a giant [[w:elliptical galaxy]].

== Jet ==
In [[w:1918]], [[w:Lick Observatory]] astronomer [[w:Heber Curtis]] discovered a [[w:Relativistic jet|jet]] of matter coming from M87 which he described as &quot;a curious straight ray.&quot; This jet extends at least 5000 light-years from the nucleus of M87 and is made up of matter ejected from the galaxy, most likely by a [[w:supermassive black hole]] (a hypothesis made more likely by the discovery of a disk of rapidly rotating gas around the nucleus of M87). [[w:Astronomer]]s believe that the black hole in this galaxy has a mass of approximately 6.4 billion (6.4&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) [[w:solar mass]]es. M87 has also been found to be a strong source of [[w:X-ray]]s. Its proximity means that it is one of the best studied [[w:radio galaxy|radio galaxies]].

===Superluminal motion===
In pictures taken by the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] in [[w:1999]], the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is believed to be a visual result of the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true [[w:superluminal motion]].  However, detection of such motion supports the theory that [[w:quasar]]s,  
[[w:BL Lac object]]s and [[w:radio galaxies]] may all be the same phenomenon, known as [[w:active galactic nucleus|active galaxies]], viewed from different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v520n2/39787/39787.html J. A. Biretta, W. B. Sparks, and F. Macchetto, ''Astrophys. J.'' '''520''', 621 (1999).;] {{cite web
 | title=Hubble detects faster-than-light motion in Galaxy M87

 | date=1999-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-ray emitting loops and rings===
Observations made by [[w:Chandra X-ray Observatory]] indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that permeate the cluster and surround M87. These loops and rings are generated by pressure waves. The pressure waves are caused by variations in the rate at which material is ejected from the [[w:supermassive black hole]] in jets. The distribution of loops suggests that minor eruptions occur every six million years. 
One of the rings, caused by a major eruption, is a shock wave 85,000 light-years in diameter around the black hole. Other remarkable features observed include narrow X-ray emitting filaments up to 100,000 light-years long, and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago.
The regular eruptions prevent a huge reservoir of gas from cooling and forming stars, implying that M87’s evolution may have been seriously affected, preventing it from becoming a large [[w:Spiral galaxy]].
The observations also imply the presence of sound waves: 56 octaves below [[w:middle C]] for the minor eruptions and 58 to 59 below middle C for the major eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/06_releases/press_100506.html &quot;Chandra Reviews Black Hole Musical: Epic But Off-Key&quot;], [[w:October 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gamma ray emissions===
M87 is also a very strong source of [[w:gamma rays]], which are the most energetic rays of the electromagnetic spectrum; more than a million times as powerful as visible light. Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but recently, using the [[w:HESS]] Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days.

It is generally accepted that the supermassive [[w:black hole]] located in the center of M87 holds a mass of several billion solar masses.  However, the fact that the variations can change over several days makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 (about the size of our [[w:solar system]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/2006/10/27/gamma-rays-pour-from-the-edge-of-a-supermassive-black-hole/ Universe Today, Gamma Rays Pour From the Edge of a Supermassive Black Hole], [[w:October 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;  the most promising source of the gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter, the faster the variations, and vice versa.

'''Messier 89''' ('''M89''' for short, also known as '''NGC 4552''') is an [[w:elliptical galaxy]] in the constellation [[w:Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] on [[w:March 18]] [[w:1781]]. M89 is a member of the [[w:Virgo Cluster|Virgo Cluster of galaxies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m089.html Elliptical Galaxy M89 @ SEDS Messier pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unusual features ==
Current observations indicate that M89 may be nearly perfectly [[w:Sphere|spherical]] in shape. This would be unusual as all other known elliptic galaxies are relatively elongated [[w:ellipsoids]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, it is possible that the galaxy is oriented in such a way that it appears spherical to an observer on Earth but is in fact elliptical. 

The galaxy also features a surrounding structure of gas and dust extending up to 150,000 light-years from the galaxy and jets of heated particles that extend 100,000 light-years outwards, indications that it may have once been an active [[w:quasar]] or [[w:radio galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy_messier_81to90.html Messier Objects 81-90 @ Sea and Sky]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messier 90''' (also known as ''M90'' and ''NGC 4569'') is a [[w:spiral galaxy]] about 60 million [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. It was discovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] in [[w:1781]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jones1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn=0-87279-667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of the galaxy's interaction with the [[w:intracluster medium]] in the Virgo Cluster, the galaxy has lost much of its [[w:interstellar medium]].  As a result of this process, which is referred to as ''ram pressure stripping'', the galaxy's interstellar medium and [[w:star formation|star formation region]]s appear truncated compared to similar galaxies outside the Virgo Cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;koopmannkenney2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Star formation activity ==
As stated above, the [[w:star formation]] in Messier 90 appears truncated.  Consequently, the galaxy's spiral arms appear to be smooth and featureless, rather than knotted like galaxies with extended star formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;koopmannkenney2004&quot; /&gt;  However, the center of Messier 90 appears to be a site of significant star formation activity.  Multiple [[w:supernovae]] in the nucleus have produced 'superwinds' that are blowing the galaxy's interstellar medium outward into the intracluster medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;tschokeetal2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blueshift ==
The [[w:spectrum]] of Messier 90 is [[w:blueshift]]ed, which indicates that it is moving towards the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ned&quot; /&gt;  In contrast, the spectra of most other galaxies are [[w:redshift]]ed.  The blueshift was originally used to argue that Messier 90 was actually an object in the foreground of the Virgo Cluster.  However, since the phenomenon was limited mostly to galaxies in the same part of the sky as the Virgo Cluster, it appeared that this inference based on the blueshift was incorrect.  Instead, the blueshift is thought to be evidence for the large range in velocities of objects within the Virgo Cluster itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegieatlas&quot; /&gt;

== Distance measurements ==
Low levels of [[w:H I]] gas prevents using the [[w:Tully-Fisher relation]] to estimate the distance to Messier 90.&lt;ref name=&quot;tschokeetal2001&quot; /&gt;

== Companion galaxies ==
Messier 90 has a [[w:satellite galaxy]] ([[w:IC 3583]]) which is an [[w:irregular galaxy]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

== Notes ==
:{{Note|A|a}}{{Harvnb|Tschöke|Bomans|Hensler|Junkes|2001}} uses a [[w:Hubble constant]] of 75 (km/s)/Mpc to estimate a distance of 16.8 Mpc to NGC 4569.  Adjusting for the 2006 value of 70{{±|2.4|3.2}} (km/s)/Mpc we get a distance of 18.0{{±|0.9|0.6}} Mpc.

'''Messier 92''' (also known as ''M92'' or ''NGC 6341'') is a [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:Hercules constellation|constellation Hercules]]. It was discovered by [[w:Johann Elert Bode]] in [[w:1777]] and independently rediscovered by [[w:Charles Messier]] on [[w:March 18]], [[w:1781]]. M92 is at a distance of about 26,000 [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LINERs in general are characterized by optical [[w:spectrum|spectra]] that reveal that [[w:ion|ion]]ized gas is present but the gas is only weakly ionized (i.e. the atoms are missing relatively few electrons).

==Inner and outer rings==
M94 contains both an inner ring with a diameter of 70&quot; and an outer ring with a diameter of 600&quot;.  These rings appear to form at [[w:resonance|resonance]] locations within the disk of the galaxy.  The inner ring is the site of strong [[w:star formation|star formation]] activity and is sometimes referred to as a [[w:starburst (astronomy)|starburst]] ring.  This star formation is fueled by gas that is dynamically driven into the ring by the inner oval-shaped bar-like structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;munoztunonetal04&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Pseudobulge==
In a paper published in 2004, [[w:John Kormendy|John Kormendy]] and [[w:Robert Kennicutt|Robert Kennicutt]] argued that M94 contains a prototypical [[w:bulge (astronomy)|pseudobulge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kormendykennicutt04&quot; /&gt;  A classical [[w:spiral galaxy|spiral galaxy]] consists of a disk of gas and young stars that intersects a large sphere (or bulge) of older stars.  In contrast, a galaxy with a pseudobulge does not have a large bulge of old stars but instead contain a bright central structure with intense star formation that looks like a bulge when the galaxy is viewed face-on.  In the case of M94, this pseudobulge takes the form of a ring around a central oval-shaped region.

==Distance measurements==
At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to M94. The [[w:surface brightness fluctuation|surface brightness fluctuation]]s distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to M94 using this technique is 17.0 ± 1.4 [[w:light-year|Mly]] (5.2 ± 0.4 [[w:parsec|Mpc]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;tonryetal2001&quot; /&gt; However, M94 is close enough that the [[w:Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble Space Telescope]] can be used to resolve and measure the fluxes of the brightest individual stars within the galaxy. These measured fluxes can then be compared to the measured fluxes of similar stars within the [[w:Milky Way|Milky Way]] to measure the distance. The estimated distance to M94 using this technique is 15 ± 2 [[w:light-year|Mly]] (4.7 ± 0.6 [[w:parsec|Mpc]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;karachentsevetal2003&quot; /&gt; Averaged together, these distance measurements give a distance estimate of 16.0 ± 1.3 [[w:light-year|Mly]] (4.9 ± 0.4 [[w:parsec|Mpc]]).

==Dark matter==
In 2008 a study was published &lt;ref name=&quot;bratek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
  | author=J. Jałocha, Ł. Bratek, and M. Kutschera

  | doi=10.1086/533511}}&lt;/ref&gt; that appeared to show that M94 had very little or no [[w:dark matter|dark matter]] present. The study analyzed the rotation curves of the galaxy's stars and the density of hydrogen gas and found that ordinary luminous matter appeared to account for all of the galaxy's mass. This result was unusual and somewhat controversial, as current models don't indicate how a galaxy could form without a dark matter halo or how a galaxy could lose its dark matter. Other explanations for galactic rotation curves, such as [[w:MOND|MOND]], also have difficulty explaining this galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13280-galaxy-without-dark-matter-puzzles-astronomers.html| title=Galaxy without dark matter puzzles astronomers| date= 06 February 2008| publisher= NewScientist.com news service| first= Stephen | last=Battersby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Owl Nebula''' (also known as '''[[w:Messier Object]] 97''' or '''[[w:New_General_Catalogue|NGC]] 3587''') is a [[w:planetary nebula]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ursa Major]]. It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in 1781.

M97 is regarded as one of the more complex of the planetaries. The 16th [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] central [[w:star]] has about 0.7 [[w:solar mass]] and the nebula itself about 0.15 solar mass. The nebula formed roughly 6,000 years ago.

The nebula gets it name due to the appearance of owl-like &quot;eyes&quot; when view through a large (&gt;200 mm) telescope under dark sky conditions with the aid of a so-called &quot;nebula filter.&quot;  The &quot;eyes&quot; are also easily visible through photographs taken of the nebula.

'''Messier 99''' (also known as ''M99'' or ''NGC 4254'') is an [[w:unbarred spiral galaxy]] approximately [[w:1 E23 m|60 million]] [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Coma Berenices]].  

The galaxy has a normal looking arm and an extended arm that is less tightly wound. A bridge of neutral hydrogen gas links NGC 4254 with [[w:VIRGOHI21]]. The gravity from the [[w:dark galaxy]] [[w:VIRGOHI21]] appears to have distorted M99 and drawn out the gas bridge, as the two galaxy-sized objects have a close encounter, before they go their separate ways. It is expected that the drawn out arm will relax to match the normal arm once the encounter is over.
Three supernovae have been observed in this galaxy.

==History==
Messier 99 was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] on [[w:March 17]], [[w:1781]].  The discovery was then reported to [[w:Charles Messier]], who included the object in the [[w:Messier Catalogue]], which was the first astronomical catalogue of star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonesbook1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The '''Pinwheel Galaxy''' (also known as '''Messier 101''' or '''NGC 5457''') is a face-on [[w:spiral galaxy]] about 27 million [[w:light-year]]s away in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ursa Major]].

It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] on [[w:March 27]], [[w:1781]], and he subsequently communicated his discovery to [[w:Charles Messier]] who verified its position and added it to the [[w:Messier Catalogue]] as one of the final entries.  

On [[w:February 28]], [[w:2006]], [[w:NASA]] and the [[w:ESA]] released a very detailed image of Pinwheel Galaxy, which was the largest and most detailed image of a galaxy by [[w:Hubble Space Telescope]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2006/10/ HubbleSite - NewsCenter - Hubble's Largest Galaxy Portrait Offers a New High-Definition View (02/28/2006) - Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The image was composed from 51 individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.  

== Discovery ==
Pierre Méchain, the discoverer of M101, described it as a &quot;nebula without star, very obscure and pretty large, 6' to 7' in diameter, between the left hand of Bootes and the tail of the great Bear. It is difficult to distinguish when one lits the [grating] wires.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEDS Historical Notes&quot;&gt;SEDS Historical Notes, [http://www.seds.org/messier/Mdes/dm101.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:William Herschel]] noted in 1784 that &quot;[M101] in my 7, 10, and 20-feet reflectors shewed a mottled kind of nebulosity, which I shall call resolvable; so that I expect my present telescope will, perhaps, render the stars visible of which I suppose them to be composed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEDS Historical Notes&quot;/&gt;

[[w:Lord Rosse]] observed M101 in his 72-inch [[w:Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]] during the second half of the 19th century. He was the first to make extensive note of the spiral structure and made several sketches.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEDS Historical Notes&quot;/&gt;

To observe the spiral structure in modern instruments requires a fairly large instrument, very dark skies, and a low power eye piece.

== Structure and composition ==
[[image:Anttlers101.jpg||thumb|left|300px|The Pinwheel Galaxy.  Credit: Scott Anttila.]]

M101 is a relatively large galaxy compared to the [[w:Milky Way]]. With a diameter of 170,000 light-years it is nearly twice the size of the Milky Way. It has a disk mass on the order of 100 billion solar masses, along with a small bulge of about 3 billion solar masses&lt;ref name=&quot;M101 mass&quot;&gt; Comte, G., Monnet, G., &amp; Rosado, M. &quot;An optical study of the galaxy M 101 - Derivation of a mass model from the kinematic of the gas,&quot; 1979, ''Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics'', '''72''', 73-81 ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979A%26A....72...73C])&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another remarkable property of this galaxy is its huge and extremely bright [[w:H II region|H II regions]] , of which a total of about 3000 can be seen on photographs. HII regions usually accompany the enormous clouds of high density molecular hydrogen gas contracting under their own gravitational force where [[w:star formation|stars form]].  HII regions are ionized by large numbers of extremely bright and hot young stars.   

On photographs M101 can be seen to be asymmetrical on one side. It is thought that in the recent past (speaking in galactic terms) M101 underwent a near collision with another galaxy and the associated gravitational [[w:tidal]] forces caused the asymmetry. In addition, this encounter also amplified the density waves in the spiral arms of M101.  The amplification of these waves leads to the compression of the [[w:interstellar medium|interstellar hydrogen gas]], which then triggers strong [[w:star formation]] activity.

== Companion galaxies ==
M101 has five prominent companion galaxies: [[w:NGC 5204]], [[w:NGC 5474]], [[w:NGC 5477]], [[w:NGC 5585]], and [[w:Holmberg IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegieatlas&quot; &gt;{{cite book

| location=Washington, D.C.
| isbn=0-87279-667-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated above, the gravitational interaction between M101 and its satellites may have triggered the formation of the grand design pattern in M101.  M101 has also probably distorted the companion galaxy NGC 5474.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegieatlas&quot;/&gt;  M101 and its companion galaxies comprise most or possibly all of the [[w:M101 Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nbg&quot;&gt;{{cite book

This galaxy appears to closely match both the object description (by [[w:Pierre Méchain]]) in the printed version of the Messier Catalog of 1781, and the object position  given by [[w:Charles Messier]] in hand-written notes on his personal list of the [[w:Messier Catalogue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frommert2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m102dseds&quot; /&gt;

===Other possible corresponding objects===
Although M101 and NGC 5866 are considered to be the two most likely candidates for M102, a few other objects have been suggested as potentially corresponding to this entry.

====NGC 5879, NGC 5907, NGC 5908 ==== 
[[w:NGC 5879]], [[w:NGC 5907]], and [[w:NGC 5908]] are all galaxies near the position of [[w:NGC 5866]].  By that criterion, they may all be as likely as [[w:NGC 5866]] to be the objects that correspond to M102.  However, none of these galaxies are as bright or as high in surface brightness as NGC 5866, so it is less likely that these objects correspond to M102.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonesbook1991&quot; /&gt;

====NGC 5928====
[[w:NGC 5928]] is a 14th [[w:apparent magnitude|magnitude]] [[w:galaxy]] located between [[w:Omicron Boötis|ο Boötis]] and [[w:Iota Serpentis|ι Serpentis]].  [[w:J. L. E. Dreyer]], in his ''Notes and Corrections'' to the [[w:New General Catalogue]], suggested that this may have been the source identified as M102 on the basis that ι Serpentis may have been misidentified as [[w:Iota Draconis|ι Draconis]] in the location given for the object.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonesbook1991&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ngc&quot;&gt;J.L.E. Dreyer, ''New General Catalogue of Nebulæ and Clusters of Stars (1888), Index Catalogue (1895) Second Index Catalogue (1908)'', Royal Astronomical Society, London, 1971, p.283&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it may not have been observable by Messier and Méchain, so it is unlikely to correspond to M102.

The '''Sombrero Galaxy''' (also known as ''M104'' or ''NGC 4594'') is an unbarred spiral galaxy in the constellation Virgo.  It has a bright nucleus, an unusually large central bulge, and a prominent dust lane in its inclined disk.  The dark dust lane and the bulge give this galaxy the appearance of a sombrero.  The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 
9.0, making it a galaxy that can easily be seen with amateur telescopes.  The large bulge, the central supermassive black hole, and the dust lane all attract the attention of professional astronomers.

==History==
===Discovery===
The Sombrero Galaxy was discovered in March of 1767 by Pierre Méchain, who described the object in a May 1767 letter to J. Bernoulli that was later published in the '''''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch'''''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kepplesanner1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Designation as a Messier object===
In 1921, Camille Flammarion found Messier's personal list of the Messier objects including the hand-written notes about the Sombrero Galaxy.  This was identified with object 4594 in the New General Catalogue, and Flammarion declared that it should be included in the Messier Catalogue.  Since this time, the Sombrero Galaxy has been known as ''M104''&lt;ref name=&quot;jones1991&quot; /&gt;.

===Historical redshift measurements===
In the 1910s, Vesto Slipher discovered that the spectra of several galaxies, including the Sombrero Galaxy, are redshifted.  The average velocity calculated from these redshifts was 400 km/s.  The redshift for the Sombrero Galaxy itself was calculated to be 1100 km/s&lt;ref name=&quot;slipher1915&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Slipher also detected rotation within the spectra of the Sombrero Galaxy.  His observations of galaxy rotation are among the first ever performed&lt;ref name=&quot;slipher1915&quot; /&gt;.

==Dust ring==
As noted above, this galaxy's most striking feature is the dust lane that crosses in front of the bulge of the galaxy.  This dust lane is actually a symmetric ring that encloses the bulge of the galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bendoetal2006&quot; /&gt;  Most of the cold atomic hydrogen gas&lt;ref name=&quot;bajajaetal1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Nucleus==
The nucleus of the Sombrero galaxy is classified as a low ionization nuclear emission region|low ionization nuclear emission region (LINER).&lt;ref name=&quot;hoetal1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are nuclear regions where ionized gas is present, but the ions are only weakly ionized (i.e. the atoms are missing relatively few electrons).  The source of energy for ionizing the gas in LINERs has been debated extensively.  Some LINER nuclei may be powered by hot, young stars found in star formation regions, whereas other LINER nuclei may be powered by active galactic nuclei (highly energetic regions that contain supermassive black holes).  Infrared spectroscopy observations have demonstrated that the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy is probably devoid of any significant star formation activity.  However, a supermassive black hole has been identified in the nucleus (as discussed in the subsection below), so this active galactic nucleus is probably the energy source that weakly ionizes the gas in the Sombrero Galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bendoetal2006&quot; /&gt;

===Central supermassive black hole===
In the 1990s, a research group led by John Kormendy demonstrated that a supermassive black hole is present within the Sombrero Galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;kormendyetal1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...473L..91K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Using spectroscopy data from both the CFHT
and the Hubble Space Telescope, the group showed that the speed of rotation of the stars within the center of the galaxy could not be maintained unless a mass 1 billion times the mass of the Sun, or 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;, is present in the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;kormendyetal1996&quot; /&gt;  This is among the most massive black holes measured in any nearby galaxies.

At radio and X-ray wavelengths, the nucleus is a strong source of synchrotron emission.&lt;ref name=&quot;debruynetal1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

This emission is actually quite common for [[w:active galactic nuclei]].  Although radio synchrotron emission may vary over time for some active galactic nuclei, the luminosity of the radio emission from the Sombrero Galaxy only varies 10-20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;debruynetal1996&quot;/&gt;

===Unidentified submillimeter emission===
In 2006, two groups published measurements of the submillimeter radiation from the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy at a wavelength of 850 [[micrometres.&lt;ref name=&quot;krauseetal2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bendoetal2006&quot; /&gt;  This submillimeter emission was found not to originate from the thermal emission from dust (which is commonly seen at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths), synchrotron emission (which is commonly seen at radio wavelengths), bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas (which is uncommonly seen at millimeter wavelengths), or molecular gas (which commonly produces submillimeter spectral lines).&lt;ref name=&quot;bendoetal2006&quot; /&gt;  The source of the submillimeter emission remains unidentified.

==Globular clusters==
The Sombrero Galaxy has a relatively large number of globular clusters.  Observational studies of globular clusters in the Sombrero Galaxy have produced estimates of the population in the range of 1200 to 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;wakamatsu1977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

These results have been repeatedly used to demonstrate that the 
number of globular clusters in galaxies is thought to be related to the size of the galaxies' bulges.

==Distance==
At least two methods have been used to measure the distance to the Sombrero Galaxy.  

The first method relies on comparing the measured fluxes from planetary nebulae in the Sombrero Galaxy to the known luminosities of planetary nebulae in the Milky Way.  This method gave the distance to the Sombrero Galaxy as 29.0 ± 2.0 Mly (8.9 ± 0.6 Mpc).&lt;ref name=&quot;fordetal1996&quot;/&gt;  

The other method used is the surface brightness fluctuations method.  This method uses the grainy appearance of the galaxy's bulge to estimate the distance to it.  Nearby galaxy bulges will appear very grainy, while more distant  bulges will appear smooth.  Early measurements using this technique gave distances of 30.6 ± 1.3 Mly (9.4 ± 0.4 Mpc).&lt;ref name=&quot;ajharetal1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, after some refinement of the technique, a distance of 32 ± 3 Mly (9.8 ± 0.8 Mpc) was measured.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonryetal2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The average distance measured through these two techniques is 29.3 Mly (9.0 Mpc) with an uncertainty of 1.6 Mly (0.5 Mpc).{{Ref|B|b}}

==Nearby galaxies and galaxy group information==
The Sombrero Galaxy lies within a complex, filament-like cloud of galaxies that extends to the south of the Virgo Cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbg&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Hierarchical methods for identifying groups, which determine group membership by considering whether individual galaxies belong to a larger aggregate of galaxies, typically produce results showing that the Sombrero Galaxy is part of a group that includes NGC 4487, NGC 4504, NGC 4802, UGCA 289, and possibly a few other galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fouqueetal1992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''Messier 105''' (also known as ''M105'' and ''NGC 3379'') is an [[w:elliptical galaxy]]  in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Leo (constellation)|Leo]].  Messier 105 is known to have a [[w:supermassive black hole]].

==History==
Messier 105 was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] on 24 March [[w:1781]], just a few days after he discovered the nearby galaxies [[w:Messier 95]] and [[w:Messier 96]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jonesbook1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book

'''Messier 106''' (also known as ''[[w:New General Catalogue|NGC]] 4258'') is a [[w:spiral galaxy]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Canes Venatici]].  It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:1781]]. M106 is at a distance of about 22 to 25 million [[w:light-year]]s away from [[w:Earth]].  It is also a [[w:Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert II galaxy]], which means that due to [[w:x-ray]]s and unusual [[w:emission lines]] detected, it is suspected that part of the galaxy is falling into a [[w:supermassive black hole]] in the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;apod&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap000215.html | title = A spiral galaxy with a strange core }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:NGC 4217]] is a possible companion galaxy of Messier 106.&lt;ref name=&quot;simbad&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Characteristics==
M106 has a water vapor [[w:maser]] that is seen by the 22GHz line of ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O that evidences dense and warm molecular gas.  Water masers are useful to observe nuclear [[w:accretion disk]]s in [[w:active galaxies]].  M106 has a slightly warped, thin, almost edge-on [[w:Keplerian disk]] which is on a subparsec scale.  It surrounds a central area with mass four &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;[[w:Solar mass|M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Henkeletal2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''Globular Cluster M107''' (also known as '''[[w:Messier Object]] 107''' or '''NGC 6171''') is a very loose [[w:globular cluster]] in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ophiuchus]]. It was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in April [[w:1782]] and independently by [[w:William Herschel]] in [[w:1793]]. It wasn't until [[w:1947]] that [[w:Helen Sawyer Hogg]] added it and three other objects discovered by Méchain to the list of Messier objects.

M107 is close to the [[w:galactic plane]] at a distance of about 20,900 [[w:light-year]]s from [[w:Earth]]. There are 25 known [[w:variable star]]s in this cluster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is where all that knowledge is put to use.  Wilderness camping is different from &quot;camp ground&quot; camping and offers the Pathfinder many opportunities to practice group dynamics, responsibility, and build self-confidence.  A well-organized trip is a joy to experience, whereas an ill-organized one can be a seemingly unending series of mishaps and misery.

As the leader, it is important that you do not ''do'' all the ''doing''.  The other participants will feel that they are merely so much luggage and begin to act as if they have no responsibilities.  One of the most difficult lessons I have learned as a leader is that a leader should really step back and ''lead'' rather than jump in and ''do''.  When ''doing'' instead of ''leading'', it is too easy to become absorbed in the task at hand and lose track of the overall picture.  While you're busy doing, other people finish (or abandon) their tasks, and you're too busy to give them their next assignment.  Rather, you as the leader should ''direct'' the activities of the others.  Know what needs to be done next, and assign someone to do it.  If they are having trouble, help them, but do not take over.  If helping them becomes too involved, assign someone else to help them.  

A highly effective way of doing this is to make a set of cards describing each task that needs to be done when setting up (or breaking) camp.  Each task should be doable by a team of three or four kids with advice and guidance from an adult mentor.  Sort the tasks into groups by priority, so that the things that must be done first are in one group, the things that should be done second are in another, and things that should be done last are in the third group.  Label these groups A, B, and C.  The number of tasks in each group should be equal to the number of 3-5 person teams that will be camping with you.  Do not include pitching the sleeping tents in this list of tasks (more on that later).

Each card should also be marked with &quot;points&quot; to be awarded to the team who completes that task.  Difficult, lengthy, or unpleasant tasks should be worth many points.  Easy, quick, and fun tasks should be awarded few points.  

Before you leave for your trip, assemble the kids into teams and assign to each team and adult mentor.  Each team should have a mix of kids - some who are experienced or skilled, and some who are inexperienced or have not yet developed camping skills.  

Choose the teams wisely.  Best friends have a tendency to goof off.  When I was a teen, my brother and I had been hired by an uncle to do some farm work.  When we suggested that he should also hire our other brother, he responded with this gem that I will never forget:

:''&quot;A boy's a boy, two boys are half a boy, and three boys is no boy at all.&quot;''  

I understand that far better now than I did when he said it.  Knowing about this tendency will enable you to head it off so you don't have to work against it.  Assign juniors to teens, and assign teens to adult mentors.  Go over this with the teens ahead of time so that they will have an idea of what they are to teach the juniors to do ''as they do it.''  This will not only introduce the juniors to new knowledge, but it will reinforce it in your teens.

When you arrive at your camp site, instruct all Pathfinders to pitch the tents they will sleep in, and then stow their sleeping bags and personal gear in them.  When they are finished with that, have them assemble near the remaining equipment.  As soon as a complete team has finished pitching their tents and stowing their gear, they may choose one of the A tasks.  When they finish their A task to their mentor's satisfaction, they may choose a B task.  When they finish their B task, they may choose a C task.  When they finish their C task, they may choose another C task if one is available (and thereby improve  their point total).

Be sure to let your Pathfinders know how the points will be used ahead of time, otherwise they will not serve as an effective incentive.  You could award the team with the highest number of points the privilege of being dismissed to eat first, followed by the team with the second highest number of points, etc.  Console the team scoring the fewest number of points by reminding them that the staff actually eats last.  

When we implemented this plan in my club we found that it made a remarkable difference in getting the kids motivated and focused on setting up the camp site.  Instead of finding kids to do the tasks I was coming up with on the spot, the kids were coming to me for their assignments.  Instead of goofing around and doing a poor job, they were executing their duties with enthusiasm and efficiency, and upon completion, they were eager to take on the next task.

To give you an idea of what tasks might be described on the cards, the tasks we used are listed below.  Though the tasks below are suited more for &quot;Campground camping&quot; rather than &quot;wilderness camping&quot;, they still give a general picture of what is to be done.  Not all of these tasks are required at every camp out.
{|border=1 align=center cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1

| Pitch dining shelter&lt;br&gt;10 points

|}
#{{note|hygiene_stations}} Hygiene stations include the dish washing station, trash receptacle (lined with a trash bag), and possibly a hand washing station.
#{{note|prepare_dishes}} &quot;Prepare dishes&quot; includes hanging a dish line, pinning mesh bags to it (in numerical order), and sorting all the eating utensils &amp; dishes into the mesh bags.
#{{note|fetch_water}} Points awarded for fetching water depend on how far away the water is and how much is needed.
#{{note|totes}}&quot;Put totes in kitchen&quot; means the tubs of food, coolers, and kitchen gear (other than camp stoves and lanterns).  Note that only the food needed for the first meal should be put in the kitchen unless it can be secured against invasion by &quot;critters.&quot;  Otherwise it is best to leave it in a vehicle, equipment trailer, or placed in a bear box.
#{{note|propane_equipment}} Propane equipment includes the camp stove(s) and lanterns.
#{{note|gather_firewood}} Points awarded for gathering firewood depend on the difficulty of the task.  The task might entail nothing more than buying some at the camp store, unloading it from a trailer or vehicle, or gathering it from the woods (if permitted).
#{{note|build_fire_ring}} It might not be necessary to build a fire ring, in which case this task should be omitted from the deck.

Once you are happy with the cards you have come up with for your club, laminate them so that they can be reused in the future.

'''Messier 109''' (also known as ''NGC 3992'') is a [[w:barred spiral galaxy]] approximately [[w:1 E23 m|46 million]] [[w:light-year]]s away&lt;ref name=&quot;AnA&quot; /&gt; in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ursa Major]].  M109 can be seen southeast of the star [[w:Gamma Ursae Majoris|Phecda]] (γ UMa).

== History ==
Messier 109 was discovered by [[w:Pierre Méchain]] in [[w:1781]]. In [[w:1783]] [[w:Charles Messier]] catalogued NGC 3992 as his 109th [[w:Messier object|object]].

Between the 1920s through the 1950s, it was considered that Messier objects over 103 were not official, but in later years the additions became more widely accepted.  [[w:David H. Levy]] mentions the modern 110 object catalog while [[w:Sir Patrick Moore]] gave the original to 104 but has M105-M109 listed as an addendum.  By the late 1970s all 110 objects are commonly used among astronomers as they still are today.

== General information ==
In March of [[w:1956]], [[w:supernova]] 1956A was observed in M109.  SN 1956A was a type Ia [[w:supernova]] in the southeast part of the galaxy, glowing at magnitude 12.8 to 12.3 at its maximum.  SN 1956A was the only supernova observed in M109 since its discovery.

M109 has three [[w:satellite galaxies]] ([[w:UGC 6923]], [[w:UGC 6940]] and [[w:UGC 6969]]) and possibly might have more. Detailed [[w:hydrogen line]] observations have been obtained from M109 and its satellites.  M109's [[w:H I region|H I distribution]] is regular with a low level radial extension outside the stellar disc, while at exactly the region of the bar, there is a central H I hole in the gas distribution.  Possibly the gas has been transported inwards by the bar because of the emptiness of the hole no large accretion events can have happened in the recent past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Environment==
M109 is the brightest galaxy in the [[w:M109 Group]], a large [[w:group of galaxies]] located in the [[w:constellation]] [[w:Ursa Major (constellation)|Ursa Major]] that may contain over 50 galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbg&quot;&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Free/Open Source Software and Learning Management and Course Management Systems'''==
The terms &quot;free software&quot; and &quot;open source software&quot; are often used interchangeably as are the terms &quot;learning management system,&quot; &quot;course management system,&quot; and &quot;content management system.&quot; However there are fine distinctions between each. In order to address your organization's software needs, it is important to understand these distinctions.

=== '''Free Software''' ===
The Free Software Movement focuses on moral and ethical issues related to the freedom of users to use, study, modify and redistribute software (Tong, 2004, p.1). Here the term &quot;free&quot; reflects the ''freedom'' to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. It is not simply a reflection of price (Free Software Foundation, n.d.).  [http://www.fsf.org/ The Free Software Foundation] lists four conditions necessary to meet the &quot;free software&quot; designation. These are:

* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor. 
* The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
:(Free Software Foundation, n.d.) 

Video: [http://www.gnu.org/fry/ Stephen Fry explains the value of Free Software] and contrasts it with the &quot;kind of tyranny&quot; imposed by proprietary software (GNU, 2008).

=== '''Open Source Software''' ===
Open Source Software is an approach to the design, development, and distribution of software; it focuses on practical accessibility to the software's source code. (&quot;Open Source,&quot; 2009). 

Open source software is often distributed for free. However vendors can charge for their versions of open software and for technical support. The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) further clarifies that &quot;open source software is different from &quot;public domain&quot; whose copyright is held by the public and &quot;freeware&quot; or &quot;shareware&quot; which are applications that are distributed in some form for free but whose source code is held by the author and cannot be freely changed or redistributed&quot; (CoSN, n.d.). 

The benefit of open source development is distributed peer review and transparency of process. The Open Source Initiative (2007) points to the promise of open source as &quot;better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.&quot; 

In terms of development practices free software and open source software are similar in that they invite open peer review, and source code transparency and access. However, according to Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Movement, the critical difference is a philosophical one: &quot;The Free Software Movement is a social movement for computer users' freedom. The Open Source philosophy cites practical, economic benefits&quot; (Perens, n.d.). 

Essentially, the difference boils down to: &quot;Free Software is superior because it's Free. Open Source software will become superior because the development is Open&quot; (Chisnall, 2007).

What does this philosophical difference between &quot;free software&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; mean to the educational community? The free software movement argues that people should not support proprietary software since it philosophically prohibits freedoms. 

=== '''How Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) benefits the educational community''' ===

All would likely agree: we need to prepare students for success in the global economy of the 21st century, a period marked by rapid changes in technology and information access. How can the use of free and open source software in schools support this goal?

For one, while students may need to learn how to use word processors to communicate and spreadsheets to explore and expand on data and applications, is it necessary to teach these skills via proprietary applications when free software with the same functionality is available? Do schools teach students and by extension families to standardize to proprietary products, many that may be too costly for home purchase? By adopting the use of FOSS in schools, educators can support students in developing technical skills that transcend the particular idiosyncrasies of the applications (Pfaffman, 2007, p. 40). Further, since there are no license restrictions with FOSS software, all machines (in school and at home) can have the same version of the program and there is no need to purchase additional licenses for new machines or pay for software upgrades. FOSS licenses also guarantee that the software will be freely available forever; users are not limited to free versions of proprietary applications that offer fewer features or limited use (Pfaffman, 2007, p. 40). Two popular examples of FOSS software include Firefox and OpenOffice.org. Both applications were based on commercial code that was subsequently released as open source (Pfaffman, 2007, p. 39). 

The United Nation's International Open Source Network (IOSN) advocates FOSS for education for its: 

* lower costs,
* reliability, performance and security,
* building of long-term capacity,
* open philosophy,
* encouragement of innovation,
* alternative to illegal copying,
* possibility of localization, and
* learning from source code.
:(Tong, 2004, p. 3)

The IOSN acknowledges that while initial cost of FOSS and upgrades is negligible, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) which includes maintenance, support, and training should be considered. However in various IOSN comparisons the TCO for FOSS is still lower than that for proprietary software (Tong, 2004, p. 10). The savings realized by using FOSS over proprietary software can be put to &quot;better purposes such as buying more computers, providing training for administrative and academic staff or developing non-ICT related infrastructure for the institution‚&quot; (Tong, 2004, p. 10).

&quot;In some situations, the availability of funds or lack of it is such that it is not a choice between proprietary software and FOSS but a choice between FOSS and nothing. By using inexpensive or donated hardware with FOSS, some institutions may be able to provide computing facilities to their students that would otherwise be impossible‚&quot; (Tong, 2004, p. 10).

From a pedagogical standpoint, educators are increasingly promoting collaboration and authorship. In an open source model, &quot;students and teachers are learning to work collaboratively within a global community toward the end of improving a product for the good of all&quot; (Guhlin, 2008). FOSS fosters innovation, critical thinking, and the development of 21st century skills. Educators will need to form and refine their own attitudes toward technology and change, if they are to model them for students.

The Consortium for School Networking asks district technology leaders to consider these benefits of open technologies for K-12 school: 

* '''Cost: License Fees and TCO:''' Licensing and purchasing costs for proprietary technologies often limit the scope of use in educational settings. Open technologies, often blended with proprietary technologies, may provide a means for the use of technology in a more ubiquitous fashion for students and teachers by leveraging the funding available.

* '''Data integrity/interoperability:''' Data interoperability through open standards increases the efficiency of systems through the use of common data elements and ensures greater data integrity. These open standards assist in both proprietary and open source applications working well together in a blended technology environment.

* '''Independence and Flexibility:''' Because the source code is open, advanced users can deeply customize applications and operating systems to their environment. This opens the door to innovation which is in turned shared with others. Upgrades are voluntary, so users are not locked into continuing maintenance fees or enforced obsolescence.

* '''Stability and Reliability:''' There is high confidence that open source software will have a viable future because so many people are independently vested in it. It is stable because so many skilled developers are working on it and testing it in many different environments. Open source operating system users report that their systems are more reliable, offer greater performance, are easier to manage, and provide better support.

* '''Broader Access to Information:''' Huge libraries of content are being assembled by organizations, agencies and individuals. Search engines make this quickly available at the point of instruction.

* '''Community Support:''' Content management systems make it easy to build attractive informational sites to communicate to the public. An informed community in turn supports schools.

* '''Engage Students in Collaboration:''' It's well documented that our students live in a world characterized by collaboration. They expect to be part of a larger community in the creation of knowledge, not just sharing, but actively contributing to the end result, whether it's the area of music, research or literature. The use of open technologies in education reinforces that view of the world and encourages students and teachers to be active members of the global community typically involved in the creation of these technologies.

== '''Learning Management, Course Management, and Content Management Systems''' ==

Learning management systems, course management systems, and content managements are server-based systems that are designed to manage learning content and learner interactions. To varying extents they enable an online learning environment with public or private access, areas for collaboration, asynchronous discussion, email, archives and storage, and submission and publication of user-generated content. Some provide data management such as attendance, enrollment, class schedules, mastery progress, assessment, and reporting. Most empower school administrators, faculty, and students to post, publish, and manage content directly without the need for programming skills, thus providing these constituents with anywhere/anytime access to a learning environment. These systems can support collaborative learning inside and outside of the school in order to extend the learning environment to the home and further involve parents (Watson &amp; Watson, 2007). Though the terms ‚&quot;learning management system,&quot; &quot;course management system,&quot; and &quot;content management system&quot; are often used interchangeably. They each have their specific focus as noted below. 

=== '''Learning Management Systems (LMS)''' ===

Learning Management Systems focus on the logistics of managing learners, learning activities, and the competency mapping of an organization (Watson &amp; Watson, 2007). The LMS manages the learning process as a whole and provides an infrastructure for delivering and managing instructional content, assessing individual and organizational learning goals, tracking progress towards those goals, and collecting and presenting data (Watson &amp; Watson, 2007). Essentially, the LMS delivers content but also handles course registration and administration, skills gap analysis, tracking and reporting.

=== '''Course Management Systems (CMS)''' ===

Course Management systems support the placement of course materials online, &quot;associating students with courses, tracking student performance, storing student submissions and mediating communication between the students as well as their instructor&quot; (Watson &amp; Watson, 2007). LMS also contain many of these functions; however, LMS are not limited to CMS functionality. A CMS provides educators with a framework, templates, and tools to create course content and to manage discussion and interactions with students within the course, without the need for programming skills (Watson &amp; Watson, 2007).

Common features of most CMS include areas for content, asychronous discussion boards, chat rooms, assignment drop boxes, quizzes, rosters, surveys, and an area for students and teachers to set-up their own templated homepages. Students and teachers are able to share resources, collaborate, participate in forums, take online tests, access grades, and upload assignments (Ioannou &amp; Hannafin, 2008, p. 46). CMS support student-teacher communication and collaboration. However, they do not have all of the administrative functions that an organization-wide learning management system would such as tracking school attendance, total enrollment, and customized organizational reporting.

=== '''Content Management Systems or Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS)''' ===

Content management systems enable web content development. With the LCMS the content is separated from the design and programming of the site; thus CMS software makes it easy to manage content without web design or programming skills (Farkas, 2008). The LCMS is a multi-user environment where developers may create, store, reuse, manage, and deliver digital learning content from a central object repository (&quot;Learning Content Management System,&quot; 2009). The LCMS allows anyone to take on the role of webmaster and thus allow educators or students to distribute the responsibility for updating web content (Watson &amp; Watson, 2007).

A LCMS allows an individual or a community of users to easily publish, manage and organize a wide variety of content on a website including: blogs, wikis, resource directories, collaborative authoring environments, picture galleries, podcasts, video sharing, discussion forums, content syndication, and news aggregation (drupal.org). Like LMS and CMS, the LCMS also features role-based permissions for users.

== '''Considerations when adopting a Free/Open Source LMS, CMS, or LCMS''' ==

Guhlin (2007) offers the following tips when considering a move to open source technologies.

'''Eight Steps to a Smooth Transition'''
# Convene a committee representative of teachers, administrators, and office staff and share the problem with them.
# The problem: We're spending a lot of money on software licenses. Let's brainstorm some solutions that lower that total cost. Get buy-in on beginning with a familiar basic application open source tool, such as OpenOffice, which can be easily shared and includes a [http://www.openclipart.org/ clipart library]. 
# Prioritize the different solutions. Thoroughly evaluate each solution in a test situation so that the committee is aware of why something works or doesn't. Have the members keep a blog or journal of what they experiencing. 
# Survey all stakeholders. Focus on function and need rather than product. This will give you the data you need to make decisions on the best solutions. 
# Maintain regular communication. Via newsletters and a Web page, disseminate committee findings and keep stakeholders abreast over time of funds saved and how they've been redirected to worthy projects that directly impact students, teachers, and community.
# Immediately create quick reference cards for the open source solutions you choose. Also train your help desk. You can turn to OpenOffice textbooks as well as Web site resources. 
# Make the transition across several campuses, setting up training and offering to do on-site demonstrations for teachers. Also setup a FAQ page online to help train everyone. 
# When you announce the decision, make CDs of the software available for people who do not have a high-speed Internet connection at home, including parents of district students. Offer to give those away at the cost of the media/duplication.
:(Guhlen, 2007) 


Video: Instructional Designer [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=330k7eiZT6g Matt Bodek discusses the reasons why he selected an open source CMS] (Drupal) to develop course sites (Bodek, 2009).

Technologies can &quot;change people's understandings of what they can do, what they want to do, what they think they need to do&quot; (Burbules &amp; Callister, 2000, p. 33). 

'''Ali Jafari models a comprehensive &quot;Next-Generation E-Learning Environment&quot;''' (Jafari, 2006).

In planning for new learning environments, educators should examine their needs, wishlists, and also the affordances of the technologies. Are they static and instructive, allowing for fixed representations and one-way transmission of information? Or are they more collaborative and productive, allowing more flexible, multimodal representations that can be modified and shared (Bower, 2008)?

[[Using Wikibooks]] can be helpful in learning more about conventions. When creating new pages, please be sure that they conform to Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]].  Doing so makes navigation within and addition to a book easier for other contributors.  Please move the page so that it begins with &quot;XQuery&quot; and link it from the book.

==Welcome!==
[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* A personal user page and [[Help:talk page|talk page]].
* The ability to [[Help:Preferences|customize]] certain aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* The ability to rename pages.
* The eligibility to become an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]]. Be sure to sign your talk page comments with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

==Welcome!==
[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* A personal user page and [[Help:talk page|talk page]].
* The ability to [[Help:Preferences|customize]] certain aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* The ability to rename pages.
* The eligibility to become an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]]. Be sure to sign your talk page comments with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

== proposal for better PDF/PS versions ==

A suggestion: include the graphics, and run the wiki pages through a filter and then through LaTeX to produce a usable output with a senseful contents/chapter section.  If one prints the current PDFs, they look crude and awful, especially on a 1000dpi laser printer.

:Sounds like a nice idea, however, I think it would be better to wait until at least a whole section is at least at &quot;developed text&quot; stage in all of its sections (if not 100% complete) to convert to LaTeX and then to PDF. As long as there's sparse text or sections under construction, I don't think it's worth it to print the book, in my humble opinion.

== Link to this book! ==

Hey just a quick suggestion!!
I know a lot of you out there who read and write this book also have websites that utilize your art. If you do, then you know there are probably a lot of people out there who admire your work and want to know how to make cool 3D stuff too. In that case, make sure at the end of your webpages to put a link back to Blender 3D: Noob to Pro, and we will have more students then ever learning off this book!
-Thanks for the time!

== Overhaul Proposal ==

The Noob to Pro tutorials right now are effective, but they could be more so. 
Some changes that could be made are:
- Make each small tutorial relate to the others, culminating in a completed scene. For example, the tutorial &quot;How to model a goblet&quot; could be followed by &quot;how to model a Plate&quot; both tutorials effectively cover different topics, and at the end of the modeling tutorials, the reader can be taught to light and animate the scene. Having a completed scene that the reader can show off has the potential of being much more rewarding and encouraging than having, say, a skyscraper, a goblet, and a simple person that all look unfinished and wildly out of place on Blender's default blue background. 
Just a thought, I would be interested to hear other people's thoughts on this idea.


== wrong link ==

I think this link is wrong -&gt; Game Editing: Rendering an AO for Terrain

Can someone fix it please? Thanks!

== how to rotate the model from x-y to x-z ==

In the manul Noob to Rro, I want to add a hat to the people as the book wrote. To do that, it needs to rotate the hat or people, e.g, from the x-y to x-z.

== Updating PDF ==

Hi, Can someone update the PDF file, or at least explain how to do so?--[[User:OsamaK|OsamaK]] ([[User talk:OsamaK|talk]]) 14:50, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

== Book title name change proposal. ==
Hello all, I am proposing that the title of this book be modified to read with a more professional sounding, more classy sounding title. my proposal would mean that the name would be '''&quot;Blender 3D: From beginner to professional&quot;''' Please state whether you agree or disagree below, and your reasons for doing so, below. Depending on response, I will leave it or re-title the book within a month. i.e. after the 20th January 2009. Cheers.--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] ([[User talk:Read-write-services|talk]]) 01:08, 19 December 2008 (UTC)
:I just noticed this as I was typing up my response below. There was no notice, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{moveto|Blender 3D - From beginner to professional}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, placed on the front / welcome page of the book to get the attention of other editors. If your fully for a rename, I'd do that and set another 30 day or so cut-off before deciding on renaming the book.  --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 05:25, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

===Pro &lt;u&gt;Novice to Professional&lt;/u&gt;===
:Can you drop the colon ? To ''&quot;Blender 3D - From beginner to professional&quot;''', take a look also in [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and it's talk page and in the proposal [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] and the active discussion on its talk page [[Wikibooks talk:Manual of Style]]. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:26, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

::Yea dropping the colon would be fine, I am ''way'' more concerned about the calling of people &quot;Noobs&quot; an American slang term that is in fact used in a derogative fashion around the Wiki to describe people who have &quot;no real clue&quot; how to do something (Newbie). I think that Blender is bordering on the point of professional quality software that to associate the term Noob/Newbie to its tutorial booklet, makes it sound incredibly cheap and nasty.--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] ([[User talk:Read-write-services|talk]]) 03:07, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

===Pro &lt;u&gt;The Blender 3D Cookbook&lt;/u&gt;===
:After further investigation, I do not find my original suggestion &quot;Learning Blender 3D&quot; or the current name &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro&quot; to really match the contents of this book.  It seems that although this may have started out as roughly a single tutorial on learning Blender, that original work was never completed (nor will it likely be without a significant rewrite of the contents).  Instead, this book became a collection of mostly unrelated, self contained tutorials on using Blender 3D that do not build upon each other.  This makes it fairly difficult to impossible to go from having no knowledge of the program to being an expert using only the resources here (from start to finish) as the name implies.  --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 15:59, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

===Pro &lt;u&gt;Noob-To-Pro&lt;/u&gt;===
:Now I disagree with this name change. I believe it is okay for this book to be titled &quot;Noob to Pro&quot;. I actually prefer the name over &quot;Novice To Professional&quot;. This book isn't made by suits and programmers, it is made by the average aspiring student. &quot;Noob to Pro&quot; is more casual, more friendly, more inviting, and it also gives the book personality and uniqueness. The name sticks in the minds of those who wish to visit again. Just because it is an American derogatory slang term does not mean we should change it. There is no reason why us web users have to conform to political corrections, we are unique individuals!

== Proposal: Need Some Cleanup ==
Hello all, I believe the &quot;beginner&quot; tutorials section of this book needs major cleanup--many tutorials I have recently checked out do NOT seem that beginner....and some are not even that clear. Also, authors of pages should really start adding their name at the bottom of the page, so instead of blindly cutting, moving, or editing someones page, we can ask them to or ask permission for such a thing. I think this is important for the book. Thank You!--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 21:52, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
:I don't see the need for asking for permission of the authors to make minor changes as everyone who creates or edits a page on wikibooks has (knowingly or not) agreed to this clause &quot;''Please note that all contributions to Wikibooks are considered to be released under the GNU Free Documentation Licence (see [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for details). If you don't want your writing to be '''edited mercilessly and redistributed at will''', then don't submit it here.''&quot;  Although, if you are going to make any major changes to a project, it's a good practice to add an entry to the article(s) talk page first for discussion and possibly place a notice on the page itself (at the top) regarding what you plan on changing. If it's something not too big like moving a section, I'd say wait at least 5~7 days after placing the notice to allow other editors time to share their opinions before carrying out the action.  For major edits (renaming the book / deleting a module), I'd say wait at least month or more before deciding on the action. I'd also recommend having a look at the wikibook guidelines: [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] and [[Wikibooks:Decision_making]].
:As for authors leaving their names on the page, this really is not necessary at all since the page history will show all past contributors and what they changed. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 05:13, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

::There exist not consistent model to make changes on a work, but if the work is being worked on it is polite to ask before making any &quot;real&quot; change (definition of major is very open), but there is no obligation to do that, in the past there has been several edit conflicts because of this existence of pecking order, personally I've been involved on the two sides of the problem and still say that the best approach is just to use common sense (but even that may fail). The [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] does improve on things and validates any future objection to a bold edit, so out of the blue edits that doesn't conform to the structure or &quot;flow&quot; of the book can be easily fixed.
::As for the authors pages, I don't agree with you, especially if you are putting any editor in the same bag. More problematic  yet is the inconsistency of history logs and how difficult it would be to make it relevant to establish authorship in a datamining of that resource. This is not the same as in Wikipedia were we would be talking about single page articles...
::Another problem is that the GFDL requires that for &quot;...in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License&quot;, this is needed also to give attributions to any other work, like mentioning that content was taken from Wikipedia or any other source (with a compatible license or authorization), this the history log can't substitute.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:27, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

== Request book be split apart ==
Although it appears that this project might have started out as a book itself on learning how to use Blender 3D, it's obvious that at some point it was mistaken for a category on all things Blender 3D.  The contents of several other books that were intended to be separate from this project were at some point were added into it.  The original book starts out fairly well written and easier to understand, but breaks off completely from the previous subject matter only a few chapters in.  Most of the modules from the &quot;Creating Models With Photo Assistance&quot; area forward have no relation at all to one another besides being about using Blender in one fashion or another.  --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 16:20, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

:Are you talking about 2 (or more) independent books or a better distribution across chapters ?
:What is the benefit of multiple books if only to cover the same subject matter and have dependencies on each other, if possible the content should be kept together unless you can propose a self contained and specific scope. You can also go beyond chapters and use volumes to keep it on the same namespace and closely connected (as in referencing content on other sections)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:03, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

: This might well be just due to the fact that the original authors ran out of steam and later editors added their patchwork of content later on. I'm not clear what you want to split up. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:17, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

::My reason for splitting this project is that it isn't a book to begin with.  Only the first few chapters belong to the same book, after that it's a collection of separate books jammed together with little or no correlation at all.  The problem I have with this is that the modules are linked together (next chapter / previous chapter) as if they were part of one book, even though they're not.  I noticed this myself when I was going through to try and cleanup up some broken links between the early chapters only to discover that I couldn't as there was no order to them.  With most of the modules not building on each other at all, leaving them linked together as though they do will likely frustrate new users trying to learn the program.  There was an obvious confusion between the earlier editors as to whether this project was going to be a category, a book, or a list of tutorials; several of the &quot;modules&quot; are not even under the same namespace.
::My proposal would be to either:
::*break up the contents into a collection of separate minibooks and list them all under the existing [[:Category:Blender 3D]] in appropriate subcategories
::*rename the book to something like &quot;Blender 3D Tutorials&quot; and have the modules link back to tutorial indexes sorted by difficulty (ie:&quot;back to beginner tutorials list&quot; instead of &quot;next chapter&quot;)  --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 18:53, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

:::I have only done sporadic edits to the book. On the other hand you have consistently been working on it for some time, and you seem to be requiring a structural reshaping to enable you to continue contributing to the work. I would dislike to see adopted a solution that would move content out of the namespace and as I stated some time ago agree that the book needs a rename.
:::I still have some difficulty to understand why you call it minibooks or talk of splitting the content across several books as it is the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book is mostly a collection of guides or tutorials except for the first &quot;pages&quot; on the toc that explain the basic on how to use the software, some of the tutorials are indeed specific on the nature of the examples they use to explain concepts of 3D editing and on using the software but they clearly wouldn't alone be a sufficient subject matter for an independent book.
:::I've had similar structural problems in merging books before (or reshaping them), there is a need of a flow and to create specific purposes, so to give a focus to the readers and enable them to fallow the text, and I agree that this seems to be lost in how the book has been evolving from very self contained tutorials (but that enables also easy consultation), maintaining a balance of the two would be difficult since the software is complex and 3D editing needs some extensive background information.
:::If you really want to drop the concept of tutorials to adopt a more technical approach the best option is to start from the beginning and reshape the TOC slowly, you have to consider that past contributors seemed to prefer the very specific and self contained approach (IIRC I think some of the tutorials were moved/adopted from personal pages), if you can't live with the tutorial structure you probably should start a new book with more distinct and systematic approach to the subject. Try to state not what is wrong with the actual book, but what you would like to reshape it into, and see if someone opposes that (7 days for each step is considered enough if stated on your proposals) take a step at a time, the easier and obvious first step would be a rename. The renaming has already been talked about and I don't recall any objection to it, this would also require a  renaming of all pages so I think you should start there. Propose you new name (or see the options already talked about and give a time to select one of them) and decide what to do from there...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:49, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

::::I can see your concerns, so for now I'd like to at least make it obvious as to what this book is, not an all-in-one-how-to, but a collection of different tutorials and manuals. My proposals:
::::*Add a notice to the main page stating the above, allowing new readers to better understand the what they're getting into
::::*Remove most of the chapter style links connecting unrelated tutorials and instead list the tutorials by subject matter (similar to [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List|this]])

::: The current wording on the main page seems to indicate that these were intended to take a specific linear approach to introducing concepts one-by-one, with each tutorial using only concepts used in the previous ones. If that is no longer the case, you'll have to decide whether to push it back to that mold, or change the approach into more of a cook- or a handbook.
::: I'd recommend keeping this in one book, though the [[Subject:Blender 3D]] page could also be used to rank and annotate list of tutuorials.
::: While the automatically generated links to parent pages are useful, they don't make any extra navigational aids redundant. Specifically, links to related content that helps readers locate tutorials that explain topics which the current one assumes knowledge of (for that purpose I created {{tlx|Japanese related}} for the [[Japanese]] wikibook). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:39, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: The problem with the book is that although the first editor(s) may have wanted a linear path, it wasn't followed through on.  I looked over the book's history and there was no linear path in the way the content was added. Editors would work on one tutorial or section of tutorials and move onto another, but didn't put enough effort into linking the different parts together (or even finishing every section) and the book quickly became a patchwork of random tutorials.  
:::: For this reason, I don't think trying to remold this book into an all-in-one is doable anymore, as most of the content would have to be rewritten.  Making it a collection instead would be much more doable, I don't have much experience making templates, although navigational aids would definitely be useful.  I like your choice of wording as well, &quot;'''The Blender 3D Cookbook'''&quot; has a very nice sound to it. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 12:37, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: Well, if you guys reckon the best thing for this book is to make it a collection, illustrating concepts &amp;mdash; rather than a linear whole with each tutorial introducing a new tool &amp;mdash; then I guess you should remodel the book. It might be worth while digging up the version that got the &quot;featured book&quot; status to see what the state was then.
::::: With deciding where to take this book, a recruiting message like I mentioned could be useful. While it's easier in some ways to work on one's own, company to double-check ones actions and help brainstorm is increadibly useful. The [[Japanese]] wikibook only has a couple of contributors, but each of us would have made plenty of mistakes on our own.
::::: Templates are simple beasts. You can have a look at some at [[Wikibooks:Template messages]] which [[User:Darklama]] and I are rewriting (comments appreciated), ask in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance|technical assistance reading room]] or just ask someone you reckon migth be able to help. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:18, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::: I couldn't find when this book became featured, but it was &quot;book of the month&quot; for July 2005 (thanks archive.org).  I'll have to complement [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]], [[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]], and the other editors who worked on starting this book, it seems that despite a rough start, they were able to meet their goal (at least partially) of making this book an all-in-one howto.  The  beginner tutorials section in the July 2005 edition was actually fairly easy to follow along with, so it seems the problem with this book was more that contents were added to it without enough moderation towards keeping the intended structure. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 13:55, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

== General thoughts about this book ==

The task of making this book to something that it claims - be a linear guide of tutorials building upon each other, is nearly undoable. 
* It would require that each author would have read all previous tutorials. 
* The beginning tutorials should be complete and well written. 
* The structure of this book has to be static and would not allow for any changes.
* A version change would require an update of the whole book.
* There would be the need for a general editor who takes care of the above things. 

The book is not to bad though at the moment, in my opinion there are a few things that are not so good (but could be handled with some effort):
* The beginning chapters are not complete. Some are very sparse and pretty much unusable in fact.
* The continuous linking between tutorials should only be kept where the tutorials are based on each other. 
* There are no statements of the used blender version, this will hit a user hard if shortcuts are changed (not to speak of UV mapping, particles, the animation system, the interface...).

My proposal is:
* Keep the pages in one book.
* Leave the name of the book as it is, because it is a well known brand.
* Create a beginning section with a continuous sequence of tutorials.
* Arrange the other tutorials in appropriate subsections but keep them as independently as possible.
* Add a version note to each tutorial.
* Create a to do list.
* Care about the versioning of the images.

:I don't think a name change is that impossible, a redirect page as well as a summary on the new book should take care of those unfamiliar with a different name.  The name's not a big issue for me though, I don't agree with keeping the name, but that's just my opinion.  
:I agree with all the other points you suggested.  With all the changes that have been suggested, a whole &quot;TODO&quot; page for the book might helpful.

::: I don't know, that's more involved then I'd like to get and I don't have an account there either, but if you want to bring up this conversation there, go ahead.  I don't really want to rewrite this book, just restructure it somewhat so it's easier for readers to follow.

:::: My apologies, but I think I'm gonna call it quits with contributing to the restructuring idea.  I spent an evening skimming from page to page to make sure all the sections I found were at least linked and listed on one page. That sounds like a simple task, but after several hours of work I didn't even get through half the book, I kept running into very broken or very incomplete pages.  If that weren't bad enough, the other problem I found was most of the images in this book would have to be recreated and reuploaded.  Many of the originals were deleted for not including licensing info and maybe half or so of the ones remaining are the same and will likely end up being deleted as well.  While it's true that there are some great tutorials in the book, they seem to be in the minority, buried inside a WIP with the original authors not likely returning.  Too summarize, I believe that in order to make this book really useful on it's own, there would be no recourse short of rewriting most of the sections (many from scratch) or heavily fragmenting the contents to highlight the completed tutorials. I have come to an impasse, fragmenting the book is possible, but seems to universally opposed and rewritting most of the book is beyond my capabilities as I'm learning the program myself.  --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 06:17, 27 February 2009 (UTC)
::::: I'm working on the German wikibook for three years now, and I know it's not finished, and not perfect. A task like making this book to a good one will take long time, but you can do small steps - one after the other.

::Look the great part about this book is you don't need a degree in Graphic Design to add to it. Of course, because the general population is able to add content to this book, not everyone is going to be completely aware of formatting structure guidelines that should be followed in general and will simply add their content. This should not !NOT! be discouraged in the least, and because a couple &lt;u&gt;authors&lt;/u&gt; (not everyone who adds content, only a couple regular editors with issues) have an issue with the formatting enough to revamp the entire book. Now he makes some good points, NullPoint, but it seems to be lost on him and the others who protest that this book is meant to be for regular people!!! We who edit regularly enjoy the formatting, but those who just wish to add their one time know-how about Blender do not pay as much attention to formatting. If we start breaking things up into redirects and seperate books and navigation, it will off-put the general popuation from contributing to this book, leading to a drop in edits, additions, and while us regular editors will still add content when we learn more, we NEED the additions of the general people to keep different perspectives, different ideas, and different minds in this book. What we regular editors can do is simply move things that are out of place into the right section, help keep the grammar and spelling looking nice, add an indent here or there as asthetics would appreciate, and maybe suggest people to add something here or here. But the best thing about this book is that in the first page, you can go anywhere you need to very easily because it is all laid out there in that chapter column. --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]])

::Oh, and about the renaming issue.....not to be rude, but people need to get over the fact that it is American Slang, and get over the fact that &quot;not everyone might get the reference of NOOB&quot;. Face it--people know this book better because of the name. It's simple and easy to remember, but it stcks in the mind. SO WHAT if it is American slang, it was made by an American!!!!! If it was made by an Aussie or a Frenchman, they can use whatever slang their country adopted, and could tell us Americans to get over because we should! And face it, if you are going to be intelligent enough to figure out a program like Blender, but you can't understand what &quot;Noob&quot; means by the phonetical similarities to Newbie? Maybe Blender might be a little too advanced for you then. Am I the only one who feels this way? Must everything be Generic or can we have SOME originality and personality? I thought the kind of people who used Blender were true Individuals and wanted to created individual projects? Anywyas, that's my opinion, I apologize about the inflammatory end.--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]])

Hey this book is badly structured! It says learn to model but its contents are: &quot;modeling a simple person&quot;, &quot;modeling a silver goblet&quot;. That is not really teaching how to model. They are too specific to be helpful in general.

What really needed is something that is general, a article/tutorial or set of article/tutorial that will enable you to know how to model anything, not specific objects. Say: start with something somewhat generic like modeling a human head, then along down there will be adding more specific modeling of heads like modeling a woman's head or a man's head an elderly head or humanoid (aliens maybe) head. The general head will give the reader the &quot;basic skills&quot; in modeling a head while the more specific ones will give the reader the skills in how to cope with the modeling problems encountered in modeling specific heads.

Noob modelers like me need to see the whole thing first before diving into specific difficulties encountered when modeling specific objects.

: Well, the &quot;more general ways&quot; could also be a &quot;learn-by-example&quot; approach, they are not exclusive. What I mean is to write an article that teach you basic skills of modeling (could be by &quot;learn-by-example&quot; approach) and then gradually teach you additional skills that would help you cope with more specific problems of modeling. Its like mathematics at school; you had to learn your numbers first before doing your arithmetics, and learn your arithmetics before doing your algebras, and learn your algebras before doing your calculus. Of course you could skip and still learn but that would be more difficult. I for once did, I studied with my big brothers calculus book when I was a grade six elementary pupil.

::Here are my own thoughts on the matter:

::1. '''The mission statement needs to be redefined.''' It's somewhat lacking in direction. I don't know what it should be, but if the name of the book is Blender 3D: Noob to Pro, that's what the book should deliver. A comprehensive tutorial which will take a person who knows nothing about Blender or 3D modeling and animation from total ignorance to a level of skill and comprehension which would be considered professional by peers in his or her field. (Unless by 'pro' we just mean a Blender power-user; but there is absolutely no reason why this book couldn't become a resource for professional digital artists to share their trade secrets if the infrastructure and general quality of the book are already in place.) There is no reason to duplicate the work being done on the official wiki. What we need to know is how to differentiate Noob to Pro from the user's manual.

::2. '''The conflict between having too much and too little theoretical information in the tutorials is a real issue which needs to be addressed.''' If the aim of the book is to enable someone to work professionally in their field (ie. as more than a mere power-user) then the theory has to be there. I think that each subject should have interlinked theory and practice pages: the practical tutorials could be followed cookbook style by people who are just starting out and need to know ''how'' something is done without needing to know all the details but the theory should be there for people who want to understand things at a deeper level. The theory pages could simply link to the practical pages the same way textbooks provide exercises at the end of chapters or sections. People then have a choice about how much or how little they want to read about a subject.

::3. '''The organization of the tutorials has to be re-examined.''' I favor an approach that starts with a general tutorial to familiarize all users with the Blender interface and underlying concepts, followed by branching skillset development trees based on the user's objectives. Blender is a multi-purpose tool and people use it for a lot of different things and the flow of the tutorials can recognize and support that. The basic tutorial (which would include very basic 3d modeling) could branch out to character modeling, environment modeling, animation, game design, architectural or scientific visualization, etc. No doubt many people would be interested in more than one branch, but organizing them this way allows us to logically order the tutorials according to the domain: character modelers obviously need to know about rigging, skinning, texturing, etc., but don't necessarily need to know about physics, lighting, scripting, etc. This solves the problem of trying to fit in tutorials which don't, in fact, progress logically because they are, in fact, about different subjects. This kind of organization is already there in a nascent state in the table of contents, but it needs to be developed much more robustly.

::4. '''People need to showcase their skills and find sources of inspiration.''' Of course there are many places already that allow you to show other people what you can do, but if any place needs outstanding work it's a wiki that promises to turn noobs into pros. It might not be a bad idea for some of the major contributors to demonstrate some of their own skill and give noobs something to strive for, and provide a gallery for registered users to show off their projects and get critiques. I don't want to duplicate the work being done by places like polycount and blenderartists but I think it might be good to offer noobs a safe place to get crits without feeling intimidated by the awesome work of some of the real pros.

== improve stages list ==

I see the &quot;stages&quot; list at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro#Table of Contents]] is slightly different than the one in the {{tl|stages}} template.
What is the extra icon supposed to mean?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:04, 9 March 2009 (UTC)
:I added the extra Icon to be used on pages that are incomplete. It is different then the sparse text one, in the sense that using [[File:UnderConstruction.Jpg]]Under Construction  shows a page is incomplete, while [[File:00%.svg]]Sparse or [[File:25%.svg]]Underdeveloped Text refers to a page which is completed but is just not all-inclusive or comprehensive. I feel it was necessary considering the status of many of the pages in this book and the complexity of certain subjects may take a while to develop. --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 20:24, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

::There is a somewhat similar convention at [[Wikijunior:Languages]]: an asterisk next to an article in the TOC means that some of the sections of that article haven't been populated yet.  More words are spent there (than are spent here) in explaining what it means; you might want to arrange your key so it explains the icon more clearly.  To be honest, I don't think the device over there works all that well, because it's too easy for the markings in the TOC to get out of synch with the actual state of the article.  I suppose the special icon here might make it harder to overlook and therefore easier to maintain...  Has it been working out well for you?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:07, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

::Well it is a new idea only implemented a couple weeks ago and I have gotten no feedback yet, good or bad. There were two aims with these new icone:&lt;br&gt;
::*Differentiate between &quot;Sparse, Undeveloped Text&quot;  and &quot;Incomplete Text&quot;.
::*Draw attention to pages that are incomplete.
::There is also a third side-effect I have only recently realized but nonetheless will likely help new users: the icon will make the page be left alone by new users, and therefore new users will not get confused or distracted by incomplete work.  Only regular editors would be the ones to visit the page. If anyone would like to give me any personal feedback or opinion on the idea, they are free to I encourage positives or negatives. --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 17:36, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

== Page modelling tips ==

The page [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/modelling tips]] has some issues:
* It should be moved to &quot;Modelling tips&quot; if it is kept at all.
* The author claims himself: &quot;this is not really a tutorial, but a list of handy tricks you will probably use alot when modelling&quot; (sic)
* The page doesn't really contain usefull information.
I think the page should be deleted. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 09:33, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
:I agree that it should be deleted. It's completely useless. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 13:28, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

== Images ==

The part below images has to be changed immediately. Images have to be uploaded to commons! There is more than one language in this world.  I suggest the following text:

'''Adding Images'''

In Blender tutorials, images are definitely a must-have. They help clarify your point, institute a standard and reference by which a new designer may judge their work, and in essence improve the teaching process of this book by at least ten-fold; however, there is an especially great problem with incorrect copyright attribution usage in Blender, which is leading to more and more images being removed from the pages and from Wikibooks altogether. These seriously hamper the tutorials, especially if the original author is gone, and can make a once-great tutorial now completely invalid and useless. Even if you believe that you know what copyright to use, please visit this proper [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender|Blender images copyright page]] and see how you should add copyright and where.

This is what you should do:
* Check whether there is an image that you can use already at [[:commons:Category:Blender 3D]].
* Upload your images to and only to [[:commons:|Wikimedia commons]]. There is more than one language in this world, and only images from commons can be reused worldwide.
 
Use the right categorization. You will find different templates for your upload also at the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender|copyright page]].

--[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 15:38, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

:....I thought images could only be uploaded to commons, then used elsewhere. I've never seen anyone be able to upload an image to Wikibooks itself. The Image Depository is just a way of filing images used in this Wikibook more categorically...but the images original location will be commons no matter what, correct? Am I missing something about images? --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 22:40, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
:: I haven't tried it, but if you click on the upload link you will upload your images to en.wikibooks only. The file CoverArt.jpg [[File:CoverArt.jpg|thumb|100px]] for example, can not be used outside en.wikibooks. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 07:45, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

Please help. I wanted to add a screen shot of a face model in progress but I had to use a set of free reference pictures I found in the internet in the background. I'm all confused in how to properly copyright this. I'm also unable to found an acceptable substitute in the commons. This copyright stuff really goes against the grain in things like this.

== Comprehension Check/Reviewing ==

Hey, look, there's still some tutorials that aren't fully comprehensive. I'm suggesting we should direct our attention to the articles that aren't fully comprehensive. Also, there are some pages that haven't been reviewed. I think somebody should review them. Ok? Thanks.--[[User:GeForce3|GeForce3]] ([[User talk:GeForce3|talk]]) 04:29, 17 April 2009 (UTC)

== English standardisation ==

Should the book be written in British or American English? I know it's a trivial matter, but I would like this to be clarified. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 15:01, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

IMHO, it doesn't matter. Brits read American just fine. Americans read English fine too.

== Every Material Known to Man ==

Should be on on Resourses... It is alredy listed twice, I copied it to there and someone undid my edit...
In resources it would be easier to find, since it is a f*ing page filled with resources for materials... Not downloadable, but are not tutorials on how to make an realistic looking material, is just: &quot;this material is R 0.454 B 0.345 and G 0.457&quot; I think you can't even change the materials, since there's the author's name, if you edit it you should create a copy of that with your changes by your name...
So since it's being discussed now, you should decide where it should be, and place it there, instead of placing in two different places that at least one person (me) believes is completely wrong... Or, if it can be in two places to ease finding, why can't it be on a third?

Cons of current places: Glossaries means &quot;an alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge&quot; and EMKTM is definately NOT that...
The other place I didn't find it now, perhaps someone alredy removed it too, but perhaps I didn't find it, cause I remember it wasn't called &quot;Every Material Known To Man&quot; there. ''-- The preceding unsigned comment was added by 189.5.142.108 04:06, 19 May 2009 ''
: I hope it is not listed twice, because the purpose of the book is ''This book can be seen as a series of tutorials arranged to help new users achieve expertise in Blender. The tutorials will increase in difficulty but enable intermediate users to quickly advance into whatever tutorial most suits their knowledge and continue along the sequence. We've made concerted efforts to accommodate everyone.''
: It is questionable whether EMKTM should be in it anyhow, so the idea of moving it to Resources seems reasonable to me. I would support that. But [[User:Bullercruz1]] has made the change at 01:57, 25 March 2009, I think it would be impolite to undo his change without asking him first. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:48, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

:: Agreed that it is not a tutorial nor anything to help people get expert, just a load of 'copy paste' materials... But they help noobs (like me): e.g. the skins are good to test humanoid meshes easily, and I know nowhere else it would be hosted so easily editable so to accomplish it's goal, so if listed as resource like the blueprints I think it would be more proper... Sorry I'm not too aware of wiki politeliness... [[Special:Contributions/189.123.179.105|189.123.179.105]] ([[User talk:189.123.179.105|talk]]) 03:44, 27 May 2009 (UTC) Hey, I'm 189.5.142.108 from before! ''(Off: Are you THE SoylentGreen from Blender Artists Forum and Blender Open Material Repository? Read a lot of topics there to help me besides this wikibook, and downloaded your Backface Culling material, it's perfect for making outlines for cartoon characters! thx)''
::: You're welcome (and it's the same person with the same nick). Best idea: register yourself here at wikibooks and write Bullercruz on his talk page. Politeness prevents edit wars, and we are all here voluntarily, so I tend to be overcautious at times. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 13:35, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Synopsis==
&lt;pre&gt;
\fontdimen&lt;f-parameter&gt;&lt;f-cs&gt; [= &lt;dimension&gt;]
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
In TeX, fonts are arranged in tables of 256 characters. In addition to the characters, a number of dimension parameters are given that TeX uses to build a page when using the font. The \fontdimen command allows you to obtain or reset a font parameter value that has already been defined or to define a new font parameter and set its value for a font that has already been loaded. Fonts are loaded with the [[TeX/font|\font]] command, which associates a control sequence with the loaded font. The form &lt;f-cs&gt; is such a font control sequence. Each font parameter is associated with an integer &lt;f-parameter&gt;. 

==Examples==
Recall that fonts are loaded with the &lt;code&gt;\font&lt;/code&gt; command, which associates a control sequence with a particular font table. The files that make up font tables are placed in a directory or library, and each font table has a given ''external name'' which TeX uses to find the table and associate it with a control sequence that can then be used in a source file to change the current font. For example,
&lt;pre&gt;
\font\roman=cmr10
&lt;/pre&gt;
associates the control sequence &lt;code&gt;\roman&lt;/code&gt; with the font table that has the external name &quot;cmr10&quot;. The font table cmr10 was designed by Donald Knuth, and it stands for Computer Modern Roman at 10 points. This table consists mostly of the Latin alphabet. It has seven parameters. Font tables that contain mathematical symbols have many more parameters. The values &lt;code&gt;\fontdimen2\roman&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\fontdimen3\roman&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\fontdimen4\roman&lt;/code&gt; give respectively the three parts of the inter-word glue for &lt;code&gt;\roman&lt;/code&gt;.

*1 (3-4 pound) boneless pork loin roast
*1 cup salt
*3/4 cup honey
*2 cups hot apple cider vinegar
*1 pound ice
*1 cup cornbread, crumbled finely
*1/2 cup chopped apple

Some cream really improves the texture, and a little lemon juice and zest really helps kick up the flavor of ordinary chicken soup!

== Ingredients ==
:2 cups shredded cooked chicken
:3 cups chicken broth
:1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
:2 tbs lemon zest, finely grated
:1 tbs minced garlic
:Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
:1 medium onion, finely diced
:4 ribs celery, chopped
:1/2 cup heavy cream
:12 sprigs fresh thyme
:5 sprigs fresh rosemary
:2 tbs olive oil
:1/2 large carrot, finely diced 
:3 bay leaves

== Directions ==
#Heat oil in a large pot over medium low heat. Add vegetables and a pinch of salt and cook until onion is translucent. There should be no sizzling.
#Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook 30 minutes.
#Remove herbs and check for taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste, before serving.

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==

If you're feeling adventurous, add some cayenne, hot sauce, or red pepper flake while it's cooking to add some heat! Chipotle chiles also work beautifully.</text>

hello admins, i would like to delete a file i uploaded in 06. i dont remember the account details i signed up with when i uploaded it. my email is in the pdf: (removed). how can i get this file deleted please?

:::::Well, you released it into the public domain - that means anyone may use it for any purpose, so we are not obligated to delete it. That said, I'd be happy to replace it with a version that doesn't include your email. If you can't provide that, someone else may be able to, but that may take some time (I'm not even sure what program to use to edit PDFs). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:19, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

&lt;!--ill be talking with your supervisor. because not obligated means that your just to lazy to do it. so ill have to find someone who is not a lazy butwipe to get this done. just for the record mike the admin is a lazy butwipe.
:Attacking people who are trying to help isn't a good policy if you want them to keep helping you. I've hidden this so you can save face.--&gt;

i will be reporting this problem to the copyrite infringement terms of service, i do own the copyrites to this material. and i will notify to them that you were uncoperative.
:After an explicit release to the public domain? I wish you luck; you'll need it. Now, if you want to be reasonable, I'm still willing to help you with this. When I figure out how to edit the file, I'll replace it, but please don't expect this to happen right this exact instant.

Could the reading room format be used to run a bike blog, and should we?

== FlaggedRevs Should Be Removed or Changed ==

Some people are aware but we've recently had another problem over the FlaggedRevs extension manifest itself at [[WB:RFP]]. The problem this time is that an author who donated a book to our site was unable to view his own edits because of the extension, was not autopromoted to +Editor because of the overly-complicated autopromotion requirements and essentially told by people (myself included, unfortunately) that there was no need to manually promote him because he would be autopromoted eventualy if he just continued editing.

I've been in regular off-wiki contact with the editors of the [[FEIA]] book, a book which is a multi-semester class project and has literally ''thousands of pages''. We run into lots of problems where students cannot easily view the changes that they make, cannot easily review the changes of others (which is a requirement for their grading system) and therefore cannot easily use Wikibooks for their projects. FlaggedRevs was originally added here because we thought it would help provide the stability that class projects need. Instead, it is doing exactly the opposite by actually ''making it harder'' for groups like this to use the site.

I have received a number of personal emails from various people who try to edit here, become confused and discouraged because of FlaggedRevs, and choose to leave the site to find someplace that's easier to get started on. I am currently attempting to get in contact with some of these people to get permission to post their sentiments here as evidence.

I do think that there is some configuration of FlaggedRevs that might be beneficial to this site, but I also know that our current configuration does far more harm then it does good. Since it's going to take a long time for us to decide on a new configuration, and since the current configuration would be doing damage to the site throughout that discussion period, I suggest that we disable the FlaggedRevs extension sooner rather then later. This way we can get down to serious discussions about the extension while not suffering the problems that it currently has. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:44, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

: Yes it will probably be awhile before any agreement can be reached on what other other changes, if any, to make. I think disabling the FlaggedRevs extension is too rash of a decision. Instead I think we should ask the developer of the FlaggedRevs extension what settings we need to change if we want to have anonymous users see the stable version by default, but also allow anonymous users to switch to and see the latest draft version easily. Of course the problem could be anonymous users may already be able to view the latest draft version, but how to do so isn't intuitive or easily apparent. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:16, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

:: Setting [[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs#User_interface|$wgFlaggedRevTabs]] to true in LocalSettings.php would provide &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;current&quot; revision tabs to make it easier to view the latest version. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:26, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
::: I tried looking at projects which had that set to true. I didn't notice any tabs. I would of suggested that myself if it worked as it suggests. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:35, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

: Just yesterday and the day before I went through [[Special:OldReviewedPages]] and cleared out many pages from [[FEIA]] that were as much as 90 days overdue, along with others.  Flagged revisions would likely be more effective if pages did not sit for so long before review.  The concerns mentioned above are why my personal preference is to only make a stable version of pages that are clearly not in flux, so that anonymous users can make improvements and see them immediately.

:I'd say one area of change would be to make it so that someone with the &quot;editor&quot; permission can choose to create new pages that are ''not'' automatically sighted.  A new page is likely going to see many changes in a short period of time and those changes inevitably don't get seen quickly.  Nearly all of the [[FEIA]] pages I saw that were long overdue had not been reviewed at all since the pages were first created by Whiteknight as stubs. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

:: I think new pages are not automatically sighted now, but if so yes that should be changed too. The problem might be that people are sighting newly created pages thinking its necessary to have them show up and then moving on, causing an old revision to be stuck as the stable version because there is no book contributors to review pages. If people hadn't sighted the pages the latest would of been shown. From what I could see, that is exactly what happened with the page in question that lead to a request on RFP. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:06, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

::: Is it possible to ''de-sight'' an old revision of a page that was sighted by another editor, thus reducing the page to a state of having &quot;no reviewed revisions&quot;?  (I know it's possible to de-sight one's own review, because I did that once.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:19, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

:::: You're right.  On the page I wrote about below, [[Horticulture/Galanthus nivalis]], I set all the settings to &quot;Poor or unrated&quot; and the submit button became ungreyed, and I was able to remove sighting on the page.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:24, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
::::: I was able to undo your automatic sighting for that page, so apparently the answer is Yes old reviews, even automated ones can be undone. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:29, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

:::A page I recently created after receiving editor permissions at [[Horticulture/Galanthus nivalis]] was automatically sighted according to its [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Horticulture/Galanthus_nivalis&amp;action=history page history], so it seems like new pages by editors are automatically sighted even now. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:22, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
:::: Ok then that should be disabled IMO.

:::: The two potential advantages of sighting, re vandalism, seem to me to be that
::::* it prevents vandalism from sitting visible on the primary versions of pages during the time until someone comes along to check them, and
::::* when someone does come along to check, it makes it easy to tell what has and hasn't already been checked.
:::: These help things work smoothly ''if'' the book has sighters who keep an eye on it and review new edits &quot;promptly&quot; (where &quot;prompt&quot; varies with the pace of activity on the book).  They could work pretty smoothly for most books if editors weren't scarce as hen's teeth (hence the recent reduction of the threshold for autopromotion).  On the low-activity end, when a book falls into a state of hibernation with no active authors, these advantages of sighting should enable a single editor with very low time commitment to keep that book from gradually decaying over time.

:::: That said, a book with a high rate of editing can completely swamp the sighters even if there are several sighters available to it.  A possible fix for that (as seems to be emerging elswhere in this thread) might be to arrange that there are no reviewed revisions of very-high-edit-rate pages.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:17, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

: Personally I didn't have any problems with FlaggedRevs pre effectively gaining the right via the Admin promotion (although I still haven't been +Editor auto-promoted, but that's another story). Also, since I sighted all the remaining WJ pages, I've found it very useful as it allows me to both check all edits since the sighting easily, rollback vandalism and I believe it has reduced vandalism as the vandals can't so easily see their bad edits. It's been discussed before but I think the major problem is the large number of inactive books which are incomplete and not fit to be sighted. FlaggedRevs would be good if everything was substantially complete and we were using it to monitor and improve the content. Right now it is only useful for the handful of active books and the featured books. Having said that, I think it should stay as it has a useful long term future. IMO. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::I agree with QU here.  I pitched the advantages of flagged revs to my reader community (which is not part of the WB community for the most part).  Many of them had been reluctant to promote/adopt my book because of the possibility of bringing up a vandalized page in a church environment.  I could see that educators would have the same issue.  Perhaps sighting should be something that is turned on for only some books?  Maybe featured books &amp; Wikijunior? I dunno! I just hate to throw it away so quickly. OTOH, I had been faithfully reviewing old flagged revs up to the point when there were something like 500 pages of the &quot;Foundations&quot; book. Sorry, but I just don't have time to review something that huge, especially when I do not judge myself qualified to make decisions about the material.  Maybe it would be better if the flagged revs were reduced to being an indicator that the page had not been vandalized. I don't think we need three categories of flagging with five levels each.  One binary category should be sufficient (not vandalism vs unchecked).  We prolly also ought to lower the threshhold for handing out +editor privs.  &quot;Just wait&quot; is not really an acceptable answer. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:24, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

:::: In practice, I have almost always treated the whole review mechanism as a pass/fail decision; except for when I was deprecating a revision (de-sighting it), I don't think I've touched the three review levels since the first week after I was autopromoted to editor.  Either I click the '''submit''' button to sight, or I don't.  The fact that there are actually nine different ways that I could give a page a passing review doesn't prevent me from treating it as a simple pass/fail, so the other eight kinds of pass aren't doing any harm &amp;mdash; and they might yet turn out to be useful to someone in the future, after we've got the overly-difficult autopromotion threshold fixed and there are enough editors to go around.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:22, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

Unfortunately busy at the moment, but after reviewing this, I think a simple one-level system would be best - used to indicate that a revision isn't vandalism, and nothing else. Fine-grained judgments of quality should be done through other methods. Currently, the harm is much greater than any benefit we've reaped, or could realistically reap in the near- to mid-term future. Maybe in some years when we have manpower to do this we can have a more substantial review process using flaggedrevs. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:59, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

I'm very glad that so many people have responded, and so quickly. However, the discussion that we've generated here is exacly what I am trying to avoid: We can talk and argue endlessly about what we want to change, and the entire time the discussion is ongoing we're stuck with the extension the way it is. It's a classic case of [http://www.bikeshed.com/ painting the bikeshed], we can just argue and argue and argue without ever getting the problem fixed. Disabling the extension serves two purposes:
# We stop causing damage immediately, so more harm isn't being done while we discuss the issue (and we ''should'' definitely take time to discuss it properly without rushing to implement a hair-brained solution to our original hair-brained configuration).
# If we don't have the extension active, we will be motivated to find a way to make it active again. Whereas if we have the extension active, we may be less motivated to change it because we already have it.
So yes, I think we have learned a lot of good lessons about what we like and what we don't like and what we want to change. Everybody has ideas (as evidenced by the discussion above), and that's a good thing to get the conversation going in earnest. While we are busy solidifying all our ideas into a comprehensive plan, I say we just shut it off and take the time to get it right. Start from a clean slate. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:13, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

::Seems to me we've got the makings here of practical measures to redress the immediate problems, stemming from old sighted revisions of pages that either shouldn't have any sighted revisions at all, or shouldn't have any sighted revisions with the current shortage of sighters.  Shutting it off would only ''prevent'' us from getting it right:  we just made a set of changes, they've just (we're told) taken effect a few days ago, and not waiting to observe ''at least'' the short-term consequences of the changes would be... counterproductive.  (A month and a half ought to give us a solid baseline from which to at least guess at longer-term consequences, and gauge the size of possible further changes; less time than that might or might not reveal something actionable.)

: Well then to make this more formal: I '''oppose''' disabling FlaggedRevs. I '''support''' disabling automatic sighting. As Pi zero said, we just got done making some configuration changes and its premature to jump to conclusions about how its not working out. I also agree that disabling the extension would prevent us from being able to get it right. OTOH disabling automatic sighing would at least make it less intrusive because the latest revision will be shown unless someone goes out of there way to review revisions. With this done we could then go back and deprecate reviews for the books being used for class projects for instance so it no longer a problem for them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:21, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

== TeX problems. ==

I recently found a snipit of TeX code that wikibooks cannot process and I am wondering if anyone has a clever work around.  The offending code is  
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\text{next year's production of steel}
&amp;=\text{next year's use of steel by steel}   \\
&amp;\quad+\text{next year's use of steel by auto}            
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

But this version without using any quotes inside a TeX block doesn't have have any problems.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\text{next years production of steel}
&amp;=\text{next years use of steel by steel}   \\
&amp;\quad+\text{next years use of steel by auto}            
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

I generally encounter lots of these lexing errors, (or the even more annoying failed conversion to png) but I am never to what extent these are bugs or limitations of the TeX implementation here. Should I be actively reporting these somewhere? If anyone has ideas about how to allow a single right quote in TeX that would be helpful to know.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:55, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

: Any limitation is with the math tag. The math tag only attempts to implement a subset of TeX or LaTeX. If you think there are bugs that should be fixed, you could try reporting them to bugzilla, but they may be ignored or marked as WONTFIX. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:36, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

For anyone following this thread, here is a work around.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\text{next year}\textrm{'}\text{s production of steel}
&amp;=\text{next year}\textrm{'}\text{s use of steel by steel}   \\
&amp;\quad+\text{next year}\textrm{'}\text{s use of steel by auto}            
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\textrm{next\ year's\ production\ of\ steel}
&amp;=\textrm{next\ year's\ use\ of\ steel\ by\ steel}   \\
&amp;\quad+\textrm{next\ year's\ use\ of\ steel\ by\ auto}            
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

depending on your tastes. It is perhaps notable that if you escape a space in \text{...} you'll also get errors.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:24, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

== [[Template:Dropimage]] has changed ==

Suddenly  the subject template has changed.   The control link ''show/hide'' now is located far to the right of the screen and not even in these drop-boxes at all.

Much formatting is already in place and many instances of this template are involved, particularly for the set ''[[Editing_Wikitext]]''.   In fact that book is the main user.    I would suggest that the work was better as it was before, and that some consideration of the writers who use it may have been a good idea.

Would an admin please consider the matter and in particular the possibility of reverting the changes to the template?   Thanks, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 20:40, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

: It ''was'' an admin who made the most recent change to the template.  Technically, the template is not protected in any way, so anyone can edit the change back to how it was previously.  However, I do not see any change to the appearance with Firefox 3.0.11. Please provide your browser and version so this can be troubleshooted. Internet Explorer 8 has been released and provides better compatibility with standards-compliant code if you happen to be using 6 or 7 of that browser. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:09, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

::Hi, The implication of your opening response suggests that you feel that an admin is always right over the intentions of others.   I note that the template has now been rewritten in collapsible table form.   I am using Opera, and was also using Opera when I wrote the subject template and the bulk of the [[Editing_Wikitext]] pages that it was made for.   I also note that some 100 or so pages link to the book so I assume that users feel that it has some value.  In my browser all of the show/ hide links now are displayed at the far right of the page instead of within the drop box as was intended.   I note also that all of the instances of the template that were intended to be centered on the laboriously formatted pages of that book are now located at the hard left.

::Admins should not feel that they have indescriminate authority to change work, especially when a great deal of effort has gone into the implementation.   This is particularly true of templates.   Frankly,  if this is how such matters are being handled it might be better for me to make my efforts elsewhere, and leave the admins to write the work.

::: I don't know of any admin who feels that way. You asked for an admin to change it back, when admin privileges are not required to do so. The CSS of the template was using left-align already for the table, the fact that Opera centered the table despite that was a bug. What version of Opera are you using? With Opera 9 under WINE I didn't see any issue with the collapse button being completely to the right of the page. I'm about to give Opera 9 another try using the native Linux version. I can fix the template so the table is centered instead by default, if that was the actual intent. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:41, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

:::In Firefox 2.0.0.20 the template dropimage fails to obey the option to center.   A simplified version of a collapsible table, for example the one in [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables]] has the same problem, but strangely that simple one can be fixed by adding a style for margin set to auto.   The template does not respond to this treatment and it is difficult at present to see why not.   Both Internet Explorer and Opera now seem to obey the centering attribute, and I note that the links have  found their way back into their boxes in all cases. [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 17:32, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: The table has &lt;code&gt;align=&quot;left&quot;&lt;/code&gt; by default which is why its aligning to the left and not centering. Any browser that is centering is ignoring that. &lt;code&gt;margin:auto&lt;/code&gt; works in most web browsers when there is also a defined width. Some web browsers are known to have weird rendering problems when attempting to align tables, so wrapping the table inside a div block will usually ensure more consistent rendering across web browsers. The table could also be replaced with a div block. That would probably confuse people who are reading the Editing Wikitext book, but it would fix a common mistake in web design, that is using tables for layout rather then for tabular data. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:04, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

In fact, if a text is uploaded in nearly complete form, it always raises my suspicions that it was cut-n-pasted from a copyrighted source.  I always Google unique-looking phrases when I see that happen, and nine times out of ten find a copyrighted source of the material with all rights reserved (which we cannot allow here).  Good luck in your new project, and thanks for asking questions instead of just leaving.

== INTRODUCTION TO BUINESS ==

As am a new comer to these show,am kindly asking for advices.
-1 since have choosen the book introduction to business,have also seen the topices below
now how can i starts to read?

:Usually you just follow the links from the table of contents page.  The book [[Introduction to Business]] is a new book almost nothing has been written besides a table of contents.  You may want to look through the [[Subject:Business]] page and see if you can find another more developed book.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:03, 30 July 2009 (UTC)
== Is Wikibooks growing? ==

I can't say it is, and the worse is actually the case. I have been contributing to Wikibooks for a few years, and what I see is people seem to be losing interest in the project. If I remember correct, more people used to contribute to math-related articles, and there are more people who would have participated in organization-related discussions like switching from bookshelves to subject pages. Simply put, I'm seeing fewer and fewer people around in the project; this cannot be good. Just so there is no misunderstanding, I'm not suggesting contents in Wikibooks are useless or that there are no serious editors contributing to the project. (For example, I consider myself a serious editor, and I believe I made some nontrivial positive contribution.) And I genuinely believe in the premise of Wikibooks, the creation of free books (in particular free in the sense of &quot;free beer&quot;. As a graduate student who has to teach, I know how outrageous the prices of some textbooks used in my class. There are ''clear and significant'' demands for cheap books. Why is Wikipedia so popular, and why can't its success be translated to the cases of textbooks?

Obviously, some kind of restructuring is in order. The strongest argument that can be made against the switching to subject pages would be that not that it destroys the status quo, but that its extent is not ''radical'' enough. I don't see how the switch would significantly change the dynamics. I have some radical ideas for restructuring. For example, I've come to think &quot;books&quot; may not be good ways to organize materials. The biggest problem is a duplication. Duplication of materials directly translate to duplications of editors' time, which are very scarce. Another problem would be that this resulted in many books left unfinished. Not only this makes us look bad (We want to look good and cool, don't we?), but often many new editors try to reorganize materials into new forms (which often end up incomplete too) instead of ''adding'' new materials to existing ones. One obvious solution I'm thinking of lately is to reduce scales. It's time to conclude that books are too large for wiki editors, who like to make small edits now and then. Maybe Wikibooks should consist of chapters or sections instead of books. This could work greatly for math books. There would be no books on linear algebra, or analysis. There would simply a page on eigenvalues or compact operators. Of course, this ''could'' move us closer to the structure of Wikipedia, but it doesn't have to be. The tones of pages are obviously different, for example; e.g., each theorems or lemmas are followed by proofs, the style that is not common in Wikipedia. Anyway, this is just one idea that I though I might share. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 23:31, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

: You have some good points. Have you seen the things people are doing at http://www.wikiversity.org/ ? ''The biggest problem is ... Duplication of materials ... There would simply a page on eigenvalues or compact operators.'' That's a good idea. We are already starting to do something similar in Engineering and Computer programming. There are a bunch of loose pages at [[Engineering Tables]] and [[:Category:Computer Programming Templates]]. People can assemble two (or more) books that &quot;transclude&quot; those pages without duplication. For example, there are several [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Engineering_Tables/Fourier_Transform_Table Wikibooks that transclude the Fourier transform table]. If anyone sees an error in that table, that person can update it once and then all those books will immediately display the improved version. Should we make a similar collection of loose pages on eigenvalues, etc.? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 20:16, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

:: Taku, the interest in contributing to books is enormous -- a lot of people I know who edit wikipedia a bit would /rather/ edit a wikibook but don't see something that matches what they have in mind.  If we could get closer to good &quot;book style&quot; as a target, we would start to find not only novice WB editors who are inspired by the idea, but experienced authors who have already published their own gfdl or cc-by/cc-sa works using WB as their platform.  I think it's important to focus on those essential groups.
:: Some tasks that should be made easier (with good bot operators, toold, &amp;c) :
::* Importing freely licensed books available elsewhere online.  Templates for importing different kinds of pages, decent doc-to-wiki and html-to-wiki converters, a simple guide to figuring out the canonical name for a page/chapter/book.  [to your point about how many books should be sharing pieces, what's the right naming convention for pieces of material explaining vectors/the Krebs cycle/fugue form?  if it starts with the name of a book, that can be confusing.  if it does not, quickly mapping a 150-pg book onto a set of Wikibooks pages becomes more tricky.]
::* Creating sets of problems.  From static problems with solutions, to dynamic problems (with variables in the statement and solution).
::* Creating pages for authors or publishers.  [[CK-12]], [[Benjamin Crowell]], and [[w:de:Wikipedia:WikiPress]] should have pages here, each has produced almost as many freely-licensed books as WB itself, and everything from their back-office processes to their list of works and versions over time (when not stored on WB) deserve mention and discussion.  If we're not discussing this level of detail about the book-production process, it will be harder to attract a large body of authors.

: I agree with a lot of what you say but disagree with a few points as well. I don't know if Wikibooks is or is not growing, I have seen lots of interesting developments in my time here and don't think we are in any kind of imminent danger of collapsing into nothingness. However, avoiding complete collapse or even maintaining the status quo is hardly good enough, we need to do more to grow the project.
: I agree that many books are too ambitious, but it's worse then that: most books have a problem with '''scope''' in some form or another. Some books are too large and sprawling, some books are too small and narrow. There are problems associated with each. I would be very interested to hear ideas about solving this particular problem, but I worry that most potential solutions are going to be unworkable for a variety of reasons.
: The idea of writing things on smaller scales and encouraging section reuse is an interesting one. However, I would caution you that pursuing this too radically will create new problems. A good book needs to have flow, a good narrative, and a good understanding of the target audience. By reusing sections or chapters, we can end up with problems where books become very disjointed. Adding new information to a particular section means we have to go back to all the books where that section is used and verify that we have all the prerequisite information and that readers will be able to follow along. That can put even more of our editors time in jeopardy.
: We do need to make some significant changes around here if we want to grow and succeed in the long run. The recent licensing change will do a lot (more then people expect) towards making Wikibooks more interoperable with other open content websites, which in turn will promote the flow of information into Wikibooks. Here are some things that I think we need in the long run to make things better:
:# More advertising. We need to get in touch with people outside Wikibooks and even outside Wikimedia and let them know that we are serious about what we are doing, looking to expand, and are supportive and helpful towards interested new users. I've been doing some blogging about Wikibooks in the past, I would like to suggest that other people do the same. In fact if anybody wants to write up an opinion peice or some kind of project advertisement or anything, I would be happy to post it (or a link to it) on my blog.
:# Improved usability. This is a big one but is necessary to reduce the technical hurdles that new users face. Improved documentation helps, but there are some technical tools we need added too. A WYSIWYG editor would be amazingly helpful, and I've been testing out some options elsewhere that would be very usable here. So many people don't edit or don't stay because wiki markup is more difficult and more ugly then people are prepared for. We also need better tools for organizing and developing books. I've worked on some javascript tools myself but they are more of a curiosity then a &quot;ready for prime time&quot; kind of tool. We could also use things like quick &quot;how to&quot; screencasts. If everybody who read this explained in a 30 second video how to perform common tasks and uploaded that to commons or youtube, that would be an amazing help and would work wonders for attracting and maintaining new authors. There are lots more ideas in this department, I won't ramble anymore but if people want more ideas just ask.
:# We need to attract authors from other places to work here.  There are plenty of people in the world who write books on their own personal websites. We can host those books here and attract their authors to come join Wikibooks. We can attract teachers and professors and researchers to write things here on Wikibooks that they wouldn't have been able to write (or write profitably) elsewhere. 
:These are just a few ideas for things that we need in Wikibooks over the long term, and I'm sure other people have other ideas. I would love to hear them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:15, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

::I haven't performed a statistical analysis but it very visible that there is an incontestable decline in contributing users and the capacity to retain said contributors (this point is the most problematic due to the nature of Wikibooks). I make this assessment in regards to the time I've been participating here.
::I don't see the scope of the books or their size (big or small) as a problem or of high importance to the general user and not to experienced contributors, since we now have a cleared the way of having books on the same scope and have a somehow established protection to stubs (so other people can pick them up). I still see very few people taking up the merge jobs that are pending ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Merge_templates Category:Merge templates]), so the issue is participation in itself not a lack of things to do.
::I'm still waiting that the agreed trail period we voted for (6 moths +-) for the FlaggedRevs is considered elapsed and we can finally invalidate it's final adoption, this to me is one of the major reasons for the huge decline we have seen in participation.

Of course, perceptions could differ depending on to which area you contribute. As it may be clear by now, my edits nowadays are mostly limited to math-related books. What has been disturbing to me (and so ultimately led me to start this thread) is that, aside from minor fixes and edits related to organization, I'm not seeing any activity of &quot;actually writing books&quot; (well, except mine). Maybe this is temporary. But since I'm a long-time editor and remember distinctly that more editors used to contribute to math books, this has been very worrying to me. Anyway, again, maybe things are different  in other areas.

:There are a handful of other editors helping with math books. I felt I did some actual writing at [[Real analysis]]; [[User:Warshall]] has been working pretty consistently on calculus; [[User:Adam majewski]] and [[User:Danwillis]] have been making regular edits to [[Fractals]].  On the other hand I understand perfectly what you mean, and because of this problem I wanted to recognize peoples efforts.  My first edit was to point out something that I felt bordered on a factual mistake at [[Real analysis]] and my comment went unnoticed for two years until I decided to make some changes.  Then, when going through the book I found many other people had made comments that were just as neglected about more blatant factual errors in the book, which had gone equally unnoticed.  My conclusion was the book was abandoned, then looking around, it wasn't clear to me that there was a math book that wasn't abandoned.  Now I see a couple, but over all we seem  to have thousands of books, dozens of books being worked on, and a handful of books that have enough content to be comparable to a printed book. (related comments to follow below). [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:09, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

Here are some responses from me to the above. Yes, I'm in a complete agree with Whiteknight on that the scope (and, especially, the title) of a book is extremely crucial for its long-term success. I have seen many unfinished books often exhibiting serious shortcomings in defining their scopes. But what is the solution? Nuoedia would have worked nicely if people can work ''diligently''. It didn't. The lesson from Wikipedia is that people are lazy, don't read instructions, they don't make well-thought edits that fits overall structures, etc. In theory, books should have good outlines and clear statement of its scopes. But, apparently, this is too much to ask for. Many books experience some major structural reorganizations because editors simply don't know or can't agree how to organize materials. (Algebra and Japanese books are examples I know.) Of course, we have many good quality books. (Personally, I think my [[Functional Analysis]] has been developing quite nicely, but then it has been written almot entirely by me; It's not an example of wiki-at-work.) In short, writing books is ''surprisingly?'' very hard, and telling people do better jobs isn't a solution. (This is the basis of my problem with subject pages. ''In theory'', they work nice. But, in practice, they probably don't work. It's too complex. People are not as smart as you would like to assume.)

:Let me start by saying functional analysis has been coming along well.  My desire to create a wiki-at-work experience is why I was interested in reviving the mathematics project (I hope this catches on and other subjects follow suite).  The fact here is that the conversations in the reading room have a lot of focus about how things should be organized but rarely discuss the actual writing of texts.  If we could get the people interested in the same subject talking to each other, then collaboration may follow.  (Personally, it would be nice to talk about my grandiose pipe dreams for mathematics, imagine getting one nice undergraduate text book together and getting the MAA to give it a book review it in the Monthly!  Even if the review were scathing, it would really get the word out that we are looking to write actual mathematics text books for use in actual classes, to a large group of people interested in mathematics. It makes me smile just to think about.)  Even if this is a lofty goal, anything that gets more then one person working on a book at a time is a good thing.  I would not be surprised to find out that we lose a lot of good editors because they feel they are working in a vacuum. No one anywhere notices or cares about the work they put into some book so why continue with it.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:09, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

I know about Wikiversity. In a sense, I guess, my above post proposes a merger with Wikibooks, but I don't think that solves the problem. Wikiversity looks too chaotic to me, and its focus on &quot;learning&quot; doesn't mix with the notion of textbooks. Textbooks are not just for learning; they (especially math texts) develop theorys from ground-up. A good textbook has a structure that, when reading from the beginning to the end, helps you to truly grasp ideas; it shows how one idea leads and connects to another. (This, I believe, is the same as what Whiteknight called narrative.) This is something that wikibooks can offer; that wikipedia can't. Wikipedia articles simply collect facts, often without narrative, without motivation. For Wikipedia this is inevitable since articles have to present all examples, all possible applications, all possible definitions, etc. (A good example is [[w:function (mathematics)]]. A good textbook would never try to present such breath.) So, ''I'' know that why we wanted book formats in the first place. But, again like nupedia, apparently, simplicity is more important. A book with good narrative is too ambitious; it's only possible if it can attract a very committed editor with a good vision. When he left, someone might or might not pick up. But since he has different &quot;vision&quot;, he inevitably has to restructure the book entirely. In other words, in this scenario, we're really not taking advantage of &quot;wiki&quot;. Good books could be written without wiki, but that would completely miss the point of this project. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 01:49, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

:&quot;Why is Wikipedia so popular, and why can't its success be translated to the cases of textbooks?&quot;
:This question is easy to answer. Wikipedia has a more broader scope and is of greater usefulness to the general Internet user, it also serves as a promoter of concepts, ideas and a mean to archive uniformity of understanding, we can even say it enables/promotes restricted topic debates and consensual agreement on them. The possibility to search and index an encyclopedia provides added value. The same is not equally transposed to books, a wikibook will have to compete not only with other online repositories, but also with printed books, it is also important to remember that electronic books haven't as yet reached a critical mass.
:Taking those point in consideration Wikibooks will always have a problem not only of perceived usability but of real visibility and usefulness (a good comparison to usefulness is to consider the Wikisource project that only offers finished products). All we have going for us is that we attempt to provide free books by empowering people to edit them but the real added value goes for the final user if and only the Wikibook can mature to a almost complete state. Ultimately I don't take the objective of creating books as the core objective of the project, the most important thing we produce is free content (that uses a lot more of creative effort than a encyclopedic article)...
:As for the proposal to merge Wikiversity to Wikibooks, I take it as a step back or in the wrong direction. Wikiversity has a very distinct goal &quot;learning&quot; (I would even go so far as to say exploration and investigation). It provides as platform for working in the evolution of ideas and knowledge that wouldn't be possible or wanted on Wikibooks since we reduced our effort to the &quot;teaching&quot; and that requires us to restrict the subjects to finished or well understood techniques and concepts that aren't moving targets and prone to have their credibility contested.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:26, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

=== Wikibooks expansion ===

Wikibooks, Wikisource, and Wikiversity have the potential to expand tremendously.  All would fill niches that are currently vacant.

Wikibooks: real-time, publicly versioned updates and improvements to free textbooks.
: Demand 
:: '''[[w:CK-12|CK-12]]''' has a MediaWiki backend for storing its 20+ books.  It uses doc and pdf formats to send them to publishers for print on demand, but intends for future revisions of their books after the initial publication date to take place on a wiki.  If there is an active community here that has looked at and writted guidelines for including their style of &quot;books composed of independent modules&quot;, all of this work can take place here at WB rather than spread across two wikis.   
:: The '''[http://lightandmatter.com Light and Matter]''' book series are all cc-sa and waiting to be remixed into other book formats or for different audiences.  They are better in cleanliness and uniform coverage than the equivalent subject-matter books here on WB.  If WB can render them beautifully and effectively convert them from numbered pageflow to a wiki solution, then this could be the place for corrections and future revisions to be made, feeding into the author's own publishing process.  Until he is willing to include a link to the Wikibooks page for his works on his 'downloads' page, we're missing an essential piece of the global-realtime-book-editing puzzle.
: Partnerships 
:: with '''Wikisource'''.  WS should have copies of all primary source materials used in Wikibooks.  An advantage of WB should be rapid translation of finished works, down to and including commentary on primary sources.  In Classics (where primary sources span Arabic, Latin, Greek, French and English) this is an essential feature to writing effective texts which most authors do not have the in-house capacity to master.
:: with '''Wikiversity'''.  WV should provide a main-namespace entry for every significant freely licensed learning material available.  These number over a million (the GLOBE exchange indexes ~1.4M at the moment); yet the databases currently used to hold them are used only to support non-interactive search engines,  They are not directly commentable, editable, or immediately usable in wikibooks (though most of them are licensed in a compatible way).  If Wikiversity supported this sort of granular learning material, WB could transclude them directly into books [perhaps that's where problems and sample tests would go].

== Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL. ==

There seems to exist a lack of direction to the Wikimedia determination for the use of Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 as the sites license. For what I have understood of the issue we need to start dropping GFDL references since the content can only be relicensed by Wikimedia any time before August 1, 2009 and that no new GFDL content is can be imported into the project since the relicense also states that the only GFDL works that can be relicensed have been on the project until November 1. It is now July 13 2009 and the lack of a clear and visible statement is worrying.&lt;br&gt;
The last action (and recent one at that) I've seen it to make all recent contribution to the project dual license (Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL) this doesn't cover our necessities nor addresses the problem of some works being included on the project violating the November 1, 2008 limitation.&lt;br&gt;
I'm I wrong on worrying about this facts ?!?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:44, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

: Any lack of direction is on the part of the Wikimedia Foundation. The decision to dual license was the board's decision. I will note though that the November cutoff in the GFDL refers specifically to works not originating on a wiki. So I think if there is a problem it is for any preexisting GFDL-only works that might have been included in books since the November cutoff. You may not be wrong to worry, but I don't think there is anything that Wikibooks as a project can do about it. I think you would have to direct your worries to the foundation. I think the only thing Wikibooks can do is to delete such works as copyright violations as they are encountered. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:12, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

::The decision to dual license is not a real problem (it can be confusing to the normal user), it just doesn't address all the issues. The November cutoff is for all GFDL works, the origin isn't an issue (but only MMC/Wiki's can relicense them). The situation now is that any GFDL content is out of our reach and there will be very difficulty to police imports made of GFDL content after November 1, 2008. Shouldn't we make this facts more visible to our userbase (at least a visible note not to import any GFDL material) ?

NPOV and OR do apply here, however.  Citations can help to head off any VFDs should someone believe your work is original research.  Notability is not really a factor here.

== Odd linebreaking with TexBox template. ==

I have noticed the following odd behavior of the TextBox template.  When a text starts on the same line as the title, then it respects the first hard coded line break in the text a, but not otherwise.  It also seem to indent, but perhaps this is a feature? See the examples below to see what I mean.

{{TextBox|1=

Write the ''LINE'' ''BREAK'' rest of the FORTRAN program to do a 
straightforward implementation of Gauss' method.

of matrix algebra that we will have later, in Chapter Three.)}}

That is a feature of the software. As you probably already know when a line starts with &quot;:&quot; it is indented. &quot;;&quot; and &quot;:&quot; are actually part of the same feature. &quot;;&quot; is used to provide a glossary/dictionary term (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and &quot;:&quot; to provide its definition (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;). The term and definition can be placed on separate lines or placed on the same line, but either way a line break is added. The single line form just like the separate line form relies on the presents of &quot;:&quot; to know where the term ends and the definition begins. That is why there is a line break. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:04, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

This is perhaps at best a curiosity, but I thought it was strange so I would mention it here.  I came across the page [[Native-PAGE]], which is not categorized.

== Nonsense images ==

I've noticed a couple on odd images here:
[[File:C ik action.gif]]
[[File:C floor.gif]]
Should they be deleted? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 04:24, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:Well for the first image, it is rather similar to images found at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Const/ik]], and that page claims the next page is called &quot;Action&quot;, so it is probably the first image was created for this action page, which is yet to be written.  The image could be helpful to who ever writes that module, provided they are aware it exists.  

:The second image was probably intended for the page [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Const/fl]] which was started by the same author but never progressed to the point that he included the image. So overall I would say it probably isn't a good idea to delete the images.  But then again they were created 4 years ago and still are not linked by anything.

== Page should be wikified? ==

This page looks rather funny: [[History of Literature/Australian Poetry at the Turn of the 20th Century]]. Wikify it? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 04:48, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:This page seems a doesn't seem so strange.  It is not unusual for a page to have no links to other pages, or is there some other aspect of its strangeness I am missing.  What would wikifying it entail? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:32, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:I'm sure it looks as funny to you as Wikipedia articles do to me, with every other word (even apparently simple ones) linked to another page.  Books are more often altered the other way. As detailed in [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikimedians#Textbooks vs. articles]]: &quot;Textbooks are self-contained, meaning that the chapters link to each other internally, but not to other wikibooks.&quot;  I have seen &quot;see also&quot; links, however.  See [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]] for the full story.    Ideally, a textbook will explain the terminology it uses in the text, without forcing readers to exit the book and consult other resources. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:55, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

::It isn't the links; it's the 'long introduction'. If this were a Wikipedia article, I would cut it up in sections. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 07:44, 22 July 2009 (UTC)
== Annotated Texts ==

I recently was looking at the policies about annotated texts.  The policies clearly seem to indicate that a necessary ingredient to being an annotated text is that the source text is included.  This only seems to be true for around a half dozen of the books in [[Subject:Annotated texts]].  Probably in most cases copyright issues would keep us from reproducing the text, regardless of manpower.  Perhaps most of these books are simply miscategorized, but I thought this might shed some light on the question as to whether pages that are errata's of published text books fall under our scope.  I tend to feel they do not, as they are not &quot;textbooks, annotated texts, instructional guides, [or] manuals&quot;.   Other books such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] is an excellent in depth guide, and I do feel belongs here, but it is not an annotated text as advertised. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:55, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

: I think another category under [[Subject:Literature]] at the same level as [[Subject:Annotated texts]] may be called for. The former should be about literature in general, while the latter implies annotations to a source.  Books on books without the source&amp;mdash;what shall they be called?  As for erratas&amp;mdash;my statement in the VfD discussion page at this time coincides with my opinion that they are outside Wikibooks' scope. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:49, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

::Books on books (or texts about texts) are called [[w:Secondary source]]. They usually contain only excerpts of the original text in contrast to annotated texts. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:31, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

: I don't think the intent was that the entire original work must be completely included in order to be considered annotated, but rather that excerpts and whatever else that might be relevant to the analysis of the work must be included or referenced in some way. Annotated Texts on Wikibooks aren't even limited to literature, they can be about movies, songs, etc. I think including the entire work completely was intended more as an ideal for works old enough to be out of copyright or where fair use might apply. I think erratas alone are outside Wikibooks scope, but I think annotated texts can include erratas as part of aiding students in a literary class. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:06, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:: I like the term ''Secondary sources'', I would be content with terms such as ''Literature study guides'', or perhaps ''Critical analysis''.  I am not sure the original intent, but I think in this case I agree with the wording we have. I suggest reserve the subject &quot;Annotated texts&quot; for books that contain the original books or media to which they pertain, and create a new subject for books which do not or can not contain the original source material.  I agree with &lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; that erratas as part of a larger study guide or annotated texts make sense here, but I think free standing lists of errors do not.

== Wikibooks in general ==

Are the books on this site able to be purchased or are they strictly online? I have seen a few I would love to be able to buy but i don't think its possible. Is it?

== Visitor count ==

I think both readers and authors would be interested in some statistics regarding specific books.  Such statistics could include:

*Visitor count

*Trends
*etc.

Perhaps this could be setup in collaboration with google analytics?

== Geothermal Heating Book ==

Back in November or so, I finished a course on installing Geothermal Heat pumps, and was wondering if there was enough interest to get a book going on the subject here in Wikibooks. Geothermal heating is one of the few mature Green Technologies that has a significant ROI. These systems often pay for themselves within the first 5 to 10 years, and the equipment is guaranteed to last for up to 50 years before needing replacement if it is installed correctly. As a member of IGSHPA I may be able to get some support from the Industry Organization, and if the quality of the book is high enough it might be made available for local courses in order to increase the number of qualified installers and contractors out there. There are two major things holding this technology back, the small number of qualified installers, and the initial cost of the installation. This book might help with the first.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 19:38, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

I have started the book at [[Geothermal Heating and Cooling]] to see where I intend to take it, look on the talk page for a discussion of possible chapters.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 08:27, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

== Would Wikibooks want a compendium of churn rates? ==

I am trying to get wider dissemination of what I believe is a [http://insidemr.blogspot.com/2006/06/comparison-of-churn-rates.html very useful resource] to people who care about churn rates. When I linked to the blog from the Wikipedia article &quot;Churn rate&quot;, the link was removed on grounds of conflict of interest and non-notability and non-expertise -- even though the blog post is cited in [http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM0839.pdf a published article] in a respected journal. So, let me get to the point. If Wikibooks were to want this content of mine, I'll hand it over, '''if''' you think this step would then enable a link from the Wikipedia article on churn rate, which gets about 9,000 page views per month. The point is to get this resource in the hands of people who want it, while it would still be properly attributed to me. More discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Flowanda#Churn_rate_resource here]. I'm looking forward to the response(s) here. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 18:02, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

:Some considerations. Wikibooks does have a policy on [[WB:OR|original or primary research]].  I notice you've been trying to find a good fit for the content, including looking at Wikisource.  You may also wish to look at [[v:|Wikiversity]] as well, which is the best home for primary research, though you cite sources in your blog and that may make it such that it is not primary research. If it's within Wikibooks' scope, you'd also have to consider where the content would go. Would it become part of an existing book or would it be developed into part of a larger book? From your blog title, maybe you'd be interested in creating a book on market research as a whole. Finally, your edits will be part of the page history and you can put yourself on an author page, but you'll have to accept that anyone could edit the information provided, unlike on your blog. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:32, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} [[Category:Lamb recipes]] [[Category:Cumin recipes]]

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound leg of lamb (shank end), cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground cumin
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 tbs cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tbs smoked paprika
* Soaked bamboo skewers
* 4 cloves garlic, smashed and minced

== Procedure ==
#Combine all ingredients except lamb in a gallon size zip-top bag. Add lamb cubes and toss to coat; refrigerate overnight.
#The next day, drain lamb; discard marinade. Thread 4 cubes onto 1 skewer. Repeat until all lamb has been skewered.
#Fire up a '''charcoal''' grill for 15 minutes. Add lamb and cook 8 minutes per side for medium rare. Serve warm with couscous.

== Notes ==

The vinegar will '''not''' turn the lamb into mush as it is not acidic enough to tenderize.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hash Tables

Hash tables allow you to efficiently store large amounts of information which can be quickly referenced and retrieved later on.

A hash table can be created, freed, referenced, or modified using the following commands and identifiers.

/hmake -s &lt;name&gt; &lt;N&gt;
Creates a new hash table with N slots.

A hash table can store an unlimited number of items regardless of the N you choose, however the bigger N is, the faster it will work, depending on the number of items stored.

eg. if you expect that you'll be storing 1000 items in the table, a table of N set to 100 is quite sufficient.

The -s switch makes the command display the result.

/hfree -sw &lt;name&gt;

Frees an existing hash table.

The -w switch indicates that name is a wildcard, all matching tables are freed.

/hadd -smbczuN &lt;name&gt; &lt;item&gt; [data | &amp;binvar]
Adds an item to an existing hash table.

If the item you're adding already exists, the old item is replaced.

The -m switch makes /hadd create the hash table if it doesn't already exist.

The -uN switch unsets the item after N seconds.

The -b indicates that you're adding a &amp;binvar item to the hash table.

The -c switch chops the &amp;binvar up to the first null value and treats it as plain text.

The -z switch decreases hash item once per second until it reaches zero and then unsets it.

The /hinc and /hdec commands use the same parameters as /hadd and increase or decrease the number value of an item.

When used with /hinc or /hdec, the -c switch increases or decreases the value once per second.

/hdel -sw &lt;name&gt; &lt;item&gt;
Deletes an item from a hash table.

The -w switch indicates that item is a wildcard, all matching items are freed.

/hload -sbni &lt;name&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [section]
/hsave -sbnioau &lt;name&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [section]
Load or save a table to/from a file.

These load/save plain text to a text file, with item and data on separate lines. $cr and $lf characters are stripped from text when saving as plain text.

The -b switch loads or saves binary files. $cr and $lf are preserved when saving as binary files.

You can use -n to load or save files as data only, with no items. When loading with -n each line of data is assigned an N item value, starting at N = 1.

/hsave also supports -o to overwite an existing file, and -a to append to an existing file.

By default /hsave excludes items that are in the /hadd -uN unset list, the -u switch forces it to include the unset items.

The -i switch treats the file as an ini file. You can specify an optional section name after the filename.

Note: /hload does not create the table, it must already have been created by /hmake.

$hget(name/N)
Returns name of a hash table if it exists, or returns the name of the Nth hash table.

Properties: size

$hget(moo).size   returns the N size of table, as specified in /hmake

$hget(name/N, item)

Returns the data associated with an item in the specified hash table.

Properties: unset

The unset property returns the time remaining before an item is unset.

$hget(name/N, item, &amp;binvar)
Assigns the contents of an item to a &amp;binvar.

$hget(name/N, N).item
This allows you to reference the table as an index from 0 to N, in order to look up the Nth item in the table.

If N is zero, returns the total number of items in the table.

You can also reference the Nth data value directly with $hget().data.

Note: This method is provided as a convenience, it is not an efficient way to use the hash table.

$hfind(name/N, text, N, M)
Searches table for the Nth item name which matches text. Returns item name.

Properties: data

If you specify the .data property, searches for a matching data value.

M is optional, and can be:

  n	normal text comparison (default if M isn't specified)
  w	text is wildcard text
  W	hash table item/data is wildcard text
  r	text is regular expression
  R	hash table item/data is regular expression

You won't believe how well ahi tuna responds to Asian flavors. It's just like apple and pork. They were meant for each other.

== Ingredients ==
*2 pounds ahi tuna loin, cut into 2 pieces
*1/4 cup ketchup
*1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
*1/4 cup light brown sugar
*2 tbs soy sauce
*2 tbs peanut oil

== Procedure ==
#Combine ketchup, vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar. Reserve 1/4 cup and add tuna to larger amount of mixture and toss to coat. Drain tuna and set aside.
#Coat a sheet of newspaper with 1-2 tsp oil. Wad up and place under a good chimneyful of natural chunk charcoal. Light and wait 15 minutes or until coals are coated with light gray ash.
#Rub grate with remaining oil and place on heated chimney. Add tuna and cook 15-30 seconds or until desired doneness is achieved.
#Remove to a plate and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rest 3 minutes.
#Slice thinly across the grain and serve with reserved marinade, or wrap tightly with a new sheet of plastic wrap and refridgerate up to 3 days.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Three Rules To Purchasing Steroids Online Safely

Today steroids are availible from numerous websites, making online steroid purchases one of the most popular 
ways to buy.  Using the internet for your steroid purchases is a efficent way to obtain high quality products
that are delivered to your door.  While buying steroids online is a effective alternative to finding a source
by asking at your local gym you do need to need to take some precautions, mostly to protect you from fraud.  
There are  always going to be people who will try to part you from your hard earned cash and give you nothing
in return.  This is especially true when purchasing steroids online.  There are many, many steroid websites 
that are nothing more than scams.  Also watch out for the selective scammer.  This is a site that sometimes
sends out products and sometimes doesnt.  It would be difficult to put a number on what percentage of steroid
websites are frauds but some have estimated it to be as high as 90%.  With numbers like that you might just think it 
would be easier to buy your juice the old fashion way by simply asking the biggest guy in your gym if he knows
where you could buy some.  For many of you that is not a option and being able to make a online purchase with
a reputable company would make your life much simpler.  Separating the legitimate steroid websites from the 
frauds is really not all that difficult.  You may have to search through alot of sites before you find one of 
the good guys, but if you knowing what to look for will make this quest easier.  The best way to find a 
legitimate steroid website is through a referral from a friend.  This is rather limiting to those of us who
dont know anyone who has bought steroids online, but if you sift through the volumes of comments on blogs and
forums you may get a better idea of what sites are legit and which are the fakes.  The first problem with 
researching blogs and forums though is that many sites do not allow people to discuss where to find steroid 
sources.  The second problem is that you have no way of knowing if the posts you are reading are being made
by &quot;real&quot; people and not by someone who is trying to promote their scam websites.  You could try sending 
personal messages to members whom posts indicate that they are trust worthy.  Another thing you will 
discover online is source lists being sold that promise you a list of sites that have been verified sources.
These lists are totally worthless so dont bother wasting your money on them.  Instead do your research, ask
people for their opinions and then follow 3 these rules:

1) Most importanly avoid any site that only accepts western union.  Instead only use websites that accept 
credit cards.  This protects you in two ways.  First, not any site can accept credit cards.  They need to be a
legitimate company in order to be approved.  With western union once your payment is sent you have no recourse
whatsoever.  Second, if your order does not arrive you can do a charge back on a credit card.  Most credit 
card companies will do this, but it wouldnt hurt to contact them first and find out what their policies are 
regarding charge backs.  

2) Contact the company by phone and by email.  Ask questions.  This will give you a feel as to wether they
professional or just scammers.  Check to see if they have a address on their website.  Then do a whois check
on the websites URL (website address) to see if that address matches the one on their site.  If you find 
discrepencies in addresses, phone numbers or emails then proceed with caution.

3) Ask for a free sample.  Most legitimate steroid sites are more than happy to provide you with a small 
sample of their product for no cost.  If they want to charge you for the sample or bill you for shipping 
charges then there is a good chance they are just trying to rip you off.

4) Find out what brand name of steroids they carry and then contact the manufacturer to see if the site you
are thinking of purchasing from is one of their retailers.  If they are not then the site is likely as scam.

Today steroids are availible from numerous websites, making online steroid purchases one of the most popular ways to buy.  Using the internet for your steroid purchases is a efficent way to obtain high quality products that are delivered to your door.  While buying steroids online is a effective alternative to finding a source
by asking at your local gym you do need to need to take some precautions, mostly to protect you from fraud. 
 
There are  always going to be people who will try to part you from your hard earned cash and give you nothing in return.  This is especially true when purchasing steroids online.  There are many, many steroid websites that are nothing more than scams.  Also watch out for the selective scammer.  This is a site that sometimes
sends out products and sometimes doesnt.  

It would be difficult to put a number on what percentage of steroid websites are frauds but some have estimated it to be as high as 90%.  With numbers like that you might just think it 
would be easier to buy your juice the old fashion way by simply asking the biggest guy in your gym if he knows where you could buy some.  For many of you that is not a option and being able to make a online purchase with a reputable company would make your life much simpler.  Separating the legitimate steroid websites from the frauds is really not all that difficult.  You may have to search through alot of sites before you find one of the good guys, but knowing what to look for will make this quest easier.  

The best way to find a legitimate steroid website is through a referral from a friend.  This is rather limiting to those of us who dont know anyone who has bought steroids online, but if you sift through the volumes of comments on blogs and
forums you may get a better idea of what sites are legit and which are the fakes.  The first problem with researching blogs and forums though is that many sites do not allow people to discuss where to find steroid sources.  The second problem is that you have no way of knowing if the posts you are reading are being made by &quot;real&quot; people and not by someone who is trying to promote their scam websites.  You could try sending personal messages to members whom posts indicate that they are trust worthy.  

Another thing you will discover online is source lists being sold that promise you a list of sites that have been verified sources.  These lists are totally worthless so dont bother wasting your money on them.  Instead do your research, ask
people for their opinions and then follow 4 these rules:

1) Most importanly avoid any site that only accepts western union.  Instead only use websites that accept credit cards.  This protects you in two ways.  First, not any site can accept credit cards.  They need to be a legitimate company in order to be approved.  With western union once your payment is sent you have no recourse
whatsoever.  Second, if your order does not arrive you can do a charge back on a credit card.  Most credit card companies will do this, but it wouldnt hurt to contact them first and find out what their policies are regarding charge backs.  

2) Contact the company by phone and by email.  Ask questions.  This will give you a feel as to wether they professional or just scammers.  Check to see if they have a address on their website.  Then do a whois check on the websites URL (website address) to see if that address matches the one on their site.  If you find discrepencies in addresses, phone numbers or emails then proceed with caution.

3) Ask for a free sample.  Most legitimate steroid sites are more than happy to provide you with a small sample of their product for no cost.  If they want to charge you for the sample or bill you for shipping charges then there is a good chance they are just trying to rip you off.

4) Find out what brand name of steroids they carry and then contact the manufacturer to see if the site younare thinking of purchasing from is one of their retailers.  If they are not then the site is likely as scam.

By sticking to those 3 rules you will save yourself alot of grief and frustration when searching the internet for steroid sources.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Discrete-Event Simulation==

AnyLogic provides [http://www.example.com Enterprise Library], a discrete-event simulation library containing objects you can use to rapidly simulate complex discrete-events systems like:
*Manufacturing processes with detailed shop floor layout
*Simple and complex service systems (e.g. banks, airports,hospitals etc.)
*Business processes with activity based costing
*Logistics and supply chain models

[http://www.example.com Enterprise Library] allows you to create flexible models, collect basic and advanced statistics, and effectively visualize the process you are modeling to validate and present your model.

This tutorial shows you the basic steps of creating models of different natures – in the fields of manufacturing, service and business processes. Enterprise Library allows you to create models of different natures where discrete events happen – for example, parts processing during manufacturing or document processing during document circulation. There are many other spheres where discrete event simulation can be successfully applied. Moreover, in case you need to extend your model and go beyond pure discrete event simulation, you can seamlessly use any other AnyLogic modeling techniques in your model. For instance, you can use statecharts to describe complex, non-trivial behavior. For more information about the modeling techniques and ways AnyLogic supports, please refer to AnyLogic Help.

AnyLogic provides the Enterprise Library, a discrete-event simulation library containing objects you can use to rapidly simulate complex discrete-events systems like:
*Manufacturing processes with detailed shop floor layout
*Simple and complex service systems (e.g. banks, airports, etc.)
*Business processes with activity based costing
*Logistics and supply chain models

The Enterprise Library allows you to create flexible models, collect basic and advanced statistics, and effectively visualize the process you are modeling to validate and present your model.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create models with the Enterprise Library in the fields of manufacturing and business processes.

We will create a simple service system of a bank department, consisting of an automatic teller machine and teller lines. ATM provides people with a quick self-service for cash. More complex transactions, e.g. paying bills, are completed by tellers, allowing customers more time without inconveniencing those customers looking for quick cash.

You can run this model [http://www.runthemodel.com/models/335/ online].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 1. Creating a New Model&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

First, we will create a new model.

[[Image:Step 1. Creating a new model1.gif]]'''Create a new model'''
#Click the '''New Model''' [[Image:New_model.gif]]  toolbar button. The '''New Model''' dialog box is displayed.
#Specify the name of the model. In the '''Model Name''' edit box, type &lt;tt&gt;Bank&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[Image:Step 1. Creating a New Model 1.png‎]]
#Click '''Next'''. This will open the next page of the '''New Model''' wizard. Here you can choose, whether you want to start creating a new model from scratch, or to use a model template as a starting point in model development. Since we want to explain you the whole process of creating a model in details, we will not use a template, but will create our model from scratch.
#Click '''Finish''' to complete the process.

New model is created. It already has one active object class called ''Main'' and experiment called ''Simulation''.

Active objects are the main building blocks of AnyLogic model. They can be used to model very diverse objects of the real world. 

In the center of the workspace you will see the graphical editor. It shows the diagram of the ''Main'' class. By default it does not contain any elements.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a New Model 2.png‎]]

To the left of the graphical editor you can see the '''Project''' view. The '''Project''' view provides access to AnyLogic models currently opened in the workspace. The workspace tree provides easy navigation throughout the models.

On the right side of the workspace you can see the '''Palette''' view, and at the bottom - the '''Properties''' view. The '''Palette''' view simplifies the process of drawing diagrams, providing the list of model elements grouped by categories in a number of stencils.

The '''Properties''' view is used to view and modify the properties of a currently selected model item(s). When you select something – e.g., in the '''Project''' view or in a graphical editor – the '''Properties''' view displays the properties of the selection.

When working with a model, do not forget to save it by clicking '''Save''' [[Image:Save_edit.gif]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 2. Creating a Simple Model&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now we will create the simpliest model consisting of the ATM only.&lt;/br&gt;First, we will create a flowchart describing the system.

==Creating the model flowchart==

In AnyLogic you create flowcharts by adding the objects from the library stencil onto the class diagram, setting custom properties for the objects, and connecting objects together.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add flowchart objects'''
#Add flowchart objects onto the diagram as shown below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 1.png]]&lt;/br&gt;To add a object of the library on the diagram, first open the library stencil in the '''Palette''' view, then drag the object from the library stencil into the graphical editor where you want to place the object.&lt;/br&gt;Enterprise Library stencil shows all the objects of the library.
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/topic/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Source.html Source] object. '''Source''' object generates entities with the specified interarrival time. In our example, it models customer arrival.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 2.png]]&lt;br&gt;Please refer to ''Enterprise Library Reference Guide'' for the description of all the ''Enterprise Library'' objects. You can find there all object functions and their parameters. To open ''Enterprise Library Reference Guide'', choose the corresponding item from the ''AnyLogic Help''. To invoke ''AnyLogic Help'', choose '''Help|Help Contents''' from AnyLogic menu.
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Queue.html Queue] object to model a queue of customers waiting for the moment they can be served.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 3.png]]
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Delay.html Delay] object. The '''Delay''' object models the ATM that is spending some time serving the customer.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 4.png]]
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Sink.html Sink] object. This object indicates the end of the flowchart.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 5.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Connect the flowchart objects'''
#Connect the objects as shown in the figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 6.png]]&lt;/br&gt;First, connect the port of ''source'' with the left port of ''queue'' (this port plays the role of the input port). Generally, input ports are placed on the left side of the object, while output ports - on the right.&lt;/br&gt;To connect ports of objects, double-click the first port and then click the second port. The connector linking two ports appears.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 7.png]]&lt;/br&gt;Cyan points inside ports indicate the correct connection. In the case you do not see cyan circles, it probably means that you put connector's point close by a port and you need to move it onto it.
#Connect the output port of ''queue'' with the input port of ''delay''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 8.png]]
#Connect the output port of ''delay'' with the port of ''sink''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 9.png]]

Now we will define the data of our model, adjusting the properties of the flowchart blocks. To modify properties of some model element, first select it by clicking on it in the graphical editor or in the '''Project''' view. This opens the properties of this element in the '''Properties''' view.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Set up the properties of the flowchart objects'''
#Modify the properties of the ''source''.
#*Specify how often customers arrive. Type 0.67 for '''Interarrival rate'''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 10.png]]
#Modify the properties of the ''queue''.
#*Set queue capacity to 15 entities. At most 15 customers will wait in a queue.
#*Select the '''Enable statistics''' check box to turn statistics collecting for this object on.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 11.png]]
#Modify the properties of the ''delay''. 
#*Name the object ''ATM''.
#*Specify the processing time. Assume that processing time is triangularly distributed with mean value of ''1'', min of ''0.8'' and max value of ''1.3'' minutes.
#*The &lt;tt&gt;triangular()&lt;/tt&gt; function is the standard AnyLogic random number generator. AnyLogic provides also other random number distributions, like [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/functions/normal.html normal], [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/topic/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/functions/poisson.html poisson], [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/topic/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/functions/exponential.html exponential] etc. Please refer to ''AnyLogic Help'' for the description of all the random number generators (see ''AnyLogic Functions'' topic).
#*Select the '''Enable statistics''' check box.

==Configuring the model==

Model simulation has a set of specific settings. A group of model settings is called an experiment, and experiments are displayed at the bottom of the model branch in the workspace tree. You can create several experiments for the same model with alternative model settings. One experiment is created by default and named ''Simulation''. 

If we start the model, it will work for 100 time units and then will stop. We want to study the process over a long period of time, therefore configure the model to work infinitely. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Set the model to stop never'''
#In the '''Project''' view, click the ''Simulation:Main'' experiment item.
#On the '''Model Time''' tab of the '''Properties''' window, choose '''Never''' from the '''Stop at specified time''' drop-down list.

==Running the model==

We are ready to run the model. First, build your model by clicking the '''Build Model''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model.gif‎]]  toolbar button. If there are some errors in your model, the building fails and the '''Problems''' view appears listing all the errors found in your model. Double-click an error in the list to open the location of the error and fix it.

After the model is successfully built, you can start it. Running the simulation, you automatically bring the current model up to date.  

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Start the model'''
#Click the Run [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model2.gif‎]] toolbar button and choose the experiment you want to run from the drop-down list. Your simulation experiment is called &lt;tt&gt;Bank/Simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 13.png]]&lt;/br&gt;In the case this model is the only one opened in the workspace at the moment you will be prompted to run this particular experiment. Later on this button will start the previously run experiment. To run any other experiment, right-click the experiment in the '''Project''' view and choose '''Run''' from the context menu.
#Having started the model, you will see the presentation window. It displays the presentation designed for your simulation experiment.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 14.png]]
#Click the button to '''Run the model and switch to Main view'''. and observe the process dynamics. You will see animated flowchart. Each model created with Enterprise Library instantly has animated flowchart where you can see detailed current object status, for example queue size, number of entities left and so on – completely in graphics!&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 15.png]]&lt;/br&gt;If needed, adjust the execution speed to your needs using '''Slow down''' and '''Speed up''' toolbar buttons.
#You can inspect flowchart objects to get the detailed information on their current state. Click on the object to open its inspect window. Inspect window show statistics on the object, e.g. '''Queue''' object's inspect shows the queue capacity, the number of entities passed through either port of the object and also whether the timeout option is enabled for this queue. ''Contains'' string displays the number of entities currently being in the object along with IDs of these entities.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a simple model 16.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 3. Creating a Model Animation&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Although the flowchart is animated, you may want to see the actual bank department layout animated. That is also possible! For each model you can create an animation to visually represent your model. You can create any animation you want. Now we will draw the layout consisting of the ATM and a queue. Then we will animate clients standing in the queue and using the ATM. We also want to visualize the current status of the ATM.

Now we will draw the layout of our bank. You draw the layout on the same diagram where you draw a flowchart. However, if you have existing image of the layout, you can simply import this picture as the bank layout instead of drawing it by yourself.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw an oval to depict the ATM'''
#Draw ATM as an oval. First, open the '''Presentation''' stencil of the '''Palette''' view. This stencil contains shapes and controls you can add on your presentation.&lt;/br&gt;To open some stencil of the '''Palette''' view, just click on the corresponding tab of the view.
#Drag the '''Oval''' [[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 1.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' stencil into the graphical editor (right in the place shown in the figure below).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 2.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw a polyline to depict a queue to ATM'''
#Double-click on the '''Polyline''' [[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 3.gif]] element in the palette so as its icon should turn into [[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 4.gif]]. Now you can draw a polyline point by point: subsequently click at each polyline point on the diagram and double-click to place the end point and finish drawing.
#Draw queue path as shown in the figure below. Please place the starting point (indicated in editing points mode with bold point inside) at the left, since by default entities will start waiting in a queue at polyline's end point (near ATM oval).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 5.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw a rectangle to indicate a status of the ATM'''
#Drag the '''Rectangle''' [[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 6.gif]] element in the '''Presentation''' stencil into the graphical editor. Place it between the queue path and the ATM oval.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 7.png]]
#Set up some properties for the ATM drawn. Click the '''Dynamic''' tab of the '''Properties''' view to open dynamic properties of the rectangle. Type run-time color expression for the shape in the rectangle's '''Fill Color''' dynamic property: &lt;tt&gt;ATM.size() &gt; 0 ? red : green&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 8.png]]
#Note that ATM here is the name of the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Delay.html Delay] object we created. The expression determines the rectangle color at run time. The &lt;tt&gt;size()&lt;/tt&gt; function returns the number of entities currently being processed. The color will be red, if a customer is served at this time, and green otherwise.

Now we are ready to animate the layout. This is done by setting up the animation properties for the logic flowchart objects.&lt;/br&gt;To modify properties of the object, first open its properties in the '''Properties''' view by clicking on the object in the graphical editor or in the '''Project''' view.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Set up animation for queue'''
#Set up ''queue'' animation. To animate a queue, just specify the queue path. Therefore, set ''polyline'' as the '''Animation guide shape'''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 9.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Set up animation for ATM'''
#Set ''oval'' as the '''Animation guide shape'''.
#Change '''Animation type''' to ''Single''. Many objects of the Enterprise Library support several animation styles. For example, a queue can show its contents like a line of items, a disordered heap of items, arranged items, and so on. For more information on animation styles please refer to ''Enterprise Library Reference Guide'', [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/topic/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Animating%20Active%20Objects.html Animating Enterprise Library Objects] help topic. In this case, the ATM will be animated by a single animation of a customer being served.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Creating a model animation 10.png]]

Now you can run the model and observe its behavior. If you want to speed up the simulation significantly, switch to virtual time mode by clicking the Toggle real/virtual time mode toolbar button. Switching to virtual time mode allows you to view simulation run at its maximum speed. Therefore, you can simulate a long period of time.

Note that when the ATM station is serving a customer, it becomes red, and when it is idle, it is green.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 4. Collecting Utilization Statistics&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

With AnyLogic, you can collect complicated statistics whenever you need them. The objects of the Enterprise Library are already capable of collecting the basic statistics. All you need is to turn the statistics collection for the object on, as it is disabled by default to speed up the model execution. Since we have already done this earlier, now we are ready to view the statistics collected for the flowchart objects with charts. 

We want to observe how mean ATM utilization and mean queue length change with time.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add a bar chart to indicate mean ATM utilization'''
#Open the '''Analysis''' stencil of the '''Palette''' view. This stencil contains charts and data objects used for collecting data and performing various statistical analysis on them. Drag the '''Bar Chart''' [[File:Step 4. Collecting utilization statistics 1.gif]] element from the stencil into the graphical editor and then resize it.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Collecting utilization statistics 2.png]]
#Go to the '''Properties''' of the chart. Click '''Add Data Item''' to add data item to be displayed by this chart.
#Modify the data item's '''Title''': ''ATM utilization''.
#Type &lt;tt&gt;ATM.statsUtilization.mean()&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Value''' of the data item. Here &lt;tt&gt;ATM&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the '''Delay''' object we created. Each '''Delay''' object has &lt;tt&gt;statsUtilization&lt;/tt&gt; data set that collects statistics on the object utilization. The &lt;tt&gt;mean()&lt;/tt&gt; is the function that returns the mean value measured. You can use other methods to get statistical values, such as &lt;tt&gt;min()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt;. You can find the list of all the methods on the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/javadoc/com/xj/anylogic/engine/analysis/StatisticsContinuous.html StatisticsContinuous] page.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Collecting utilization statistics 3.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add a bar chart to indicate mean queue length'''
#Add one more bar chart in the same way. Resize it to look like the one in the figure.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Collecting utilization statistics 4.png]]
#Open the '''Appearance''' tab of the '''Properties''' view and choose the first option from the '''Bars Direction''' section to make bars grow to the left.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Collecting utilization statistics 5.png]]
#Add a data item to be displayed by the chart. Set '''Title''': ''Queue length'' and '''Value''': &lt;tt&gt;queue.statsSize.mean()&lt;/tt&gt; Here &lt;tt&gt;statsSize&lt;/tt&gt; is the data set of type [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/javadoc/com/xj/anylogic/engine/analysis/StatisticsContinuous.html StatisticsContinuous] that collects the statistics on the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Queue.html Queue] size.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Collecting utilization statistics 6.png]]

Run the model and observe the ATM utilization and mean queue length with just created charts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One thing that can slow you down when you are getting started or trying to do some rapid prototyping is to export functions all the time. Rather, you can use the compiler directive. This makes programming erlang much more enjoyable, not to have to manually type:

  export(function_not_an_other_one/4).

everytime you add a function and would like to test it. Rather, you can use:

  compile(export_all).

You can manually export only the things you need to when you are done with the program.

Another handy trick is to use

  42&gt; make:all([load]). 

Rather than compile the latest version all the time.

  43&gt; c(my_module_v17).

or is it 

  44&gt; c(my_module_v18).

?Module in code gives the current module name, which is super helpful when spawning.

  spawn(?Module, fun_name, arity),

Otherwise, you need to change the module name in every spawn every time you change the name of the module.
If you would like to keep an eye on a process you can monitor it, after you have registered it.

  45&gt; register(my_loop, spawn(my_module, my_loop, [])).
  46&gt; Mon_my_loop = erlang:monitor(process, my_loop).

A helpful utility function is rpc.

  rpc(Dest, Msg) -&gt;
    To ! {self(), Msg},
    receive
      {Dest, Answer} -&gt; Answer
    after 1000 -&gt;
      {Dest, did_not_answer_msg, Msg}
    end.

This helps keep synchronous commands between processes from getting answers from the wrong process. We force the identification of the process providing the answer, and sequential queuing should handle the rest.

==Fajarowicz variation==
The Fajarowicz variation or Fajarowicz gambit is said to have its origins in the chess circles from Leipzig, with the first important game being H.Steiner – Fajarowicz at the 1928 Wiesbaden tournament.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Black makes no immediate effort to regain the gambit pawn, preferring to concentrate on active piece play. As the game develops, White has to avoid several tactical pitfalls, in particular a Bb4+ at an annoying moment; a Qf6 doing a double attack on b2 and f2; (after 1...d6 2.exd6 Bxd6) the pseudo-sacrifice 3...Nxf2 4.Kxf2 Bg3+ and 5...Qxd1, winning White's queen for two minor pieces; and, once White has played e3, a concerted attack on the d3 square with the setup Nc5/Bf5/Nb4.

According to Borik, the best moves for both players are 4.Nf3 Bb4+ 5.Nd2 Nc6 6.a3 Nxd2 7.Nxd2 Bf8 when it is difficult for Black to justify his pawn sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; The variation 4.a3 also gives Black some headache, disallowing the check on b4 and preparing to attack the knight with Qc2. The response 4...Qh4?!, introduced in O'Kelly – Bisguier (1969) is dubious after 5.g3 Qh5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Qc2!

==Minor variations==
===4.Qd3 and 4.Qd4===
Both 4.Qd3 and 4.Qd4 seem to gain a tempo by attacking the Ne4, but after 4...Nc5 followed by 5...Nc6 Black gets his tempo back and the queen remains misplaced. Black can develop with d6 its Bb8 with the pawn exchange d7–d6, and then setup an attack on the light squares c2 and d3 with moves like Bf5 and Nb4. It is important that Black gets the move d7–d6 soon enough, as he must be able to answer a possible Bc1–g5 with Qd8–d7. In that way he avoids an exchange of pieces and the queen can still play on the light squares via the f5-square. If White gets his queen on g3, Black can protect his g7-pawn with Nc5–e6 when the white queen will soon reveal to be misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===4.Qd5===
The move 4.Qd5 seems better than 4.Qd3 or 4.Qd4 as the queen cannot readily be attacked by the black knights. Borik recommends 4...Bb4+ (considered as &quot;playable&quot; by Lalic) so that White has the annoying choice between giving his bishop pair with 5.Bd2, wrecking his pawn structure with 5.Nc3, or blocking his own bishop with 5.Nd2. In that latter case, an important tactical finess is that after the possible 5...Nc5 6.a3 Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 b6! White cannot take the black rook because of 8.Qxa8? Bb7 9.Qxa7 Nc6 that wins the white queen.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p66; Borik says it has been suggested by J.Staker.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Black can freely develop its queenside, harass the white queen and later regain the e5-pawn.

===4.Nd2===
The cautious 4.Nd2 allows the retreat 4...Nc5, letting the Nd2 misplaced and obstructing the Bc1. Then the hasty 5.b4 runs into 5...Ne6 6.a3&amp;nbsp;a5! and the attack on the b4-pawn forces White to give away the c5-square with 7.b5. Black has a good game as he can install a knight on the strongpost c5 and then concentrate on regaining the e5-pawn.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; White does better with 5.Ngf3 Nc6 and a transposition in the 4.Nf3 variation.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White immediately attacks the Ne4, but takes care not to put the queen on a square where Black could attack it while developing (as would be the case after 4.Qd3 or 4.Qd4). Now any retreat by the Ne4 would mean that Black loses his advance in development, in which case he no longer has any compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Thus Black must continue to develop while trying to keep the Ne4 on its square, but that is by no means easy. Borik thinks 4.Qc2 is the one &quot;that gives Black the most problems to solve&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Borik68&quot;&gt;Borik 1986, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; but Lalic does not agree at all, stating that the reply &quot;4...Bb4+ [....] followed by d7–d5 ensures Black rapid development and plenty of counterplay, it is for this reason that 4.Qc2 is not on the danger list&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

|The line 3...Ne4 4.Qc2 d5}}
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 4.Qc2 d5''

The reply '''4...d5''' protects the Ne4, opens the way for the Bc8 and leads to a good position for Black after various natural White's moves:
* 5.cxd5 allows Black to develop its queen with 5...Qxd5, when White is not able to keep the e5-pawn and parry the various threats on the a5–e1 diagonal on the same time, for example 6.Nc3 Nxc3 7.Qxc3 Nc6 with the double threat Qxe5 and Bb4, or 6.Nd2 Bb4 7.Ngf3 Nc6 8.a3 Bxd2+ 9.Bxd2 Nxd2 10.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 11.Kxd2 Bg4 followed by O-O-O and Rhe8.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Lalic points out that Black can also go for 5...Bf5! 6.Qa4+ c6 7.d6 Qb6 8.e3 Nd7 with advantage to Black.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.150&lt;br&gt;Molina – G.Gomez, Argentina 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
* 5.Nf3? Bf5 (threatening 6...Ng3) 6.Qa4+ Nc6 7.Be3 Bb4+ 8.Nbd2 d4! and White has more and more problems to solve with g7–g5 to come.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.68&lt;br&gt;Mititelu – Seineanu, Romania 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not, however, stand up against the best white continuation, so that Lalic considers it to be &quot;objectively not entirely sound&quot; and &quot;dubious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.149, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; After White's best reply '''5.exd6''' removing the Ne4 from its outpost with 5...Nxd6 would mean the failure of Black's dynamic strategy, so Black continues to develop with '''5...Bf5''', in the same time creating the threat 6...Ng3. Now again White has opportunities to go astray:
* 6.dxc7 is too greedy, giving an important tempo and opening the d-file for the Ra8. Black continues with Qxc7, Nc6 and O-O-O, then depending on the circumstances he can create pressure on the d3-square with Nc5 and Nb4.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.70&lt;br&gt;Rössner – Kipke, Berlin 1933&lt;br&gt;Krastev – Donev, Bulgaria 1954&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6.Qa4+ and 6.Qb3 lose at least two tempi as the white queen will again be under attack when Black plays Ne4–c5. Black easily develops his pieces with Nc6, Bxd6 and an attack along the central columns.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.71–73&lt;br&gt;Steiner – Fajarowicz, Wiesbaden 1928&lt;br&gt;Gilfer – Richter, Munich Olympiad 1936&lt;/ref&gt;
But White can benefit from the pin of the Ne4 (as the Bf5 is not protected) with the paradoxical '''6.Nc3!''' when White keeps his queen under the threat of the Bf5 but develops his pieces and attacks the Ne4 once more. Now the e4-knight has only two discoveries that protect the Bf5, but 6...Ng3 fails to the tactical 7.Qa4+ Bd7 8.dxc7 Qxc7 9.Nb5! and White wins. Thus Black has only '''6...Nxd6''' to keep the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

Now a retreat with the white queen would give a development advantage to Black, so White uses the fact that his sixth move has given him enough control of the e4-square to play '''7.e4!''', preparing the development of the Bf1 and attacking the Bf5. Unfortunately for Black any reasonable defence like 7...Qe7 or 7...Bg6 would give White the time to catch up in development, and remain a pawn up. Thus Black's best option is the piece sacrifice '''7...Nxe4''' to grab a pawn and tempt White into a fire of tactical pressure. The acceptance of the sacrifice with 8.Nxe4 gives Black enough play for the piece, e.g. after 8...Bb4+ 9.Ke2 Nc6 10.Be3 Qe7 11.f3 O-O-O.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.75, citing Nikolay Minev in the ''Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings''&lt;/ref&gt; White does best to give up an exchange and continue his development with '''8.Bd3!''' when after the possible 8...Nxf2 9.Bxf5 Nxh1 10.Nf3 White has an enormous lead of development for his material investment.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.76&lt;br&gt;Kottnauer – Martin, Czechoslovakia vs France 1946&lt;/ref&gt; White's position is to be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.151&lt;br&gt;Molo – Angulo, Correspondence 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Borik proposes to revive the variation with 10...g6, but then Lalic argues that 10...g6? 11.Bg5! Be7 12.Rd1 leaves White on top.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

|The line 3...Ne4 4.Qc2 Bb4+}}
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 4.Qc2 Bb4+''

Instead of 4...d5, more cunning is '''4...Bb4+''' to pin the white pieces before deciding what to do with the Ne4.&lt;ref&gt;According to Borik 1986, p.79, this is an idea from the master Hermann Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; White cannot reply 5.Bd2 as he would lose the bishop pair and Black would easily regain the e5-pawn with Nc6/Qe7/O-O/Re8. After 5.Nd2 this knight is misplaced and blocks the Bc1, so Black can open the game with 5...d5 in favourable circumstances, when White can continue in several directions but Black gets a good game in all cases:
* 6.cxd5 will probably transpose into the 4.Qc2 d5 5.cxd5 variation, which is not very good as Black develops his queen with tempo.
* 6.e3 is a bit passive, e.g. 6...Bf5 7.Bd3 Qg5! 8.g3 Nd7 9.Ngf3 and here Borik recommends 9...Qh5 with a good attack, a possibility that is also endorsed by Tseitlin.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.80&lt;br&gt;Timet – Meyer, Zagreb 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6.Nf3 was tried in 1987 for the first time by Stohl, but after 6...Bf5 7.Qb3 Nc6 8.cxd5 Nc5 9.Qx4 b5 10.Qf4 Qxd5 11.Qxf5 Ne4! Tseitlin considers &quot;Black's threats are difficult to meet&quot;. Note that Lalic considers 6...Bf5 to be an error on the basis of the continuation 7.Qb3! Bxd2+ but he fails to consider Tseitlin's reply 7...Nc6.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.136&lt;br&gt;Stohl – Trapl, Namestrova 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.149&lt;br&gt;Hertneck – Trapl, Germany 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6.exd6 is considered an error by Lalic but after 6...Bf5! he only looks at 7.Qa4+ and fails to consider Borik's recommendation 7.a3 Bxd2+ 8.Bxd2 Qxd6, when Black has enough compensation for the pawn with his active Ne4 and Bf5.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.81–82&lt;br&gt;Antainen – Nieminen, Finnish Correspondence Championship 1973&lt;br&gt;Bascau – Meewes, correspondence 1971&lt;br&gt;Laghkva – Contendini, Leipzig Olympiad 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

The other possibility for White is '''5.Nc3''' so that the Bc1 is not blocked. Black continues with 5...d5 when White should avoid the natural continuation 6.cxd5?! Qxd5 7.Bd2 Qxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Nxd2 9.Kxd2 Nc6 because he has no satisfactory way to save the e5-pawn (e.g. 10.Nf3?! Bg4 11.e3 O-O-O+ 12.Kc2 Bf5+ etc.) so that Black gets a favourable endgame.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.148&lt;br&gt;Cruz Lopez – Bellon Lopez, Lerida 1991&lt;/ref&gt; After the better 6.exd6 (instead of 6.cxd5?!) 6...Bf5 7.Bd2 Nxd6 8.e4 Bxc3 9.Bxc3 Bxe4 Black has regained his pawn but White has the bishop pair and possibilities of an attack on the kingside.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of 8.e4 White can also try 8.Qb3 Nc6 9.e3 Qe7 10.Nf3 O-O-O but Black has good counterplay for the pawn.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

==3.What types of documentation may be necessary for travel?  Explain the purpose of each type of document.==
===Driver's License===
A driver's license is necessary in order to legally operate a motor vehicle on a public road.

Many groups of countries have agreed to recognise driving licences issued by authorities of any of its members. Examples include the European Union and the GCC, where holders of driving licences issued by any member state can drive in all member states. Most countries worldwide will also recognize the licenses of citizens of foreign states wishing to drive as visitors. All EU member countries now issue licenses in a standard format, regardless of the language of the license.

The International Driving Permit (IDP) (sometimes erroneously called the International Driver's License) is a booklet which is an authorized translation of a driver's home license into many languages (especially languages with different scripts such as Russian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.). In some cases, it is obtained from a motoring organization such as the Automobile Association or the equivalent in the driver's home country. In other cases, it is delivered by the same government services that deliver ordinary licenses. The IDP has no validity except when used in conjunction with the driver's own license. The existence of the IDP is necessitated by many countries refusing to recognize driver's licenses written in foreign languages without accompanying translations.

The People's Republic of China at present does not recognize IDPs (although Hong Kong and Macau do) and requires drivers to get an additional PRC licence before being officially allowed on all roads. Holders of foreign licences are exempt from certain requirements when obtaining a PRC licence.

===Passport===
A passport is a document, issued by a national government, which certifies, for the purpose of international travel, the identity and nationality of its holder. The elements of identity are name, date of birth, sex, and place of birth. Most often, nationality and citizenship are congruent.

A passport does not of itself entitle the passport holder entry into another country, nor to consular protection while abroad or any other privileges, in the absence of any special agreements which cover the situation. It does, however, normally entitle the passport holder to return to the country that issued the passport. Rights to consular protection arise from international agreements, and the right to return arises from the laws of the issuing country. A passport does not represent the right or the place of residence of the passport holder in the country that issued the passport.
===Visa===
A visa is an indication that a person is authorized to enter the country which &quot;issued&quot; the visa, subject to permission of an immigration official at the time of actual entry. The authorization may be a document, but more commonly it is a stamp or sticker endorsed in the applicant's passport. Some countries do not require a visa in some situations, such as a result of reciprocal treaty arrangements. The country issuing the visa typically attaches various conditions to the visa, such as the time that the visa is valid, the period that the person may stay in the country, whether the visa is valid for more than one visit, the type of travel that is permitted (business, tourist, study) etc. The possession of a visa is not in itself a guarantee of entry into the country that issued it, and a visa can be revoked at any time.

==4.Watch a travelogue program that shows travel scenery and geography of a unique location.==
The Globe Trekker travelogue program airs in the United States on many PBS stations.  You can also find travelogues on websites such as Hulu, or on DVD at various retail outlets. 

AdventSource sells an Adventist-produced travelogue video series created specifically for this honor, called &quot;The Nature of God in Nature&quot;.  There are currently two episodes:  ''Hawaii'' and ''The Lake District''. Both come with English and Spanish audio options.

==5.Discuss in a group setting what kind of attitude travelers should have when traveling abroad.==

Always show respect for other people and cultures.
Learn about customs and protocol and try not to be offensive.  
Do not act like you come from a superior place - everywhere is different in various ways.
Do not expect things to be like home. If things were like home there would be no reason to travel.
If people do not speak your language (ie English) they are not stupid. Learn a few words of their language and bring a phrasebook.

==6.Create a simple 7-day trip plan for a “family vacation.”  As part of your plan, create a 7-day trip planner and include:==
===a.Details on one historic place to visit===
===b.Details on two natural sites to visit===
===c.Details on one recreational site to visit===
'''&lt;big&gt;Note:  the first and last days may be travel days&lt;/big&gt;'''

==7. List a few different ways people got around in Bible times.==
In Bible times there were not many options for getting around.  People either walked, rode on an animal (donkey, horse, camel), rode in a cart or wagon pulled by an animal, or took a boat or a ship to their destination.  Rich people had a few more options including being carried on a litter (an item of furniture mounted on poles and carried by a team of people), or riding in a chariot.

==8.Calculate approximately how long it would take to walk between Jerusalem and Damascus.==
Depending on the route taken, the distance between Jerusalem and Damascus is anywhere between {{units|300km|190 miles}} and {{units|240 km|150 miles}}.  It's probably safe to assume that the longer of these distances is the most accurate.

Long-distance hikers can cover about {{units|50 km|30 miles}} in a day.  However, in order for them to do this, they must be in top condition traveling over easy terrain.  A well-seasoned hiker can cover {{units|25 km|15 miles}} per day, every day, for an extended period of time.  We should assume the lower of these two figures.  

From this information, we can calculate that it would take on the order of &lt;math&gt;\frac{300km}{25km/day} = 12\ days&lt;/math&gt; to cover that distance.

==9.Sketch a map of a trip mentioned in the Bible:==
===a.Show name of person(s) and path taken including notable stops made.===
===b.Show different types of lines for each different mode of transport taken.===
===c.Show a “legend/key” for identifying markings and transport types.===
'''&lt;big&gt;Note:  You may have to logically guess some aspects of the information if not mentioned directly in scripture.&lt;/big&gt;'''
A non-exhaustive list of examples might include: 
* Abram trip to Canaan or Egypt
* Jesus and family flight to Egypt
* Children of Israel Exodus from Egygt
* Paul's missionary journeys
* Jonah's travels
* Ezra or Nehemiah's travels

If this honor is being earned in a group session, it would be nice to have each Pathfinder select a different person/group and route to research and present to the class at the next meeting. Online maps would be a good start to relate the story of the Biblical trip to modern borders and cities. This should be a learning experience and perhaps the Pathfinder will have the opportunity to follow the same path in person someday.

To assist the injured in getting aid, most countries have designated a specific number as a universal emergency telephone number. Another name for it is the emergency services number. Dialing this number should connect you to the nearest EMS call center. With mobile phones, it may be advantageous to use a local number, as the recognized call center may be incorrect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I love, and dislike cooperative learning. I love it because it is actually an effective strategy for getting students to work together, yet still have individual accountability. On the other hand, I dislike cooperative learning to a certain extent because it involves students working with other students. This is not to say that I am against students working with their peers because I am not. Whether they want to or not, there are going to be situations where students will have to work with people they may not like or are uncomfortable with. It does not make them abnormal or anti-social, but it is a lesson they will have to take with them once they graduate from high school. The reason I dislike students working with other students, no matter how much individuality is involved, is that some students simply do not like working with other students. I would know, because I am one of them. I work very well with others, however, I strongly prefer working alone. So I understand how some students might feel the same way. Therefore, it is a very beneficial that cooperative learning’s advantages significantly outweigh its disadvantages because of the individual accountability. Although it is somewhat of a new strategy, I plan on using cooperative learning significantly in my classroom. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 03:16, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Cooperative learning is a very helpful method for teaching in the classroom.  It is a nice alternative to the typical bookwork assignment or worksheet.  Cooperative learning requires full participation from the entire class.  A lot of cooperative learning activities require students to get up and move around the classroom.  This movement stimulates cognitive processes and helps students to reinforce concepts in new ways. I agree that sometimes students want to work alone or they do not want to participate in a group activity.  However, it is good sometimes to push students at an appropriate level to get outside of their comfort zone and to participate in a cooperative learning activity.

== Overview ==

The '''''Permanent Sticking Charm''''' is used to permanently fasten one object onto another.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Although we are never informed how to perform this charm, we do see its results; and we are led to believe that it is effectively irrevocable.

We first see this charm used, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], in the entrance hall of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|his mother]] had affixed her portrait to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm, and Sirius has been completely unable to remove it.

Sirius Black later tells Harry about the tapestry showing the family tree of the &quot;most Ancient and Honourable House of Black.&quot; This tapestry is also affixed to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] threaten to fasten [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]] badge to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm when he seems unable to decide where to keep it.

In the first chapter of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the Muggle Prime Minister recalls his efforts to remove a portrait in a distant corner of his office. From the description of his efforts and how they had failed, we can guess that this portrait, which is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|Wizarding portrait]] used for communications between the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and the Prime Minister's office, is affixed to the wall of the office with a Permanent Sticking Charm.

Finally, when Harry visits Sirius' room for the first time in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], he finds that many pictures and tokens of Sirius' stay in Gryffindor House had been attached to the walls with Permanent Sticking Charms. One assumes that Sirius had done this to irritate his parents. Perhaps curiously, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus]]' room, similarly decorated with Slytherin memorabilia, is not described as having had that charm used; perhaps Regulus, as he was not rebelling against his parents, did not fear that his decorations would be disturbed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is geology? Defined broadly, geology is the study of rocks. Geology has a number of topics: palaeontology (study of fossils), Plate Tectonics (Movement of the plates), Erosion (breaking down of rocks), and a whole number of different topics. The aim is to give you basic knowledge of geology. To know more, try looking round your local library and have a look at the References and External Links.

NOTE: There is a reasonable amount of confusion of how to classify geology: some classify it as a subject on its' own, others classify it as a form of science. I personally class it as a topic of geography. 

==The basics==
It is vital in geology to understand the three ways rocks form:

===Sedimentary===
Sediments (such as teeth, rocks and sand) settle on the bottom of a riverbed. Over millions of years, these sediments compress together to form sedimentary rock. The sediments may have got to the riverbed in a number of ways: they could be from eroded cliffs, and gradually layers got deposited ('dumped' in one place by the forces of the currents) and compressed over time. Sedimentary rocks are layered into strata, with the newest rocks above the older. If a really strong force (such as movement of the plates) occurs, the layers, or strata, could be ordered differently: for example, the rocks may be older the further along the cliff you walk opposed to the height of the cliff. Different sediments form different sedimentary rocks: for example, sandstone is formed from sand sediments and mudstone is formed from mud sediments. Sedimentary rocks tend to be the 'weakest' of the three, as Igneous and Metamorphic rocks both undergo extreme pressures to form. 

===Igneous===
These rocks are characteristic of their resistance to weathering and their crystals. Igneous rocks are formed in two ways: from molten rock (magma) underground or from lava (from an erupted volcano). Both forms involve lots of heat and pressure. You can tell which way Igneous rock formed by analysing the crystals. The Igneous rocks that have formed underground in the mantle tend to have quite large crystals, because rock takes a long time to cool underground, opposing being spewed out to sea- which cools the molten rock very quickly. Granite is a typical example of Igneous rock that has formed underground: it is very tough, has quite large crystals, and is very resistant to weathering. Dykes and Sills are formed when lava runs through other rocks, giving it characteristic layering. 

===Metamorphic===
These rocks have undergone extreme pressures to form and, like Igneous rocks, are very tough and resistant to weathering. They are formed in a number of ways: a Sedimentary, Igneous or Metamorphic rock could come into contact with molten rock in the mantle, therefore altering its' composition. Metamorphic rocks tends to be common in mountainous regions: mountains form when plates push together, forming a subduction zone where one plate sinks under the other. The forces involved are unimaginable. Marble is a quite valuable example of Metamorphic rock, other rocks and minerals can be seen inside the Marble, as all kinds of rocks are caught in the process of metamorphism. 

==The Plates==
Plate Tectonics is the movement of the Plates. The Continents of the Earth may seem immovable, but they have been moving throughout history and gradually still are. Perhaps the most famous past position of the continents is during the Triassic era, when all the continents were together, forming the Supercontinent Pangea. The past positions of the Plates can help Geologists solve a number of mysteries: like why the White Cliffs of Dover are exactly the same as those off a shore in France. When Plates meet they behave in a number of different ways. They could move apart, collide or move along the fault line that is caused by the meeting. Fault lines are the plate boundaries that rise when the two plates collide, forming jugged, rocky formations, a bit like when cars crash. They also cause Metamorphism, explaining why much of the world's mountains are made mainly of Metamorphic rock. India is currently further colliding with the Asian plate. The immense force of this collision is what formed the Himalayas, which Everest is in. However, the colliding of Plates can also lower land level, because one Plate always sinks in the process of Subduction (explained in Metamorphic section).

==Erosion==
I like to think of Erosion as the 'Digesting of rocks', because Erosion 'breaks down' rocks, making it an important part of forming Sedimentary rocks and therefore the Rock Cycle. The Sea is a big part of erosion: when the waves lash at the cliffs, the rock may dissolve, or it may break off the cliff, sometimes forming interesting patterns such as caves and arches, where the 'weaker' material is eroded first. Glaciers can erode rocks in the same way as the sea can, cracking rock in narrow gauges and valleys. Much of the valleys we see today were 'calved' by Glaciers. Ice is chemically less dense than liquid water, which is why it is always the top of rivers and lakes which freezes over first. If there is a chip in a rock, drops of rain can find its' way into the rock. If a really cold day follows, the water freezes, therefore expanding, which cracks open the rock. Examples include cracked rock near drainpipes. There was a significant amount of this form of Erosion during the Ice Age. Corrosion, or chemical weathering, is common where there is lots of pollution. Rain is slightly acidic, due to the dissolved carbon that it contains, which over time can roughen the sides of rock and monuments. Industrial chemicals (such as Sulphur) can also dissolve in the rain, further increasing the acidity. The power of river currents is a big part of erosion. The current in the river erodes away the bedrock, and loose rock travels with the river. It may be deposited which over time, may form sedimentary rocks. The erosive power of a river is revealed when it floods. The wind is a major force behind erosion, particularly in deserts where sand is forcefully flung onto rocks. The wind can also speed up other erosive forces (such as the sea). Biological weathering is common on about any old building. The process of biological weathering is similar to the erosion caused by freezing: as the plant grows, it may find itself trapped by rocks (such as in a patio). As the plant grows more and more the crack it is growing in expands further, damaging the rock. Last but not least is onion skin weathering. When the temperature cools, a rock will contract. When the temperature rises, rock expands. If these temperature changes are frequent and severe, the constant expanding and contracting makes the rock weaken and 'peel off' like layers of an onion. Onion Skin is common in Desert climates. 

==Minerals==
Minerals are the elements or compounds we find in rock. Some minerals are worth lots as jewellery, others in industry. Oxygen and Silicon are the most abundant elements in minerals, making up over half the minerals on Earth. The atomic formation in minerals make them have different characteristics. Pollutants and impurities can change some of the characteristics of minerals: hence the wide variety of Quartz colours and the bluish tinge of copper on iron. One characteristic that is useful in telling minerals apart is the hardness scale, devised by Friedrich Mohs. The scale shows resistance to scratching by other minerals.Diamond is the hardest mineral and will scratch all other minerals, without getting scratched itself, Talc is at the other end of the scale, being the weakest mineral. 

==Fossils==
Fossils are the preserved remains of an organism that lived in the past. As sediment settles in the seabed or riverbed, organisms may be trapped in the process, the sediment protecting the body from decay. It is only usually the teeth, shell, or bones of an organism that get preserved, and rarely do any organic remains preserve: they usually get replaced by minerals such as Pyrite. Fossils tell us many clues about Earth's history: such as the past position of the Plates or mass extinctions or disasters. Fossils can tell us how old a rock is. But to be a 'zone' fossil, the organism must be common throughout the globe, but at the same time, have a relatively short period of time on the planet e.g. an organism that lived for over 200 million years would not tell us the age of the rock accurately, unless the organism had many short-lived species. 

==Quiz==
# Which rock type can be produced when other rocks erode?
# Which rock type is produced when other rocks melt;
# and how would the rocks melt; 
# and why is the new rock not metamorphic? 

==Answers==
# Sedimentary rock
# Igneous rock
# In the mantle
# Because not all Igneous rock is formed from other rock; metamorphic rocks are 'second-hand'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 5. Adding Custom Animations for Clients&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

At the moment bank clients are displayed on the animation as small rectangles. Now we want to define some custom animation for bank clients. You can use for that any existing image or draw some sophisticated animation using primitive AnyLogic shapes. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw a group of shapes to represent a bank client'''
#Draw animation for customer as shown in the following figure. Draw it using polyline and oval.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Adding custom animations for clients1.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Add just drawn shapes to the group'''
#Select the oval and the polyline. 
#Right-click the selection and choose '''Grouping|Create a group''' from the popup menu.
#You will see the group icon appeared in the centre of the selection.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Adding custom animations for clients 2.png]]
#Select the group and modify its properties.Name the group ''customerShape''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Adding custom animations for clients 3.png]]
#Select shapes and belittle them by dragging the handles.
#We want to place the group outside the presentation area. Therefore, drag the diagram down with right mouse button pressed. Then drag the group of shapes above the flowchart as shown on the figure.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Adding custom animations for clients 4.png]]&lt;/br&gt;Successfully added shapes will move along with the group. If some shape stays where it is, it means it was not added to the group and you need to redo the previous steps.

Now tell the source object that generated entities should be represented by this group of shapes.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Modify the source properties'''
#Select the ''source'' object.
#Type &lt;tt&gt;customerShape&lt;/tt&gt; as '''Entity animation shape'''. You can use code completion assistant.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Adding custom animations for clients 5.png]]

Run the model and view the animation.

:[[File:Step 5. Adding custom animations for clients5.png]]&lt;/br&gt;You can see customers are represented by our custom shapes now.

This model demonstrated the basics of the Enterprise Library. Now we are ready to create more advanced model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 6. Adding Tellers&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

Now we will create another part of the system by adding tellers that are working at the bank. Now some clients will come to see tellers, some – to access the ATM. We can model tellers using delays in the same way as we modeled ATM. However, modeling tellers using resources is much more convenient. Resource is a special unit that can be possessed by entity. Only one entity can possess a resource at a time; therefore entities compete for resources.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Modify the flowchart'''
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Service.html Service] object.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 1.png]]&lt;/br&gt;'''Service''' seizes resource units for the entity, delays the entity, and releases the seized units.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Modify the object properties:
#*There is one queue for all tellers. Set up '''Queue capacity''' to be of 20 places.
#*We assume that service time is triangularly distributed with the min value of 2.5, average value of 6, and the max value of 11 minutes. Set '''Delay time''': &lt;tt&gt;triangular( 2.5, 6, 11 )&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 2.png]]
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/ResourcePool.html ResourcePool] object. '''ResourcePool''' object is storage for resource units. It should be connected to resource seizing and releasing objects ('''Service''' in our case). So connect it to the lower port of the ''service'' object.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 3.png]]&lt;/br&gt;Name the object ''tellers''. Specify that this resource object has only four resource units: define its '''Capacity''': 4&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 4.png]]
#Place [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/SelectOutput.html SelectOutput] object. '''SelectOutput''' object is a decision making block. The entity arrived at the object is forwarded along one of two output ports depending on the user-defined condition.&lt;/br&gt;Leave the default object properties. The entity routing condition &lt;tt&gt;randomTrue(0.5)&lt;/tt&gt; defines that the number of customers competing for ATM and teller service will be approximately equal.&lt;/br&gt;Connect ''selectOutput'' and ''service'' to other objects as shown in the figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 5.png]]

Since the model changed, we need to alter the model animation as well.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Modify the animation'''
#Draw a polyline to animate the waiting customers queue. Draw it from left to right. Name the polyline ''queueBeforeTellers''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 6.png]]
#Draw a polyline with four points to the right of ''queueBeforeTellers''. This polyline will indicate where teller animations are placed. Name it ''tellerPlaces''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 7.png]]

Now we will animate our tellers by defining two images representing tellers being idle and busy. AnyLogic will automatically switch between these images when the resource unit becomes seized and released.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Animate tellers'''
#Drag '''Image''' from the '''Presentation''' stencil to the place shown in the figure with a blue crossed rectangle.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 8.png]]
#Go to the '''Properties''' of the image shape. Name the image ''busyTeller''.
#Define the image that this shape will display. Use '''Add Image''' button to add ''Teller Busy.png''. You can find this file in the folder where ''Billing Department'' sample model is located (somewhat like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;AnyLogic folder&gt;\plugins\com.xj.anylogic.examples.&lt;build number&gt;\models\Billing Department&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/br&gt;You will see the added image in the preview area.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 9.png]]
#Select the '''Original Size''' check box. If '''Original Size''' option is not selected, the picture is shown to fit the rectangle of the image shape, and otherwise the picture is shown without any distortions.
#Create one more image to show relaxing teller. Name it ''idleTeller'' and choose ''Teller Idle.png'' as the image displayed by this shape.

Now we will animate the flowchart by setting up animation properties of the flowchart objects.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Animate the model logic'''
#Now we need to animate customers queue. Therefore, modify the ''service'' properties:
#*Set ''queueBeforeTellers'' as '''Animation guide shape (queue)'''&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 10.png]]
#To animate tellers, modify the ''tellers'' properties:
#*Specify ''tellerPlaces'' as '''Animation guide shape'''
#*Choose '''Set''' as '''Animation type'''
#*Set ''idleTeller'' as '''Idle unit animation shape'''
#*Set ''busyTeller'' as '''Busy unit animation shape'''&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 11.png]]

In the current model the number of tellers is fixed. However, we may need to vary it dynamically at the model run time. AnyLogic provides a set of controls enabling changing the model parameters. Now we will add a slider to vary the number of tellers at run time.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Add a slider to vary the number of tellers'''
#Add a slider. Open the '''Controls''' stencil of the '''Palette''' and drag the '''Slider''' element from there into the graphical editor. Place it below our '''ResourcePool''' object to let the user know that this slider will vary the capacity of this particular object.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 12.png]]
#We want to vary the number of tellers in the system from 0 to 4. Therefore, set 4 as slider’s '''Maximum value'''.
#Type &lt;tt&gt;tellers.capacity&lt;/tt&gt; as the slider's '''Default value'''.
#Specify &lt;tt&gt;tellers.set_capacity((int)value);&lt;/tt&gt; as slider's '''Action'''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding tellers 13.png]]

Run the model. You can see tellers being animated with our images. Now you can change the number of tellers with the slider. Therefore, you can see how many tellers you need for the specific customer arrival rate.

The move '''4.Nf3''' develops a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. Tseitlin considers 4...Bb4+ to be the best reply,&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; but the most common move is still 4...Nc6 and both moves often transposes anyway. 

== 4...Nc6 ==
''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 4.Nf3 Nc6''

After the continuation 5.Nbd2 Bb4 6.a3 Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 much will depend on whether Black can get his pawn back or not, and in what conditions. Tseitlin gives a line starting by 9...O-O as leading to a White advantage,&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not clear that Black's king belongs to the kingside, as Lalic explains:&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The plan of castling queenside enables Black to play for g7–g5, intending to undermine the defence of the e-pawn or simply to launch an attack if White has still had the courage to castle kingside.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Black has also tried 5...Nc5, in order to let the Nd2 on its bad square where it blocks the Bc1. In a top-level game Alekhine chose to dominate the light squares with the development Bf1–g2, and after 6.g3 Qe7 7.Bg2 g6 he went for the paradoxical 8.Nb1!, as Tseitlin comments:&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.140&lt;br&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012841
 | title=Alekhine – Tartakower, London 1932
 | publisher=ChessGames.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This move, though astonishing at first sight, is in fact perfectly logical. Once Black has clearly revealed his intention to develop his bishop on g7, White no longer needs to reckon with any action on the e1–a5 diagonal. Therefore he has no reason to refrain from bringing his knight to the dominating d5-square.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The position of the knight in d5 latter forced Black to play c6–c5, creating a weak d6-pawn that ultimately caused Black's defeat. Black can improve with 6.g3 d6 7.exd6 Bxd6 8.Bg2 O-O 9.O-O Qf6 10.Nb3 Be6 11.Nxc5 Bxc5 12.Qa4 Bg4!, retaining good attacking possibilities for the gambit pawn.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly after 10.Rb1 (instead of 10.Nb3) Lalic notes that:&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Black has some compensation for the sacrificed pawn, since the white knight on d2 is awkwardly placed and Black has a definite lead in development, although this will be useless if White is allowed to consolidate his position, as he has no weaknesses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another idea for Black is to castle long, with 6.g3 d6 7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Bg2 Bf5 9.O-O O-O-O 10.a3 and now the move 10...Qf6 is essential to hinder the dangerous advance b2–b4.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; 

Instead of 6.g3, White has also replied to 5...Nc5 with the funny 6.Nb3 and after the reply 6...Ne4 White has gained the moves Nb1–d2–b3 for free, but whether it is an advantage is unclear. White can make use of his better control of the c5-square with 7.a3 d6 8.Qd5 Bf5 9.exd6 Nxd6 10.Nc5 threatening 11.Nxb7.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.156&lt;br&gt;Kozul – G.Mohr&lt;/ref&gt; White can also opt for the flexible 6.a3 (threatening 7.b4) 6...Qe7 7.e3 Nxe5 8.Qc2 a5 9.b3 b6 with roughly equal chances.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

Better than 5.Nbd2 is the preparatory move '''5.a3!''', hindering any Bf8–b4+ or Nc6–b4 idea. Now Black has to do something about the Qd1–c2 threat. He can try 5...d6 hoping to attract his opponent into something like 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Nbd2 Bf5 8.e3 Qf6 9.Nxe4 Bxe4 10.Bd3 where Black retains some play.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; But White should not oblige and must play the strongest 6.Qc2 so that after the sharp 6...Bf5 7.Nc3 Nxf2 8.Qxf5 Nxh1 Black will not be able to save his Nh1 and White has the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.88; Tseitlin p.109&lt;br&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1028348
 | title=Reshevsky – Bisguier, New York 1954–55
 | publisher=ChessGames.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if Black reacts with the more prudent 6...Nc5 7.b4 Ne6 8.Bb2 dxe5 9.e3 f6 10.Bd3 g6 11.Nc3 Bg7 White has the initiative and Black can only hope to gradually neutralise White's strong pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 4.Nf3 Bb4+''

Instead of 4...Nc6, Black does best to include '''4...Bb4+''' which Tseitlin considers &quot;the simplest and most reliable course&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tseitlin95&quot;&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; as White then has to choose between different difficulties. After 5.Bd2 Nxd2 6.Nbxd2 Nc6 7.a3 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 it seems White has everything covered,&lt;ref&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.138&lt;br&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1125511
 | title=Smyslov – Steiner, Groningen 1946
 | publisher=ChessGames.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Borik thinks Black will eventually be able to regain his pawn with the plan b6/Bb7/O-O-O/Rde8/g5/g4, with an initiative on the kingside.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Tseitlin does not agree and prefers the continuation 7...Bf8! (instead of 7...Bxd2+) 8.Qc2 g6 9.Qc3 Bg7 so that &quot;Black not only makes sure of recovering the gambit pawn, he also preserves the advantage of the bishop pair&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tseitlin96&quot;&gt;Tseitlin 1992, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Black's chances are to be preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tseitlin96&quot;/&gt;

So it is better for White to keep the bishop with '''5.Nbd2''' Nc6 6.a3 and now Black can easily get confused by the move-order. After the natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 the game has transposed in the same position as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Lalic 1998, p.143&lt;br&gt;Kullamaa – Starke, Correspondence 1991&lt;/ref&gt; White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back.&lt;ref&gt;Borik 1986, p.91&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black would be 5...d5 when Tseitlin sees sufficient compensation for the pawn in all lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tseitlin96&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Step 7. Collecting Customer Time Statistics&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

We want to know how much time customer spends waiting in ATM queue and the whole time he spends in the bank. We will collect time statistics using AnyLogic analysis data objects and observe the resulting time distributions using histograms.

First, we will create new entity class ''Customer'' to represent customers in our model. This class will have parameters to carry the required time information.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define ''Customer'' Java class''' 
#Right-click model item and choose '''New|Java Class''' from the popup menu.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 1.png]]
#This opens '''New Java Class''' dialog. Type the name of the new Java class: &lt;tt&gt;Customer&lt;/tt&gt;. Specify that ''Customer'' is derived from ''Entity''. Therefore, select ''com.xj.anylogic.enterprise.Entity'' from the '''Superclass''' drop-down list.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 2.png]]
#Click '''Next''' to open the next page of the wizard. On the second page of the wizard, define the parameters of the class. Create ''startWaiting'' parameter of type double to store the time when the customer starts waiting in the ATM queue.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 3.png]]
#Click '''Finish'''. You will see the code editor for the created class opened.&lt;/br&gt;Type double &lt;tt&gt;enteredSystem;&lt;/tt&gt; in the class body to define one more class parameter. This parameter will store the time when the customer enters the bank department.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 4.png]]
#When finished, close the code editor by clicking on the “cross” button in the upper right corner of the editor.

Add histogram data objects to store statistics on customer's waiting time and time in system. Histogram data objects suppport standard statistical analysis on the data values being added (calculate mean, minimum, maximum, deviation, variance and mean confidence interval).

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Add histogram data objects to collect time statistics'''
#To add histogram data object on the diagram, drag the '''Histogram Data''' from the '''Analysis''' stencil of the '''Palette''' onto the class diagram. 
#Set up the properties of the element.
#*Change the '''Name''' to ''waitTimeDistr''.
#*Change the '''Title''' to ''Waiting time distribution''.
#*Set the '''Number of intervals''' equal to 50.
#*Set the '''Initial interval size''': 0.01.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 5.png]]
#Create one more histogram data object. &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl&lt;/tt&gt;+drag histogram data object to create its copy. Change the '''Name''' to ''timeInSystemDistr''. Change the '''Title''' to ''Time in system distribution''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 6.png]]

Now we will modify properties of our flowchart objects. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Modify the properties of the flowchart objects'''
#Modify ''source'' properties:
#*Specify &lt;tt&gt;new Customer()&lt;/tt&gt; as '''New entity'''. Now this object wiil generate entities of our ''Customer'' class. Type &lt;tt&gt;Customer&lt;/tt&gt; in '''Generic parameters''' field. This enables direct access to the fields of the ''Customer'' entity in the dynamic parameters of this object.
#*Type &lt;tt&gt;entity.enteredSystem = time();&lt;/tt&gt; in '''On exit'''. This code stores the time when a customer was generated in the ''Customer''s variable &lt;tt&gt;enteredSystem&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;time()&lt;/tt&gt; function returns the current model time.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 7.png]]
#Modify ''queue'' properties: 
#*Type &lt;tt&gt;Customer&lt;/tt&gt; in '''Generic parameters''' field.
#*Type &lt;tt&gt;entity.startWaiting = time();&lt;/tt&gt; in '''On enter'''. This code stores the time when a customer started waiting in the queue in the ''Customer'''s variable &lt;tt&gt;startWaiting&lt;/tt&gt;.
#*Type &lt;tt&gt;waitTimeDistr.add(time() - entity.startWaiting);&lt;/tt&gt;  in '''On exit'''. This code adds waiting time of the customer to the &lt;tt&gt;waitTimeDistr&lt;/tt&gt; histogram data object.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 8.png]]
#Modify ''sink'' properties:
#*Type &lt;tt&gt;Customer&lt;/tt&gt; in '''Generic parameters''' field
#*Type &lt;tt&gt;timeInSystemDistr.add(time()-entity.enteredSystem);&lt;/tt&gt; in '''On enter'''. This code adds the whole time the customer spent in the bank to the &lt;tt&gt;timeInSystemDistr&lt;/tt&gt; histogram data object.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 9.png]]

Run the model and view the statistics using inspect window of the data set. Open inspect window for data set by clicking on it. Here you can see standard statistical analysis on the data values being added to this data object.

[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 10.png]]

Now we want to display the collected statistics using standard histograms.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Add two histograms to display distributions of customer's waiting time and time in system'''
#To add histogram on the diagram, drag the '''Histogram''' element from the '''Analysis''' stencil of the '''Palette''' onto the class diagram where you want to place the histogram.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 11.png]]
#Define the data object to be displayed by this histogram. Click the '''Add Histogram Data''' button and specify the '''Histogram''' to be displayed: ''waitTimeDistr''.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Collecting customer time statistics 12.png]]
#Add one more histogram below the existing one.  
#Choose the data object to be displayed: ''timeInSystemDistr''.
#Change the '''Title''' of the displayed data to ''Time in system distribution''.

Run the model. Set virtual time mode and observe distribution of customer's time in system and waiting time.

Cams are machine elements whose function is to control lateral movement through its rotational displacement. One application is the control of [[valve]] positions (they control inlet of air-fuel mixture as well as outlet of the exhaust gases e.g CO,CO2 &amp; H2O). They are shaped to be eccentric, so that the axis of rotation is slightly offset, and to enable a [[follower]] to trace out the path that the make as they rotate. They need to be made of a material with a hard surface on the face that contacts the follower. The bearing surface is either a [[bush]] or a plain bearing drilled and ground in the material itself. They are often lubricated as they turn to try to minimise wear. Rotational speeds need to be quite low to maintain full contact of the follower wheel on the cam surface with out jumping. Cams have been superceeded in some machines by hydraulic or electric actuators that offer more flexibility in control of the displacement graph.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ophthalmology Department Model==

In this section of the tutorial we will build a model of a typical ophthalmology unit. Patients arrive to the department to undergo the ophthalmoscopy procedure. They are held in the waiting room and wait for ophthalmologists to come and make an examination. The procedure is held in the procedure room. When a doctor arrives, patient moves to empty procedure room escorted by the doctor. The procedure is performed using an ophthalmoscope. Ophthalmoscopes are stored in the storage room and are taken by doctors just before the procedure begins. Following the procedure, the doctor transports the ophthalmoscope back to the storage room and returns to the staffroom, and the patient leaves the ophthalmology department.

We will construct our model using network based modeling blocks. A group of the Enterprise Library objects with common prefix &quot;Network&quot; enable network- or layout-based modeling. Typically, they are used when the processes being modeled are going on in a certain physical space and include movement of entities and resources. Entities can move along paths of the network and use resources located in that network.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 1. Creating a New Model==

First, we will create a new model.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create a new model'''
#Click the '''New''' [[File:New_model.gif‎]] toolbar button. The '''New Model''' dialog box is displayed.
#Specify the name of the model. In the '''Model name''' edit box, type &lt;tt&gt;Ophthalmology Department&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model 1.png]]
#Specify the location  where you want to store your model file. Browse for the existing folder using the '''Browse''' buton, or type the name of the folder you want to create in the '''Location''' edit box.
#Click '''Next'''. This will open the next page of the '''New Model''' wizard. Here you can choose, whether you want to start creating a new model from scratch, or to use a model template as a starting point in model development. Since we want to explain you the whole process of creating a model in details, we will not use a template, but will create our model from scratch.
#Click '''Finish''' to complete the process.

New model is created. It already has one active object class called ''Main'' and experiment called ''Simulation''. Active objects are the main building blocks of AnyLogic model. They can be used to model very diverse objects of the real world. 

In the center of the workspace you will see the graphical editor. It shows the diagram of the ''Main'' class. By default it does not contain any elements.

[[File:Step 1. Creating a new model 2.png]]

To the left of the graphical editor you can see the '''Project''' view. The '''Project''' view provides access to AnyLogic models currently opened in the workspace. The workspace tree provides easy navigation throughout the models.

On the right side of the workspace you can see the '''Palette''' view, and at the bottom - the '''Properties''' view. The '''Palette''' view simplifies the process of drawing diagrams, providing the list of model elements grouped by categories in a number of stencils. The '''Properties''' view is used to view and modify the properties of a currently selected model item(s). When you select something – e.g., in the '''Project''' view or in a graphical editor – the '''Properties''' view displays the properties of the selection.

When working with a model, do not forget to save it by clicking Save [[File:Save_edit.gif‎]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 2. Creating a Model Animation==

Now we will draw the model animation since the logical structure of the model is generated from the animation you draw. To simplify drawing, we will add the model layout first. You can draw the department layout using AnyLogic presentation shapes, or you can import any picture as the layout. The drawing approach is good for prototyping, when you want to experiment with draft layouts. The image approach is excellent for working with an existing layout.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Add department layout'''
#First, open the '''Presentation''' stencil of the '''Palette''' view. This stencil contains shapes and controls you can add on your presentation. To open some stencil of the '''Palette''' view, just click on the corresponding tab of the view.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 1.png]]
#Drag the '''Image''' [[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 2.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' palette into the graphical editor (right in the place shown in the figure below).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 3.png]]
#Set up the image properties in the '''Properties''' view. Click '''Add Image''' button and navigate to layout picture. You can find the layout here: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;AnyLogic folder&gt;\plugins\com.xj.anylogic.examples.&lt;build number&gt;\models\Ophthalmology Department\layout.png&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 4.png]]
#To preserve necessary picture size, select the '''Original Size''' option.
#The image should look like this:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 5.png]]

Now we will draw the model animation. Drawing an animation, we define the transportation network, where rectangles represent network nodes and polylines — network links.

We will draw a rectangle for each department room and connect rectangles with polylines playing the role of moving paths in our model.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw network nodes'''
#Draw rectangles representing department rooms. Ophthalmology department has the following functional areas: waiting room, three procedure rooms, storage room for ophthalmoscopes and private office space for medical staff. 
#To draw a rectangle, drag the '''Rectangle''' [[File:Step_3._Creating_a_model_animation_6.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' page of the '''Palette''' view into the graphical editor.
#Resize rectangles by dragging to fit into the corresponding areas of the layout as shown in the figure below. To simplify drawing, switch binding to grid off by clicking the '''Enable/Disable Grid''' toolbar button.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 6.png]]
#Name rectangles as shown in the figure. It is important since we will refer to nodes by their names in future.
#To make moving in our model more sophisticated, we will also add some additional rectangles to represent intermediate moving destinations. Draw four additional rectangles standing for intermediate network nodes and place them as shown in the figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 7.png]]

Now we will define network segments by drawing polylines. In network-based model polylines represent moving paths.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw network segments'''
#Using the '''Polyline''' [[File:Step_3._Creating_a_model_animation_3.gif]] drawing tool, draw polylines as shown in the following figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 8.png]] 
#To draw a polyline, drag the '''Polyline''' [[File:Step_3._Creating_a_model_animation_3.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' page of the '''Palette''' view into the graphical editor. Then double-click the drawn polyline to switch to editing points mode. In this mode you can add new points by double-clicking on the polyline and move points by dragging them.
#Note that all end points of polylines should necessarily lie inside the connected rectangles.

The logical structure of the network will be constructed from the presentation shapes added to the group we will specify as the '''Group of the network shapes'''. So now we should create a group and add all just drawn shapes to it.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Add shapes to a group'''
#Drag the '''Group''' [[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 9.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' palette into the graphical editor.
#Name the group &lt;tt&gt;networkGroup&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 10.png]]
#Add all created shapes to the group. First, select shapes. The best way is to drag the mouse with the left button pressed over the area containing the shapes you want to select.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 11.png]]
#The selected shapes will be highlighted in blue (see the figure below). If some shape has not been selected, you can press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl&lt;/tt&gt; and while holding it, click this shape with the left mouse button. The shape will be added to the selection.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 12.png]]
#When finished selecting shapes, right-click the selection (you should click exactly on the outline of some selected shape), and then choose '''Grouping|Add to existing group''' from the popup menu.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 13.png]]
#Finally, click on the &lt;tt&gt;networkGroup&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define procedure rooms location'''
#Draw a polyline connecting rectangles representing the procedure rooms. We will use it later on.&lt;/br&gt;Place polyline points exactly inside the &lt;tt&gt;procRoom1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;procRoom2&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;procRoom3&lt;/tt&gt; rectangles.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 14.png]]
#Name it &lt;tt&gt;roomsLocation&lt;/tt&gt; and set custom line color.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 15.png]]
#Make the polyline invisible. Go to the '''Dynamic''' page of the polyline's '''Properties''' and type &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Visible''' field.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 2. Creating a model animation 16.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 3. Animating Patients and Resources==

Now we will draw animations to depict patients, doctors and scopes in our model.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw a shape depicting a patient'''
#Zoom the diagram in, say to 400% scale.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_10._Adding_agent_animations1.png]]
#Drag the diagram a little bit down and to the right with the right mouse button pressed.
#Draw patient shape like shown in the following figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Animating patients and resources 1.png]]
#You can draw it using any AnyLogic presentation shape, or with an image. We will draw it using a curve. To draw a curve, drag the '''Curve''' [[File:Step_10._Adding_agent_animations3.gif‎]] element from the '''Presentation''' page of the '''Palette''' view onto the diagram. Then double-click the drawn curve to switch to editing curve points mode. In this mode you can add new points by double-clicking on the curve and move points by dragging them.
#Name the shape &lt;tt&gt;shapePatient&lt;/tt&gt;. The name is important since we will refer to patient animations by shape name.

Now we will draw shapes to depict doctors and ophthalmoscopes in the same way as we did for patients.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Draw shapes to depict doctors and ophthalmoscopes'''
#Draw a shape depicting a doctor using the '''Polyline''' [[File:Step_3._Creating_a_model_animation_3.gif]] drawing tool. Name it &lt;tt&gt;shapeDoctor&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Animating patients and resources 2.png]]
#Draw a shape depicting an opthalmoscope using the '''Polyline''' [[File:Step_3._Creating_a_model_animation_3.gif]] drawing tool. Name it &lt;tt&gt;shapeScope&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Animating patients and resources 3.png]]
#When finished, zoom the diagram out to the default scale by pressing the '''Zoom to 100%''' [[File:Step 3. Animating patients and resources 4.gif]] toolbar button.

We have finished drawing the model presentation. Now we will configure the model network and define the process itself using a flowchart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 4. Defining the Network and Resources==

Now we will add objects describing the network and resources available in it.  

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define the model network'''
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Network.html Network] object onto the diagram. To add a object of the library on the diagram, first open the library palette ('''Enterprise Library''' stencil of the '''Palette''' view), then click on the object in the library stencil and finally, click in the graphical editor where you want to place the object.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 1.png]]
#[http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Network.html Network] object defines the network. Please refer to ''Enterprise Library Reference Guide'' for the description of all the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Enterprise%20Library%20Objects.html ''Enterprise Library objects'']. You can find there all object functions and their parameters. To open ''Enterprise Library Reference Guide'', choose the corresponding item from the ''AnyLogic Help''. To open Help window, choose '''Help|Help Contents''' from AnyLogic menu.
#Set the object properties. Specify the group containing shapes standing for network nodes and links. Thus we associate the defined network structure with this '''Network''' object. Choose &lt;tt&gt;networkGroup&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Group of network shapes''':&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 2.png]]

Now we will add library objects defining pools of network resources. The resources may be of three types: ''moving'', ''portable'' and ''static''. In our example, doctors are moving resources, scopes are portable resources, and procedure rooms are the static ones.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define doctor resources pool'''
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkResourcePool.html NetworkResourcePool] object on the diagram. '''NetworkResourcePool''' describes resources of a particular type. This one will describe doctor resources. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 3.png]]
#Name the object &lt;tt&gt;doctor&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Specify the number of resource units in the '''Capacity''' edit box: 5.
#Specify the home location of the resource. Moving resource unit returns there if it gets idle. In our model doctors spare one private office space, so we leave the default value of the '''Home defined by''' property ('''Single node''') unchanged.
#Type '''staffRooom''' (the name of the rectangle representing the staffroom) in the '''Home node''' edit box.
#Set &lt;tt&gt;shapeDoctor&lt;/tt&gt; as '''Idle unit animation shape''' and '''Busy unit animation shape'''.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define procedure room resources pool'''
#Add one more [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkResourcePool.html NetworkResourcePool] object to describe procedure room resources. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 4.png]]
#Name the object &lt;tt&gt;procRoom&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Change the '''Resource type''' to '''Static'''.
#A static resource always resides at its home location. There can be a number of resource home locations. In this case you need to draw a polyline with points lying in the corresponding rectangles and specify it as the object’s '''Home path'''. We have three procedure rooms in our model, so we should use this approach. 
#Choose '''Path across nodes''' in the '''Home defined by''' property.
#In the '''Home path''' edit box, specify &lt;tt&gt;roomsLocation&lt;/tt&gt; polyline created beforehand for this purpose.
#Specify that the resource object has the number of resource units equal to the number of points of the specified polyline. Therefore, choose '''By home shape''' option in the '''Capacity defined''' property.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Define scope resources pool'''
#In the same way, add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkResourcePool.html NetworkResourcePool] object to describe ophthalmoscope resources. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 5.png]]
#Name the object &lt;tt&gt;scope&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Change the '''Resource type''' to '''Portable'''.
#Specify the number of resource units in the '''Capacity''' edit box: 5.
#Specify the home location of the resource. Portable resource unit are placed there at the model startup. Leave the default value of the '''Home defined by''' property ('''Single node''') unchanged.
#Type &lt;tt&gt;storageRooom&lt;/tt&gt; (the name of the rectangle representing the storage room) in the '''Home node''' edit box.
#Set &lt;tt&gt;shapeScope&lt;/tt&gt; as '''Idle unit animation shape''' and '''Busy unit animation shape'''.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Connect NetworkResourcePool objects with Network'''
#To add the defined resources into the network, you should connect ports of '''NetworkResourcePool''' objects with the port of the '''Network''' object. Connect them as shown in the figure:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 6.png]]
#To connect ports of objects, double-click the first port, then optionally click at each connector's turning point on the diagram, and finally click the second port. The connector linking two ports appears.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Defining the network and resources 7.png]]
#Cyan points inside ports indicate the correct connection. In the case you do not see cyan circles, it probably means that you put connector's point close by a port and you need to move it onto it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 5. Creating a Flowchart==

Now we will finish creating the simpliest model where patients arrive to the waiting hall of the department, then go to the first procedure room and after some time leave the department.

It is time to define a flowchart describing this process. In AnyLogic you create flowcharts by adding the objects from the library stencil onto the class diagram, setting custom properties for the objects, and connecting objects together.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Create a flowchart'''
#Create a flowchart describing the process. Add Enterprise Library objects on the diagram and connect them as shown in the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Creating a flowchart 1.png]]&lt;/br&gt;Now set up the properties of these objects. 
#Set up the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Source.html Source] object. '''Source''' object generates entities with the specified interarrival time. In our example, it models patient arrival. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Creating a flowchart 2.png]]
#*In the '''Arrival rate''' field, specify the patient arrival rate: 0.05.
#*Set &lt;tt&gt;shapePatient&lt;/tt&gt; as '''Entity animation shape'''.
#Configure [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkEnter.html NetworkEnter] object. [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkEnter.html NetworkEnter] adds entities to the specified location in a network. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Creating a flowchart 3.png]]
#*Choose &lt;tt&gt;waitingHall&lt;/tt&gt; as patients '''Entry node'''. Patients will arrive at the department waiting room.
#*Specify the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Network.html Network] object describing the network, to which new entities will be added. Type network (the name of our [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Network.html Network] object) in the '''Network''' field.
#Set up the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkMoveTo.html NetworkMoveTo] object. This block moves entities from the current location to a new one. We add this object to model how patients move from waiting hall to a procedure room. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Creating a flowchart 4.png]]
#*Choose &lt;tt&gt;procRoom1&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Node'''. Patients will go to the first procedure room. At this point we assume that all patients are examined at this room only.
#Set up the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Delay.html Delay] object. '''Delay''' object delays entity for the specified time. In our model this time stands for the ophthalmoscopy procedure. Placing Delay block in our flowchart evidences that network-based modeling objects can be mixed with regular process objects like [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Queue.html Queue], [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Delay.html Delay], [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/topic/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Service.html Service], etc. Set up the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Creating a flowchart 5.png]]
#*Specify the object's '''Capacity''': &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;. This parameter defines how many patients can be examined at the same time. 
#Configure the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkMoveTo.html NetworkMoveTo] object. We add this object to model how patients are leaving the department after the ophthalmoscopy procedure. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Creating a flowchart 6.png]]
#*Patients will move to the destination you specify. Specify &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Node''' since this rectangle corresponds to the department exit.
#[http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkExit.html NetworkExit] object removes entities from the network. Leave the default properties of the '''NetworkExit''' object unchanged.
#[http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/Sink.html Sink] object indicates the end of the flowchart. Leave the default properties of the '''Sink''' object unchanged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 6. Configuring Simulation==

Model simulation has a set of specific settings. A group of model settings is called an experiment, and experiments are displayed at the bottom of the model branch in the workspace tree. You can create several experiments for the same model with alternative model settings. One experiment is created by default and named ''Simulation''. 

[[File:Step 6. Configuring the simulation 1.png]]

If we start the model, it will work for 100 time units and then will stop. Since we want to observe the process for a long time, we need to remove the model stop condition. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif‎]] '''Remove the model stop condition'''
#In the '''Project''' view, click the ''Simulation:Main'' experiment item.
#On the '''Model Time''' tab of the '''Properties''' window, choose '''Never''' in the '''Stop''' drop-down list. The model now will simulate infinitely until we will stop it.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Configuring the simulation 2.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 7. Running the Model==

Build your model by clicking the '''Build Model''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model.gif‎]] toolbar button. If there are some errors in your model, the building fails and the '''Problems''' view appears listing all the errors found in your model. Double-click an error in the list to open the location of the error and fix it.

[[File:Step 7. Running the model 1.png|none|frame|''Problems view'']]

After the model is successfully built, you can start it. Running the simulation, you automatically bring the current model up to date.  

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Start the model'''
#Click the '''Run''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model2.gif‎]] toolbar button and choose the experiment you want to run from the drop-down list. Your simulation experiment is called &lt;tt&gt;Ophthalmology Department/Simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Running the model 2.png]]&lt;/br&gt;In the case this model is the only one opened in the workspace at the moment you will be prompted to run this particular experiment. Later on this button will start the previously run experiment. To run any other experiment, right-click the experiment in the '''Project''' view and choose '''Run''' from the context menu.
#Having started the model, you will see the presentation window. It displays the presentation designed for your simulation experiment.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Running the model 3.png]]
#Click the button to '''Run the model and switch to Main view''' and observe the process you have modeled. You can see that the model behaves correct: patients arrive at the waiting room, then go to the first procedure room and after some time leave the ophthalmology department.
#You can adjust the execution speed to your needs using '''Slow down''' and '''Speed up''' [[File:Step 7. Running the model 4.png]] toolbar buttons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 8. Occupying a Procedure Room==

At this point, all patients are examined in the first procedure room only. Moreover, several patients are examined in the same procedure room at the same time. Now we will improve our model by adding room seizing logic. We will model procedure rooms as static resources. Patients will move now to any of three procedure rooms. The room will be occupied for the examination time so that no one else can be examined there at this time.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the flowchart'''
#Add [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkSeize.html NetworkSeize] object. [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkSeize.html NetworkSeize] object seizes a given set of network resources. In our case we want to seize static resources - procedure rooms.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Occupying a procedure room 1.png]]
#Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Occupying a procedure room 2.png]]
#*Specify the '''List of resources''' to be seized. The list of resources is defined in the following way: you list names of [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkResourcePool.html NetworkResourcePool] objects whose units are being seized. One unit will be seized per pool name. We need to seize one procedure room, so you should type &lt;tt&gt;{procRoom}&lt;/tt&gt;
#Modify properties of the &lt;tt&gt;moveToProcRoom&lt;/tt&gt; object. We want this block to move patients not to the first procedure room, but to the one that was previously seized by the patient for the examination.Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Occupying a procedure room 3.png]]
#*Specify that patients will go not to the well-defined destination, but to the location of the seized resource unit (in our case - to the occupied procedure room). Choose '''Seized resource uni'''t option in the '''Destination is''' property.
#*Specify the name of the seized resource unit that will serve as a destination for patients. Type &lt;tt&gt;procRoom&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Resource''' field. &lt;tt&gt;procRoom&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of our [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkResourcePool.html NetworkResourcePool] object that defines procedure room resources pool.
#[http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkRelease.html NetworkRelease] object releases previously seized static resources. We need this object to release the procedure room after the procedure.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Occupying a procedure room 4.png]]
#Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Occupying a procedure room 5.png]]
#*Specify the resources this block releases. Instead of specifying a list of names of seized resources, simply select '''All seized resources''' in the '''Release''' property since we want to release all seized resources after the procedure will be completed.

Now you can run the model. You can see that patients are examined at any of three procedure rooms and rooms are occupied for the examination time so that no one else is examined there at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 9. Calling a Doctor==

Now we will complete our model definition by modeling how ophthalmologist is called to perform the examination. Ophthalmologist picks an ophthalmoscope from the storage room on his way to patient, and returns it back after the procedure.
 
[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the flowchart'''
#Modify the properties of the &lt;tt&gt;networkSeize&lt;/tt&gt; object. We want this object to seize a doctor and an ophthalmoscope as well.&lt;/br&gt;Type &lt;tt&gt;{procRoom, doctor, scope}&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''List of resources''' property.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 1.png]]
#Modify the flowchart. Insert the objects indicated in the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 2.png]]

[http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkSendTo.html NetworkSendTo] block sends (moves) network resources from their current location(s) to a new location. In our case we want to send seized doctor to the storage room to take the seized scope. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 3.png]]
#*Specify the list of resources this block will send. Type &lt;tt&gt;{doctor}&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Resources to send''' property.
#*Specify that resources will move to the '''Seized resource unit'''.
#*Specify the name of the seized resource, which location will play a role of destination node. Type &lt;tt&gt;scope&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Resource''' field.
#Modify the properties of the &lt;tt&gt;sendToPatient&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkSendTo.html NetworkSendTo] object. This block moves a doctor with a scope to a patient awaiting for the doctor in the waiting hall. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 4.png]]
#*Specify the list of resources this block will send. Type &lt;tt&gt;{doctor, scope}&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Resources to send''' property.
#*Specify that resources will move to the '''Entity'''.
#Modify properties of the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkAttach.html NetworkAttach] object. This block attaches the specified seized network resources to the entity. The result is that they will move together with the entity (escort the entity) until they are detached or released. The resources being attached must be already seized and located in the same node as the entity.&lt;/br&gt;We want this block to attach a doctor with a scope to a patient so that patients wil move to the procedure room escorted by doctors. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 5.png]]
#*Choose '''All seized non-static resources at entity location''' option.
#Modify properties of the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkSendTo.html NetworkDetach] object. This block detaches the previously seized and attached network resources from the entity. The detached resource units will still be possessed by the etitity but will not accompany it when the entity moves. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 6.png]]
#*Choose '''All attached resources''' option.
#Modify the properties of the &lt;tt&gt;returnScope&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.enterprise_library/help/html/NetworkSendTo.html NetworkSendTo] object. We use this block to model how doctors return scopes to the storage room after the examination is completed. Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 9. Calling a doctor 7.png]]
#*Specify the list of resources this block will send. Type &lt;tt&gt;{doctor, scope}&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Resources to send''' property.
#*Specify that resources will move to the '''Specified node'''.
#*Specify the name of the node where the resources should move. Type &lt;tt&gt;storageRoom&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Node''' field.

We have finished creating our model of the ophthalmology department. Run the model. Now you can see the doctors coming with ophthalmoscopes to perform the patient examination.

The first is the mesh or shape, the second is the texture file (.bmp or .tga), and the third part comprises text documents, such as config.txt and  scripts. You can modify the texture file fairly easily to change the appearance of the asset, a process known as '''re-skinning'''. Re-skinning is a fairly easy way to get started in asset creation for your layout. Be aware you need to respect copyright laws and you need the mesh creator's permission before distributing the new asset (i.e., uploading to the DLS). Also, understand that different types of texture files have slight differences; some file types have more options than others. Some assets have a greater impact on Trainz performance than others. Since we can select which asset to reskin, as a beginner select assets with a single .bmp or .tga texture file.

This tutorial will take you through the steps to do a simple reskin. The tutorial uses TRS2009 CM2 because this version of Trainz does a lot more error checking than previous versions and this will help you to avoid errors. The re-skinning process is similar in previous versions of Trainz, so if you have TRS2004, TRS2006 or TC3 you will be able to follow this tutorial. In Trainz12 (TRS12), much of this process has been automated, so skip ahead at this point to the next paragraph. To clone an asset in '06 or TC3 use CMP in a similar manner to the TS2009 description, in TRS2004 access the asset folder (Auran/TRS2004/World/Dispatcher/downloads/asset kuid) and copy the folder. Open the copied folder, open the config.txt file and change the assets kuid number to one with your own ID prefix. Be sure not to duplicate an existing kuid number of yours. Open the config. file and change as appropriate the description, author, licence, e-mail address and web address. Be careful not to change any other data. Save and close the config.txt. file. Now edit the asset folder's kuid number to the one you used in the config. txt. file.

In TRS12 you need only select the asset by right-clicking on it in Content Manager. Select 'edit' from the drop down menu, then 'Edit in Content Creator Plus'. This brings up an editable form that will save a new config.txt file for you. You may alter the fields in the form as appropriate. Note that some fields are determined by changes you make in the editable fields, making it easy to complete this step without mistakes (errors and warnings appear in the bottom panel).

At this stage you may want to download the excellent free photo editing software GIMP if you don't already have it. 
http://www.gimp.org/. However, many other paint programs (such as Photoshop) will work equally well.

We'll start with a simple sign that uses a .bmp texture file: &lt;code&gt;kuid:86627:1182&lt;/code&gt; and step one is to clone the asset in Content Manager. Note this sign is Trainz version 1.5; it doesn't require any features of the later versions. Right click the asset and click on clone. (For TRS 2004 see above, second paragraph; in Trainz12 an error that the asset uses an obsolete trainz-build number (numbers below 2.7 are not supported. However, TRS12 will correct this limitation when you commit your new asset). 

[[Image:Clone for reskin.jpg]]


Having cloned the asset we now need to edit it.  Go to the '''Open for Edit''' tab, right click. (TRS 2004 users, open cloned folder). In Trainz12, right click on the new asset (note a new kuid has been assigned with your ID prefix). Then click on 'Edit' and 'Edit in Content Creator Plus'. 

[[Image:Edit in explorer.jpg]]

This opens up a Windows folder containing the asset.  We now want to edit the .bmp file using GIMP


[[Image:Edit with GIMP.jpg]]
Note the two panels one for the image and one containing the tools.

[[Image:Edit with GIMP1.jpg]]

Just below the image is the scale, for ease of use raise this to 400% and increase the window size of the panel.  Use the eye dropper tool to pick up the background colour then the paint brush to remove the existing lettering.

[[Image:Edit with GIMP2.jpg]]

GIMP is particularly strong in adding lettering.  Note the background / foreground colour squares click on the curved arrow to reverse these to get white lettering.  Click on the lettering tool, the letter &quot;A&quot; and select a font, &quot;Gill Sans MT Bold&quot; is fairly useful.  It is possible to add fonts to GIMP.  You can adjust the font size directly.

[[Image:Edit with GIMP3.jpg]]

Left click with the mouse at the top left hand corner then enter the desired text.  It is possible to change the font size before clicking on close.


[[Image:Edit with Gimp4.jpg]]

To position the text type &quot;M&quot; then click on &quot;Move the active layer&quot;

[[Image:Edit with Gimp5.jpg]]


Save the file.

[[Image:Edit with Gimp6.jpg]]

Go to edit the config.txt file.

''If you started with a .tga file then the saving process is slightly different.  First note the file size of the .tga file.  Then when you save ensure that RLE compression is unchecked.''
[[Image:Edit with Gimp7.jpg]]

''Compare the file sizes.  If your edited file is smaller then double check you have RLE compression off.  If your edited file is roughly 33% larger than the original verify you do not have an alpha channel, delete any alpha masks from the copy by clicking Layer, Mask, and Delete Layer Mask, then save again.''


Now edit the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in a basic text editor such as Notepad. (See introductory paragraph on cloning in TRS2004 for details on editing the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file) 
Do not use word etc. in case it adds invisible characters which will confuse Trainz.

Click to select in CM2 and commit ({{keypress|Ctrl|M}}) (TRS 2004 users simply make sure that the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file is saved, close the asset folder and back out of the Trainz folder.)

Bring up in Surveyor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pedestrian Simulation==

AnyLogic provides the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PL.html Pedestrian Library], a higher-level library for simulating pedestrian flows in “physical” environment. It allows creating models of pedestrian buildings (like subway stations, security checks, etc.) or streets (big number of pedestrians). The Pedestrian Library allows you to create flexible models, collect basic and advanced statistics, and effectively visualize the process you are modeling to validate and present your model. You may collect statistics on pedestrian density in different areas, to assure acceptable performance of service points with hypothetic load, estimate lengths of stay in specific areas, detect potential problems with interior geometry – effect of adding obstacles and many other applications. In models created with Pedestrian Library, pedestrians move in continuous space, reacting on different kinds of obstacles (walls, different kinds of areas) and other pedestrians.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create models with Pedestrian Library. We will create a simple illustrative example of subway entrance . This model demonstrates how to simulate simple pedestrian flow and services using AnyLogic Pedestrian Library

Note that there is a reference model '''Subway Entrance''' available representing the milestones of the editing. You can use it if you experience any difficulties creating a model and you would like to compare your model with the reference file. Use '''Sample Models''' page of the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/wwanylogic/Welcome%20Page.html Welcome] page to open this example.

Please refer to ''Pedestrian Library Reference Guide'' for more information about Pedestrian Library blocks and their functions and parameters.

You can run this model [http://www.runthemodel.com/models/161/ online].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 1. Creating a New Model==

First, we will create a new model.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Create a new model'''
#Click the '''New''' [[File:New_model.gif‎]] toolbar button. The '''New Model''' dialog box is displayed.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a new model 1.png]]
#Specify the name of the model. In the '''Model name''' edit box, type &lt;tt&gt;Subway Entrance&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Specify the location  where you want to store your model file. '''Browse''' for the existing folder using the Browse button, or type the name of the folder you want to create in the '''Location''' edit box.
#Click '''Next'''. This will open the next page of the '''New Model''' wizard. Here you can choose, whether you want to start creating a new model from scratch, or to use a model template as a starting point in model development. Since we want to explain you the whole process of creating a model in details, we will not use a template, but will create our model from scratch.
#Click '''Finish''' to complete the process.

New model is created. It already has one active object class called ''Main'' and experiment called ''Simulation''. Active objects are the main building blocks of AnyLogic model. They can be used to model very diverse objects of the real world. 

In the center of the workspace you will see the graphical editor. It shows the diagram of the ''Main'' class. By default it does not contain any elements.

[[File:Creating a new model 2.png]]

To the left of the graphical editor you can see the '''Project''' view. The '''Project''' view provides access to AnyLogic models currently opened in the workspace. The workspace tree provides easy navigation throughout the models.

On the right side of the workspace you can see the '''Palette''' view, and at the bottom - the '''Properties''' view. The '''Palette''' view simplifies the process of drawing diagrams, providing the list of model elements grouped by categories in a number of stencils. The '''Properties''' view is used to view and modify the properties of a currently selected model item(s). When you select something – e.g., in the '''Project''' view or in a graphical editor – the '''Properties''' view displays the properties of the selection.

When working with a model, do not forget to save it by clicking '''Save''' [[File:Save_edit.gif‎]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">     I have not been able to complete my observations, but I will speak on my observations as being a teacher assistant.  In some of the classrooms that I have been in the teachers do have control.  I think that for some of the teachers that have no classroom management it is because in some way the students come into the classroom and they (the students) have made up in their mind that this teacher is not going to make them do anything; and this is where the tug and pull of classroom management goes wrong.
     I have substituted in classrooms and the students know what is expected of them, but some will try to get over on me. I know how to take control of the classroom and I let the students know that I will not hesitate to send them to the office if I have to keep talking to him/her.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 20:54, 2 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 2. Creating a Model Animation==

Now we will draw the model animation. To simplify drawing, we will add the subway entrance layout first. You can draw the layout in AnyLogic using the animation editor, or you can import any picture as the layout. The drawing approach is good for prototyping, when you want to experiment with draft layouts. The image approach is excellent for working with an existing layout. We will add the existing image of the subway entrance.

#First, open the '''Presentation''' stencil of the '''Palette''' view. This stencil contains shapes and controls you can add on your presentation. To open some stencil of the '''Palette''' view, just click on the corresponding tab of the view.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_2._Creating_a_model_animation_1.png]]
#Drag the '''Image''' [[File:Step_2._Creating_a_model_animation_2.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' palette into the graphical editor (in the place shown in the figure below with the crossed rectangle).&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step_2._Creating_a_model_animation_3.png‎]]
#Set up the image properties in the '''Properties''' view. Click '''Add Image''' button and navigate to layout picture. You can find the layout here: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;AnyLogic folder&gt;\plugins\com.xj.anylogic.examples.&lt;build number&gt;\models\Subway Entrance\entrance_layout.png&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/br&gt;You will see the added image in the preview area:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 1.png‎]]
#To preserve necessary picture size, select the '''Original Size''' option.
#The image should look like this:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 2.png‎]]

Now we will draw the model animation. For each model you can create an animation to visually represent your model. You need this also to define graphically environment objects of your model.

First, we will draw a border of our environment area playing a role of the walls of the subway entrance building.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw the building walls'''
#To simplify drawing you may need to switch off the grid and zoom in the animation using the corresponding toolbar buttons:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 3.png‎]]
#Draw the polyline as shown in the figure below. To draw a polyline, drag the '''Polyline''' [[File:Step_3._Creating_a_model_animation_3.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' page of the '''Palette''' view into the graphical editor. Then double-click the drawn polyline to switch to editing polyline points mode. In this mode you can add new points by double-clicking on the polyline and move points by dragging them.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 4.png‎]]
#Set up the following properties for the polyline drawn:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 5.png‎]]
#*Name the polyline &lt;tt&gt;walls&lt;/tt&gt;.
#*Change the polyline’s width to make it more noticeable on the presentation diagram.
#*Make the polyline closed. Select the '''Close Polyline''' checkbox. This makes the polyline closed by connecting the first and the last polyline’s points. 
#Make the polylne invisible at the model runtime. Go to the '''Dynamic''' page of the polyline's '''Properties''' and type &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Visible''' field.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 6.png‎]]

Frequently walls of the simulated environment are drawn by several shapes, therefore Pedestrian Library requires that all these shapes are added to one group and this group is specified as the '''Walls''' parameter of the corresponding library object. So now we will create a group and add the walls polyine to it.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Create a group to contain shapes defining environment border'''
#Drag the Group [[File:Step_2._Creating_a_model_animation_9.gif‎]] element from the '''Presentation''' palette into the graphical editor.
#Leave the default '''Name''' of the group: &lt;tt&gt;group&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Add the just drawn polyline to the group. First, select it by clicking on it. The selected shape will be highlighted in blue.
#Right-click the selection (you should click exactly on the polyline), and then choose '''Grouping|Add to existing group''' from the popup menu.
#Finish adding the polyline to the group by clicking on the &lt;tt&gt;group&lt;/tt&gt;.

Now you should define entry and exit points for the pedestrian flow. 

Draw an entry first. Entry is a place where pedestrians appear in the simulated environment. It can be defined with a line, polyline, or a pivot containing lines and/or polylines.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw an entry'''
#Drag the '''Line''' [[File:Step_11._Making_people_contacts_distance-based4.gif‎]] drawing tool from the '''Presentation''' palette into the graphical editor (in the place shown in the figure below):&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 7.png‎]]
#First, click the place where you want to draw the start point of the line.
#Then drag the mouse to the place where you want to draw the end point of the line and release the mouse button.
#Name the line &lt;tt&gt;entry&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Draw an exit'''
#In the same way, draw the exit line as shown in the figure below. Exit line is a place where pedestrians are disposed by the simulated environment.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Creating a model animation 8.png‎]]
#Name the line &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt;.

Note that both entry and exit lines should fit inside the environment area shape, i.e. inside walls polyline.

|description =Sandspurry is a tiny flower that grows close to the ground.  Most people do not even notice it as they walk by.  It grows along the edges of sidewalks and streets and can survive mowing.  The flowers have five purple petals, with green leaf-like parts called ''sepals'' ('''see'''-pulls) between them.  In the center of the flower are yellow parts which is where the seeds are made.
|facts = Sandspurry blooms in early spring and the flowers persist well into Autumn.

== 1. Why is it important to find out what the local laws are before starting a camp fire?  Where should you get that information?==
In many localities, it is ''illegal'' to light a camp fire without a permit.  Failure to obtain a permit can result in a hefty fine.  Permit issuance is generally left to the discretion of the local fire department, and they may decline to issue one based on current conditions (i.e., when they deem the risk of wildfires to be too great).  If a person were to light an unpermitted camp fire, and that fire got out of control, the person responsible could be criminally charged and held liable for any resulting damage (which could exceed several million dollars).

== 2. Identify 3 reasons why a camp fire should never be left unattended.==
*It could get out of control and spread.
*It would be a danger to unsupervised children who are (in general) fascinated by fire and may wish to experiment with it.
*It is illegal in many localities.

== 3. List 10 rules for fire safety to consider when camping ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Fire/Fire safety}}

== 4. Identify the temperatures the following foods should be kept at, and explain why this is important when camping:==
;(a)Hot foods: Hot foods should be kept warmer than {{units|60°C|140°F}}.  
;(b)Cold foods: Cold foods should be kept cooler than {{units|4°C|40°F}}.
The temperature range between {{units|4°C|40°F}} and {{units|60°C|140°F}} is the ''danger zone'' where bacterial growth is vigorous.  Bacteria is what makes food spoil, and eating spoiled food can cause sickness.

== 5. List 5 things you can do to prevent animals from coming into your campsite.==
*Wash all dishes as soon as you are finished eating.
*Store food in animal-proof containers, or hang it beyond their reach.
*Food storage containers should be air-tight to prevent aromas from escaping and attracting animals.
*Do not bring food into your tent.
*Store food trash in air-tight containers as well, and place it in an inaccessible area.  Another option is to burn uneaten food.

Note that these steps will still not prevent a persistent animal from investigating.  Raccoons which have been acclimated to human activity are brazen enough to enter a well-lit campsite even when humans are less than 10 meters away!

== 6. What safety precautions should you consider when building a latrine?==
*The latrine should be located at least {{units|60 meters|200 feet}} away from any source of water.
*The latrine should be private.
*The commode should be sturdy and well-able to support the weight of anyone using it.

== 7. Make a list of items that should be in a “First Aid Kit” and inspect your Pathfinder Club's camping first aid kit and make recommendations of any missing items as applicable.==

Commercially available first aid kits available via normal retail routes have traditionally been intended for treatment of minor injuries only. Typical contents include:
* adhesive bandages
* regular strength pain medication
* gauze 
* low grade disinfectant.  
Additional items may include:
* tweezers (for tick and splinter removal)
* Ace bandages
* burn cream
* medical grade gloves (to protect the responder)
* alcohol pads (for sterilizing equipment and wounds)
* an epinephrine auto-injector (brand name Epipen) - often included in kits for wilderness use and in places such as summer camps, to treat anaphylactic shock.

When inspecting your club's first aid kit, be sure to check expiration dates on any medications.

== 8. List 5 things to consider when practicing good hygiene at a campsite where there is no running water (ie showers, flush toilets, sinks, or faucets).==
*Camping does not absolve a person from good hygiene practices.  It merely makes such practices a little less convenient.
*Build an appropriate latrine and locate it properly (away from the campsite and away from any source of water).
*Wash dishes in plastic tubs.  One for pre-rinse, one for washing, and one for rinsing.  All tubs should be filled with hot water (heat it on the camp stove), and the temperature should be checked before the dishes are washed.  
*Water temperature can be moderated by mixing hot water with cold water.  
*The final rinse tub can benefit from a teaspoon of chlorine bleach.
*A handwashing station can be fashioned from a gallon jug (such as a milk jug).  Fill it with water, screw the cap tightly in place, and suspend it from a tree.  Pierce the jug with a golf tee.  When the tee is removed, water will dribble out.  When the tee is replaced, the flow will stop.  Put a bar of soap in the toe of an old pair of pantyhose, cut the leg from the hose, and tie it to the handle of the milk jug.  This will keep the soap from falling to the ground and getting covered with debris, but the soap can be used without removing it from the hose.
*Spit toothpaste into the trash or bury it.  No one wants to look at that.

== 9. Demonstrate 3 ways you can purify water when camping.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Purify water}}

== 10. Identify 2 types of fuel used for camp cooking and explain what precautions should be used when using each type of fuel. Discuss 5 guidelines for safely handling the following camping items:==
===(a)knives===
#Keep knives sharp.
#Close folding knives when they are not in use or when passing one to another person.
#Cut away from the body (yours or anyone elses).
#Do not throw knives
#Do not stick a knife blade into the ground.
===(b)axes===
#Check the condition of the axe before using it, and make certain the head is firmly attached to the handle.  Check this continually as you use the axe.
#Make sure the area above the head is clear before swinging an axe.
#Do not use an axe when another person is within two axe-lengths.
#Make sure no one is directly in front of you or directly behind you (in case the axe head comes off).
#Do not chop the ground with the blade.
#Do not swing the axe unless you have a firm footing.
#Whacking a dead tree with an axe can dislodge dead limbs.  Watch for them.
#Do not swing an axe towards any part of your body (especially feet and legs).

===(c)saws===
#Do not chop with a saw.  Saws are for cutting.
#Keep fingers clear of the blade.
#Start cuts at a low angle so the blade does not bind or jump out of the kerf.
#Store a saw in a safe place when it is not in use.  Don't make it a tripping hazard.
#Be aware of the entire length of the blade when sawing.
#Do not saw into whatever is supporting the item being cut.

===(d)hatchets===
#Do not hold an item with one hand and chop at it with the other.  You really do want to keep all your fingers.
#Sheathe a hatchet when it is not in use.
#Present the handle to a person to whom you are passing a hatchet.
#Store a hatchet in a safe place when it is not in use.  Don't make it a tripping hazard.
#Keep the hatchet sharp.
===(e)machetes===
#Make sure anyone using a machete is well supervised.
#Store a machete out of the reach of children.
#Do not swing the machete towards your legs or feet.
#Anticipate that the machete can glance off a target after it strikes it.
#Sheathe a machete when it is not in use.

===Types of Fuel===
;Propane: Propane is perhaps the most popular form of fuel for a camp stove.  Be sure to close the valve tightly when the tank is not in use.  When lighting a propane stove, be sure to have the fire ready before turning on the gas.  If you turn on the gas first and then have trouble getting the fire to light, you can cause an explosion.  Allow the gas to clear for five minutes before attempting to relight.
;Alcohol: Backpacking stoves often use denatured alcohol as their fuel source.  Be aware that alcohol flames can be almost completely invisible, especially in direct sunlight.  Pathfinders have been known to believe the stove is not lit because of this, and then have attempted to refuel the (lit!) stove.

== 11. Assist your club or conference leadership in a campsite safety inspection using the current Adventist Risk Management Pathfinder Camp Safety Inspection Form or its equivalent. Be able to briefly explain the score/report given concerning the safety of the campsite.==
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|The form provided by Adventist Risk Management is not a campsite inspection form at all, but rather, a summer camp facility inspection form.  We recommend that you use your conferences camp site inspection form.  Ask your conference youth director or an area coordinator for one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor header|3|2009|North American Division|Recreation}}

== 1. Earn the following honors if not already earned:&lt;br&gt; a)Camping Skills I-IV&lt;br&gt;  b)Camp Safety==
See the following chapters for tips and instructions on earning these honors:
*[[../Camping Skills I/]]
*[[../Camping Skills II/]]
*[[../Camping Skills III/]]
*[[../Camping Skills IV/]]
*[[../Camp Safety/]]

== 2. What is meant by “Pathfinders are a sacred trust” and how does camp safety support that aspect of ministry in the church?==
When parents allow their children to join Pathfinders, they have certain expectations of what will go on at the meetings and outings.  Staff must be constantly vigilant of anything that could threaten the safety of any Pathfinder, and must not be hesitant to intervene when boundaries are crossed.   This however, deals only with physical safety.

Not only are the staff to keep the children safe at all times, they are also to serve as a Christian example.  They are to provide spiritual leadership to those in their care.  If the Pathfinder experience is not pointing the Pathfinder to Christ, the leaders are not executing their duties properly.  

Remember this text from Matthew:

{{Bible verse
|book = Matthew
|chapter=18
|verse=6
|version=NIV
|text=
But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
}}

== 3. Train a Pathfinder Unit or its equivalent in the Camping Safety Honor==
See [[../Camp Safety/]] for tips and instruction on teaching this honor.

== 4. Conduct 5 camp site inspections (on at least two camping experiences) using the current Adventist Risk Management Pathfinder Camp Safety Inspection Form or its equivalent. ==
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|The form provided by Adventist Risk Management is not a campsite inspection form at all, but rather, a summer camp facility inspection form.  We recommend that you use your conferences camp site inspection form.  Ask your conference youth director or an area coordinator for one.
|Conduct 5 camp site inspections (on at least two camping experiences) using your conference's current camp site inspection form or its equivalent.
}}

Some conferences have the TLT's conduct camp site inspections during the Camporees.  If this is the case in your conference, it makes an excellent opportunity to meet this requirement.  Otherwise, it can be met by conducting a formal inspection during a club campout.  Here are some of the things to check for:

*First Aid Kit
**Complete
**Accessible
**Well marked
*Medical Release Forms
**Each Pathfinder should have a copy of their own
**Each Staff member should have copies for all Pathfinders under their care.
**Master copies should be in a central location
*Fire Safety
**Fire extinguishing equipment present (unless no fire is to be lit)
**Perimeter around fire pit is neat and free from obstructions
**Fire is confined to a proper fire ring
*Tents
**Properly pitched
**All ropes and guy lines are tight
**Sleeping bags and luggage are neat
**Adults and children in separate tents
**Boys' and girls' tents are properly separated
*Kitchen Area
**Food is secured against animals
**Food is stored at a safe temperature
**Kitchen and dishes are clean
**Fire extinguisher accessible and near stove
**Area is neat and free from tripping hazards
*General Campsite Area
**Clearly marked entrance
**Neat
**Free from tripping hazards
**Tools are stored properly
**Potentially dangerous tools are secured away from young hands
**Pathfinders have proper supervision at all times

      <text xml:space="preserve">This ebook is seriously lacking. Flourescents are highly underrated, and the paragraph on aeroponics is just plain wrong information. airstones? bursting bubbles? That's a description of DWC and NOT aeroponics.

The description in the aeroponic section was correct (bubbles popping forms a nutrient mist and roots hung in air) but is not the spray mist type of system most commonly referred to as aeroponic so it has been rewritten. But the fluorescent section accurately lists the strengths and limitations of fluorescent lighting. If you try to use fluoros in a large space with taller plants through flowering you will get airy buds with little weight where you could have gotten tight solid nuggets. In the future please edit where a correction is needed instead of using the talk page. Edits are always subject to future revision but it saves time and effort.

[[Marijuana Cultivation/Fundamentals/Garden establishment]] will not be used. It is redundant. The entire fundamentals section of the book is a far more in-depth guide to constructing a garden. I didn't delete because I did recommend to the author when I removed it from the outline that he add any appropriate content to the existing chapters of the book. That was some months ago. Marked as you requested. -- [[User:Shaitand|Shaitand]] ([[User talk:Shaitand|talk]])

perhaps this shuld be corrected?

and now i get

GLUT: Fatal Error in opengl: redisplay needed for window 1, but no display callback.&lt;/pre&gt;  

found the problem a  glutDisplayFunc(RenderScene);  or equivelnt is required 
&lt;pre&gt;

===Hello===
this is a really good starting point. Thanks for sharing.
Maybe I'm wrong but, shouldn't
&lt;pre&gt;
#ifndef WIN32
&lt;/pre&gt;
be
&lt;pre&gt;
#ifdef WIN32
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also I was trying to compile this on CentOs and I didn't see conio.h. Maybe it's non-standard header. I've commented it out and window did not close immediatelly. Isn't call of glutMainLoop() enough to prevent window from closing?

As previously stated, the #ifndef WIN32 that actually defines WIN32 related stuff should be replaced by #ifdef. Also, there is no need for a getch() since glutMainLoop() doesn't return unless an event, message or command requires it (at least on Win32). Tested using VS2008 on Console subsystem. Feel free to revert if this has any impact I did not forsee on another architecture. [[User:TheSpooler|TheSpooler]] ([[User talk:TheSpooler|talk]]) 03:45, 25 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

===Purpose===
Many users state that when they get a message, they will respond on your talk page instead of on their own. This makes reading back a conversation quite cumbersome; having to switch talk pages back and forth in order to make sense of the conversation. To this end, you can use this template to notify a user that you have responded to his/her message on your own talk page.

===Usage===

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}|'''''your'' username'''}}
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}|'''''your'' username'''|'''section'''}}

To have the links point to a '''non'''-user talk page, you must include the full talk page link.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}|'''Talk:''page name'''''|'''section'''}}
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}|'''Wikibooks talk:''page name'''''|'''section'''}}

To include a timestamp, add &lt;code&gt;ts=&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (five tildes).

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}|'''Talk:''page name'''''|'''section'''|ts=&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}|'''''your'' username'''|'''section'''|ts=&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Place the code on the talk page of the user you have answered to. The recipient may remove this template from his/her talk page at any time. A link to edit the first section of the talk page is shown within the template. The &lt;code&gt;'''section'''&lt;/code&gt; parameter is optional; when you enter the name of the section on your talk page, it will directly link to that section.

===Redirects===
*{{tlx|Tb}}

==Notes==
* Do not substitute this template!
* This template may cause display errors if used in a section header; it is best to use it on a line by itself.

      <comment>/* The changing for wedding dresses */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Do follow the tradition, why not change? ==

It seems that wedding golden time comes; wedding dress zone is crowded with brides-to-be in shopping mall. Maybe many of them feel a big headache for choosing their dream wedding dress. Cause many patterns in stores are out of fashion, or many of them are out of stock. What a pity for this. However, we are so lucky in nowadays, for ladies could wear dream ones for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecustomdresses.com/&quot;&gt;Custom wedding dresses&lt;/a&gt;, and whatever color, pattern you want. Of course, the price of most concern above custom-made is not higher than the traditional, it makes almost fiancés are able to afford this. 

Also custom-made is acceptable to wedding participants. For many of them couldn’t wear prom dresses in daily life except for taking part in the party or wedding. A big problem comes to ladies, whether buy an expensive and beautiful prom dresses or not, is it worthy of doing so? The Custom prom dresses is the best choice at this time. Many of customers wanna have it attractive in price and quality. Now it’s not an impossible dream by custom-made. It .meets the needs of most ladies and overshadows international brands. Try to image that you wear the beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecustomdresses.com/prom-dresses.html&quot;&gt;custom prom dresses&lt;/a&gt;, dancing in the party. Are you able to resist the jealous sight?

== For a better wedding ==

Wedding date comes near at hand. Choosing wedding dresses has been submitted to schedule and also becomes a big tough task for me. My friends tell me the following three styles are fashion now. I have to made comparison among them.

Simple Style：

Simple design could build up to the special character of ladies. However how to emphasize on the merits and avoid demerits is a tough point with simple designs in the international fashion industry. The excellent pruning and material are the best points for success, which could embody the quality and class of wedding dresses perfectly. In my opinions, this style is fit for the girl who owns the strong sense of independence.    

Romantic Style:
Maybe all of us would get to term of” romantic” for referred to wedding. And all of us make efforts to set up the natural and romantic mood.　The wedding gowns with hollowed bordering ornament or lovely clarity flowers, mysterious veils. All of these embody romantic style. It is fit for the girls who own the sense of cultural. And I love this very much.  

magnificence style：

None could deny that this style could make guys shining all of the time. But only magnificence is not enough, also include the elegant is perfect. It owns the French Royal style, embodies the glorious girls in prom dresses. But I don’t favor it very much for shinning so much.

== The changing for wedding dresses ==

Nowadays although wedding has became much simpler, the wedding dresses becoming very various. As people consumption concept improving, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecustomdresses.com/&quot;&gt;custom wedding dresses&lt;/a&gt; more and more popular with bride and bridegroom. 
As bridesmaid, your dresses also important in the wedding day, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecustomdresses.com/bridesmaid-dresses.html&quot;&gt;Custom bridesmaid dresses&lt;/a&gt; hence has many problems to notice. For example, the flowers for the custom bridesmaid dresses must smaller than custom wedding dresses, or you will cause the trouble for bride.

If your wedding has flower girl dresses, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecustomdresses.com/flower-girl-dresses.html&quot;&gt;Custom flower girl dresses&lt;/a&gt; must be collocation with the bride dresses. This will show your wedding harmonious.

In the wedding day, many women also wear the wedding gowns, believing that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecustomdresses.com/&quot;&gt;custom wedding gowns&lt;/a&gt; will make the wedding colorful, that is because custom wedding gowns not only fit for your body, but wear your specific character. 

Since the custom dresses so favorable for people, why we order it immediately?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 3. Adding a passenger flow==

Now we will finish creating the simple model simulating passenger flow. We need to add library objects adding and removing pedestrians from the simulated environment.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Create the model flowchart'''
#Create a flowchart describing the process. In AnyLogic you create flowcharts by adding the objects from the library stencil onto the class diagram, setting custom properties for the objects, and connecting objects together. Add Pedestrian Library objects on the diagram and connect them as shown in the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Adding a passenger flow 1.png]]
#To add a library object on the diagram, open the '''Pedestrian Library''' palette, and drag the required object from the palette into the graphical editor.
#To connect ports of objects, double-click the first port and then click the second port. The connector linking two ports appears.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Adding a passenger flow 2.png]]&lt;/br&gt;Cyan points inside ports indicate the correct connection. In the case you do not see cyan circles, it probably means that you put connector's point close by a port and you need to move it onto it.
#Configure the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedGround.html PedGround] object. This object allows user to define 2D layer in the simulated environment, representing &quot;ground&quot; for pedestrians, i. e. surface on which pedestrians can walk. Set up the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Adding a passenger flow 3.png]]
#*Set the walls for the floor. In the '''Walls (group, optional)''' field type the name of our Use &lt;tt&gt;group&lt;/tt&gt; containing &lt;tt&gt;walls&lt;/tt&gt; polyline drawn earlier for this purpose.&lt;/br&gt;Please refer to ''Pedestrian Library Reference Guide'' for the description of all [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/Pedestrian_Library_Objects.html Pedestrian Library objects]. To invoke AnyLogic ''Pedestrian Library Reference Guide'', choose the corresponding help topic in the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/wwhelp/Help%20Window.html Help window].
#Configure the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedSource.html PedSource] object. '''PedSource''' object generates pedestrians. It is usually used as a starting point of the pedestrian flow. In our example, it models passenger arrival.&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Adding a passenger flow 4.png]]
#*Specify the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedGround.html PedGround] object, defining the ground, to which new pedestrians will be added. In the '''Arrival ground (PedGround)''' field type the name of your '''PedGround''' object: &lt;tt&gt;pedGround&lt;/tt&gt;. 
#*Define the place of the ground where the passengers will appear. It can be defined by a line or a polyline. Type &lt;tt&gt;entry&lt;/tt&gt; (the name of the polyline drawn earlier for that purpose) in the '''Appears at (line, polyline)''' field. Now passengers will appear at some random point of the &lt;tt&gt;entry&lt;/tt&gt; line.
#Set up the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedGoTo.html PedGoTo] object. This block moves pedestrians from the current location to a new one. We add this object to model how passengers move from the entry to subway trains.&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 3. Adding a passenger flow 5.png]]
#*Specify destination for passengers. When entered environment, pedestrians will go to to the target you specify. It can be defined with a line or with a pixel. At this point we assume that all passengers move directly to subway trains. Specify &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; (the line representing the passenger flow exit) in the '''Target (point,line)''' field.
#Leave all properties of [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedSink.html PedSink] object by default. '''PedSink''' object disposes incoming pedestrians. It is usually used as an end point of the pedestrian flow.
#Leave all properties of [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedConfiguration.html PedConfiguration] object by default. This object represents a set of Pedestrian Library’s global parameters and allows tuning the model for a specific task in order to get maximum model performance.
